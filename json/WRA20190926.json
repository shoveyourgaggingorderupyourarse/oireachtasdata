Where an IREF makes an actual distribution or on the redemption of units in the IREF, non-resident investors will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%. Certain investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies, charities and credit unions are exempt from the withholding tax as this is the norm for such bodies across the tax acts.<\/p>  <p>  The Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) framework was introduced in 2013, to facilitate long-term, risk-diversified, collective investment in rental property. In order to be a REIT, a company must be listed on the main market of an EU stock exchange within three years of forming, and it must be widely held. Income and gains from Irish property are not taxed within the REIT but are instead taxed in the hands of the investor when distributed.<\/p>  <p>  Dividend withholding tax at 20% must be applied to all distributions from REITs, other than distributions to certain limited classes of investors such as pension funds\u00a0and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax.<\/p>  <p>  Given the important implications which developments in the property market can have for the economy, my Department actively monitors developments in this sector on an ongoing basis.

This plan sets out in detail the Government&rsquo;s analysis of the risks and impacts of a no deal outcome across the range of key issues and sectors and the extensive work ongoing across Government to mitigate these risks. This plan follows on the enactment of the Brexit Omnibus Act earlier this year and the roll-out of a comprehensive programme of engagement with stakeholders across all key sectors with over 1,200 events to date so that citizens and business take the necessary actions to prepare. This is in parallel with detailed contingency planning at EU level. However, as underlined in the Contingency Plan, notwithstanding Government preparations, a no deal Brexit will be highly disruptive for Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, my objective is to protect the economic and financial interests of the State and to support the work of the Revenue Commissioners so as to minimise the Brexit disruption to trade, to the greatest extent possible. \u00a0My Departments and its agencies are advancing preparations within the whole of Government framework overseen by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of An Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has already taken important steps to prepare our economy, including through dedicated measures announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019, supported by long-term planning through the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework which will provide significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 is being prepared on the basis of Government assessments of the implications of a possible no deal &ndash; not because we are resigned to this outcome but because it is the only prudent way to prepare. It is important to give certainty to businesses and citizens that the Government is prepared for a no-deal Brexit and stands ready to support the economy in such a scenario. For the most affected sectors, a number of temporary, targeted support measures are under consideration and both the level and type of support will be finalised as part of the Budget 2020 negotiation. Assuming a no-deal Brexit ensures the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of this exceptional challenge, whilst preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances. Finally, it is important to safeguard the hard won progress of recent years in stabilising the public finances. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the financial services sector, the Central Bank has been preparing extensively for Brexit. The Central Bank is satisfied that, from a financial stability perspective, the most material and immediate risks from a no-deal Brexit are manageable.\u00a0 Some level of market disruption would be inevitable in a no-deal scenario, but the system as a whole should be resilient enough to withstand these bumps.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners are also prioritising Brexit preparations and have been taking measures aimed at facilitating and supporting legitimate trade with UK post Brexit, in close cooperation with other Government agencies. These measures include a significant\u00a0upgrade of their national Customs ICT system to deal with increased volumes of customs declarations, the assignment and training of up to 600 additional staff for Brexit related roles across a range of functions and an ongoing extensive nationwide trader outreach programme. Additional physical capacity is also in place at ports and airports to apply checks and controls. Funding and training has also been provided to support the customs intermediary sector.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that my Department and its relevant agencies \u00a0are continuing to give the highest priority to the work of preparing for a no deal Brexit, including encouraging and supporting preparedness by business and citizens across the county\u00a0 so that we can mitigate the impacts to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600036#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600036#WRB01800"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[39093\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600036#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to take action or enact legislation that will bring rates of Irish banks into line with the European average rates for mortgages in view of the fact the current ECB interest rate for deposit facility is 0.5% and its marginal interest rate is 0.25%;

Indeed the reasons for this were explored in a report published by my department in March (Risk Weighted Assets in Ireland: The Link to Mortgage Interest Rates).<\/p>  <p>  This report shows that a large part of the difference between Irish mortgage rates and European mortgage rates is linked to how capital rules are applied.

The most recent data available show the average weekly wage grew by 3.5 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2019. \u00a0In the earlier stages of economic recovery, growth in weekly earnings was primarily as a result of growth in hours worked per week, but recent data have shown much stronger growth in average hourly pay.\u00a0 For instance, in 2018 average weekly earnings grew by 3.3 per cent, with average hourly earnings growing by 2.9 per cent.<\/p>  <p>  Below the headline figure, the data show variation across sectors of the economy.\u00a0 For example, recent quarters have seen strong growth in weekly earnings for workers in the &lsquo;administrative and support services&rsquo;, &lsquo;information and communication technology&rsquo; and &lsquo;transport and storage&rsquo; sectors.\u00a0 Over the last 12 months, both weekly and hourly earnings are growing across all economic sectors reported by the CSO, showing the broad-based strength of Ireland&rsquo;s current economic performance.<\/p>  <p>  The latest macroeconomic forecasts published by my Department as part of the Stability Programme Update in April this year projected continued growth in average wages of 3 per cent for 2019, with further wage growth expected in the medium-term. \u00a0This is consistent with the other labour market elements of the forecast, such as continued growth in employment and a further decline in the unemployment rate.\u00a0 This also indicates the existence of a &lsquo;Phillips curve&rsquo; in the Irish economy - with the labour market closing in on full employment and the supply of labour becoming scarce, wages are increasing in order to attract or retain employees. \u00a0A new set of labour market projections and commentary will be published with Budget 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I am fully alert to the possible risk of an overheating economy.\u00a0 Indeed the Government&rsquo;s Future Jobs Ireland strategy aims to maximise the supply of suitably skilled labour in our economy, boosting productivity and protecting our international competitiveness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600036#WRB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600036#WRB03900"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[38959\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600036#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the way in which the perceived unfairness of the inheritance tax system as outlined in correspondence from a person (details supplied) can be addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>I have received correspondence from the Deputy with regard to the treatment under Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) of couples who are married, cohabiting or in a civil partnership and the CAT\u00a0treatment of those who do not have children. The correspondence, which is an external legal opinion sought by the Deputy, suggests changes to the current CAT rules and treatment. <\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of Capital Acquisitions Tax, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance and the person who receives the gift or inheritance determines the lifetime tax-free threshold (the Group Threshold) below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise. As Capital Acquisitions Tax is generally payable by the beneficiary, rather than the disponer, the system promotes horizontal equity in that all individuals with similar circumstances are treated in a similar manner.<\/p>  <p>  It is a long-held principle of inheritance tax that transfers of assets between spouses are exempt. The spousal exemption from inheritance tax was extended to civil partners from 1 January 2011. Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of tax as a separate and unconnected individual. <\/p>  <p>  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership, which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. <\/p>  <p>  I would say that where two people - irrespective of their relationship - share a home owned by one of them, and where the homeowner dies leaving that home to the other person, they can avail of the CAT dwelling house exemption, once other conditions of the relief are met. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As regards the treatment of individuals with no children, gifts or inheritances from them are subject to either category B or C thresholds irrespective of their individual status.

Revenue has advised that this position is unchanged.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The flat rate expenses regime is\u00a0a concessionary practice operated by Revenue where both specific commonality of expenditure exists across an employment category and the statutory requirement for the tax deduction as set out in section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is satisfied.

In volume terms, NPLs in the domestic Irish banks have now fallen by &euro;70.2 billion (82%), from peak in 2013. A major contributor to this has been the almost 109,000 mortgage restructures that are currently in place. <\/p>  <p>  Despite this progress, more work is required before the NPL ratios at the Irish banks reach the European average of under 4%.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the protections in place for all borrowers before a sale remain unchanged. For example, Start Mortgages and Pepper, the firms involved in the loan sales transacted by PTSB since 2018, are both regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. When dealing with borrowers, these firms are required to comply with the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. Furthermore, assurances have been given that the terms of a restructure agreed before these sales took place will continue to be honoured.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in 2018 I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible. The result of this review was published last October and it is encouraging to note that the key findings included confirmation that for borrowers who engaged with the process, the CCMA is working effectively as it is intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to highlight that I cannot stop loan sales, even by the banks in which the State has a shareholding. These decisions are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks, which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Submissions","counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[39113\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he received a submission from as association (details supplied) in relation to the necessity of putting in place a pilot training programme in 2020 as the commencement of a modern and sustainable continuous professional programme for all private agricultural consultants and advisers here; if the matter will be given consideration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":140,"content":"<p>My department has so far received in excess of 250 Pre-Budget Submissions from a wide range of groups and individuals.

As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation of the sector.  This framework is mainly governed by the EU Solvency II Directive, which provides for three ways in which an insurance undertaking can operate within the Irish market.  <\/p>  <p>  These are to: <\/p>  <p>  - establish a head office in Ireland (authorised by Central Bank of Ireland);<\/p>  <p>  - establish a branch in Ireland through Freedom of Establishment (FOE); or<\/p>  <p>  - operate on a Freedom of Services basis (FOS), i.e. conduct business in Ireland from another country.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that there are companies operating in each of these channels in the Irish insurance market.  The Solvency II framework is designed to allow for a level playing field across the European Union for insurers, not only in terms of access to markets within the EU, but also with regard to the level of supervision and regulation.  Therefore, it plays an essential role in facilitating competition in the insurance sector across the EU. It also expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to comparing insurance costs across jurisdictions in Europe, Insurance Europe, the European (re)insurance federation, produces reports on an on-going basis regarding the insurance industry across Europe. For example, the European Insurance in Figures (2017 data) and the European Motor Insurance Markets, both published in early 2019, contain some useful comparative information in respect of insurance up to 2017. The European Insurance &mdash; Key Facts published in October 2018, graphs the average premium level across European countries for a variety of insurance products for the year 2017. The varying levels of premiums across Europe is accounted for by a wide range of regulatory, risk and economic factors which differ across European jurisdictions (as noted on p. 16 of the European Motor Insurance Markets).<\/p>  <p>  For example, other factors that may influence an insurance company&rsquo;s decision to operate or not in a particular country, could include the number of personal injury claims made, the level of awards granted, and the legal costs and time associated with settling\/defending claims in that country. In this regard, there has been some sectors of our economy such as the leisure, adventure and hospitality sectors where insurance cover has either become unavailable or prohibitively expensive.  Indeed, I understand that in recent meetings between Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, and a number of UK insurers\/underwriters in London who have recently left the Irish insurance market, the reasons above were mentioned as to why they had made this decision.  Therefore, for these parts of the market, there is undoubtedly an issue around its attractiveness and this consequently has impacted on competitiveness.  <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, in order to create a more competitive environment, the Government is focussing on implementing the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) including those of the second Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) Report which concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in England and Wales (4.4 times) and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council. The recently enacted Judicial Council Act 2019 provides for the establishment of this Council, which will allow for the recalibration, by the Judiciary, of award levels for personal injuries.  It is now a matter for the Judiciary to establish the Judicial Council and the subsequent Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations due to the constitutional separation of powers, it is my hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and will prioritise it accordingly by completing a first set of guidelines, which take account of the PIC&rsquo;s benchmarking report, as soon as possible.  At the same time, the Law Reform Commission (LRC) has begun a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages, which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the creation and implementation of the Personal Injuries guidelines by the Judiciary will result in the lowering of award levels.  As importantly, I believe it should lead to a greater consistency in award levels for injuries of the same type.  This therefore should mean that there will be less of an incentive for a person to litigate, as they should not be getting any more from a court award than a PIAB award, which in turn should have a significant impact on legal costs.  In summary, I believe that over time the clearest signal that these changes are working is when there is an increase in the number of PIAB cases being accepted by claimants particularly for minor and moderate injuries.

However it is also clear that there are dark clouds on the horizon, with the external environment continuing to deteriorate, and the risk of an adverse shock to the economy - for instance through a disorderly Brexit &ndash; rising all the time.<\/p>  <p>  The macroeconomic projections published at Stability Programme Update (SPU) 2019 were based on the assumption the UK will leave the EU with a deal and that a transition &lsquo;status quo&rsquo; period would be agreed that extends or replicates existing frameworks until end-2020. However, since the publication of SPU the possibility that the UK will leave the EU without a deal has increased substantially. To reflect this, for budgetary purposes, the Government has decided to base Budget 2020 on the assumption of a 'no-deal' Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  In order to quantify the effects of a disorderly Brexit, my Department and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) recently published an updated model-based assessment of the economic impacts. The report found that in aggregate terms compared to a scenario in which the UK did not leave the EU the level of GDP would be 3 per cent lower after 5 years. The impact is expected to be greatest in the first year which is primarily explained by higher trade costs with the UK reducing the level of overall trade and short run disruption due to uncertainty. <\/p>  <p>  Despite these impacts, the Irish economy is still expected to grow but at a slower pace as a consequence of Brexit. As part of Budget 2020 my Department will publish updated macroeconomic forecasts which will be based on the assumption that the UK leaves the EU without a deal.  <\/p>  <p>  Of course Brexit isn&rsquo;t the only risk faced by the economy. As a small open economy Ireland is particularly exposed to a slowdown in growth in key export markets, with a loss of momentum particularly evident in both the euro area and the UK in recent quarters.  <\/p>  <p>  The best way we can mitigate against these risks is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC04700"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[39246\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost of reducing to 0% the VAT applied to sport and leisure activities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

Unfortunately, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can compel any insurer to provide cover or to provide it at a particular price. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. Consequently, the Government cannot direct insurance companies to cover certain types of risk, such as that related to sports and leisure bodies.  A further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.  In summary, therefore there is unfortunately no quick fix solution to this matter.<\/p><p>That is not to say, that this issue remains a priority for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which was established in July 2016, and which produced two reports, is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of the Cost of Motor Insurance Report<i><\/i>and the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report.  Its most recent Progress Update, the Ninth, was published in July 2019 and shows that the vast majority of recommendations and actions due by Q2 2019 have been completed.  To that end, the key achievements to date from the two reports, including the following:<\/p><p>- The establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission and the publication of its two reports, which included a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time. This showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales;<\/p><p>- The enactment of the Judicial Council Act 2019, in July which provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  It is now a matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to operationalise the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which will introduce new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly;<\/p><p>- The commencement and prioritisation by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;<\/p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The Bank is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will also make recommendations to me regarding potentially expanding its scope to include employer and public liability insurance;<\/p><p>- Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;<\/p><p>- Commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p><p>- Various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality.<\/p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, particularly those relevant to sports and leisure bodies.<\/p><p>I believe it is important to emphasise that the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions, and the establishment of the Judicial Council in the coming months is very important in this regard.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputies that important reforms are taking place and that I am confident that if the level of awards are reduced as a results of the operationalisation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, then the issues that are being experienced by sports and leisure bodies should recede.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carbon Tax Yield","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC05300"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[39251\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount collected to date in carbon tax; the methods of dispersing the revenue generated from the tax; the purposes for which the revenue collected from the tax has been used for the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":176,"content":"<p>The total annual net receipts from carbon tax are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Total   Net Receipts<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>&euro;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>223,084,537<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>298,231,058<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>353,954,210<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>388,376,990<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>385,361,885<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>418,996,237<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>430,247,558<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>419,603,362<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>431,131,923<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>3,348,987,760<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Carbon tax receipts to end August 2019 were approximately &euro;281,800,000, some &euro;20 million (6.8%) behind forecast.<\/p><p>To date the revenue from carbon tax has been remitted to the central fund and therefore used to fund public services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corporation Tax Regime","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC05600"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[39260\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the expected tax yield from expanding transfer pricing rules to the SME sector; the number of Irish SMEs that could potentially be impacted by this move; the number of employees working for these SMEs; if the data is available; the reason put forward as to the reason the rules should be extended to SMEs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":179,"content":"<p>Ireland's Corporation Tax Roadmap includes a commitment to amend Ireland's transfer pricing regime in Finance Bill 2019.  This commitment stems from recommendations made in the Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Code by Mr Seamus Coffey.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the recommendations in that Review is that consideration be given to extending transfer pricing rules to SMEs, having regard to whether the associated burden of keeping transfer pricing documentation would be proportional to the risks of transfer mispricing occurring.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the process of updating Ireland's transfer pricing rules, my Department recently published Ireland&rsquo;s Transfer Pricing Rules Feedback Statement to enable consultation with stakeholders on the approach I propose to take to meeting the commitments made in this area. <\/p>  <p>  Being mindful of not imposing an undue administrative burden on SMEs, the Feedback Statement signals a proposed approach towards how transfer pricing rules could be applied to SMEs.  That approach proposes that smaller enterprises will not be required to provide any transfer pricing documentation and that medium enterprises will only be required to provide simplified transfer pricing documentation in respect of very material cross border transactions with associated persons.  I believe that this would strike an appropriate balance between the risk of mispricing and the compliance burden imposed. <\/p>  <p>  Application of transfer pricing rules to SMEs, but with relaxed documentation requirements, is consistent with the approach adopted in many other OECD countries.  Also, of note, where the associated person who is the other party to the transaction is located in a country which has transfer pricing rules, it is likely that there is already a requirement for the group to prepare transfer pricing documentation in relation to the transaction in that other country.  Therefore, providing transfer pricing documentation in Ireland may not be a significant burden for many medium enterprises. <\/p>  <p>  The Feedback Statement also proposes that the provisions for SMEs would not be commenced at the same time as the rest of the transfer pricing provisions.  The rationale behind this approach is to ensure that SMEs do not face any additional compliance burden next year given other uncertainties faced by business at this time. This will have the added benefit of providing a window to allow SMEs to fully consider and understand how the application of transfer pricing rules could impact them and prepare for that eventuality.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it is unable to provide exact figures for the number of Irish SMEs that could be impacted by transfer pricing rules.  However, Revenue estimate that approximately 1,500 companies from over 50 groups could be brought within the scope of the new rules when they eventually come into effect for SMEs.  Revenue advise that it does not have estimated figures available for the number of employees working for SMEs that could potentially come within the scope of transfer pricing rules.  Given that it is not intended to commence the extension of transfer pricing rules to SMEs in 2020, there are no immediate impacts on the tax yield as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Data","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC05900"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[39261\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600037#WRC06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of mortgage switches undertaken each year since 2003 and the associated value of those mortgage switches in tabular form; the work completed by his Department to make mortgage switching easier for the customer; the tangible measures being taken in that regard; the physical signatures that are required when it comes to mortgage switching under section 10 of the Electronic Commerce Act 2000; if he has reviewed this Act with a view to making mortgage switching easier for the customer by making electronic signatures available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>Data provided by the Central Bank indicates that mortgage switching (defined, for the purposes of this response, as loans issued by one lender to refinance an existing mortgage with another lender) in Ireland peaked in 2006, when approximately 27,000 mortgages switched provider. <\/p><p>Between 2009 and 2014, switching decreased significantly, reflecting subdued lending activity in the overall Irish market at that time.

The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.

This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers.

It is a significant investment by this Government in research, development and innovation in Ireland with an allocation of &euro;500 million in the period to 2027. Call 1 of the DTIF opened on 29 June 2018 and 27 successful projects were announced on 10 December 2018. In total, over &euro;75 million of Government funding was committed to 104 separate organisations within these 27 collaborative projects over a three-year period. From the start, my Department has indicated that &euro;20 million would be made available in 2019 to commence the first tranche of projects. That funding is currently being drawn down and it is expected that it will be allocated in full against profile by the end of the year. For the most part, enterprise partners in DTIF collaborations will draw down funding retrospectively following the submission of validated claims for vouched expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  As regards certain commercial activity not being funded, my Department officials engaged in extensive dialogue with our agencies in advance of defining the eligibility criteria for Call 1 of the DTIF to ensure compliance with the provisions of the General Block Exemption Regulation scheme for R&amp;D funding and to the national legislation under which funding is provided. When DTIF Call 1 opened in June 2018, those rules were included in the call documentation published on my Department's website. For Call 1, project bids that focused on \"industrial research\" were sought in order to provide clarity to applicants and to provide the optimal rate of State support across the board to all eligible companies (i.e. 50% matched funding). All successful projects were awarded funding subject to contract negotiations and complying with these State Aid rules. Whilst some commercialisation costs were allowed, not all were allowable due to these rules.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) is administering DTIF Call 1 on my behalf and, given the unique nature of the Fund, it needed to develop new consortia agreements to facilitate payments to constituent organisations. EI has engaged in intensive contract negotiations with participants in each project, checking that costs submitted were eligible under these State Aid rules and also justifiable for the work packages involved.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the pre-financing of certain project costs, the DTIF Call 1 guidance document had indicated that pre-finance of up to one-third, subject to certain criteria, could be made available to small companies only, in line with the legislation governing the enterprise agencies of my Department. EI established a new process for assessing pre-finance applications for the DTIF. This process is now in place and payments to the SMEs approved for pre-finance are being processed once the formal legal documentation is signed off and returned to EI.  <\/p>  <p>  Collaborations of the scale and nature funded through the DTIF are a first for Ireland. Due to the unique nature of the Fund and the complexities involved, it has taken longer than anticipated to put the necessary arrangements in place and to conclude contract negotiations with all 104 organisations. <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this is causing difficulties for a number of organisations involved but I am very pleased to see the overwhelming support for this new Fund from small and large companies and from across the research system.  We have taken the opportunity in Call 2 to refine our rules and procedures based on learnings from Call 1 and I am confident that the DTIF will continue to be welcomed as a key instrument for Ireland in helping to embrace and prepare for the new wave of technologies that will underpin our economic development into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600039#WRE06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Preparations","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600040#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[39255\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600040#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the reason she did not write to the 222,000 companies to prepare for Brexit earlier in 2019.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>As the Brexit deadline of 31 October 2019 draws nearer, I am very conscious of the urgent need for businesses to take action to prepare and plan for Brexit, despite continuing political uncertainty.

Companies typically file their annual returns from the start of October over a 4 week period. My initiative was designed in order to get maximum impact with companies visiting the CRO website during that key filing period.<\/p>  <p>  This latest initiative through the CRO was just one of the many channels and campaigns that my Department has been engaged in to communicate with businesses to get out the key messages in terms of steps they need to take to prepare for Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the enterprise and regulatory agencies under my Department have been working closely with businesses for months through their own engagement campaigns and client clinics.

My priority is to ensure our current and future business environment becomes more straightforward, while providing sufficient resources to aid these businesses to develop the tools they need to succeed, grow and create sustainable employment.  <\/p>  <p>  To determine the current climate of our enterprise ecosystem, I commissioned the OECD to conduct a Country Review of SME and Entrepreneurship Policies in Ireland in March 2018. The timescale for this review was 18 months and the final Report will be launched in Dublin by myself and the OECD Deputy Secretary General on the 23rd of October.  The outcome of the review aims to provide tailored analysis and recommendations to Government on how to improve the design and implementation of national SME and entrepreneurship policies and programmes, based on an assessment of the country&rsquo;s current SME and entrepreneurship performance, framework conditions and policies, and informed by international comparisons.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has played a central role supporting and facilitating the OECD during this intensive process. My officials have organised stakeholder events throughout the process to-date in order to facilitate detailed engagement between DBEI, other Government Departments, agencies, academia, business representatives and the small business sector. This engagement has enabled the OECD to gain insightful knowledge of our SME and entrepreneurship ecosystem at the various critical stages of building this report.<\/p>  <p>  The OECD review has comprehensively examined all aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s SME and Entrepreneurship ecosystem. The Report and the accompanying Strategy Roadmap will assist my Department in developing a national SME Strategy which will be aligned within the overall Future Jobs Framework. <\/p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the impact regulatory burdens and compliance costs can have on small businesses. Research indicates that where a large company may spend one euro per employee to comply with a regulatory duty, a medium-sized enterprise might have to spend around four euros and a small business up to ten euros. That is why my Department is leading on the development, roll out and implementation of the SME Test.<\/p>  <p>  The main thrust of the SME Test is to assess the potential for less stringent requirements for smaller companies and the simplification of regulatory adherence, for example through the use of templates, reduced thresholds for SMEs and use of plain English in forms.<\/p>  <p>  My Department sought best practice through other EU Member States regarding the development of the SME Test and a guidance approach was taken. In 2017, consultation took place with the Advisory Group on Small Business, which my colleague Minister of State Pat Breen TD chaired, and a public consultation followed thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that the application and use of the SME Test across Government is now a deliverable action in the Future Jobs 2019 work programme. The adoption of the Test is included under action 2.3 which states:<\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;Raise awareness and promote the SME Test throughout Government Departments. Workshops will be available for policymakers&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  In July 2019, my colleague Minister Breen wrote to each Government Department in his role as Minister of State for Business requesting that policymakers and those responsible for drafting relevant legislation in each Department utilise the Test. The nomination of a relevant official in each Department has also been sought so that my Department can engage and assist with the adoption of the SME Test in practice.  <\/p>  <p>  As a country, we want our Irish SMEs continue to grow and prosper and to become more innovative. Accessing finance is an integral part for the growth of any business. That is why my Department oversees EU sponsored programmes providing our diverse range of SME businesses with alternative financial solutions to those already available in the current market.  <\/p>  <p>  Microfinance Ireland provides loans between &euro;2,000 and &euro;25,000 to start-ups and existing micro enterprises who may be experiencing difficulty in accessing credit from other commercial lenders. The Brexit Loan Scheme is a &euro;300 million loan fund available to eligible Irish businesses impacted by Brexit with loans available between &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5 million and unsecured loans up to &euro;500,000. The &euro;40 million European Angel Fund is a joint initiative with the European Investment Fund designed to enhance the capacity of Business Angels to provide equity financing for innovative companies in the form of co-investments. <\/p>  <p>  SMEs who participate in the public procurement process will be very aware of the financial and promotional opportunities that come with successfully winning all or part of a Government tender.  Officials in my Department and that of the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) work together throughout the year to ensure a strong focus is maintained on promoting awareness amongst the SME sector. This commitment is reinforced by way of my Department participating on the OGP&rsquo;s SME Procurement Advisory Group and their reciprocal participation in the DBEI chaired Interdepartmental SME Communication Group, which oversees the promotion of the www.supportingsmes.gov.ie website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600040#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Development Plan Data","counter":310,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600040#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":311,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[39257\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600040#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the projects mentioned in the National Development Plan 2018-2027 that come under her remit or bodies under her aegis by county in tabular form; the start dates and estimated completion dates for each project; the capital funds allocated to date for each project; the estimated total cost for each project over the 2018-27 period; and the amount expended to date for each such project.","asker":"1250","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":312,"content":"<p>The Capital funding provided to my Department is mainly focussed on grants to support our multi-annual enterprise development and innovation programmes, rather than specific projects.<\/p><p>The Priority Investments under the National Strategic Objective in the National Development Plan (NDP) of a &ldquo;Strong Economy supported by Enterprise, Innovation and Skills&rdquo;, for which my Department has primary responsibility, in the main build upon the Department&rsquo;s multi annual capital programmes.

Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and is provided free of charge to girls in secondary school.<\/p>  <p>   During the 2019\/20 school year, girls who previously declined the HPV vaccine and are still attending secondary school can join the HPV girls only programme.  By contacting your local HSE Health Office appointments will be offered to girls to receive the HPV vaccine in HSE mop up clinics.  However, it must be noted that vaccinated girls may still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600040#WRF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Oireachtas Joint Committee Recommendations","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600040#WRF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[39115\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600040#WRF02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress to date in implementing the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, namely, the provision of exclusion zones and the availability of free contraception; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1315","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware exclusion zones were not part of the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, however, it is my intention that people can access termination of pregnancy services safely.

The Scoping Inquiry was led by Dr Gabriel Scally, under Terms of Reference which are published on the website of my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Scoping Inquiry produced a First, Final and Supplementary Report. In total these reports set out 58 recommendations for improvements in our screening programmes and wider health services. These reports are available on my Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  The Final Report of the Scoping Inquiry, published in September 2018, is unequivocal in stating that the widespread non-disclosure of the results of historical screening audits was a substantial breach of trust for the women and families concerned. It caused significant distress and additional suffering to those affected. However, Dr Scally is clear that the Inquiry is satisfied with the quality management processes in the labs contracted by CervicalCheck. His reports present no evidence that the rates of discordant smear reporting or the performance of the programme fell below what is expected in a cervical screening programme. Crucially, he confirmed that he found no reason why the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV regime is introduced. This provided welcome reassurance for women in Ireland, given the importance of screening for women&rsquo;s health.<\/p>  <p>  The Supplementary Report, published on 11 June 2019, addressed issues relating, broadly, to laboratories used for CervicalCheck screening, including the use of additional sites, laboratory accreditation schemes, and procurement and contracting of laboratory services by CervicalCheck. The Report identified issues in regard to contractual compliance, in particular the use of additional sites for screening of CervicalCheck sites without CervicalCheck&rsquo;s knowledge; procurement, including a reduced focus on quality in procurement; and contracting. However, the Supplementary Report stated that, on the basis of the information available to the Inquiry, the use of additional laboratories did not in fact result in a reduction in the quality of the screening provided to Irish women and there is no evidence to suggest deficiencies in screening quality in any laboratory.<\/p>  <p>  Dr Scally confirmed to me in July this year that the work of the Scoping Inquiry is concluded. Government has accepted all 58 of the recommendations that were set out in Dr Scally&rsquo;s three reports into CervicalCheck. An implementation plan was approved by Government in December 2018 and work is ongoing in my Department, the HSE and the National Cancer Registry of Ireland on the range of actions within the Plan. <\/p>  <p>  Dr Scally carried out a review of the implementation plan earlier this year, at my request, and he affirmed that the Implementation Plan is a comprehensive response to his report. He was clear that significant effort and resources are being committed to addressing the problems he identified and has acknowledged that substantial and important progress has been made to date in implementation of his recommendations. Quarterly reports against implementation are published on the website of my Department. <\/p>  <p>  I have requested Dr Scally to undertake a further review of implementation of his recommendations, and this work is ongoing. Dr Scally has stated that he is confident that the recommendations which he has made are already facilitating the development of a cervical screening service that, in international terms, will be outstanding.<\/p>  <p>  Also currently underway, following the Government decision in May 2018, is an Independent Clinical Expert Panel Review of cervical screening. This is being carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), and will provide women with independent assurance about the timing of their diagnosis and treatment. Every woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer since September 2008, whose cancer was registered with the National Cancer Registry of Ireland before 5 May 2018, and who had one or more tests under the CervicalCheck programme, was offered a review of her case.<\/p>  <p>  As noted in a guidance document produced by Public Health England, \"no matter how closely a review tries to reproduce the original screening conditions, the conditions of a review are different\", and hence it is normally expected that any review such as this will have review results which disagree with their original review result (discordance). This is in line with international experience. For planning purposes, the HSE is estimating that up to 40% of participants may be identified by the RCOG Panel as having discordance.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this month the HSE sent a letter to all participants in the review to provide an update about the process, and to advise participants of when they may expect to receive their individual reports. This letter also provided women with options about how they may choose to receive their report. The feedback from participants has been positive, both in relation to the information pack and the options for receiving results. Women have started to receive their results and it is expected that the process will take a number of months to complete.<\/p>  <p>  The Royal College will also prepare an aggregate report for the Minister, which will include recommendations, where appropriate, on improving care for women. The Royal College wrote to the Minister on the 6th of September last advising that, based on the provisional findings of its Review, the performance characteristics of the CervicalCheck Screening Programme that fall within the scope of the Review appear to be broadly in line with the experience in the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600040#WRF03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[39133\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600040#WRF03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current wait time for women awaiting smear test results; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":342,"content":"<p>Significant progress has been made in clearing the backlog of smear tests and reducing turnaround times.

The NHSS budget for 2019 is &euro;985.8m which is an increase of &euro;24.3m over its 2018 budget.<\/p>  <p>   Over the last two years, an additional &euro;45 million has been provided to NHSS budget for the continued provision of services in line with pricing and demand.

The latest available performance reports indicate that there are 23,236 people supported in the Scheme at the end of July this year. This is significantly more people than forecast and this creates a challenge. The HSE has also advised that the cost of care continues to rise and the average weekly cost per bed is higher in 2019 than anticipated.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the available budget and the demand for support, the HSE releases funding in a managed way to ensure that the operation of the NHSS remains within the budgetary allocation. The HSE cannot legally fund clients beyond the determined funding allocation, and the appropriate mechanism relating to funding allocations is through the estimates and budgetary process. To manage the available funds throughout the year, a national placement list for the release of funding is operated by the HSE, to enable it to operate within budget. Funding issues to applicants in chronological order, to ensure equity nationally. Approved applicants are placed on the national placement list in order of their approval date and funding is released to applicants in order of their place on this list. The length of time spent on the placement list depends on the number of applicants currently receiving financial support and the number of new applications. Where demand is higher, the time spent on the waiting list may increase having regard for the prudent management of the Scheme's budget. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has put in place arrangements that a monthly analysis of performance of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme continues to ensure that the maximum number of new entrants are approved with the shortest possible waiting times while remaining on track to deliver a balanced budgetary position by year end.

On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme, which offers HPV vaccination to all girls in their first year of second level education (generally 12 to 13 year olds), to a programme that also offers the vaccination to boys in their first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys starting in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for several reasons:<\/p>  <p>  - Vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;<\/p>  <p>  - Boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases.  As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.  Therefore, the gender neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.  All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.    <\/p>  <p>  Extending the HPV vaccine to boys will also provide direct protection to boys against HPV-related disease.  It also provides indirect herd protection to girls who have not been vaccinated.  Another important factor includes the additional protection provided by a gender neutral programme to vulnerable groups (for example, men who have sex with men) and the potential to improve the resilience of the immunisation programme to fluctuations in vaccine uptake and to the movement of individuals into and out of the country.<\/p>  <p>  For older children who did not receive the vaccine as part of the School Immunisation Programme the HPV vaccine can only be obtained privately from a GP.  If your child is 15 years of age or older they will require three doses of the HPV vaccine in order to be fully protected.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered free of charge by their GP.  However, the cost of purchasing the vaccine privately is not covered by the medical card.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600041#WRG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600041#WRG03200"},{"type":"question","counter":396,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[39201\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600041#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the recruitment process has commenced for a new general practitioner for Cappoquin Health Centre, County Waterford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":397,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for it to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600041#WRG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Funding","counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600041#WRG03500"},{"type":"question","counter":399,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[39203\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600041#WRG03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when mental health development funding for 2019 was released to the HSE; the breakdown on the allocation of this funding within the HSE; if part of this funding has been allocated to areas outside of mental health; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":400,"content":"<p>Budget 2019 made allowance for an additional &euro;55 million for Mental Health Services to build on existing services.

As such, they are recognised as valuable landscape features under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and thus are eligible for BPS payments. It is also recognised that such features must be appropriately managed and maintained by appropriate trimming to keep them in optimum condition, both as field boundary features and to help maintain the optimum structure and thickness to encourage bird nesting etc., and best practice prevails where this is done as part of an appropriate cutting rotation. <\/p>  <p>  Their importance is further recognised through the inclusion of a number of hedgerow-specific actions within the GLAS (Agri-environment Scheme under pillar II).

There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since autumn 2018, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.<\/p>  <p>  The Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM), which recently closed for applications, will provide temporary exceptional adjustment aid to farmers in the beef sector in Ireland subject to the conditions set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019\/1132. BEAM is funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support, provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of the market volatility and uncertainty.  Over 34,500 farmers had applied for BEAM at its closing date of 20 September, representing potential commitments of almost &euro;78 million.<\/p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current RDP period. <\/p>  <p>  This year, I introduced the exchequer-funded Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a &euro;20 million scheme which will provide suckler farmers with valuable data on the weaning efficiency of their animals.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for beef farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Sheep and suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.<\/p>  <p>  In recognising the major challenges faced by the farming sector and the important role that various schemes operated by my Department play in underpinning the viability of many farms, last month I secured agreement from the European Commission that will allow for a higher rate of advance payments under the 2019 Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and a number of Rural Development Schemes. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, I have secured a funding increase to the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme which brings the total budget this year to &euro;250m.  On foot of changes to EU Regulations, payments under the ANC Scheme will be made in two instalments this year.  The initial instalment of 85% worth &euro;168.5m was paid to almost 79,000 farmers last week, with the balancing payments of 15% commencing in early December.  These supports provide a major injection of funds to the suckler and sheep sector at an important time.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the sheep sector, I introduced the Sheep Welfare Scheme in December 2016 in order to provide support for sheep farmers in improving welfare standards in the national sheep flock.  Participating farmers are paid &euro;10 per eligible ewe, and some &euro;36m issued to farmers in respect of the first two years of the Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to supports which are available for sheep farmers under the Rural Development Programme, including GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups, sheep farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.  <\/p>  <p>  I have also made available financial support to sheep farmers for compliance with new sheep EID rules of &euro;100 per farmer and I would like to remind farmers that the closing date for the Sheep EID Tag Subsidy Scheme is 30 September 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is a constant and central component of the strategic development of the industry, as evidenced by its placement at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development. Food Wise 2025 prioritises the potential for growth in new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. <\/p>  <p>  Following my visit to Japan in June, the Japanese market was opened for Irish sheepmeat and the Deputy will be aware of the recent audit visit by Chinese officials to a number of sheep slaughtering plants as part of the on-going efforts to secure access to the Chinese market for Irish sheepmeat. <\/p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to farmers, together with ensuring market access to as many markets as possible, are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector.  <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that beef and sheep farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600041#WRG05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600041#WRG05800"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[39236\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600041#WRG05900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if refusal to award partnership status and benefits under the TAMS and DES schemes to a person (details supplied) will be reviewed with a view to reappraisal and approval in view of the extent to which the proposal has been strengthened; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>The person named made an application under the Dairy Equipment Scheme 05 July 2019 and this application has now been transfered to the Registered Farm Partnership following set up with the Department's Registered Farm Partnership Section.  <\/p><p>TAMS II is a demand-led scheme and, due to the high increase in application numbers, the ranking and selection system is being applied with a cut off mark of 39.57 in Tranche 14 for Dairy Equipment.

The latest registers compiled by the NTFSO deal with 2018 and are available at  <\/p><p>The Waste Shipment Regulation, Regulation (EC) No. 1013\/2006, on transfrontier shipments of waste, sets out the procedures to be followed when moving waste within, into and out of the EU. The Waste Shipment Regulation already includes those procedures to be followed when sending materials to &ldquo;third countries&rdquo;. Under current UK policy, waste is not permitted to travel between the EU and the UK for disposal and this will continue to be the case after Brexit. This is further enhanced by the provisions of the Waste Shipment Regulation which states &lsquo;all exports of waste from the Community destined for disposal shall be prohibited&rsquo;. Any waste travelling to or from Ireland to the UK for recycling or recovery will not be affected. In practical terms, there will be no change to current procedures or the paperwork used to organise shipments of waste so additional costs do not arise in this context.<\/p><p>Under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, which the UK will remain party to post Brexit, international shipments of waste are controlled through a process of prior written consent. This allows countries exporting waste to verify that the authorities in destination countries are content to accept the proposed shipment and that the waste can be managed in an environmentally sound manner at its final destination. The OECD decision, which again the UK will remain party to post Brexit, provides the control framework for the transboundary movement of waste between OECD countries for energy recovery and recycling.

An efficient and low emitting public transport system is a key priority in helping the transport sector contribute towards meeting our climate change goals. As part of a comprehensive programme of work to &lsquo;green&rsquo; our transport system, investment in public and sustainable transport to support modal shift and accommodate growing travel demand has been substantially increased in recent years.<\/p><p>In Project Ireland 2040, &euro;8.6billion has been indicatively allocated over the period 2018 to 2027 towards the delivery of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system. Improving public transport services and infrastructure is central to providing an alternative to private car travel, not only to reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions, but also to enable the sector to cater for the increasing demands associated with growing population and employment in a greener and more environmentally sustainable way.<\/p><p>This funding will be provided for major programmes and projects, including MetroLink, the DART Expansion programme and BusConnects, with continued investment in bus fleet expansion, Local Link services, maintenance and renewal of heavy rail, as well as the multi-annual urban cycling and walking infrastructure investment of over &euro;110 million underway for our main cities. <\/p><p>Within the umbrella figure of &euro;8.6 billion, it is estimated that <i>c<\/i>. &euro;2 billion will be spent on the delivery of the Dublin BusConnects programme, with a further <i>c<\/i>. &euro;200 million respectively to be spent to deliver Cork and Galway BusConnects. This programme is expected to have a transformative effect on the operation of public bus services, enabling more people to travel by public and sustainable transport than ever before.<\/p><p>My strong commitment to transition our public transport fleet away from fossil fuels towards cleaner technologies was recently reaffirmed in the all-of-Government Climate Action Plan<i>. <\/i>The first one hundred low-emission buses will enter the urban bus fleet by the end of 2020. By 2023, under the BusConnects Programme, approximately half of the public urban bus fleet in the Greater Dublin Area will be low-emitting, with full conversion by 2030.<\/p><p>A similar comprehensive programme of work is underway to move the commuter rail fleet to low-emitting alternatives. We plan to electrify key heavily-used elements of the rail network by creating a full metropolitan area DART network for the Greater Dublin Area, which is the part of the national rail network that carries over 75% of total rail passengers each year. It will mean high-frequency electrified rail services to Drogheda, Celbridge\/Hazelhatch, Maynooth and M3 Parkway, as well as new interchange stations with bus, LUAS and Metro networks. The NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are undertaking a procurement process for the establishment of a 10-year framework agreement for the purchase of the additional lower-emitting rail fleet required for this expansion of the DART network. <\/p><p>Our movement to low-emission alternatives for public transport will be important in helping to promote and normalise the use of alternative fuels and technologies in the transport sector.  The measures will mitigate the carbon footprint of the public transport fleet, which currently accounts for less than 5% of Ireland's annual transport sector emissions (or roughly 1% of our overall emissions).  By maintaining a focus on expanding the carrying capacity of our public transport over the coming years, we can help address the largest sustainability challenge in the transport sector - which is shifting more journeys from private motoring towards suitable alternatives in public transport and active travel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600042#WRH05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":469,"content":"<p>Question No. 174 answered with Question No. 172.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licence Renewals","counter":470,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600042#WRH05300"},{"type":"question","counter":471,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[39183\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600042#WRH05400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if the requirement for driver licences to be renewed only in their last three months of validity is required by law; and if so, if the rule will be changed in view of the imposition on those who wish to renew their licences in anticipation of working abroad temporarily.","asker":"1242","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":472,"content":"<p>The requirement for driver licences to be renewed in their past three months of validity is set out in regulation 12(3) of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 2006 (S.I. number 537 of 2006) as amended.

This measure refined the development introduced in 2017 and increased the eligibility of each registered child on ECCE from an average of 61 weeks, to a potential 76 weeks (two programme years). This delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.<\/p><p>The minimum age was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice. It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early years care and education in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios. The upper age limit remains the same (i.e. a child is not eligible if they will be 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year).<\/p><p>In order for a child to be eligible to be enrolled for free pre-school in September 2020 they must have been born between 1 January 2017 - 31 December 2017, i.e. they must have reached 2 years and 8 months on or before 31 August 2018.<\/p><p>In the example cited by the Deputy, the child will not be able to commence their ECCE in September 2020 as they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st August 2020. However, they will be able to commence ECCE in September 2021, and continue for a further year from September 2022, commencing school in September 2023.<\/p><p>Some parents\/guardians may prefer for their child to start school at age 4 rather than 5. These parents\/guardians may therefore opt for 1 year of ECCE only. This decision is entirely at the discretion of the parent\/s or guardians but it is important to reiterate that two full years of ECCE provision is available to all children.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the National Childcare Scheme will launch on 29th October 2019 and income-assessed subsidies will be available to families with children aged between 24 months and 15 years. This is a means-tested subsidy and is calculated based on a family's circumstances. The rate will vary depending on the level of family income, the child&rsquo;s age and educational stage, and the number of children in the family.

I secured &euro;8.86m in capital funding for childcare in 2019 with the ultimate aim of benefiting parents and children through improving our childcare infrastructure and capacity. A particular focus is on expanding service provision for children under three years of age.  <\/p><p>Under the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan published in 2018, I ensured that Childcare was identified as one of our nation's strategic priorities. I am delighted that &euro;250 million in additional funding has been committed for the expansion of high quality, early learning and care and school age childcare over the duration of the Plan.<\/p><p>Finally, the draft Childminding Action Plan published recently, and currently out for consultation,  sets out Government's draft proposal to further improve access  to high quality and affordable childcare through childminders.

As of end of August 2019, there were 82,233 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance and 2,967 beneficiaries of Carer's Benefit.  The projected combined expenditure on Carer's Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit in 2019 is approximately &euro;878 million.  <\/p>  <p>  A primary qualifying condition for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit payments is that the applicant provides full-time care and attention to a person in need of such care.  However, in order to support a carer&rsquo;s continued attachment to the workforce and broader social inclusion, carers may engage in some limited employment, education or training, while still being regarded as being in a position to provide full-time care.  During this time of employment, education or training, adequate provision must be made for the care of the relevant person. Both the full-time care and attention requirement and the 15-hour limitation are contained in the respective legislative provisions of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant schemes. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2006, the number of hours per week that carers could engage in employment, education or training outside the home was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.  <\/p>  <p>  The only social welfare scheme with a criteria of 19 hours is the Working Family Payment (WFP).  A threshold of 19 hours (or 38 hours per fortnight) is applied as a minimum for the Working Family Payment.  It should be noted that, for WFP purposes, any combination of hours that reaches 38 hours each fortnight is acceptable. A person can combine their weekly hours with their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant's hours to meet the condition.  Therefore a carer&rsquo;s working hours can be taken into account for WFP purposes.  <\/p>  <p>  In assessing weekly family income for Working Family Payment (WFP) purposes, most weekly social welfare payments are assessed.  Budget 2012 contained a measure which provided for the assessment of Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payments in determining entitlement to WFP. This measure brought the treatment of these two payments for WFP purposes into line with the treatment of all other primary social welfare payments.  It also provided for a more consistent approach to the concurrent payment of WFP with other social welfare payments. Moreover, while this measure reduced a person&rsquo;s secondary payment (WFP) it did so without affecting their primary payment, in this case Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, therefore targeting available resources at those in most need.<\/p>  <p>  Any further changes to this condition would need to be considered in a budgetary context and would also need to maintain a reasonable balance between the requirement to provide full-time care for the care recipient and the needs of the carer.<\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600043#WRJ04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","counter":521,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600043#WRJ04900"},{"type":"question","counter":522,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[39156\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600043#WRJ05000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an appeal by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":523,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 16 September 2019.

Initial regulations in relation to schemes of priorities were made subsequently and further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters.<\/p><p>In order to support the delivery of discounted homes to buy or rent, this Government has committed &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund, from 2019 to 2021, to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of some 6,200 homes.  To date, funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 13 local authority areas, has been allocated for infrastructure works on sites that will support the delivery of almost 3,200 homes. <\/p><p>The overall cost and the timing of delivery for these projects is contingent upon the completion of design, planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>In addition to making discounted homes available for purchase, the Government is also committed to the development of a new &lsquo;Cost Rental&rsquo; sector in Ireland. Under the Cost Rental model, rents cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only, less both the profit margin seen in the private rental sector and any financial supports provided by the State\/local authorities.  With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, this would mean that many households on moderate incomes will have access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case.<\/p><p>The rents for Cost Rental units will obviously depend upon the overall cost of each development and will vary according to the site and design specifics. However, my Department has identified several factors that can put downward pressure on costs and make Cost Rental more affordable for tenants &ndash; these include low\/zero land costs; a design approach with value engineering and long-term maintenance in mind; and capital subvention to individual developments through the Serviced Sites Fund.<\/p><p>More competitive rental levels under the model can also be supported by accessing low-cost, stable finance that is paid back over an extended period of time. This long-term financing has, for example, been accessed via the European Investment Bank (EIB). <\/p><p>A pilot Cost rental project is currently on site in Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, Co. Dublin. It involves a collaboration between the Department, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the Housing Agency, Approved Housing Bodies, Respond and T&uacute;ath, and the Housing Finance Agency.<\/p><p>I officially launched the Enniskerry Road development earlier this month.  It comprises of 155 homes, a community facility, along with green spaces and car parking (including underground car parking).  The 155 homes include 50 cost rental units, all of which will be 2-bedroom apartments. It is anticipated that at &euro;1,200, rents for these units will be significantly below the market rates for the area.<\/p><p>While the cost rental element of this project is relatively small in scale (50 units), it will act as the first example of how this model can work in an Irish context, and will provide us with invaluable lessons when designing a larger-scale system. It will help to shape the contractual model and specifications for future larger-scale projects.<\/p><p>The second Cost Rental pilot project will be delivered on a Dublin City Council-owned site at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, Emmet Road, Inchicore.  It is estimated that this site can accommodate over 470 homes in a high quality mixed tenure development. The current tenure mix as agreed with the Department will be 70% Cost Rental and 30% Social. <\/p><p>These new schemes are set in the context of significant moderation in the growth in house prices and complement other key Government affordability initiatives.  Included among these are the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, under which over 1,000 loans had been drawn down by end June this year, and the Help to Buy Scheme, under which some 14,000 applications have been approved.  In addition, the Land Development Agency's  initial portfolio of sites will have the potential to deliver 3,000 affordable homes and the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund ( LIHAF) will support more than 2,300 affordable homes on mainly publicly owned lands, while 5,600 further homes will benefit from a LIHAF-related cost reduction, some of which have already come on stream.

This may result in a lowering in the demand for housing. However, it is also possible that Brexit may impact net migration to Ireland in the short-term, particularly if a slow-down in the UK economy diverts a proportion of UK based-enterprises and employees as well as EU migrants who might otherwise have migrated to the UK, to Ireland. <\/p><p>Short-term phenomena, both immediately prior to and after a UK withdrawal from the EU, must be distinguished from the likely long-term picture.  The National Planning Framework is based on long-term, mid-range demographic and econometric projections over the period to 2040.  If a significant trend becomes apparent that is likely to continue in the long-run, national strategy would need to be reviewed accordingly.  In the meantime, the Rebuilding Ireland housing delivery target of 25,000 homes per annum by 2020 will be met, with the National Planning Framework, published in 2018, identifying a need for this number to increase to 30-35,000 homes in the years to 2027.  Any post-Brexit impact will be closely monitored and factored in accordingly.<\/p><p>In December 2018, the Government published its Contingency Action Plan which outlined the many risks of a no deal scenario, and the work underway at national and EU level to mitigate these risks as much as possible. My Department contributed to the process and identified the areas within its remit.  On 9 July the Government published the Brexit Contingency Action Plan Update which<i><\/i>reflects the extensive work that has taken place at EU level and on a whole-of-Government basis. The Action Plan emphasises the need for stepped up preparedness measures, by exposed businesses in particular. In that regard, approximately one third of the Irish construction industry's  inputs are imported, a significant proportion of which comes from the UK.<\/p><p>The preparedness measures for the construction sector span across a number of Government Department and Offices. These include the Department of Education and Skills (construction workers\/professional qualifications), the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation &amp;amp; NSAI (the trade of goods and services) and the  Revenue  Commissioners (customs, duties and levies) and each is engaging on the issues in their areas. <\/p><p>One of the key areas under my Department's remit is the implementation of the Construction Products Regulation (EU) No 305\/2011 (CPR), which sets the rules for placing certain construction products on the EU market and the requirement for a CE Marking.  On the date of withdrawal, the UK becomes a third country. This has implications for the certification of certain construction products, for manufacturers, importers, distributors and authorised representatives when placing products on the Irish\/EU Market and builders, building professionals and others when specifying and using certain construction products. <\/p><p>Since January 2018, my  Department has been engaging with the construction sector in relation to the impact of Brexit  for the CPR and the actions that should be taken before the UK leaves the EU.

The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist contractors is an essential consumer protection measure giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  In addition, it will complement the reforms made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 and contribute to the development of an enhanced culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector. <\/p>  <p>  It is proposed that the operation of CIRI will be vested in the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) in the same way that statutory registration of Architects was vested in the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), pursuant to the Building Control Act 2007. The independence and objectivity of the registration board will be critical to the success of CIRI and a number of provisions are included in the draft Bill to uphold the independence of the registration system, including in relation to fees. My Department is working with the Attorney General's Office with a view to achieving publication of the Bill in early 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600044#WRK03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Urban Regeneration and Development Fund","counter":564,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600044#WRK03200"},{"type":"question","counter":565,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[39140\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092600044#WRK03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when a decision will be made on an appeal or review relating to the refusal by his Department to fund a project applied for under the urban regeneration and development fund (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":566,"content":"<p>The Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) launched last year has an overall provision of &euro;2 billion to 2027.
