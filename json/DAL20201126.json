The plan is a whole-of-Government initiative.  It aims to promote responsible business practices at home and overseas by all Irish business enterprises, in line with Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights globally.  The plan is directed at Government and State agencies, Irish companies operating at home and overseas and multinational enterprises operating in Ireland.  The Department has established an independently chaired business and human rights implementation group to oversee implementation of the national plan.  The group was convened in December 2018 and given a three-year mandate, expiring in December 2021.  Its first meeting took place in January 2019.  Membership consists of representatives from civil society, academia, the business community and Government Departments and agencies.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government commits to a review of the implementation of the national plan.  My officials are currently examining the options for giving effect to this commitment, having regard to the structural changes to my Department upon the formation of the new Government.

This follows the July European Council conclusions on the MFF-Next Generation EU package, which stated that a regime of conditionality to protect the budget and Next Generation EU will be introduced.  The Presidency tabled a compromise proposal for a regulation in September, which led to difficult discussions since, while a number of member states strongly support the use of protective measures, others oppose such measures or want to limit them to very specific breaches as they affect the EU budget.<\/p>  <p>  The mechanism agreed with the European Parliament would require member states allocated funding from the EU's budget, including the recovery fund, to respect the rule of law, which is an essential precondition to comply with the principles of sound financial management enshrined in Article 317 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Approval of the own-resources decision as soon as possible is critical to allow the recovery fund to support member states, through grants and loans, to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 crisis and to recover from it.  I regret that Hungary and Poland are not yet in a position to support the MFF agreement and own-resource decision due to their opposition to the rule of law mechanism.

Ireland is a firm supporter of these EU values.  Hungarian Government reforms, mainly in the justice area, give rise to concerns about fundamental principles of the operation of the rule of law, including judicial independence, media freedom, academic freedom and the protection of civil society organisations and human rights defenders.

The demolition by Israeli authorities of private property is of grave concern.  Demolition and confiscation of humanitarian assets, including education infrastructure, is contrary to Israel&rsquo;s obligations under international humanitarian law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.  The only conclusion we can draw from the systematic nature of these policies, especially in areas where illegal Israeli settlements have already been constructed, is that they are aimed at forcing Palestinians off their land.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland regularly conveys its views on these actions to the Israeli authorities, both directly and through the EU.  I have also raised the issue on my visits to the region on numerous occasions.

Ireland, the EU and the wider humanitarian community are supporting impacted communities.<\/p>  <p>  My primary concern is the hardship and injustice that demolitions and confiscations cause for Palestinian families.  It is of additional concern when those structures confiscated or demolished are donor-funded.  It is important that the question of recompense for humanitarian relief funded by our taxpayers should be pursued.  Ireland pursues this matter issue consistently through the West Bank Protection Consortium, which plays a leading role in supporting threatened communities from forcible transfer, co-ordinating the provision of essential services to them, including material and humanitarian assistance and legal aid.  It is the practice of the consortium to raise the issue of compensation directly with the Israeli authorities and to date, the consortium has sought compensation of over &euro;625,000 in respect of confiscated or demolished assets.  In other words, we believe that we can be more impactful and effective if we work with other countries in a consortium like this, which involves some other EU countries as well, and we help to fund activities such as legal action taken on the back of these cases of demolition and confiscation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600005#C00100","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1606382400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The aviation sector is so important to our economy, particularly our tourism sector and in that context, are there any discussions at European level on this?  I know that it will have to be at that level.  Are there any discussions around this issue?  Maybe the information does not need to be a passport but could be in the form of a digital app or digital identification stating that a person had been vaccinated.  If one listens to the head of Quantas or other airlines, it seems that this is coming down the track.  There have been discussions in the UK Parliament about it.

We would like to see more co-ordination at an EU level although there has already been quite a lot, in terms of the traffic light system which is now providing a lot more certainty.  The truth is that very few people are travelling anyway.  The Government guidelines are very clear that any international travel should be limited to essential travel under level 5 restrictions but we are working towards a situation where we hope that can change as we move into next year.<\/p>  <p>  The passenger locator form is not something that relies on goodwill or voluntary co-operation.  It is a legal requirement to fill out a passenger locator form on entering the country.  It is also a legal requirement to fill it out accurately.  If a person puts false information on the passenger locator form, he or she is breaking the law and the penalties for that are quite severe.  Travellers who are exempt from the restrictions because they are essential workers or because they have taken a PCR test and are coming from an orange region will have to include that information on the passenger locator form and do so truthfully.  Otherwise, they are breaking the law.  I hope we will be able to accommodate something similar when vaccination becomes available so that people coming into Ireland who have been vaccinated can complete a passenger locator form that recognises this fact.  Obviously, we will have to take public health advice on this but my expectation is that if people are vaccinated, they will be able to avoid the restrictions that currently apply to international travel, particularly those arriving from orange locations.  We are working on this and the more we can do together, across the EU, the more effective it can be.  However, Ireland needs to protect its citizens against the potential threat of a reseeding of the virus through international travel.

It would be safe to say that Ireland has been one of the most restrictive countries in the EU in terms of international travel.  We have taken a lot of criticism from the airlines and there has been huge frustration at our airports because of that.  We believe it is for good reason, despite the fact that Ireland, arguably, relies on air travel more than any other country in the EU, with the possible exceptions of Malta and Cyprus.  We want to try to change our approach while making sure that we are continuing to be compliant with public health advice.  We do not want, following enormous efforts and sacrifices from people, to reintroduce the virus again through international travel, which is a danger if it is not managed right.  This is a difficult balance to get right.<\/p>  <p>  We have also made the decision that we are not going to have mandatory quarantine, enforced by knocking on people's doors.  Instead, we have introduced a mandatory element to the policy in the context of the passenger locator form and the legal requirement to fill that out accurately.  It is not a perfect system but by and large it has worked reasonably well.  It has limited international travel significantly and has kept the number of clusters linked to such travel to a very low level.

A great number of soldiers and military flights go through Shannon on their way to creating mayhem.  I am disappointed that the Minister will not make it an issue.

The priorities we have set for our term on the Security Council are built around peace, peacekeeping and holding countries to account for their actions under international law.  That is what we campaigned on and that is why we got significant support from UN member states, particularly small countries and countries that have been impacted by conflict.  Many such countries trust Ireland to be a voice to which they can speak, knowing that they will be listened to.  They see us as a country that will advocate for their concerns.

Negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship have entered an even more intensive phase since 21 October, with negotiating teams working daily to close the gaps between the two sides.  Due to a member of one of the negotiating teams falling ill with Covid-19, talks at chief negotiator level were temporarily suspended late last week.  The talks have now resumed and the negotiating teams are continuing their work online.<\/p>  <p>  A brief update on Brexit was provided by President von der Leyen at a videoconference of EU leaders on 19 November.  On 20 November, she noted that recent days had seen movement on some of the key areas, including that of state aid, although further work remains to close the remaining gaps.  That is now the focus of the negotiating teams.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies will appreciate that this process has reached a particularly sensitive point.  It is clear that unlocking a deal will only be possible if appropriate arrangements are found with regard to the key issues of the level playing field for open and fair competition, governance and fisheries, a key national interest for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In intensifying the negotiations in October, both sides agreed that regardless of progress in individual workstreams, nothing is agreed until an overall agreement is reached.  Nevertheless, we understand that progress has been made in recent weeks in a range of other areas of importance to Ireland, including connectivity and police and judicial co-operation.<\/p>  <p>  Any deal must involve compromises on all sides but a deal cannot come at any price.  The EU cannot accept proposals that impact on the integrity of the Single Market or damage the long-term political and economic interests of the Union.  We recognise that the UK also has its red lines.  The work of the negotiators is to find a set of arrangements that respects both EU and UK values and interests and which gives us a strong and sustainable framework for the vital co-operation between us in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Michel Barnier has our full support, and the support of the entire EU 27, at this crucial moment in the negotiating process.  As the EU&rsquo;s chief negotiator, he has been central to the united and cohesive approach of the EU 27 throughout the Brexit process, including during its most critical moments.  The universal confidence and respect he inspires in EU capitals is testament to his efforts.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues in government and I have remained in close contact with our European counterparts over recent times.  I acknowledge the absolute and unflagging support and solidarity our EU partners have demonstrated throughout the Brexit process.  They have always recognised the unique ways in which Ireland, North and South, is affected by Brexit.  This concern has expressed itself through the EU mandate and draft legal text and through the words and actions of our partners.  I have no doubt that we will continue to enjoy their solidarity.<\/p>  <p>  Irrespective of the outcome of the ongoing negotiations, the end of the transition period will bring substantial and lasting change.  This means that business and citizens must take action now to be ready for 1 January.  I particularly emphasise that, with or without a trade deal, any business that moves goods from, to or through Great Britain will be subject to a range of customs formalities, sanitary and phytosanitary checks and other regulatory requirements that do not apply to such trade today.<\/p>  <p>  I also take this opportunity to remind the House that, regardless of the outcome of the talks, the full, effective and timely implementation of the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol, remains vital and that this is an internationally binding legal obligation on both sides.  The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is explicitly designed to operate regardless of whether an EU-UK future relationship agreement is in place.

It has been an incredibly complex process.  So far, Irish interests have been factored in to the solutions that have been agreed.  We must try to ensure that the final agreement on a future relationship and a trade agreement can be reached in a way that does the same.

This broader agreement should recognise that the UK is being accommodated in terms of accessing EU Single Market areas, whether on energy, aviation, road haulage, data, data security or financial services.

First and foremost, the Government and I are interested in protecting fishing interests to ensure we have a fishing industry in future.  The issue of the Brexit adjustment fund and what proportion of it goes to fishing and so on is separate.  I have had conversations with the Commission on the matter.

It is an extraordinary position for the EU to have granted Northern Ireland full, unfettered, tariff and check-free future access to the Single Market of 450 million consumers.  That is in addition to ensuring unfettered access for Northern Ireland into Great Britain.  There is an upside to that which we should see and share with Northern Ireland, as opposed to seeing it as a threat.  We should view Ireland as an island for economic purposes and as an all-island economy, and we should ensure that the protocol works in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600008#F00900","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Issues","time":1606384800,"counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600009#G00150"},{"type":"question","time":1606384800,"counter":72,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[38445\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600009#G00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on whether the actions taken by Hungary and Poland are undermining the effective functioning of the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1591","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","time":1606384800,"counter":73,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[38266\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600009#G00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on Poland and Hungary blocking coronavirus recovery funding due to it being linked to the rule of law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","time":1606384800,"counter":74,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[38456\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600009#G00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the action being taken to ensure that the rule-of-law mechanism will be effective in the EU budget discussions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","time":1606384800,"counter":75,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[37954\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600009#G00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the action of Poland and Hungary in vetoing the multi-annual budget and recovery programme of the EU; the way in which he sees the requirement for member states to adhere to the common values of the Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1620","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1606384800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the Minister answered a similar question earlier and went into great detail.

I thank the Deputy and I share his concerns.  I outlined in my earlier reply the state of play on efforts to reach agreement on the MFF and the next generation EU recovery package.  I am confident that the German Presidency will ensure that clear rule-of-law conditionality is retained.  A prolonged delay in releasing funds to vital EU programmes due to continued objections from Poland and Hungary would have a negative impact on the EU&rsquo;s efforts to deliver recovery across the Union.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland is a firm supporter of the rule of law and the values of the EU enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union.  We believe it is vital for the EU to have the necessary tools to monitor possible breaches across member states and to respond effectively to challenges when they arise.  The EU must insist on the highest standards from its own member states if it is to remain an effective advocate for the rule of law globally.  Indeed, the very credibility of the Union is at stake.  We have, therefore, supported strong and effective rule of law provisions to protect the EU budget.  Once the regime of conditionality is introduced, Ireland will support its fair, proportionate and effective implementation.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that this regime of conditionality would strengthen the range of existing tools available to the EU for monitoring, promoting and enforcing the rule of law.  These include the ongoing Article 7 proceedings against Hungary and Poland, under which there have been several hearings at the General Affairs Council.  Ireland has been an active participant in these hearings and will continue to be.<\/p>  <p>  We have also welcomed the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s first annual rule-of-law report this year, which presents a broad overview of the rule of law situations across member states and the EU as a whole.  It provides a valuable, impartial assessment of both the positive and negative developments relating to rule of law.  We actively engaged with the Commission in the preparation of the Ireland chapter of the report and we welcome the independent and impartial review of rule of law in Ireland.  We look forward to discussing the Irish chapter of the report with fellow member states at a meeting of the General Affairs Council during the Portuguese Presidency in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600009#G00700","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1606384800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

Our ability to respond effectively to Covid-19 and its impact on economies across Europe is now being threatened by the protracted delay in respect of this issue.  Next generation funding is particularly relevant to assisting us across a wide range of areas.  Even the Common Agricultural Policy budget is supplemented with funds contained within the next generation allocations.<\/p>  <p>  It is imperative, therefore, at this critical crossroads for our economy and for the economies of other member states and in the context of our response to Covid-19, that this money begins to flow in respect of the assistance available to us in the form of financial measures and packages to help and assist various sectors.

Many in the UK argued for a long time that the EU is a Common Market rather than a Union.  That is an important aspect in respect of how we consider this matter.  Ultimately, the EU is more than a Common Market.  It is a Union and, ultimately, a peace project and at the heart of peace are key values.  Freedom of the press, freedom of civic space, lack of interference with the judiciary, etc., are important values.

It is a value system which allows the European Union to be a credible example of a multilateral system and project that secures peace and protection of its own citizens, but also to be an example internationally for how democracy, the rule of law, a legal system and an acceptable social safety net for people should actually function.

Ireland has consistently supported women human rights defenders and continually advocates for the freedom of all civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment.  The detention of human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia is deeply concerning and Ireland has raised our concerns bilaterally with the Saudi authorities.  Most recently, on 9 November, the detention and welfare of Ms Loujain al-Hathloul were raised directly by officials from my Department with the Saudi ambassador to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also raises these issues in international forums.  At the most recent meeting of the Human Rights Council in October, Ireland co-signed a joint statement expressing deep concern at the ongoing detention of women human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia.

Ireland regularly discusses these issues in various EU forums and works closely with other member states to ensure human rights issues in Saudi Arabia are addressed.

It talked about all the forums the Minister just mentioned and all the dialogue it has but it makes no odds when it comes to the repression of those who seek their own liberty.  Due to its wealth and power, it seems to wield an awful lot of influence in the western world.

Clearly what she is doing is campaigning for human rights.<\/p>  <p>  This is important because the open letter Oireachtas Members sent to the Minister has been circulated in Norway, Sweden and in the British Parliament as an example of how world pressure must be put on the Saudi regime, and other parliamentarians have been asked to follow the Irish model.

By providing a repackaging and resale market for corporate debt it lowers the cost of debt financing.  It is accepted that having the option of more diversified sources of financing is good for investment and business.  It is also important for financial stability in the economy, as the ability to securitise loan books plays an important role in allowing banks to meet their capital requirement obligations and continue lending to businesses and individuals.<\/p>  <p>  The role of securitisation has been recognised by the European Commission through its work on capital markets union.  However, this regime is subject to several anti-avoidance provisions.  For example, the Finance Act 2011 restricted the ability of section 110 companies to avail of a tax deduction for interest payments to connected persons in respect of profit participation notes.  The Finance Act 2016 put further restrictions in place.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there are competing concerns in this area.  On the one hand, there are ongoing concerns regarding loan book sales and the appropriate levels of taxation.  On the other hand, it is recognised that bona fide securitisation is important for both consumer lending and bank capital requirements.

When it was announced in late July, it was estimated that the scheme would involve an Exchequer cost of up to or approximately &euro;270 million.  This was an outside estimate based on 2.15 million individual taxpayers availing of the tax credit.  In addition, as I indicated at the time, the measure was introduced in anticipation that the economy would be on the way to being fully open and there would be mobility across the country.  A number of weeks after we announced the scheme, that all changed.  The scheme is due to operate until April of next year, but the flexibility exists for me to extend its operation next year beyond that date.  As for uptake and the eventual cost across next year and the year after, a lot will depend on how matters unfold in the weeks and months ahead.

Rather than losing this money for the sector, however, I ask the Minister to ring-fence the &euro;100 million underspend to date and to use it to act as a guarantee for those who purchase gift vouchers in the hospitality sector between now and Christmas.  We have seen iconic attractions such as Dublin Zoo under threat of closure.  This will make many people wary of purchasing gift vouchers for hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions as they fear they may not reopen.

As the Deputy will be aware, that was aimed at trying to give small and medium-sized retailers additional profitability and additional support if needed to continue to have the chance to stay open or reopen and keep on their current employees.  The reason I ultimately did not go with the additional tax support for the voucher to which the Deputy referred is that I cannot make that conditional on the voucher being spent in Irish-owned retail businesses below a certain scale.  If one brings in a voucher such as that, it would be for use in all retailers, regardless of how they are owned.

Regarding the existing State savings offering, the NTMA, through State savings projects, offers a wide range of tax-free savings products to the public, including prize bonds and fixed-rate savings bonds and certificates.  Both short-term and long-term fixed-rate products are offered, with maturities from three to ten years.<\/p> <p> The low level of return from normal savings vehicles is a product of the low interest rate environment generally.  As such, interest rates on offer via State savings products are competitive and provide good value for their holders.  The return rewards savers who hold products to maturity.  Early redemption is possible, although at the loss of most, if not all, of the return.  There has been an increase in the purchase of State savings products in the past 12 months.  This growth in deposits is consistent across the financial services sector in Ireland.  State savings balances at the end of October 2019 were &euro;21.1 billion, while the end-October 2020 balances totalled &euro;22.4 billion.  In the intervening 12-month period, therefore, customer inflows were approximately &euro;1.3 billion.

That is really welcome.  The NTMA and I keep under review the suitability of products, which includes looking at how they are performing.

There is a flip side to that argument, which is that the same high level of savings is evident throughout the EU and in many other developed parts of the world at this time.  As those savings are spent, we need to be in a place where our exports are competitively priced and accessible to avail of the demand that is likely to develop in the economies to which we export.

Yes, they are gladly availing of the schemes the Minister mentioned, such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme, rates breaks and the Covid restrictions support scheme, but they still have many issues in respect of bank and lending repayments because of liens against properties.  It appears to restrict banks in approving or granting funds under the Government's guarantee scheme, which it had been hoped would be used to assist in the payment of suppliers.

I have been in touch with the Department and officials specifically in respect of the issue that has arisen as a result of the banks' failure to acknowledge the commitment one would have expected to materialise by virtue of the guarantee scheme being in place.

This relief allows a niece or nephew to be treated as a child of the disponer for CAT purposes in certain circumstances.  A person may qualify for this relief if he or she receives a gift or inheritance of business assets, including farming assets.  This means the person is entitled to the group A tax-free threshold, currently &euro;335,000, when calculating the CAT liability for the gift or inheritance, rather than the group B threshold, which is currently &euro;32,500.  The use of this relief is not restricted to circumstances in which the disponer or beneficiary has no family.  To qualify for this relief, the niece or nephew must have worked for the disponer for five years immediately before receiving the gift or inheritance and for a minimum number of hours per week.  This is a targeted relief.  The policy rationale underpinning the relief is to recognise a niece or nephew who has placed his or her labour and expertise at the disposal of the disponer for an ongoing period to the benefit of the business or farm.<\/p>  <p>  If the Deputy's question refers to potentially extending this scheme, it would clearly represent a fundamental departure from the principles underpinning our CAT regime.

This goes back to the principle of ensuring that lending is done with care and in a way that is in the long-term interest of the borrower.  <\/p> <p> Again, being on one of our subsidy schemes should not, in general, preclude somebody from getting a loan but the viability of the employer and the nature of the support the employer is getting are matters that must be taken into account.

In the early morning, a man in his 40s living in a tent in the shadow of Leinster House was found dead.  He had been living there for some time.  Later in the afternoon, another man died in accommodation run by a well-known charity.  We do not know the full circumstances of these tragic deaths but it is clear that both men were homeless.  This brings the number of such deaths reported in Dublin this year to more than 52, which represents a significant increase on the number of deaths of those sleeping rough or in emergency accommodation in 2019.

People experiencing homelessness, who often have acute addiction or mental health needs, are at a greater risk of dying prematurely.  The exact causes of death vary.

Are we doing enough to reduce this risk and prevent such deaths?  Is our emergency accommodation system fit for purpose?

I was very saddened to hear of the deaths of those two men in recent days.  At any time of year, although particularly in the run-up to Christmas, the deaths of people who are homeless fills us all with sorrow.  As I understand it, there have been media reports concerning the deaths of two individuals in Dublin between the evening of 24 November and the morning of 25 November.  One of these deaths was of a man who had a tenancy in long-term supported accommodation.  The second man was found in a tent in Dublin 2.  The circumstances of his death have not yet been fully established.  These deaths are tragedies for the families involved and we extend our sympathies to those families and to all who knew them.  Out of consideration for the families of these men, people should respect their privacy and should not speculate as to the individual causes of their deaths.<\/p>  <p>  On the evening concerned, the DRHE outreach team worked through the night, as it does every night, to bring rough sleepers into emergency accommodation.  A total of 31 people came into emergency beds on that night while 32 spare emergency beds were available to homelessness services in Dublin city.  No person should die on our streets because of the lack of a bed.  There were beds available and there were support workers on the street encouraging people to come in that night.  The death of people who use homelessness services is taken very seriously.  As the Deputy has mentioned, the HSE and the DRHE have commissioned a detailed review of all recent deaths in homelessness services.  This was agreed on 10 November.  Although we already know a great deal about this matter from previous work, it is important to get a more current picture to help us to understand why the number of homeless people who are dying is rising while the number of people who are homeless is falling.<\/p>  <p>  Each case is different and has a personal story behind it.  We should respect that and not engage in gross simplifications.  I appreciate that the Deputy did not do that.  He spoke about the interplay between homelessness, addiction, mental health and all of the other issues that make this such a difficult problem to solve.  It is important to ensure that the Government fulfils its duties to protect our vulnerable and to reduce homelessness in our cities and towns.  It is vital that we continue to deliver appropriate measures to ensure that all individuals experiencing homelessness are helped to exit homelessness and move into permanent housing and that those with complex health and mental health needs are provided for.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government contains a commitment to expanding the Housing First approach, which has been successful to date.  This approach is based on understanding that the best way to deal with people's underlying problems, whether these relate to their mental or physical health or other issues, is to make sure that they have a roof over their heads.  That has worked quite well so far and further investment will be made in it.  The Government is also acquiring more one-bed homes.  There is a real shortage of one-bed social housing units in Ireland at the moment.  So many of those who are homeless are single men and they need such accommodation in combination with the required support services.  As of the third quarter of 2020, 459 people have been housed under the Housing First programme.  This is making a difference and we will continue to build on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600021#T00500","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1606392000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his response.

It is always a matter of concern that people who use homeless services die early.  They may die considerably earlier than average.  It is of particular concern that the number of deaths is rising at a time when the number of homeless people is falling.  We need to get to the bottom of that and respond to it as an emergency, as the Deputy describes it.<\/p> <p> What is being done?  Cold weather arrangements are being put in place at the moment for the winter period, including more bed capacity and 24-hour facilities with meals, continuous placement for families and enhanced rough sleeper outreach.  The Dublin street outreach services are provided by Dublin Simon Community and funded by Government.  This involves a broader engagement for people who are sleeping rough.  There has also been an increase in the mobile health clinic.  It delivers weekly services to outreach teams in co-operation with Dublin Simon Community and the Housing First intake team, which is part of the Peter McVerry Trust.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600021#T00700","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606392600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I wish to address the issue of social media.  No one can dispute the fact that social media has changed our lives beyond recognition.  It has now become the centre of many people's lives, so much so that it is now a medically recognised addiction.  In fewer than 14 years it has morphed from being a way of expanding our social network to being a means to destroy people's credibility, reputations and lives at the simple touch of a button.  Social media has changed life as we knew it.  It has impacted on politics across the world.  Some of this change has been positive, but for the most part turning the political system into a free-for-all has proved to be damaging and unsettling.<\/p>  <p>  For the vast majority of politicians, having a presence on social media is almost as vital as having their names on the ballot paper.  It is crucial for public representatives to be in touch with people and communities.  However, no person, whether in public life or otherwise, should be the target of lies and abuse.  This is happening more and more across the world and, sadly, it is also happening here in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  A clear example of this was the most recent general election.  It is widely known that social media platforms were used to target and undermine parties and candidates.  Fake profiles were created on social media with the sole purpose of spinning lies and false information intended to cause maximum damage.  Reports of certain political groupings encouraging their supporters to target other candidates by posting negative and false comments were rampant.  This did not simply happen on the usual platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter.  There were chatrooms on a number of sites where keyboard warriors, using monikers to disguise their identities, tore apart the political and personal lives of candidates.  For the most part, the comments held as much water as a sieve, but how many voters would have taken the time to check the veracity of the information?<\/p>  <p>  Social media, if left unmonitored, can whip up support for almost anything.  Lies and truth compete for the attention of the public.  It has happened time and time again throughout this pandemic.  Cleverly worded false information has put innumerable lives at risk.  Governments across the globe have been accused of using the pandemic to gain control over peoples' lives.  Supposedly scientific articles have falsely informed people that mask-wearing is unnecessary.  Protests and riots have been organised at the drop of a hat in major cities with crowds screaming demands for freedom from restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  Social media is now the most powerful weapon of our age.  It encourages the right to freedom of expression.  When will it protect the rights of people who are victimised or misled by lies?  This Government has taken commendable action in bringing forward legislation to make the sharing of inappropriate images of women on the Internet punishable by a prison sentence.  We must not stop there.  We must not forget other victims.  Cyber-abuse in all its forms must be legislated for and stamped out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600022#U00200","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1606392600,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  This is something that has been on the minds of many people in our country in recent weeks and months, including parents who are worried about their children and individuals who are worried about their reputations.<\/p>  <p>  It is true that social media has been a great innovation.  Like all technologies, it comes with positives and negatives.  I believe that in many ways social media has changed our lives for the better but it has also changed our lives for the worse.  It allows us to connect on a daily basis with people who perhaps in the past we only saw once a week or once a month.  It has been helpful in the pandemic, when it is difficult to meet up with people.  It allows us to stay connected with people overseas, relatives and friends with whom we would otherwise have lost contact.  We are now able to see what they are doing in their daily lives in a way that we could not in the past.  It also allows people to organise as residents' associations, political campaigns, groups of workers and groups of businesspeople.  That is not a bad thing in itself.  It is probably a good thing but it does come with new dangers.  Those new dangers include dis-information, misinformation, downright fake news, conspiracy theories and things that would never be published in a normal newspaper or on a television news bulletin.  Yet, these things can be distributed online and seen by tens of thousands of people as though they were true with no consequences.<\/p>  <p>  In many ways social media is the public square and should be treated as the public square.  The things that people are not allowed to do in a public square should not be allowed on social media either.  We know what these are.  We are all in favour of free speech.  We allow people to speak freely, but there is a limit to that.  There are things that people cannot say in the public square, because if they did they could be sued for libel or defamation.  The same things apply to a disguise.  We allow people to disguise themselves, to dress up, as it were, in the public square, but not if they do it with a view to causing harm to others.  That is fundamentally the principle we should apply to social media.  If a person is allowed to do something in the public square, then it is okay.  If a person is not allowed to do it in the public square, then it is something we need to take action against.<\/p>  <p>  How are we taking action?  As Deputy Lowry mentioned, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is bringing forward legislation to make imaged-based sexual abuse a criminal offence.  This will build on some work done by Deputy Brendan Howlin.  The idea is to turn this into a legal protection against people using intimate images to harm or threaten others.<\/p>  <p>  We are also going to bring in legislation to establish an electoral commission.  It is long overdue but very much needed.  This will allow us to regulate online political content.  The third aspect is the legislation being brought forward by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Martin.  It relates to an online safety commissioner and giving a new office and role to the media commission.  The plan is to give the online safety commissioner the power to order platforms to take down content that they have not taken down where it is harmful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600022#U00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1606392600,"counter":246,"content":"<p>When the term cyberbullying is used, most people think it refers solely to children and teenagers.

There is an illusion among some people that well-known individuals are unaffected by name-calling and hateful comments and should somehow be able to handle it.<\/p>  <p>  I believe our House has a role to play.  Political leaders must act to curb the crude, vicious and scurrilous attacks on political opponents.  Many of these social media warriors are out of control and need to be reined in.  A pattern develops where the same cowards repeatedly pop up to peddle hateful, offensive and malicious commentary.  This brand of political support should be banished.

Is what is said something that would be tolerated if it happened in the public square?<\/p> <p>Could somebody say what is being said in the street and do so without consequences?  The other issue is how we can legislate in this context.  We plan to legislate for an online safety commissioner as part of the media commission.  That online safety commissioner will have the power to order platforms to take content down where it is harmful.  We will have a job to do in this House to define what harmful means, because one person's harmful is another person's opinion.  We must bear that in mind.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of everyone.  Some financial organisations are only too happy to prey on misery and distress, some of which has been generated by the Covid pandemic.  This is particularly true of those vulture funds that have initiated a vicious cycle of ruthless activity involving the forced sale of hundreds, if not thousands, of farms across this State.  Indeed, earlier this week Declan O'Brien of <i>The Farming Independent<\/i>reported that there has been a renewed upsurge in forced farm sales by these funds.  This has involved the adoption of an extremely aggressive approach by these lenders since the end of the Covid-19-related moratorium on forced sales.  The same report also noted that personal insolvency practitioners and farmer organisations, such as the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA and the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, have been sounding the alarm on this issue for years.  Yet, nothing has been done by the Government.<\/p><p>The picture emerging from across this State is absolutely horrendous.  I have taken calls from some very distressed constituents.  This matter is of profound concern to many farmers who are trying their level best to engage with lenders regarding debt management and repayment.  As I understand it, personal insolvency practitioners have also sounded alarms on this issue.  They have stated that some farm sales are even being forced through without any prior notice being given to the farmers involved.  I am aware of one case where a farmer was informed by his neighbour that his farm was up for sale online.  That is disgraceful.  We need Government action on this issue.<\/p><p>As I understand it, several of these forced sales have been denied through the application of protective certificates under the personal insolvency legislation.  This is not a new issue.  We need much more action from the Government.  We cannot allow this ruthless activity on the part of vulture funds to continue.  In 2018, farm organisations, including the IFA and the ICMSA, warned the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, that there was an urgent need to put in place a greater degree of enforcement by the Financial Regulator in respect of the protections offered to farmers.  The 2018 IFA submission noted that &quot;Vulture funds take a short-term approach to the loans acquired and are not generally interested in working out a long-term debt resolution with the customer&quot;.  This generates real and lasting damage, as the sale of assets damages the underlying viability of family farms.  This is a particular problem for farms where the value of security held is often far in excess of the debts.  Here we are, almost three years later, with a hard Brexit overshadowing Irish agriculture and a reformed fair deal scheme for farmers still not finalised and yet there is no movement on this issue.  Where are the protections for farmers against vulture funds?  What is this Government going to do to stop this ruthless aggressive activity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600023#V00200","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1606393200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>It is important to say at the outset that people have a responsibility to repay their debts.  If people borrow money, they have a responsibility to pay it back.  That is true for mortgage holders, farmers and business people.  If people do not pay back their debts, they are causing social harm.  Farmers not paying back their debts means that is harder for other farmers to get credit and that they have to pay higher interest rates when they do.  Business people not paying back their debts also has an effect in that it will be harder for other business people to get credit and that they will also have to pay higher interest rates when they do.  People not paying back their mortgage debts also makes it harder for other people to get mortgages in the first place and it will also mean that they will also have to pay higher interest rates when they do.  We need to be frank and honest about the fact that people not paying back their debts causes social harm to others.  It is not just a case of not paying money back to the banks or other financial institutions.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, I believe strongly that people who make an honest and reasonable effort to pay back their debts as best they can, whether that means over a prolonged period or by means of a restructuring of the debt, should be facilitated.  Nobody wants to see anybody losing a home, a business or a farm.  Generally speaking, the courts are sympathetic in those circumstances.  I do not see how a sale of a farm or a business could occur if there had not already been repossession hearings in a court, because that would have to happen first.  Courts in Ireland do not grant repossession orders lightly.  The number of such orders granted is very low.  It must be borne in mind, therefore, that many protections already exist.

I do not think he understands the gravity of the situation in rural Ireland.  As the IFA has observed, it is simply unacceptable that farmers who gave security to long-standing institutions and pillar banks can have that security sold to faceless entities that may not be answerable to anybody.

This issue is especially acute in small, rural nursing homes.  The simple reality is that private nursing homes are not able to match the HSE in the context of pay and benefits, as well as, recently, more aggressive recruitment by the HSE and HSE-funded agencies.  This is placing intolerable pressure on private nursing homes.<\/p> <p>I am a strong supporter of home care packages and I believe that we need to invest significantly in that model of care.  For many different reasons, however, we will continue to need the very important services of the nursing home sector.  I am not in the business of trying to increase profits in the sector.  My objective is to try to ensure decent wages and proper benefits for staff as well as an accessible, affordable and quality service for those who need it.<\/p> <p> I have no ideological bias between private or public care.  I want a quality service, fit for purpose, which represents value for money.  On the issue of value for money, the Comptroller and Auditor General published a report this year on the fair deal scheme.  That report states that the weekly average fee in 2018 for public nursing homes was &euro;1,564, while for private nursing homes, it was &euro;968.  As care standards overseen by HIQA are the same in all nursing home settings, this means the staff in private nursing homes bear the brunt when it comes to cost savings because the homes have to make a profit, otherwise they close their doors.  This is completely unacceptable.  In July 2016, the T&aacute;naiste, then Taoiseach, published the terms of reference for a review of the fair deal scheme.  That report remains unpublished.  Why is this?  Will the T&aacute;naiste publish it now, or will he ask the Minister for Health to do this?<\/p> <p> The report from the Comptroller and Auditor General stated the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, which is responsible for the determination of fees under the fair deal scheme on behalf of the State, did not provide his office with a model to inform how the fee is determined under the fair deal.  There is no clarity on the models of funding.  If the scheme is called \"fair deal\", it should be a fair deal for all involved - the residents, the nursing homes and the staff who work there.<\/p> <p> I have looked at the programme for Government and I am not excited by what I see.

Like her, I thins there will always be a role to play for nursing homes.  We want more home care and more people being able to stay in their homes for longer and that is the plan and the direction of travel.  This is why so much additional funding has been provided for home care in recent years with a 40% increase in the past couple of years and a further increase next year.  There will always be people who need a nursing home and who need residential care and this needs to be provided for.  Like the Deputy, I have no ideological bias as to whether that is provided by the public or private sector, so long as standards are high and that people are cared for properly.<\/p>  <p>  On the fair deal review, I had thought that was published ages ago.  I may be wrong.  If it was not, I will check into that.<\/p>  <p>  The fees paid by the State to the nursing homes under the nursing homes support scheme are negotiated between the NTPF and nursing homes individually and that is done on a confidential basis because it is commercially sensitive.  The NTPF tries to make sure that reasonable costs are covered and that a reasonable profit is possible for those nursing home providers.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult for private nursing homes to compete with the State and with the HSE for staff.  This is because in the State sector the pay is generally that little bit better and there is the possibility of a public sector pension, which is very valuable, and the leave arrangements can also be beneficial.  We need to bear in mind that the nursing home sector is very profitable.  I know that this year may have been an exception but, in the round, the nursing home sector is profitable.  It may be the case that there are a lot of nursing homes around the country that have the capacity to offer better terms and conditions for their staff by reducing their profits.  We need to be frank about this too.<\/p>  <p>  There is a difference between public and private nursing homes.  They are not directly comparable. It is generally the case that those public nursing homes under the HSE tend to care for people with higher care needs.  We often see figures comparing one sector with the other and saying that the cost of providing care in a HSE nursing home is higher than that in a private nursing home.  This is often because the public nursing homes tend to take people with higher care needs, so it is not always directly comparable in the way some people try to compare it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600024#W00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1606393800,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

Their income has not dropped by 25% or 30%, however, so they have not been able to access State supports such as the employer wage subsidy scheme or the restart grant.  They have had help with personal protective equipment, but it is proving especially difficult.

The core concept of the scheme is that the State will provide additional funding to nursing homes that require it to contribute to their additional costs associated with Covid-19, and to the costs of dealing with mitigation and outbreak management where that occurs.  Eligible costs include both additional payroll and non-payroll Covid-19-related costs.

It is important to acknowledge that generally, students are not paid across the public service.  Medical students, trainee garda&iacute; and teacher trainees are not paid.  Student nurses in their final or pre-registration year are paid because they are different and do real work on wards that would not be done were it not for them.  That is why there is special recognition for student nurses and why they get paid in their pre-registration year, even though most students in the public service and, indeed, the private sector, do not get paid for their work.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, is examining whether we can improve the payment they receive but this issue must be seen in the wider context that it is not the norm for students to receive payment in either the public or private sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600025#X00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1606394400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I also extend my sincere sympathies to the families and friends of the two homeless people who have died.

However, we need to bear in mind that just because people can gather in a pub, it does not mean that an equal number of home gatherings will not happen.  In fact, it is very possible that, having spent a few hours or a night in the pub, people will then retire to somebody's house and have a house party there.

However, as we move from level 5 to level 3, which we hope to do next week, inter-county travel will still be restricted.  It will only be allowed for work, school or essential purposes like caring for an elderly relative.  Inter-county travel, including cross-Border travel, for shopping or for visiting friends and relatives will not be allowed.

I knew I was on the list for this item.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the T&aacute;naiste and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to introduce this Bill.  I thank also the staff of the Office of the Ceann Comhairle and the Bills Office who worked very hard to help me with this.  I am delighted to discuss my Bill in the House.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has ripped through our society and economy and has wreaked havoc on workers and their families.  Many workers, especially front-line and essential service workers such as suppliers, shop and supermarket workers, workers in food processing and meat factories, nurses, doctors and garda&iacute;, have been working around the clock since March to help us get through the Covid-19 crisis.  They are working today and will be working throughout Christmas.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, for many of these workers, this means they have been unable to use up all their 2020 annual leave due to the workplace demands the pandemic has brought.  As a result, countless workers could lose several days of annual leave once the year ends.  It is for this reason I bring this Bill before the House.  The Bill seeks to allow workers to carry over annual leave from 2020 which they were unable to take due to the effects of Covid-19 on the worker, the employer or the wider economy or society and to use that leave in 2021 and-or 2022.  Put simply, this means that where workers could not take their leave due to Covid-19, they will be facilitated with a carryover of that leave into 2021 and-or 2022.  I see no reason the Government should object to such a proposal given that we have seen similar changes in Britain, where they have amended their working time legislation to allow workers to carry over leave not taken due to Covid-19 into the next two leave years.<\/p>  <p>  These are extraordinary times and as such they call for extraordinary measures.  This legislation is intended to be only temporary but it seeks to give back to workers and to help those workers who have worked non-stop throughout the Covid-19 crisis and who have not been able to take their annual leave.  I am sure I speak for everyone in the House when I say that no businesses or Government agency would want to see workers' untaken annual leave lapse at the end of this year.  The Government has been quick to implement emergency measures and a number of supports to cover a range of matters but has been very slow in looking out for workers.  Workers have accrued their leave and are entitled to take it.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to ensure that workers' annual leave rights are preserved.  If they cannot take their leave in 2020 due to Covid-19, they should have a legal right to carry it over into 2021 and-or 2022, when, it is to be hoped, we will have a vaccine and will be able to move about with some semblance of normality.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that when the Second Stage debate is taken, all those Deputies who stood up to give a round of applause to front-line and essential service workers earlier this year will support it.  The Bill seeks to give workers something that will be of real benefit to them.  There is a reason we get annual leave.  It is not necessarily because employers love workers, it is because workers sometimes need a rest in order that they might continue to do their work.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600028#AA00400","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1606396200,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600028#AA00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1606396200,"counter":310,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600028#AA00600","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1606396200,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1606396200,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600028#AA00800","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1606396200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600028#AA00900","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1606396200,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1606396200,"counter":315,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600028#AA01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1606396200,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Niamh Smyth - to discuss the need to address concerns about direct provision centres in Monaghan; (2) Deputy Carol Nolan - to discuss the need for a primary care centre to be constructed in Birr, County Offaly; (3) Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan - to discuss a HSE allowance to cover the additional costs of waste disposal incurred due to a disability; (4) Deputy Steven Matthews - to discuss a Covid-19 outbreak in a County Dublin hospital and immediate measures to minimise any further risk to patients, staff and the wider community; (5) Deputy Michael McNamara - to discuss the withdrawal of mortgage approval at final drawdown due to the applicant being in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment; (6) Deputies Joe McHugh, Darren O'Rourke, Matt Carthy and Ruair&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute; - to discuss the implications of Brexit for the invalidating of certificates of professional competence in road haulage and passenger transport; (7) Deputy Chris Andrews - to discuss the urgency of a date for vital surgery for scoliosis patients who have to wait more than six months for treatment (details supplied); (8) Deputies Kieran O'Donnell and Maurice Quinlivan - to discuss delays in construction of the Coonagh-Knockalisheen road; (9) Deputy David Stanton - to discuss the need to support second level students travelling from Cobh to school in Carrigtohill and transport affordability; (10) Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor - to discuss proposals to honour the Labour Court recommendation on occupational pensions for community employment supervisors; (11) Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett - to discuss the working conditions and traumas faced by online control moderators; (12) Deputy Dessie Ellis - to discuss concerns that insurance companies are refusing mortgage protection cover to those with underlying conditions during the Covid-19 pandemic; (13) Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in - to discuss the scarcity of second level places in north Dublin owing to schools reducing their intake to enable social distancing; and (14) Deputy Michael Moynihan - to discuss safety works planned for Ballymaquirk Cross, Kanturk, County Cork.<\/p>  <p>  The matters raised by Deputies Niamh Smyth; Joe McHugh, Darren O'Rourke, Matt Carthy and Ruair&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute;; and Carol Nolan have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600028#AA01200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1606396200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.14 p.m. and resumed at 1.33 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Judicial Appointments Process: Statements","time":1606396800,"counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600029#CC00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1606396800,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Before we commence this item, it is important for me to set out the terms of engagement.  I almost said \"terms of endearment\".  Let us ensure they are terms of engagement.  Last week, I ruled that the process followed by the Government in relation to judicial appointments could be raised, subject to keeping within the limits of parliamentary debate and respecting the normal rules on Cabinet confidentiality.  As part of the official functions for which she is accountable to the House, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, undertook a process that led to a name being submitted to the Cabinet.  The Minister may, therefore, be questioned on this particular process, including on the nature of the process, the steps involved in it and how it was actually conducted.  These are all objective issues that are in order and do not encroach on other branches of government.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Minister may not be questioned on the merits or relative merits of candidates, nor can she be questioned on how candidates were evaluated with reference to the selection criteria.  All persons involved in this process are holders of judicial office and I remind Members that they cannot comment on their suitability for office.  These are all subjective matters that Members are precluded from addressing, in accordance with the longstanding rules of the House.  I would also make the point that the process conducted with the selection of one name for submission to Cabinet and some matters related with Cabinet, including the Government memorandum and discussions, may not be raised because of the constitutional provisions regarding Cabinet confidentiality.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I ask Members to adhere to the framework I have outlined.  If this framework is followed, it will not be necessary for me to intervene in the course of proceedings, something I do not want to do.  However, in the event that I do have to intervene, I ask Members, please, to respect that and to co-operate with the rulings and directions.<\/p>  <p>  I call the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600029#CC00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1606396800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I am happy to take this opportunity to update the House on the appointment by the Government of members of the Judiciary.  Over the past century, one of the great successes of the modern Irish State has been the Judiciary, which has consistently acted in a robust and independent fashion and earned the respect of fellow judges in Europe and around the world.  Since I was elected to this House, and especially since I have had the honour of serving as Minister for Justice, I have been acutely conscious of my over-riding duty to uphold and vindicate the independence of the Judiciary.  As Minister for Justice, I will continue to do so throughout this debate.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to set out the details of this appointment for the information of Deputies.  However, unlike previous Ministers who have answered questions relating to judicial appointments, I come to the House today as a number of Members have put forward a motion of impeachment.  It makes it all the more important that everyone in the House today is mindful of their responsibilities.  It is incumbent on all of us to uphold the independence and integrity of the Judiciary and not to do or say anything that could undermine the courts or any sitting judge or, indeed, undermine the separation of powers.  We do not have to look too far across Europe to see instances where the independence of the Judiciary is questioned.  I have participated in European Union meetings where this very issue was discussed many times.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to first set out the process by which judges are appointed under the Constitution and the law.  I know many Members will already be familiar with this process, given the lengthy debates in the House in recent years on the judicial appointments legislation proposed by the last Government.  Appointments to the Judiciary are made in accordance with Articles 13.9 and 35.1 of the Constitution by the President acting on behalf of the Government.  This is a constitutional function that cannot be transferred or delegated.  The constitutional prerogative to advise the President on judicial appointments lies with the Government alone.  The Government takes this responsibility seriously and our objective at all times is to propose the best person to fill each judicial vacancy.  I can assure the House that that was also the case when the Government decided to nominate Justice S&eacute;amus Woulfe to the Supreme Court.<\/p>  <p>  As I outlined to the House in replies to parliamentary questions earlier this week, it has been the practice to maintain a vacancy on the Supreme Court due to the reduction achieved in waiting times in that court in recent years.  However, this is, of course, kept under review.  In this particular case, the Chief Justice wrote to the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, on 4 February 2020, requesting that the Supreme Court vacancy arising from a retirement in June 2019 be filled.  He cited emerging pressures, including the establishment of the CervicalCheck tribunal.  As he was obliged to do under law, the then Minister for Justice and Equality wrote to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, on 17 February 2020.  In keeping with the usual practice, the Minister asked the board to furnish him with nominations for the vacancy and the name of each person who had informed the board of his or her wish to be considered for appointment.  The then Minister also responded separately to the Chief Justice, stating that this request of JAAB did not presuppose the filing of the post; it was to facilitate the procedure should a decision be taken to make an appointment at whatever point in the future the vacancy might be progressed.<\/p>  <p>  The only judicial nomination made during the period of Government formation was to the post of President of the High Court.  As this is a senior position and has broader statutory functions it was done.  It should be noted that this appointment on 18 June, a week before the Government was formed, resulted in a second vacancy on the Supreme Court.<\/p>  <p>  It might be helpful to explain that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is an independent board established under the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 to identify persons and inform the Government of the suitability of applicants for appointment to judicial office.  In line with the Cabinet handbook, between 11 and 14 July I informed the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Attorney General of my intention to propose S&eacute;amus Woulfe for the position, following which I brought a memorandum for the consideration of the Government on 15 July, recommending a name to Cabinet for appointment by the President.<\/p>  <p>  In this case, the recommendation was in line with the recommendation of JAAB, which is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes the Presidents of the four other courts, as well as members of the Bar Council and the Law Society and several lay members.  The process through which JAAB recommends applicants for consideration by the Government is set out in Part IV of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, as amended.<\/p> <p>These are the applicants who meet the eligibility criteria for the particular court, as set out in the Courts Act 1961, including, for example, 12 years as a solicitor and a barrister for appointment to the superior courts.  Serving judges are not currently required to apply to JAAB.  It is worth noting that section 18 of the 1995 Act makes specific provision that the board may recommend the Attorney General for appointment to judicial office.  Where the Attorney General wishes to be considered for such appointment, he or she shall withdraw from any deliberations of the board concerning his or her suitability for office.  That is the law.<\/p> <p> In a letter to my predecessor dated 11 March 2020, JAAB advised that it had met on 9 March and decided to recommend one candidate, Mr. S&eacute;amus Woulfe SC, whom it considered suitable for appointment to the Supreme Court.  As requested by the Minister, and as required by the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, JAAB indicated that there was one applicant considered for this post through the JAAB process, namely, Mr. S&eacute;amus Woulfe SC, and there were no other applicants.  Deputies will note from the annual reports of JAAB that this number is in keeping with previous such processes of appointment to the Supreme Court.  There was one applicant in each case for two Supreme Court posts in 2019, one application in 2017 and one in 2015, from persons eligible to apply through JAAB, namely, those who are not currently serving judges.  Under section 20 of the 1995 Act, all proceedings of the board and all communications to the board are confidential.  That is all of the information made available to me by the independent board.<\/p> <p> As I mentioned, the outgoing Government made no judicial appointments other than dealing with the urgent appointment of the President of the High Court.  Following my appointment at the end of June, I was informed by my officials of the vacancy to be filled on the Supreme Court and that the Chief Justice had written to my predecessor on 4 February seeking that the position be filled as soon as possible.  A draft memorandum was submitted to my office on 6 July 2020.  The submission included details of the recommendation that had been made by JAAB, expressions of interest from serving members of the Judiciary and the names of all other judges eligible for the position.  The expressions of interest from serving judges were received over a number of years and retained on file for any current or future vacancy that might arise.  Whether or not existing judges put forward expressions of interest is a confidential matter, for obvious reasons, and it is not the practice to release information that might identify any of those judges.<\/p> <p> The practice in regard to appointments or nominations to positions made by Government is that only one name is brought to Cabinet by the proposing Minister.  This practice is particularly important in the context of judicial appointments, as an open debate on the merits or otherwise of sitting judges, as well as others who have been nominated by JAAB, would amount to a complete politicisation of the judicial appointments process.  One of the very great strengths of the Irish Judiciary has been its non-political character and independence, unlike what we see in many other countries.  It is a solemn duty on the part of the Minister for Justice to propose to Cabinet someone who, in the opinion of the Minister, is the best person for the particular judicial vacancy.  The Government then decides whether to approve the appointment.  That is exactly what happened in this case.<\/p> <p> Turning to the future, it is fair to say that reform of the law relating to judicial appointments has been ongoing for some years.  Under the previous Government, the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 was introduced and debated at great length in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The reforms set out in that legislation arose from a public consultations process on a review of the judicial appointments system in 2014.  While the JAAB process was regarded as an innovation in its day, it was considered timely and worthwhile, almost 20 years on from its establishment, to review its operation and, indeed, the entire judicial appointments system, to ensure that it reflects current best practice.  The need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence was a significant factor in this consultations process.<\/p> <p> The Government has acted appropriately at all times throughout the current process, which we stand over, having adhered to the process and the law.  However, the Government has never believed that the judicial appointments process currently in place is as good as it should be.  That is why we built into our programme for Government an undertaking to bring forward new legislation very quickly to reform the process.  It seems that we can all agree in this House that there is significant room for improvement in the current system.  I am determined to lead that reform and to do so quickly.<\/p> <p> I want to work with all Deputies to make sure the new system is future-proofed in order to meet the very highest standards that we expect in choosing our future Judiciary, including that the members of which have the diverse backgrounds and skills that reflect the society they serve.  I know I can look forward to the support of all Deputies in this crucial task.  I will shortly seek the approval of the Government for a new general scheme of a judicial appointments commission Bill 2020 to provide for the establishment of a new commission to replace JAAB.  This will be reforming legislation and there will be ample opportunity for the House to discuss and debate what it needs to contain.  I intend to lead this reform, make it happen and, above all, make it work in the interests of the independent Judiciary and the public we all serve.  I trust in having Deputies' support to bring that reform about at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600029#CC00300","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606397400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Carthy.<\/p><p>The facts of the matter before us are as follows.  On 27 June, the Minister for Justice took office.  Waiting on her desk when she arrived in the Department were four applications for the job of Supreme Court judge, a massive job carrying a salary, in excess of &euro;220,000, paid for by taxpayers.  The Minister had four applications - not one, as she and other Ministers have tried to make out, but four.  Whether they came from JAAB or via expressions of interest is immaterial.  She had four applications.  On 15 July, she recommended one of those applicants to the Cabinet for appointment to the Supreme Court.  That person just happened to be the previous Attorney General and long-term Fine Gael activist, S&eacute;amus Woulfe.  Four became one.<\/p><p>Any reasonable person would have expected the Minister to come before the D&aacute;il today and set out how those four names were whittled down to one.  She has not done so.  She said that she had no discussions about the applicants or their suitability for office with the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste or any other Minister.  This is not credible in the slightest.  The T&aacute;naiste, who is the Minister's party leader, knew there were other applicants.  In fact, he knew S&eacute;amus Woulfe had applied for the position because he said so to the now Taoiseach and the leader of the Green Party during the negotiations on the programme for Government.  The Minister did not, however, tell the Taoiseach that there were other applicants.  Why was the Fianna F&aacute;il leader kept in the dark in this regard when the Minister's party leader and others were aware that there were additional applicants?<\/p><p>Much of the Minister's story just does not add up.  At a meeting of the justice committee last week, she said in response to a question from me:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... I looked at the recommendation that had been made and other expressions of interest that often come for any of these positions.  Following that I spoke to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Attorney General.  On foot of that, a recommendation was made, and a name was given to Cabinet. <\/blockquote>  <p>I find it absolutely baffling that the names of the applicants and their suitability for appointment would not be discussed at that time by the Minister and the party leaders in government.  The successful applicant was a long-term Fine Gael activist who served as Attorney General in a previous Government.  Yet, there was no disclosure and no discussion in this regard with the Minister's partners in government.  Even if we suppose that the Minister did make this decision on her own, the fact remains that one name out of four was signed off by Cabinet and it is the one the Minister brought to Cabinet.  The other three rejected applicants were all sitting judges and, presumably, experienced and very well qualified if they were applying for such an eminent position.  However, S&eacute;amus Woulfe, the long-term activist, is the name that miraculously made its way to Cabinet.<\/p><p>I have heard the Minister say that she looked at the four names and made her decision.  On what basis did she evaluate the applicants?  What motivated her decision to bring to Cabinet the name that she did?  Was it the individual's experience?  Was it his reputation in dealing with complex cases?  What were the criteria applied in respect of this appointment to the highest court in the land?  What the Minister is telling us simply does not stack up.  She told RT&Eacute; last Friday evening that she took a number of weeks to consider the appointment.  However, in response to a parliamentary question, she said that she did not receive the memorandum with the details of persons applying for the post until 6 July.  According to the same response, she started to speak with party leaders on 11 July, with whom she says she did not discuss the issues of suitability or experience.  The consideration she gave to the matter took days, then, not weeks.  None of this stacks up and that is why we are here today.<\/p><p>This appointment was a done deal.  A Fine Gael-supporting Attorney General was on his way out and Fine Gael needed to find a job for him.  He was one of Leo's cronies and that is the Fine Gael way of doing business.  The Minister did it and Fianna F&aacute;il went along with it.  The Green Party, God help it, did not know what to say or where to look.  This was a Fine Gael appointment.  It was boxed off long before the Minister ever took office and she signed off on it.  That is the reality and it is why we are here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600030#DD00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1606397400,"counter":323,"content":"<p>As Deputy Martin Kenny said, we are here today because Fine Gael in government has a problem in regard to cronyism.  It has a problem of doing favours with insiders.  It has a big problem with being held to account when caught out.  This is the second time in three weeks that a Fine Gael member of Government has had to come before the D&aacute;il to answer questions about his or her conduct.  First up was the T&aacute;naiste and Fine Gael leader to answer for leaking confidential information to his political ally when he was Taoiseach.  Now, the Fine Gael Minister for Justice is before us regarding the highly questionable manner in which the former Attorney General and Fine Gael supporter, S&eacute;amus Woulfe, was appointed to the Supreme Court.  Both cases stink to the high heavens.  Both the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Justice had to be dragged into the D&aacute;il kicking and screaming.<\/p> <p>Why did that happen?  Fine Gael does not do accountability.  However, it does arrogance, in spades.  Whether it is the former Minister of State, Brian Hayes, seamlessly moving to become the champion of the banks and the vultures, or another Fine Gael former Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy, moving straight into a cushy job as a lobbyist for high finance, time and again we see the arrogance of the Fine Gael old boys' network at work.  This arrogance is not without consequence.  The behaviour exposes all that is rotten in Irish politics - favours for friends, cronyism and insider deals.  Who pays for it?  The ordinary people pay.  It is the people looking for a home or waiting for a hospital bed, families struggling with mortgages or insurance costs and workers looking for decent jobs and wages.  Instead of focusing on what is best for our people, Fine Gael each time focuses on what is best for its friends in high places.  People go without so Fine Gael's friends can have it all.  Fine Gael arrogance is at the centre of this controversy.<br\/><br\/>The Minister insulted the D&aacute;il for weeks by resisting calls to come to the D&aacute;il and answer questions.  Now, she is insulting people's intelligence by offering implausible scenarios.  The truth is that this judicial appointment was an old-fashioned political stroke.  It is as simple as that.  Instead of bringing clarity, the Minister has sought to muddy the waters in the hope that people will just tire of the matter.  I hate to break it to Members, but that is not going to work.  Everyone knows that this was a shady deal and that it stinks.  They know what it looks like when people in power box off a job for their political friend, because they have seen it all previously.  The reason this process appears to be all over the place is that there was no process.  The dogs in the street know that.  The reason the Minister cannot explain properly how she whittled four names down to one is that she did not.  It was not even as crass as saying &quot;eeny, meeny, miny, moe&quot;; it was saying &quot;eeny, eeny, eeny, Woulfe&quot;.<br\/><br\/>This deal had been done before Deputy McEntee became Minister for Justice.  The appointment was not even decided in the Department of Justice.  It was decided in Fine Gael.  Everybody knows that it was a done deal.  Fine Gael is now trying to take the people for fools, just as it took the Taoiseach for a fool and kept him in the dark about an appointment to the highest court in the land.  So determined was Fine Gael to get its man through, it ran rings around the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, to ensure it happened.  It is not often I agree with a member of Fianna F&aacute;il and it is rare for me to agree with Dermot Ahern.  However, the former Minister for Justice was bang on point when he wrote:<\/p><blockquote>\tIt now seems that leading Fine Gael members pulled a fast one by rushing to fill the Supreme Court vacancy with their own former attorney general.  Incoming Taoiseach Miche&aacute;l Martin should have smelled a rat.  He's long enough around. <\/blockquote> <p>Fine Gael wiped Miche&aacute;l's eye by rewarding a loyal friend with a highly paid and very powerful job.  For all the talk of new politics from Fine Gael, we are being dragged back to the old days and the old ways.  It is the culture of arrogance so typical of Fine Gael that ensures that Governments come and go, but nothing changes.<br\/><br\/>People are sick to their back teeth of it.  They are sick of the political strokes, the who-one-knows manoeuvring and Fine Gael cronyism.  They are determined that the days of the old boys' network and insider backroom deals are well and truly numbered.  The Minister had an opportunity to come clean and confirm what everybody knows.  It is deeply regrettable and disappointing that she did not take that opportunity.  She was a party to a Fine Gael old boys' club political stroke.  That is the long and the short of it.  She should come clean.  She will have a further opportunity to do that during the questions and answers, and I urge her to take it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600030#DD00300","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606398000,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome today's exercise in proper political accountability.  It is one of the core functions of the House to hold the Executive to account for all its actions.  I have been privileged to serve in three coalition Governments, two of which were coalitions with Fine Gael.  In each Government, all senior Government appointments were subject to cross-party agreement after detailed discussions about all available and suitable candidates.  Few appointments received greater scrutiny than the appointment of senior judges, so much so that one Government fell in 1994 on the basis of a lack of cross-party agreement.<\/p>  <p>  While it is correct that the Minister for Justice proposes one name to the Government for appointment, it was never the sole or exclusive right of that Minister to determine alone who should be nominated.  The names of all suitable candidates were circulated to, and considered by, the leaders of each party in the Government.  Detailed papers were presented to each leader and they eventually arrived at a consensus.  As I understand it, the Minister's position is that this process was set aside, that she alone made the decision and then presented it to the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, as a done deal and that they, their advisers and party managers simply nodded through her personal choice.  I believe I am presenting her position fairly.<\/p>  <p>  After a decade of experience in three Governments, I consider that an absurd position.  To get listed on the Cabinet agenda, a memorandum has to go through a vetting process involving all party leaders involved in the Government and especially the Taoiseach.  Presumably, the Minister's officials prepared the memorandum for the Government.  She said in her contribution today that she received a draft memorandum in her office on 6 July.  Surely she was advised that the previous Government, led by Deputy Varadkar, had established a non-statutory advisory group outside of the JAAB to assist with identifying eligible and qualified persons suitable for appointment as senior judges.  That committee was served by a secretary who was a representative of the Department of the Taoiseach.  Was the Minister aware that this advisory committee recommended a number of persons to be considered for judicial office?  Did she have regard to the recommendations of this advisory committee in making her choice of who to propose to the Government to be nominated to the Supreme Court?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister stated previously that she brought a memorandum to the Cabinet proposing a judicial appointment to the Supreme Court, and that the memorandum contained only one name.  The Taoiseach has also suggested that her memorandum did not contain the information that three sitting judges had expressed an interest in the position, although she told the House today that the draft memorandum included details of the recommendations made by the JAAB, expressions of interest of serving members of the Judiciary and all other judges eligible for the position.  Was that detail included in her final memorandum, as it was in the draft?  In either case, how is it that the Taoiseach was unaware of the others?  Did the Minister check if not listing the names was normal practice?  Did she examine the most recent judicial appointment memorandum brought forward only weeks before by her predecessor to check what was normal practice and if it was appropriate to list all eligible candidates for the information of the Government?<\/p>  <p>  Section 3.2(c) of the Cabinet Handbook states that every memorandum for the Government should \"ensure that all relevant considerations are brought to the attention of the Government in making a decision, that information provided is complete and accurate and that any qualifications are clearly stated\".  Does the Minister believe she fulfilled the requirement of the Cabinet Handbook in this instance?<\/p> <p>If it was the case that political agreement had been reached between the Government parties that the outgoing Attorney General should be appointed to the Supreme Court, I believe that would be both legal and constitutional.  In deference to you, a Cheann Comhairle, I will simply say, however, that it certainly would not be best practice.  If it was the case that the Minister was simply left with a <i>fait accompli<\/i>on arriving into ministerial office, that there was already a political agreement about who should fill this vacancy, that would be politically understood, if not accepted or agreed with.<br\/><br\/>What is undermining the Minister's position and the credibility of the Government is the maintenance of the unbelievable, that she or any Minister for Justice, experienced or not, whether she was three weeks in the job or five years in the job, would take it upon herself to appoint the outgoing Attorney General to the Supreme Court in preference to all other applicants, including senior serving members of the Judiciary, without discussing the implications of that action with the leader of her party and the leaders of the other parties in government and, especially, for constitutional reasons, with the Taoiseach of day.  I also question that any self-respecting party in government would simply exclude itself or allow itself to be excluded from such an important process.  That simply does not bear credibility.  As Richard Nixon discovered, it is not always the action that is one's undoing, sometimes it is the strain involved in presenting a version of events which, to anybody who actually knows the process or simply follows politics or history, is not credible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600031#EE00200","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606398600,"counter":327,"content":"<p>The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land.  It is essential that those who are appointed to it come through a rigorous process in order that any vacancies are filled by those most qualified to do the job.  That is why process is important.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, otherwise known as JAAB, is a vetting process.  It is all about considering if a barrister or solicitor has the skill set to make a good judge.  Once JAAB establishes if an applicant or applicants meet that criterion, the name or names of those applicants go on a list and they are deemed to be eligible to be appointed.  That is very important.  This is not a recommendation to appoint.  The Minister should not keep saying that it is.  As we know, judges do not apply through this process.  I presume that is because they already do the job.  They have a track record of doing the job, so they do not have to be vetted for their ability to do a job they are already doing.  Judges apply directly to the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General, both of whom know the names of those who apply through this route.<\/p><p>I listened very carefully to what the Minister had to say in her interview on &quot;Six One&quot;.  She said that, following her appointment to the justice portfolio in June, she looked at the JAAB recommendation &ndash; I underline the use of the word &quot;recommendation&quot; again - and other expressions of interest.  I note the Minister keeps calling it a recommendation.  Why is she doing that?  That is a cover.<\/p><p>Following that, she told us that she spoke to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Attorney General.  We know she did not tell them that some judges specifically applied for this vacancy.  She said a recommendation was made after this discussion and a name was given to Cabinet.  She said that only one name is ever given to Cabinet.  That does not mean that the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and other coalition party leaders would not be fully briefed on who applied and the process used to establish who is the best fit for the job.  The Minister said in the interview: &quot;Considering Justice Woulfe's name was delivered through the JAAB, that is the name that was given to Cabinet.&quot;  That is a direct quote from the Minister.  She emphasised that S&eacute;amus Woulfe's name came through an official process which was chaired by the Chief Justice himself, giving the impression that this was a recommendation.  JAAB was the only official process in all of this but, as I keep saying, it is a vetting process not a recommendation to appoint.  However, that process has become superior to any informal application process, through which those with judicial experience apply.<\/p><p>The Minister was appointed as Minister for Justice on 27 June 2020.  I want to concentrate on a few things that happened before that date.  On the Order of Business on 17 November, the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI and the Leader of the Green Party, Deputy Eamon Ryan, prior to the formation of the Government, were told that Mr. Justice Woulfe ... The bottom line is very simple and very straightforward.  We were simply told that Mr. Justice Woulfe would come through the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  That is it.  As far as I am concerned, he came through the board and was recommended as being suitable for the position.  He was an outgoing Attorney General and, in my view, was qualified for the position.  In the aftermath of the formation of the Government, as Taoiseach I had no difficulty with the Minister for Justice bringing his name forward.  I had no difficulty in supporting that nomination. <\/blockquote>  <p>On 19 November, the T&aacute;naiste said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am pretty sure it was the week before the new Government was formed that the party leaders discussed whether S&eacute;amus Woulfe would be reappointed as Attorney General or whether there would be a new Attorney General.  We decided collectively that there would be a new Attorney General and that S&eacute;amus Woulfe would not be reappointed as Attorney General and at that point, for transparency and information, I informed the other leaders that there was a vacancy, that S&eacute;amus Woulfe had been recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, as suitable for that vacancy, and that was the end of the conversation. <\/blockquote>  <p>In a nutshell, the Taoiseach told us the decision was made in advance of Deputy McEntee being appointed as Minister for Justice.  He said that because S&eacute;amus Woulfe was the outgoing Attorney General and came through JAAB process, he would get the job.  The T&aacute;naiste pretty much said the same.  It is as simple as that.  The decision was made.  There was only one name considered.  The other CVs did not need to be considered.  Judicial experience did not matter.  That is what a political appointment looks like, yet the Minister would have us believe she went off, worked away on this on her own, went through all those eligible for promotion to the Supreme Court, including several judges who applied specifically for the role, and came to the conclusion that the former Attorney General was the best person to fill the vacancy, and that she was completely oblivious to the fact that it was a done deal.  As I pointed out, it is a problem that she is using the cover of JAAB as a recommendation rather than a vetting process.  If I am wrong, the Minister needs to address the following questions.  What criteria did she use to evaluate the applications?  Who else was involved?  What value was put on track record and judicial experience?  When did the Minister become aware that some judges had specifically applied for this job?  I also want to know if the Minister discussed the matter with the T&aacute;naiste, the former Minister for Justice and Equality or the former Attorney General at any point before she brought the name forward.  Was she told who was to get the job?<\/p><p>I want to go back to the Taoiseach.  One thing I find very strange in all of this is that the Taoiseach made such an issue of the importance of judicial experience when he was in opposition in 2017.  This was in the context of the outgoing Attorney General, M&aacute;ire Whelan, being appointed to the Court of Appeal.  His central point was that she lacked any judicial experience, yet there was no issue with a very personalised debate on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  Anyone looking back at that debate will acknowledge that it is very different from today's debate.<\/p> <p>Yet when an appointment was being made to a higher court, the Supreme Court, judicial experience was not a valued criterion for the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste.  The Minister would have us believe that there was a fair and equal consideration of all applicants.  The Minister received a hospital pass and is being put in the firing line.  She is defending the process by which the appointment was made when we all know full well there was no process.<\/p> <p> Just as the Minister has been put in this position, the Opposition has been taken for fools.  The nonsensical suggestion that the Minister would come in and use the normal ministerial Question Time to deal with this was not only an insult but a dangerous precedent.  Those who applied other than through the JAAB process must be questioning what was the point.  I put some questions about this to the Taoiseach in July but they were ruled out of order.  I was told that under Standing Order 44, there was no official responsibility to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for some of the matters I raised relating to the criteria for appointment.<\/p> <p> We need a judicial appointment process that truly reflects the separation of powers.  The Social Democrats are of the view that cannot be done with the involvement of the political strand and there must be total separation, with appropriate checks and balances.  That requires a referendum and we must end this kind of nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600032#FF00200","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606399200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>To be honest I find much of this debate amusing and I am somewhat surprised we are having it.  We are having it nonetheless.  One of the most amusing statements today came from the Minister, who said the great strength of the Judiciary is its non-political character.  I was in knots of laughter when I heard that comment.<\/p>  <p>  In essence, many Deputies are expressing outrage that the Government used a vacancy on the Supreme Court to appoint a politically connected person because that person was politically connected rather than because he was the best or most suitable person for the job.  I have a newsflash; all our top judges are, effectively, political appointees.  When Fianna F&aacute;il is in government, we get judges with Fianna F&aacute;il connections; when Fine Gael is in government, we get judges with Fine Gael connections; and the odd time, if Labour is the extra wheel, we might get one of their mates.  This time we have Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in government and Fine Gael got to appoint the judge.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the outrage expressed is because this is a glaring example of a political appointment, as opposed to the more normal and subtle way of appointing judges via the old boys' network.  Is the outrage because the person appointed was not a barrister?  The normal route to the court is through a judicial system dominated by a very small and self-perpetuating elite.  The judicial system and barristers are drawn from a small pool, largely controlled by the Honourable Society of King's Inns, set up by none other than Henry VIII to ensure controlled access to the Bar, and initially to keep out Catholics.  This is the only place where somebody can become a barrister.  Judges are not exclusively but are overwhelmingly barristers.  The Honourable Society of King's Inns is the only place that trains barristers but there is no statutory basis for this in any law made democratically by us.  It owes its origins to Henry VIII and was set up to ensure that a small, well vetted elite controlled who could become a barrister or who would be kept out.  It is still doing that.<\/p>  <p>  Inside the Honourable Society of King's Inns there is another secret society, known as the benchers.  There is an inner bench and outer bench.  Anybody who is made a judge automatically becomes a member of the benchers.  They have secret dinners about which nobody finds out.  These happen regularly.  I wonder if some of the outrage is caused by the fact that S&eacute;amus Woulfe was not even a bencher.<\/p>  <p>  The idea now is the Minister for Justice has appointed a candidate because he was a Fine Gael activist.  We are now in for a bigger shock, so we should get the smelling salts ready.  Here is another newsflash.  There is no such thing, in reality, as the separation of powers.  We have a political system dominated by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, with a splash of Labour and this time around the Greens have been thrown in.  We have a judicial system dominated by the friends of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, with the odd Labour appointee.  In expressing outrage about such a fiasco, I say to the other party leaders, including Deputies Mary Lou McDonald, Alan Kelly and Catherine Murphy, that next week they will have a chance to demonstrate outrage by supporting the motion tabled in the name of People Before Profit by Deputy Paul Murphy to remove S&eacute;amus Woulfe for stated misbehaviour.  Those Deputies can demonstrate that we are serious about the separation of powers and democracy.  Just as important, we are serious about demonstrating that we recognise the major sacrifices of the Irish people over the past nine months in abiding by public health guidelines.  It would show that these guidelines were not made just for the little people but were also made for the great and the good, whether they came from the benchers club or not.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Minister aware that S&eacute;amus Woulfe is a former branch secretary of Fine Gael in Dublin Bay North?  Is she aware that Mr. Justice George Birmingham, who sat on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, which recommended S&eacute;amus Woulfe, was a former Fine Gael Minister of State?  Is she aware that S&eacute;amus Woulfe sat on a previous JAAB that recommended Mr. Justice Birmingham for a position as President of the Court of Appeal?  Does she believe there is a danger of \"you scratch my back and I will scratch yours\"?  Did she know Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, who also sat on JAAB that recommended S&eacute;amus Woulfe, was a former Fine Gael candidate for the Seanad?  The Minister should have found it distasteful that a body with so many Fine Gael connections should itself recommend somebody with a Fine Gael connection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600033#GG00200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1606399200,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I find it quite outrageous, to be honest, that after two weeks of ducking and diving by the Government, in trying to shield the Minister from questioning, we have received a statement that goes on for ten minutes and manages to avoid the central issue about which questions have been raised.  The central issue is, if the Minister's story is accurate, on what basis did she decide that S&eacute;amus Woulfe would be the name she would recommend to the Cabinet?  On what basis did she decide it would be him rather than the other judges on the memorandum before her?  It is astounding that the Minister can manage to speak for ten minutes while avoiding the central matter about which questions have been asked repeatedly.<\/p><p>Everybody knows what this controversy is about.  It is about whether S&eacute;amus Woulfe was a political appointee.  Was there a deal between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il that Fianna F&aacute;il would get the Attorney General if Fine Gael got its former Attorney General on to the Supreme Court?  Did Fine Gael pull a fast one?  Either way, is S&eacute;amus Woulfe now on the Supreme Court because he is close to Fine Gael and was a Fine Gael activist?  That is the central question.<\/p><p>The dogs in the street are in no doubt about the answer to that question.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy implied, in a way the T&aacute;naiste gave the game away in speaking in the D&aacute;il on 19 November, pointing towards the truth of the arrangements that had taken place.  For those outside who see it as glaringly obvious that this is a political appointee, there are very good reasons for such thinking.  In 2011, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>did a survey of judges, finding one in three has personal or political connections to political parties.  That is wildly disproportionate to what happens in society at large.  We do not have that kind of mass participation, where one in three people in society is a member of a political party.<\/p><p>It should be noted, of course, that we will not find judges that are personally and politically connected to parties of the socialist left.  It is overwhelmingly the case they are connected to Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, the traditional establishment parties of Irish capitalism that are wildly over-represented within the Judiciary.  It is perfectly normal, as Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has mentioned, to have political appointees, unfortunately.<\/p><p>The story presented by the Minister is not at all credible but let us take it on its merits.  We will have a chance to ask questions and, I hope, get some answers on it shortly.  The Minister described a timeline.<\/p> <p>On 29 June, she is appointed as Minister.  On 6 July, she gets a memorandum, which includes the name of S&eacute;amus Woulfe but also includes, importantly, other names.  On 15 July, she brings a memorandum to Cabinet and a recommendation, with the other names stripped out and S&eacute;amus Woulfe's name alone remaining.  That is the essential part of the Minister's narrative and, crucially, apparently between 6 July and 15 July, or earlier if she knew earlier, the newly-appointed Minister, who was two weeks in the job at that stage, does not talk to a sinner about it.  She does not talk to the T&aacute;naiste and her party leader, to the Taoiseach or to the leader of the Green Party, although that might not surprise people.  She does not talk to the Attorney General, the Secretary General of her Department or to a sinner.  Instead, she looks deep inside her heart and decides, \"Yes, this one\".  S&eacute;amus Woulfe is the man for the job as opposed to all these other people.  It is very blatantly and very obviously not credible at all.  It very clearly is not what took place.  <\/p> <p> There is a question that flows from that.  If it is the case that on 6 July the Minister got a memorandum with a number of names, chose to strip out names and leave one remaining and bring that to Cabinet and the Government decided to appoint S&eacute;amus Woulfe as a Supreme Court judge, on what basis can it be said that the Government met and acted as a collective authority?  Article 28.4.2&deg; of the Constitution is clear that the \"Government shall meet and act as a collective authority\".  Never mind bringing the names, did the Minister even inform the Cabinet that there were a number of possible options?  Did the Minister bring that information to Cabinet?  It cannot have acted collectively if it did not know that there were other applications and thought there was only one from S&eacute;amus Woulfe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600033#GG00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606399800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>Everybody listening to this debate at home will be familiar with the recruitment process for a job and most will have been through some type of recruitment process in their own work.  Everybody understands that a recruitment process should be fair, open and transparent and that the person with the best knowledge, experience, character and skill should be selected for the job.  We live in a meritocracy and merit is the basis for the selection for any position in this country.  That should apply from the bottom of society to the very top.  It is not rocket science.  It is a basic standard that people demand in their own working lives.  For the applicant, it ensures fairness and for the recruiter, it ensures that the best person is selected for the job.<\/p>  <p>  Let us look now at how this country works.  For far too long in Ireland people got jobs on the basis of who they know and not what they know.  The establishment parties have, for years, divvied up jobs on the basis of party affiliation.  When I was a kid, if a person wanted a job with Telecom &Eacute;ireann, he or she went to the local Fianna F&aacute;il councillor and got the job.  That culture is still alive and well.  I know of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael politicians who still make representations on behalf of their supporters for State jobs.  We also saw how the inner circle functions a couple of weeks ago when we learned that the T&aacute;naiste leaked a confidential, not-for-circulation document to his friend.  People recognise this culture as part of who Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are and they recognise the gross injustice of it as well.  <\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste have hidden behind a smoke screen that they call the separation of powers.  Surely the biggest threat to the separation of powers is a culture that allows for party affiliates to be fast-tracked for appointment as judges.  If we want to really separate the Oireachtas from the Judiciary, we need to separate the selection of individuals from the party system.  The majority of Attorneys General in the history of this State have been made senior judges.  A full 16 of 31 Attorneys General have been appointed to senior positions ranging from the Court of Appeal all the way up to the Supreme Court.  Furthermore, a number of Attorneys General were offered posts as judges but refused them for personal reasons.  There is conveyor belt system in the appointment process.  Judges at all levels have been party members, speech writers, candidates, Deputies, Ministers as well as close friends or siblings of politicians.  It is not just Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael who have been involved in this practice.  The Labour Party has also been an eager participant in the system over the years.  <\/p>  <p>  What is the remedy for this situation?  The remedy is transparency.  We must have a clear and transparent process for recruitment to the most important jobs in the land.  A second remedy Ministers and Governments being willing and open to answer questions on the process itself.  Incredibly, most Irish people know more about the US process for the selection of a judge to the Supreme Court than the Irish process.  I have heard Ministers being asked on radio shows about the process of selecting judges for the Supreme Court of this land.  They shrugged and were not even able to answer the questions.  Why does the process of selecting judges in this country have to be more opaque than the third secret of Fatima? It is because it suits the political establishment to do things behind closed doors and not to have an open, transparent process.  <\/p>  <p>  Over the course of three weeks, the Minister had to make a choice as to who would be the next judge of the Supreme Court.  It is interesting that in all of the speeches and radio interviews she has given, she has focused on one list only.  However, there are two other lists relevant to choosing candidates for the Supreme Court.  One is a list of those who are eligible for promotion to the Supreme Court but I have never heard the Minister mention that particular list.  The other is the list of those who are interested in appointment to the Supreme Court and ,again, there is a lack of detail on that.  Both of those lists are held by the Attorney General.  Did the Attorney General give the Minister these lists and if so, when?  Is it plausible that the Attorney General would not have, at some level, discussed these lists with the Taoiseach, the man who appointed him to his position?<\/p>  <p>  We need to know many things about this process.  In the three weeks that the Minister had to select a judge, did she work out the existing experience or skills gaps on the Supreme Court?  If so, how did she do that?  Did she go through the volumes of published judgments from existing judges?  Did she do this by herself or did she have a team to do it?  Did the team produce a shortlist for the Minister?  Did she interview any of the applicants?  Did any of the applicants or a third party make a presentation to her on the skills set of each nominee or each individual available for the job?  Why did she select the candidate with the least amount of court experience of all of the individuals interested in the job?  It is very hard to believe that the Minister would go through all of this process and never mention the names of the other candidates to the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste.  Does anybody think it is credible that in a system that is already knee-high in political horse trading, the Minister did not at any stage speak to her political bosses about the applicants for the job?  If she did not speak to the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste three weeks into her role, who did she get advice from?  <\/p>  <p>  Most people listening to this debate will understand what everyone in here understands, namely that the decision was already made and that the process was separate from the particular decision.  Have any of the people who applied for the role been in contact with the Minister since?  Is there a process open to them whereby they can articulate their discomfort with the fact that they have been overlooked in this process?  <\/p>  <p>  We need to have confidence in the Judiciary.  <\/p> <p>In all research published in this country, people's confidence in the Judiciary has been rated very highly.  These questions are not designed to impugn the name of the judges but rather to focus on the process.  The truth is that the lack of transparency associated with this process has done significant damage.  I have been a Deputy for ten years now and I note that the standard response when Ministers get into trouble is to claim that they did everything right with regard to the process only to have it magically revealed to them that the process was wrong before saying that they will do the best they can to fix the issue in question.  That is horse manure.  If the Opposition did not seek to flood this issue with the light of transparency, you can bet your bottom dollar that it would be a case of business as usual for this Government.  This is the equivalent of a child being found with his hand in the cookie chair before telling his mother that it was her fault for leaving the jar too low.<\/p> <p> Politicians and political parties are forever calling for political reform.  I have to laugh at that because the most obvious place in which to reform politics is within those parties.  It is for political parties to resist doing things that are obviously wrong, such as the actions in question today.  Laws and regulations are necessary only when the people concerned do not have the moral compass to do the right thing.  From what we have seen here and in the history of political parties with regard to the selection of judges, that moral compass does not exist.  We need to change the law to make sure that this cannot be done again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600034#HH00200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606400400,"counter":334,"content":"<p>May I just point out that we are now more than an hour into this debate but copies of the Minister's speech have not been circulated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600035#JJ00200","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1606400400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I presume that is being looked after.

He is doing a fine job, as always.  I always find him to be very fair.  This is extraordinary.  The whole timeline in respect of this situation is utterly unsatisfactory and extraordinary.  I am worried and concerned about the people at home looking at, or reading, this debate.  They are under the floor in debt, are living in fear and have anxiety and trauma as a result of what is going on in respect of Covid.  We can look at this side by side with what is going on here and how long it took to get agreement for these questions today, limited as they are.<\/p>  <p>  I will again go over the timeline, which is utterly extraordinary.  In June 2019, Ms Justice Mary Finlay Geoghegan, a Supreme Court judge, retired.  On 14 January 2020, a general election was called.  Also in January 2020, Mr. S&eacute;amus Woulfe applied to JAAB to be considered for the Supreme Court job.  On 4 February, the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, wrote to the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, seeking a judge for the Supreme Court.  On 8 February, the general election was held.  We were all very busy at that time.  On 17 February, the then Minister wrote to JAAB, which is chaired by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Clarke, to ask the board to recommend a candidate for the position of Supreme Court judge.  On 9 March, the board sat under Mr. Justice Clarke and cleared the name of Mr. Woulfe as the only name proposed for the Supreme Court vacancy.  On 11 March, JAAB wrote to the then Minister to inform him that it had cleared the name of Mr. Woulfe.  After a long gap, on 27 June the new Government was formed after all the talks, anxiety, wheeling and dealing, horse trading and anything else that went on.  Those of us in the Rural Independent Group were interested but we were not wanted next, nigh or near the Government.  We have a good idea why that was the case.  The current Minister, Deputy McEntee, then brought the only name proposed by JAAB, that of Mr. Woulfe, to the Cabinet meeting on 15 July.  I believe it was her first Cabinet meeting but I am open to correction on that point.<\/p>  <p>  This is deeply suspicious.  A former Fine Gael Attorney General, Mr. S&eacute;amus Woulfe, applied to JAAB, which is chaired by his old friend, the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, in respect of a Supreme Court vacancy.  This post had been vacant for seven months, which is extraordinary, but suddenly, when Fine Gael faced possibly losing office as a result of the election, Mr. Justice Clarke decided to get moving and set the wheels in motion by writing to the then Fine Gael Minister, Deputy Flanagan, telling him that he needed a judge to be appointed.  The Minister then wrote to JAAB, which is chaired by the former Fine Gael supporter, the same Mr. Justice Clarke, to ask it to convene to consider the vacancy.  The board met in haste and sent Fine Gael supporter, Mr. Woulfe's name back up to the then Minister who decided to sit on the nomination for over three months, or 12 weeks, until the new Government was formed.  He and the new Minister, Deputy McEntee, appear to have binned the other expressions of interest from well-qualified judges.  Deputy Flanagan handed this minefield over to Fine Gael's new Minister for Justice and Equality who took it to Cabinet.  It is absolutely crystal clear that the current Minister did not make this decision alone.  She was probably absolutely innocent in doing the party's work, which one can call what one likes but it begins with a \"d\".  It is shocking.<\/p>  <p>  What process was followed in respect of the other judges appointed on the very same day as Mr. S&eacute;amus Woulfe, now Mr. Justice Woulfe?  From where did the Minister get her advice on these other appointments?  Did she consult the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, the Green Party leader, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, or the previous Minister, Deputy Flanagan with regard to these appointments?  Did she speak to Deputy Flanagan, who is now a backbencher, about the appointment of Ms Mary Morrissey to the Circuit Court?  Did she know that Judge Morrissey had once worked in Deputy Flanagan's firm?  I do not have great eyesight and I have to wear glasses but a blind man could see what is going on here.  There are none so blind as those who cannot see at all.  This stinks to high heaven.  It is extremely sad.<\/p>  <p>  As I assured the Taoiseach on the day we met, the Rural Independent Group has no interest in engaging in a witch hunt with regard to Mr. Justice S&eacute;amus Woulfe or in pursuing the impeachment process.  There are no grounds for it.  We could not do it even if we wanted to.  I will be very clear that our group will not support such an action.  We do, however, have to get this sorted.  Would these shenanigans have taken place if the former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, was still in Cabinet?  He lost his seat.  That was unfortunate.  We had many a good row but, nonetheless, he tried gallantly to reform this process for decades whether in his writings, in Cabinet, in the Seanad or in the D&aacute;il as an Independent Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  We did get some reform.  We got a judicial conduct committee which is empowered to deal with complaints.  An Act in this regard was debated here and signed into law six, seven or eight months ago by the President.  I believe that  building has been rented for it and that it has a full complement of staff.  All that is needed is a doorman to open the door so that the general public will be able to make complaints.  Why are we waiting until next June for this?  Why is it being delayed?  There are some very sinister reasons behind this which need to be questioned.  I will not put them on record but I know what they are.  Murky business is going on.<\/p>  <p>  We have the separation of powers.  The Ceann Comhairle can stop me if I stray from what it is permitted to say.  There are people in the Four Courts today.  The courts are not meant to be sitting to hear cases relating to evictions but they have been sitting right throughout the pandemic and through both lockdowns.  There is supposed to be a moratorium on banks evicting people but people are being evicted from their homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600035#JJ01000","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1606400400,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I advise the Deputy not to go there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600035#JJ01100","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1606400400,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I am not going there; I am just saying what is going on.

We know this; we have seen it.  In addition, unregulated thugs are going around the country.  Some have been brought before the courts and fined for carrying on like the heavy gang.  Some of these are mercenaries from other countries who have murky pasts.  The regulation agency is in Tipperary.  I have made complaints to it and have met members of its staff.  Indeed, the chairman came up to the D&aacute;il to meet Deputy Michael Collins, Deputy Nolan and me to discuss the situation but it still goes on.  We are supposed to represent the people.  We have a constitutional right to defend the people, not to persecute them and to drive them into oblivion.  The British did that to us for generations and over centuries.<\/p>  <p>  We commemorated Bloody Sunday last week.<\/p> <p>We were proud in Tipperary to get out on that field, albeit in Cork, and win.  That is the spirit of that jersey and the people who fought for this country.  I am talking about &Oacute; Treasaigh, Breen and Michael Hogan.  Those people spilled their blood, as did countless others.  What kind of a democracy did we get?  We looked for it and fought for it.  What have we got?

The House has heard me refer to how this has crept back into the Business Committee.

I will not be censored or controlled by Fine Gael.<\/p> <p> The sad part about it is that we have a Taoiseach who was so behoven and craven to get that job.  He got his prize.  It is like he has got his first communion or leaving certificate or whatever.  Whatever happens, it will not get in the way of him losing his job.  He knows, with fear and terror, that the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is riding high in the polls.  If the Taoiseach trips up, they will dump him over.  We will have an election and he will be gone and that prize will be taken away from him.  It was much sought after.  He had been looking for it for 25 years and he got it.  He kicked out his own Ministers, Deputies Barry Cowen and Dara Calleary, and saved the Fine Gael skins.  We saw it two weeks ago with the former Taoiseach, and now T&aacute;naiste, answering questions.  We will see it here again today.  Yet, the Fianna F&aacute;il people can be sacrificed.  It is a proud party.  My father was a founding member.  They are being sacrificed to the wolves for the sake of naked greed, power and luxury.<\/p> <p> We see it every day here the disdain when we ask questions about what is going on.  We cannot get information or the figures and data on Covid counts.  We cannot get the science.  The Taoiseach will be protected no matter what happens.  God, if a tsunami came, one he could swim over, he would stay and keep his head above it and to hell with the Croppies - they could lie down.  They forget the country and the people who fought for Ireland.  They forget the families struggling today.  They forget the workers trying to carry on and eke out a living.  Then there is big business and the banks, insurance companies and the bands of vultures who are carrying on the murky, dirty, messy work of sucking the lifeblood out of the fighting spirit of the Irish.<\/p> <p> I put a call out for the fighting spirit of the Irish to rise up and not take this disgraceful behaviour.  It is pathetic.  In the spirit of C.J. Kickham from Mullinahone, I will not take it or accept it.  That is the spirit of the McInerney family from Cashel and many others.  T.J. McInerney was fighting there.  The ballot box will change all this soon.  We thought we got it the last time but we did not.  They have control.  The fingers are on the handlebars of power.

I had read the Standards in Public Office Commission reports.  I asked myself why we must rely on the Opposition to bring changes.  Fair play to Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward that Bill.  SIPO has told us repeatedly what changes were needed, yet in January of this year the former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform told us no changes were necessary.  It has taken all the scandals to date and the revolving door, plus the initiative from Sinn F&eacute;in, to force some type of change.  Even then, the Government said it needed nine months.<\/p><p>It is similar with this.  Why do I mention it?  It is because I looked back.  I thank some parts of the media for their work on this story.  Without them, we would have little information.  Certainly, we would have none if we were reliant on the Government.  The Government has told us it has done nothing wrong and has complied with the procedures.  The procedures have been totally opaque because no one knows how they work.<\/p><p>Let us consider the words of the former Chief Justice, Ms Susan Denham, who retired in 2017.  She said many interesting things in her farewell speech.  She talked about the lacunae and the necessity for change.  She said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThis lacuna is so in spite of many years of discussions on the topic.  I first discussed the matter with the minister for justice, Nora Owen, in 1997... <\/blockquote>  <p>She referred to what was needed in terms of legislation, training for judges, a more transparent system for appointments and so on.  She also referred to the Council of Europe and GRECO, which has been referred to many times.  In 2014, she referred to a 2007 GRECO report that made five recommendations, namely, that a judicial council be established; that the system for appointing judges be reviewed; that a special pay and conditions body be established for the Judiciary; that a code of conduct for judges be formally established; and that a dedicated training institution for judges be established.  She said in 2017 that, notwithstanding the fact that those recommendations had been made by the Council of Europe or a body acting under its aegis, not one recommendation had been acted upon.  This was the Judiciary asking for change.  GRECO has continued to publish interim compliance reports and other reports and it is still unhappy with the rate of change in Ireland.<\/p><p>I disagree with the comments of Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, although mostly I agree with her.  I believe it is remarkable that the Judiciary has been independent.  Indeed, I remember Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy, now deceased.  He stands out.  He tried to hold the Government to account in respect of the amendment to the Constitution relating to abortion.  The former Justice, Mr. Peter Kelly, also stands out among many other judges.  I am not here to make any apology for judges but their independence is remarkable.  In my moments of despair with this institution, the Health Service Executive and many other institutions, the Judiciary stands out for me as the last bastion for an ordinary person on occasions.  The greatest problem of course is that most people do not have access to the courts because the process is far too expensive.  I wish that is what we were talking about today.<\/p><p>I would call the Minister's speech today disjunctive.  I do not believe the paragraphs follow from each other and I believe the Minister is in a difficult position.  I believe the Taoiseach should be before the House answering these questions today and setting out what has happened.  He was well able to speak on the last occasion Fine Gael and the Labour Party allowed the then Attorney General to go to the Court of Appeal.  He called it an insider job that stank to the high heavens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600036#KK00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1606401000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>We were not in government at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600036#KK00400","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1606401000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I take that back.  At the point when it went up, his comment was that it stank to the high heavens.<\/p><p>I am not here to score political points.  I am here to outline is that each Government has absolutely failed to learn that we need to change the process for appointing judges so that it is not opaque.  I will stay with Ms Justice Denham for the moment.  In paying tribute to the media, she said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI would like to thank the journalists who have reported on the work of the Supreme Court during my tenure as a judge of the court, and as Chief Justice.  For the rule of law to flourish in a democracy, an understanding and knowledge of what happens in our court is required. <\/blockquote>  <p>The last sentence is significant.  I would add to it by saying that for democracy to flourish, what we need is a knowledge of how institutions work, in particular governments and the Executive and how they appoint judges.  It seems to me that there is no openness and accountability in the Minister's speech today or in the manner in which the former Attorney General was made a justice of the Supreme Court.  I have no wish to comment on the merits or otherwise of that appointment.  I am commenting on the process.  It seems to me extraordinary that one of the paragraphs in the Minister's speech refers to the fact that it was practice to leave a Supreme Court vacancy.<\/p> <p>I find that extraordinary given that the Chief Justice wrote in February of urgently making the appointment.<\/p> <p> We seem to have many parallel systems of appointment.  We must remember that back in 1995 the Act was brought in to bring some measure of reform to the appointments system.  The JAAB process, through which the former Attorney General went, was one route.  We also then had judges who were interested, and they send their expressions of interest through the Attorney General or the Minister for Justice.  The Minister has not clarified whether it is the Minister for Justice who receives those expressions of interest from the sitting judges or the Attorney General.  If it is the Attorney General, has anybody asked if there is a conflict of interest when, on the one hand, a sitting Attorney General wants to become a Supreme Court justice while, on the other, he has the applications from the sitting judges who are interested in the position?  Has anyone thought about that or how that conflict is handled, if there is one?  To me, it has all the appearances of a conflict of interest.  The Minister has not dealt with that issue.<\/p> <p> The third system of appointment involves sitting judges who have not come forward but whom the Government is allowed to consider.  What is the procedure for looking at that?  Does it not strike the Minister that this is not an open and accountable system in a republic and a democracy?  We cannot call ourselves a republic and a functioning democracy if we do not have an open system.<\/p> <p> Following the debacle of the previous Attorney General being appointed to the Supreme Court - again, I am making no comment on the person concerned but commenting only on what happened following that appointment, and Deputy Howlin has referred to this - I understand a review was carried out by Martin Fraser.  Following that review, a committee was set up, parallel with the JAAB made up of the Chief Justice, a layperson and other distinguished people.  We are not aware of who was appointed, how they were appointed or how the committee functioned.  It appears, however, to have functioned well and to have been instrumental in appointing a number of applicants to the higher courts.  Where did that system go?  Was the Minister told about it?<\/p> <p> That committee is the fourth part of the jigsaw.  The four parts are the JAAB; the notices which go straight to the Attorney General or the Minister, a matter that nobody has clarified; the sitting judges who the Government can pick; and this advisory committee which was set up following the previous debacle and in relation to which the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, said it stank to high heaven.  What happened to that set-up?  It would be helpful if that was outlined to us today.  It would be helpful if the Minister stated the Government could no longer stand over this system.  This is the way this has always been done but we can no longer go on like that because we are in trouble in Europe.  We are pointing the finger at other countries, and rightly so, but we need to look in the mirror first.  We must look at what the Council of Europe, through its organisation, GRECO, has highlighted repeatedly.  <\/p> <p> The irony of all of this is that we do not have a system in place yet regarding complaints about judges' behaviour.  Much of the information we have here is by default because we did not set up a fair and just system for complaints concerning judges, as happened in respect of the former Attorney General, now Supreme Court Justice, S&eacute;amus Woulfe, and his attendance at golfgate.  We had no procedure in place to deal with that matter, so we went back to a former Chief Justice, set up an informal system and a total mess ensued in that regard.  We learned from the openness and accountability of the printed transcript certain facts about how S&eacute;amus Woulfe was appointed.  That is ironic in itself.  I hope it is the start of a stronger light being shone in this area and of reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600036#KK00500","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606401600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Connolly.

I am very grateful to get the Deputy's advice from time to time.  What I think we have heard are some severe political charges.  I do not know if they are necessarily helpful, but so be it.<\/p>  <p>  As we move on to the questioning process, I ask Members to have respect for the parameters within which we must operate.  We must also stick rigidly to the five-minute time limit.  It would also be helpful if Deputies were to indicate whether they intend to have back and forth questions with the Minister or if they intend to group several questions and then leave the Minister time at the end to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600037#LL00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1606401600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>It would be better to have a back-and-forth process, if that is possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600037#LL00300","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1606401600,"counter":355,"content":"<p>That is fine.

That has not been disputed by the Minister or anybody else.  He sat around the Fine Gael Cabinet table for four years.  The Minister took up her role on 27 June.  She got a list of four names on 6 July, including candidates with long judicial experience.  In record time, a matter of days, the Minister whittled that list of four names down to one and that single name went off to the Cabinet.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said nothing really about how that process worked.  She cannot seriously think that people believe this yarn that a process was followed here.  Nobody believes that.  Does the Minister seriously believe that people believe the yarn that this was not a Fine Gael political stitch-up?  That is plainly not the reality.  The Minister must stop fooling people and recognise and admit that there was no process and no evaluation because she has not outlined one, and there could not have been one.  The Minister needs to admit that to her colleagues in this Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600037#LL00500","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1606401600,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I do not think anybody's political persuasion should prevent him or her from being promoted or moving through the ranks of any job, whether for a judicial appointment or not.  I was appointed on 27 June, which was a Saturday.  On Sunday, 28 June, I came into the Department and, as is customary, I was given a huge amount of notes and information.  As part of that information, I was told by my Department that there was a vacancy and a request from the Chief Justice to fill it as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I also found out within those first few days that there was a list from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board because that was already in my office and had been with the previous Minister.  That was obviously made available to me, that there was one name.  When I talked about the document I received on 6 July, that is a pre-document that I sign off on before it goes to Cabinet, so it does change.  In the interim period, from when I was appointed and learned there was a vacancy to when I learned that S&eacute;amus Woulfe had come through the JAAB, I had a conversation, informally, with my colleague and with the T&aacute;naiste.  He informed me that there was a vacancy and that S&eacute;amus Woulfe had come through that process.  I informed him that I was already aware of that.  He also informed me or gave a view, I suppose, that he thought S&eacute;amus Woulfe would be a good judge.  <\/p>  <p>  I did not make a decision then because at that stage I did not have all the other names.  I only received them when I got the e-submission.  That was on 6 July and this matter did not go to Cabinet until 15 July.  There were two subsequent Cabinet meetings in between that time.  What I did, therefore, was not bring it immediately, even though I had been told that this was urgent.  I took time to look at the JAAB recommendation, and it is a recommendation because it states that in the letter and in the relevant section of the legislation referring to JAAB.  I looked at all the names that had come through the expressions of interest process, and then there was obviously a list of sitting judges.  They had not expressed an interest, however, so that was something which is looked at last.  Following that process, I spoke to all the leaders, as I have outlined in the timeframe, and, based on their responses, I made a recommendation.  It is a very clear process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600037#LL00600","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1606401600,"counter":358,"content":"<p>To be clear, the Minister is saying that basically she spoke to one person in Cabinet and that was the T&aacute;naiste in respect of this issue.

The following day I received briefings from my Department, one of which outlined that there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court.  I was asked to fill that as soon as possible.  I was also made aware a JAAB recommendation was already in my private office, which alerted me to the fact that the former Attorney General had come through that process.  Later that week, in discussion with my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, I was informed that the former Attorney General had come through that process.  I told the T&aacute;naiste I was aware of that and he simply said he believed the former Attorney General would make a good judge.  Of course, I took that on board, but at that stage I had not yet received all of the other expressions of interest.  I received those in a draft memorandum on 6 July.  Following receipt of that, I looked at all expressions of interest, the recommendations of the JAAB and the sitting judges eligible for this position.  After several days and two other Cabinet meetings, I spoke to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Attorney General.   I made a recommendation to all four of them.  There were no further questions.

The phenomenon they show is not new.  I would like to quote that gentleman:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am living in St. Patrick's Direct Provision centre in County Monaghan for a long time and sharing a room with 3 persons even during Covid-19 outbreak in this centre.  Last week I got this infection all over my skin, I don't know if it is mould in room or the numerous cockroaches and mice. <\/blockquote>  <p>In the programme for Government we are committed to ensuring that Ireland provides protection to those seeking refuge from conflict, torture and persecution and, in doing so, we agree that direct provision needs to be changed.  We have committed to ending direct provision and ensuring that communities are intrinsically involved with and consulted in the provision of accommodation for those who are fleeing their countries, usually due to war.  <\/p><p>As of 15 November, 228 people were being accommodated at St. Patrick's Accommodation Centre in Monaghan.  Four other premises, hotels and guest houses are used to provide accommodation while a further 183 people are accommodated in temporary accommodation throughout County Monaghan.  A significant number of people are in direct provision in County Monaghan alone.  I have received numerous calls to my office from people questioning the Government's plans for a further direct provision centre in Ballybay.  The Minister's office has said that his Department has no plans for such a development, but it would be most helpful if he could confirm that today. <\/p><p>The Government has committed to the ultimate phasing out of direct provision, which I welcome.  As we know, there is nothing humane about the conditions for those living in these facilities.  In their current state, the facilities do not provide the proper opportunities to integrate with the communities in which residents are living.  Moreover, the local communities are not afforded the proper opportunities to engage with the process, which creates division, suspicion, ill-feeling and separation.  I know the scenario I have outlined is not unique to County Monaghan.  It is replicated in many centres throughout the country.  I would like the Minister to commit to checking on the well-being of the people in St. Patrick's Accommodation Centre.  I would like to hear his plans and those of the Government to phase out direct provision in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600041#PP02100","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1606404600,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter - I know she raised it a number of days ago as well - and for giving me the opportunity to come back and speak directly to the House on the matter.  I am happy to do so.  I am aware of social media reports circulating on this matter, and some Deputies, including Deputy Niamh Smyth, have contacted me directly about these reports.<\/p>  <p>  To set the broader context, all accommodation centres are subject to regular unannounced inspections by both my officials in the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, and an independent inspectorate company, QTS Limited.  These inspections are generally undertaken twice yearly by my officials and once yearly by QTS.  Inspections cover a wide range of issues, including the quality of the food, fire safety and other health and safety issues.  Regular visits are also made to all emergency accommodation centres by IPAS.  Any issues that are brought to the attention of IPAS are raised with the accommodation provider for resolution.<\/p>  <p>  St. Patrick's accommodation centre was inspected by an IPAS official on 24 September and again by QTS on 11 November.  These inspections did not reveal any major issues at the centre.  However, during the second inspection QTS noted that there had been a cockroach infestation in an annexe to one of the buildings used for accommodation.  QTS also noted that the provider had taken the appropriate remedial action and had engaged an exterminator and that the matter was at an end.<\/p>  <p>  In recent days my attention has been drawn to reports that a resident in St. Patrick's was suffering from a medical condition for which he could not access appropriate medical care.  I assure Deputies that, as a rule, access to mainstream medical services through the primary healthcare system is available to all direct provision residents, who have access to medical cards.  I am informed that in this case the gentleman in question had a phone consultation with a doctor, resulting in a treatment option being provided, and that further in-person medical care, located very close to the accommodation centre, is at all stages available to the gentleman to avail of.  I assure the Deputy that I continue to make inquiries to ensure that whatever additional steps are necessary to provide this gentleman with medical care are taken urgently.  I intend to review the inspection reports on this centre and will continue to engage with IPAS on its findings and any recommendations that are specific to the centre.<\/p>  <p>  IPAS has a complaints policy which is widely disseminated in centres.  Complaints are made initially to the centre manager with a view to informal resolution.  If a person is not satisfied with the outcome of his or her complaint, he or she may make a complaint to IPAS, which will investigate the matter and take appropriate action.  As of last year, in the event that the resident is not satisfied with how his or her complaint is dealt with, he or she has full access to the services of both the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children.  Both bodies have been undertaking both individual and collective reports on direct provision.  There is also a confidential freephone support service run by the Jesuit Refugee Service.  It was introduced in May of this year in the context of Covid.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, to address the Deputy's specific question, I confirm that my Department has no plans to utilise any other properties in Monaghan or Cavan not already in use as accommodation for international protection applicants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600042#QQ00100","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1606404600,"counter":469,"content":"<p>That will come as good news to those of us who are concerned for people who are living in inhumane conditions, as the Minister said.  We know from information provided by his Department and the inspections that were carried out that the man in question was not exaggerating.  There was no intent on his part to put out any false information or anything like that.  The Minister has addressed that to some extent.  As for people who find themselves in these situations, where there is a cockroach infestation in a centre, the Minister talked briefly about the health provisions in place.  My understanding is that this gentleman looked to go to Cavan General Hospital but that support was not available to him.  Could the Minister talk to us a little more about the health provisions in place - he has briefly summarised them - for people who find themselves in these situations?<\/p>  <p>  I have checked the number of direct provision centres around the country.  Monaghan seems to have a very high number of direct provision settings and centres, whether temporary or permanent.  Monaghan Integrated Development does terrific work under Gabriel O'Connell in providing support to people.  I think 183 was the figure I gave the Minister for one of the centres; 228 is the figure for St. Patrick's.  Could the Minister talk to us a little about the type of provision the Government is putting in place in terms of resources for the likes of Monaghan Integrated Development to try to help these people to stand on their own two feet and to integrate into the community, with language and education?

My Department makes provision for that.  I do not wish to stray into the specific circumstances of the treatment of one individual - that would not be appropriate - but my Department and my office have been in contact, through IPAS, with the management of the centre in question to ensure that this gentleman gets the appropriate level of medical assistance.  Every person in direct provision should get the appropriate level of medical assistance.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned about the statement that there were four people living in the room.  My understanding is that only 7.5% of residents of direct provision accommodation now live in a room with more than two other unrelated people.  I will double-check that point because what the Deputy says is not the information I have received.  Those measures to reduce the number of people unrelated living together were brought in specifically as a result of Covid.  That involved getting extra centres around the country, and that was the right thing to do during Covid because we wanted to thin the numbers in the existing direct provision centres as we know congregation is a definite Covid risk.  My Department has received a substantial additional allocation for 2021 to support direct provision.  One of the things we will do is to support these \"friends of the centre\" networks that have built up around the country.  The Deputy referred to some of the local voluntary activity taking place in Monaghan.  These centres are established in direct provision centres around the country, and I really want to support them because that gets the voluntary sector and the NGOs in to provide those additional supports.  I have mentioned the Jesuit Refugee Service, which does huge work around the country in providing additional supports, particularly to those who are perhaps our most vulnerable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600042#QQ00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1606404600,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Will the Minister confirm whether inspections have continued during the Covid period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600042#QQ00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1606404600,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I will allow the Minister a further brief response but there is no provision for him to come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600042#QQ00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1606404600,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Yes, inspections have continued during Covid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600042#QQ00600","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","time":1606404600,"counter":474,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600042#QQ00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1606404600,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Four Deputies have put their names to this matter.

EU legislation sets out several requirements that must be satisfied in order to be eligible to hold a road transport operator licence, one of which is professional competence.  In order to fulfil this requirement, every road transport undertaking in Ireland or, indeed, any other EU member state must have a nominated transport manager to effectively and continuously manage its transport activities.  The transport manager must hold a certificate of professional competence in either road haulage or road passenger transport, depending on the nature of the operator's business.  This certificate must be issued by an EU member state and is ordinarily obtained by passing a written examination.  As highlighted by the European Commission in 2018 and, more recently, in July of this year, after the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, transport managers' CPCs issued by an authority of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, or a body authorised by the United Kingdom will no longer be valid in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Government's Brexit preparations, the Department of Transport carried out a review and identified approximately 200 individuals with a UK-issued transport manager CPC who are currently nominated as transport manager for Irish road transport operators.  The Department recently wrote to these transport managers and the relevant operators to ensure they are aware of the position as outlined by the European Commission.<\/p>  <p>  There are steps that affected transport managers and operators can take to ensure they continue to be in compliance with the relevant EU legislation.  Individuals who hold a UK-issued transport manager CPC and who wish to act, after the end of the Brexit transition period, as transport manager for a road transport operator based in the EU, including Ireland, will need to obtain a transport manager CPC issued by an EU member state.  This affects UK-qualified transport managers working for Irish operators, but also those working for other operators based in other EU member states.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Department&rsquo;s correspondence to those UK transport manager CPC holders who work as transport manager for Irish-based transport operators, the Department has communicated with the European Commission on this important issue.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Commission yesterday evening indicated that before the end of the Brexit transition period we may issue a corresponding Irish transport manager CPC to those UK-qualified individuals working for Irish operators.  This is extremely welcome news for those affected transport managers and operators as it means that the transport managers will not now be required to undertake an Irish exam in order to continue to work as transport manager for an Irish operator.<\/p>  <p>  In light of this clarification received from the European Commission, my Department is now examining as a matter of urgency the arrangements that must be put in place in order to allow for the issuing of corresponding transport manager CPCs to affected individuals.  A further communication will shortly be issued to affected transport managers and operators to inform them of this recent update from the European Commission and to outline what needs to be done in order to obtain an Irish transport manager CPC.  We will advise impacted transport managers to apply before the end of the year to avail of these new arrangements, and will communicate this as soon as possible.  It is important to note that those affected will not need to sit an exam to secure an Irish CPC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600043#RR00400","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1606405200,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I do not know what to say.

The town has a growing population and also serves south Offaly and, indeed, people from north Tipperary.  The people of the area have been left without a Midoc service for well in excess of two years.  I am aware that the Sl&aacute;intecare policy emphasises the need for the delivery of primary care units and acute services within the community.<\/p> <p> I stress the urgent need for a commitment to be given to establish a primary care centre in Birr.  There was great disappointment when the application for approval of a site that had been earmarked for the centre was refused by the HSE after 12 months of waiting for a response.  I was very disappointed, as a Deputy serving the area, not to get an answer to my parliamentary questions on this issue.  I commend the cathaoirleach of Offaly County Council, Councillor John Carroll from Birr, who has done fantastic work on this issue.  Councillor Carroll met with HSE representatives recently and it is my understanding that there are now three options on the table for a site for the centre.<\/p> <p> I implore the Minister of State to ensure that her Department commits to the timely delivery of a primary care centre in Birr.  The services it would provide are badly needed and there is a shortage of GPs in the town.  If we had a state-of-the-art primary care centre, it would likely attract GPs to the town, which would solve that problem at the same time.  Will the Minister of State to commit to engaging with the HSE to secure the delivery of this facility for Birr?  I have tried engaging with it and am very disappointed to say that I have had little or no response.  My understanding is that when the site application was refused, after 12 months of people waiting to see what was happening, the decision was communicated by way of a telephone call to the county councillors in Birr.  That is totally unacceptable.<\/p> <p> This is a very serious issue and we need a commitment that progress will be made on it.  The people of Birr deserve better and I am here today to ensure, on their behalf, that everything is done to secure the delivery of the primary care centre and that the process is not dragged out any further.  As I said, the town has been without a Midoc service for more than two years, which puts it at a huge disadvantage.

On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, I acknowledge the Deputy's work in advocating for the people of counties Offaly and Laois.  I know she has concerns about the progress of the delivery of a planned primary care centre in Birr.  Although the HSE has responsibility for the delivery of such centres, there is, of course, a level of engagement with officials in the Department of Health on those projects.  I welcome the opportunity to update the Deputy on this important project.<\/p>  <p>  First, I assure the Deputy that the HSE has not abandoned proposals for a primary care centre in Birr.  In fact, it is continuing to work closely with local GPs and is engaging with private developers to ensure the residents of Birr and its surrounding area will ultimately have access to a purpose-designed, well-equipped, high-quality facility.  The development of these centres, like other building projects, is dependent on many outside factors, including the suitability of available locations and planning processes.  An additional complicating factor with this development is the desire to secure the commitment of local GPs to sharing accommodation and delivering healthcare services alongside HSE staff in support of a multidisciplinary team approach to patient care.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the original site identified for the centre was at the existing rugby club facilities in Birr and that agreement had been reached between the HSE and local GPs on developing this location.  However, planning permission was refused by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in June 2018.  This was an extremely disappointing development but the continued commitment to deliver a centre was demonstrated by the HSE's inclusion of Birr in a national advertisement in May 2019 seeking expressions of interest to deliver centres under the operational lease model.  This advertisement resulted in a number of potential locations being identified in Birr.  Offaly County Council proposed a site known locally as the rectory lands.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions are continuing on how best to proceed, although they have been somewhat hampered by the Covid-19 crisis.  I am aware that local GPs have indicated that they do not wish to pursue the council's option and their preference remains the original rugby club site.  I understand they intend to make a submission under the new Offaly county development plan to that effect.  The HSE has recently written to interested parties identified in the May 2019 advertisement inviting them to submit their best and final offer for the development and operation of a primary care centre in Birr.  The HSE hopes these submissions, when returned, will be considered early next year and, in the absence of further issues arising, enable an indicative centre operational date of quarter 3, 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt that Deputy Nolan and the local community in Birr are frustrated by the delays in progressing this project, but there should be no doubt that there is still a commitment to building a primary care centre in Birr.  The HSE and other stakeholders continue to work to make that plan a reality and fulfil the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of delivering better care, closer to people's homes and in their local communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600044#SS00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1606405800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

She said that it the HSE hopes to made a decision on submissions received in the first quarter of 2021.  I welcome that information, as I said, but we really need ongoing updates from the HSE on the matter.  I do not want to have to keep chasing it for answers.  In fairness, when I sent in my parliamentary questions to the Minister, they were acknowledged, but there was no follow-up from the HSE.  This issue must be a top priority for the Department because the establishment of a primary care centre in Birr is very important to the people living there.  I do not want to be back here in two years' time saying that nothing has happened and the sod has not yet been turned.  I really hope we can get things moving very quickly and get the project off the ground.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that the HSE needs to step up to the mark.  Its communication thus far has been dire.  I would like to see a timeline of what is happening as we go along.  If the HSE could provide a briefing on the progress being made, as it is made, that would be very helpful.  My constituents are very concerned about this issue and I, as their Deputy, would love to see the primary care centre in place.  The cathaoirleach of Offaly County Council is also working very hard on the issue, as I outlined.  Instead of promises, we want certainty that the project will be delivered.

I can hear the frustration and annoyance in her voice regarding the slow pace of this project.  The development of primary care centres to accommodate primary care teams and GPs in one location is an essential enabler of the delivery of community and primary care services nationwide.  The driving force behind the development of the centres is the desire to support the implementation of new models of care that offer patients access to high-quality healthcare services and resources closer to their homes and in their local community.<\/p>  <p>  As I have outlined, there are different factors that can have an impact on the delivery of a primary care centre.  These delays are intensely frustrating for all involved, especially local communities who, rightly, wish to see local services developed.  Notwithstanding the delays in this instance, the HSE continues to work closely with local GPs and is engaging with private developers to progress the development of a centre in Birr.  I assure the Deputy that both my Department and the HSE are fully committed to the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.  The development of primary care centres will continue to be an important building block in enabling the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare to become a reality.  Indeed, significant progress has been made on the roll-out of centres nationally.  There are now 135 centres operational throughout the country, up from 70 at the end of 2012.<\/p>  <p>  To reiterate, the HSE recently wrote to interested parties identified in the May 2019 advertisement inviting them to submit their best and final offer for the development and operation of a primary care centre in Birr.

Years of neglect, underinvestment and lack of political will have led to systemic failures in the mental health service.  This is a Bill of hope.  It is a vital legislative measure that will elevate the plight of people seeking mental health supports to the forefront.  The legislation aims to compel a change in attitude towards mental health at the highest level of policy making and governance.  A recent incident that caused concern among mental health advocates was when the Government launched its winter plan for health and there was no mention of mental health in the plan.  If this Bill is passed, it will be incumbent on the Minister for Health to include a mental health plan in next year's winter plan.  If this change of attitude occurs at the highest level, it will filter down into all levels of society and will see the stigma often associated with mental health conditions lessened.  We must start to break the stigma once and for all.<\/p>  <p>  The effective integration of mental health services and physical health services is particularly important.  A parity of esteem approach to mental health and physical health will provide a holistic, whole-person response to everyone in need of care and support, with his or her physical and mental health needs treated equally.  Mental healthcare has suffered from systemic neglect and a lack of appropriate resources over the years.  Neglect of people with severe and enduring mental illness has negative outcomes for the individuals concerned, their families and society.  This neglect of mental health occurs across the spectrum at policy, institutional, organisational and individual levels.  The Bill will place a duty on the Minister for Health to promote health parity and to ensure all organisations in the health system meet parity obligations in respect of mental health.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said numerous times, if one has an accident and cuts one's head, one will receive the appropriate treatment and aftercare when and where one needs it, but if one has a problem inside one's head, one may not receive the necessary treatment.  This Bill aims to redress that imbalance.  Mental health problems do not simply materialise Monday to Friday or between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and then magically disappear outside those hours.  There must be access to a comprehensive, 24-7 mental health service which examines the holistic needs of the person.  We heard experts at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response describe the mental health services as out of date and not fit for purpose, with many services inundated with cries for help.<\/p>  <p>  We need a mental health strategy for young people to provide earlier intervention and support and to reduce the number of adults presenting with mental health challenges later in life.  Prevention is better than cure.  Before the Covid-19 pandemic, children were waiting up to two years to get an appointment with the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  This is simply not good enough.  It is expected that these waiting lists will increase post Covid.  When the restrictions were first introduced many people, myself included, thought they would be short-term measures and that we would be back to some form of normality quickly.  This has caused people extra worry and anxiety.  They are missing family, friends and the like.  As a result, people who would not normally have mental health issues have perhaps experienced them for the first time.  At present, we are not delivering a comprehensive or adequate mental health service and if there is a big increase in demand during and after the pandemic, I do not know how the system will cope.<\/p>  <p>  I have engaged with numerous stakeholders that have endorsed this Bill, including the Mental Health Commission, Mental Health Reform, Shine and others.  I call on all parties and none to support this Bill, particularly Fianna F&aacute;il which has advocated in the past for mental health parity.  I hope it will support the Bill today.  One of the recommendations in Sharing the Vision states that funding should reflect parity of esteem for mental health compared to other health conditions.  The Mental Health Parity of Esteem Bill aims to offer hope for better mental healthcare by ensuring that vulnerable persons with mental illness are cared for efficiently, when needed and on a par with physical healthcare.  I ask that the Bill be passed to Committee Stage when it can be teased out and examined further.  It must be allowed to progress.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, this is a Bill of hope.  It will give hope to any person suffering from mental health problems that he or she will receive the right treatment at the right time.  It is very easy to lose hope now, and people need it.  They need an assurance that the increase in mental health issues arising from Covid-19 will be treated in a respectful and appropriate manner.  In the meantime, the most important thing we can do is be kind to, and respect, each other.  It is perfectly okay not to be okay right now.  It is normal to feel anxious, frightened, frustrated or worried about things over which one does not have control.  People should be kind and reach out if they are not feeling okay.  If this Bill is passed today, it will send a clear message to everyone who is or has been affected by mental health, either personally or through family and friends, that we have listened to them, that they are not alone and not only have we listened, but we have acted and put in place the start of a process that will make their quality of life better.<\/p> <p>That is the very least they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600045#TT00300","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606407000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>It is great to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I congratulate Deputy Ward.  I also wish the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, the very best of luck in her role.  I will be very brief and try to explain to people what parity of esteem means when it comes to mental health.  It is defined as valuing mental health equally with physical health, which would result in those with mental health problems benefitting from equal access to the most effective and safest care and treatment.  It is about equal efforts to improve the quality of care.  It is about the allocation of time, effort and resources based on need.  It is also about equal status within healthcare, education and practice.  It is about equally high aspirations for service users and equal status in the measurement of health outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  We talk about parity because one of the biggest issues we have had in this country for many years is the stigma attached to mental health.  Stigma refers to problems of knowledge, which is basically ignorance, and attitudes and behaviour of discrimination against people.  This Bill tries to remove the stigma attached to mental ill health.  For many years we have spoken about the fact that with health issues we try to treat the problem, whereas with mental health we will have to treat the person and in order to do that we need wraparound services.  I had a very brief meeting with the Minister just before this and we spoke about it.  It is about educating everybody when it comes to how we judge people and, more importantly, how we do not judge people.<\/p>  <p>  Taking a parity-of-esteem approach would also enable the HSE and local authority health and social care services to provide a holistic, whole-person response to a problem.  The relationship between physical health and mental health is such that poor mental health is also linked with a higher risk of physical health problems and poor physical health is linked with poor mental health, so the parity is there already.  In the current Covid climate, we are all aware from the many calls to our offices that people are suffering in so many different ways at the moment.  We should do the right thing and make a positive move here today.  The aim of the Bill is to include everybody and to accept that, come the exit from Covid, many people will suffer with some form of mental anguish or mental ill health.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is important because it gives an opportunity for all parties and none to start afresh.  Let us go into 2021 putting our hands up and saying we will now accept that we have to treat everybody equally and respect everybody equally.  We must give people the care they need.  It is very simple.  If a person breaks a leg and arrives in an accident and emergency department, everybody knows what their job is and what they have to do.  It should be the same when a person is in trouble with a mental health issue.  What is important is not to judge people because we do not know what ticks their boxes.  With Covid, many people are suffering.  Some have lost their jobs.  Others have lost loved ones or they are in trouble with their mortgages.  We are all individuals and we deal with anxiety and grief very differently.  It is about having a wraparound service for each individual and treating the individual and not the so-called pain.  We spoke many times about mental health in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I am very optimistic that we can get off on the right foot in 2021, with the agreement of all parties.  I would love to see us as human beings standing up and saying we are going to address the real issues and do the right thing.<\/p>  <p>  I did a lot of research recently in the UK, which is probably three or four years ahead of the position here.  The system there is working.  I do not want to frighten the living daylights out of anyone but, as it stands, the life expectancy of a person with a mental health illness can be shortened by ten to 15 years and sometimes 20 years.  It is very important that we treat each and every individual with empathy, respect and non-judgment.  If we can bring about parity of esteem and understanding of mental health across the board in this country, we will be doing the right thing.  I hope and pray that all parties and none will at least back the Bill to proceed to the next Stage.  I hope we can increase people's life expectancy and their belief in the services improving.  We know the services are at breaking point at the moment.  They are very under-resourced.  I would very much welcome if we could all agree on a starting point and a plan to move this issue forward in the coming years.  I urge Members to please support the Bill and to do the right thing for everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600046#UU00200","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1606407000,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I commend my comrade, Deputy Mark Ward.  He is truly passionate about his portfolio and about attaining parity of esteem for mental health and physical health so that they would be treated equally.<\/p><p>For many, when it comes to our mental health and physical health, it is not just a question of what is wrong with us but of what happened to us.  The psychologists say that if we cannot tell the story of what happened to us, it will tell itself anyway in our lives.  Looking across this city and State we see people living with the consequences of what happened to them and what was done to them, all too often sometimes by the State.  We had mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries, industrial schools, hubs, hostels, soup runs and people living and dying in tents.  A mother in my constituency was afraid to complain about HAP-funded, rat-infested accommodation because there was nowhere else for her to go with her family.  Young mothers are taking their lives because of State-inflicted poverty, hunger, homelessness and sometimes the terror of Tusla.<\/p><p>If we are to have a serious conversation about mental health, we need to start with a serious conversation about why so many people are hanging on by a thread.  I am a new Deputy and I am shocked when people ring and thank me for just listening to them.  Sometimes they cry with relief.  It is no wonder our offices are called clinics.  Even as a councillor I often had people weeping across the table or down the telephone.  One of the things they do not tell us we will need in our constituency offices is a box of tissues because of the pain that some people are in.  I refer to people who work but who cannot get a home to rent or to buy.  People are in pain because they have a blood platelet count of 435,000 and they cannot get a hospital appointment for a gastroenterologist since last July.  They are in pain because their six-year old child needs a specialist interview for sexual abuse and they are waiting since March.<\/p><p>I have older men in my constituency who are living in conditions that are intolerable in a republic.  They do not have light, running water, heat or electricity.  They cannot wash themselves during a pandemic.  Their mental health is really suffering.  That is no wonder.  They are asking themselves if they ever imagined, even on their worst day, that things would be this bad and that the system into which they have contributed would leave them like this.  It is a measure of their own sanity that they question this because the answers to their questions are enough to drive anyone to despair.  Society, in its addiction to the <i>status quo<\/i>, is content, so it is really important that we talk about parity between mental health and physical health.  However, talk is cheap and ultimately it is useless.  We as a State must look once and for all at what is driving people to despair.  It is the lack of a decent home that they can afford, a lack of decent food, a lack of heat when it is cold or the lack of a job with good working conditions.<\/p> <p>When they are sick they should have the chance to be treated in a fit for purpose health system and, above all, they should have the chance to be listened to.<br\/><br\/>People say we should leave our politics at the door when it comes to mental health but we express our politics in how we vote on matters.  People expressed their opinion in electing us to the D&aacute;il so it is really important to bring politics into the Chamber, as our voting &quot;t&aacute;&quot; and &quot;n&iacute;l&quot; affects people.  I thank Deputy Ward for bringing forward this Bill and I hope it will get support across the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600046#UU00300","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606407600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy Ward, on bringing forward this very important legislation.  This Bill rightly puts mental health treatment at the same level of importance as physical health treatment.  This principle was enshrined in British law in 2012, demonstrating we are at least eight years behind with our own Irish legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The rationale for the Bill is to place a duty of care on the State to accept the principle of parity of esteem, both for physical and mental health.  Earlier this month I raised with the Taoiseach the appalling position of there being no inpatient child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, beds in Wexford.  Children who require inpatient care for their mental health must travel to Cork or possibly other counties for a bed, or worse, be put into an adult unit.  This Bill will bring about a change for good and influence future policies.  It will change attitudes towards mental health and the overall well-being of our country.<\/p>  <p>  Another area of mental health welfare that we really need to get to grips with concerns dual diagnosis of people suffering mental ill health and addiction.  We all hear and know of people at their lowest point being passed from service to service.  As there appears to be no collaboration between services to deal with such individuals, we need to urgently develop best practices and introduce \"wet hostels\" to support and treat citizens with dual diagnosis.  There is no reason shared files, collaborative work and a comprehensive treatment plan could not exist in treating a dual diagnosis of mental illness and addiction.<\/p>  <p>  If we are to have parity of esteem in mental health, we must also take an holistic approach.  One such way for this to happen is through the promotion of early intervention and prevention work, as well as the more traditional mental ill health care.  A service that comes to mind is the Jigsaw service for young people with mental health issues.  It proves a listening ear and gives expert advice and support to young people aged between 12 and 25.  It also provides families, teachers and those who support young people's mental health with a wide range of coping and resilience skills.  An excellent service such as this should be in every area and accessible to every young person.<\/p>  <p>  In response to a parliamentary question I tabled in July, the south-east community healthcare section of the HSE indicated it was not aware of any plans to develop a further Jigsaw programme in the region in 2020.  I urge the Minister of State to recognise the importance of this service and begin planning the investment required for expansion.  By supporting and passing this Bill, the House would commit to a noble principle that from now on, the physical and mental health of the nation would be treated as one indivisible right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600047#VV00200","speaker":"1621"},{"type":"speech","time":1606407600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>It says much and highlights the lack of regard, respect and priority that we display to those with mental health issues that we are forced to bring forward a Bill acknowledging that mental health issues should be held in parity with physical health.  I welcome the Bill and thank my colleague, Deputy Ward, for introducing it and giving us the opportunity to begin this conversation on an important societal matter.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome that today the sub-committee dealing with mental health matters was established and had its first meeting.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his role in fast-forwarding the establishment of that sub-committee.<\/p>  <p>  Mental health services and supports in this State have always been an afterthought or something that was difficult to access in the past and they are often treated like a dirty secret and something to be buried.  In those less enlightened times, the official approach was to exclude, lock away, medicate, ignore and somehow try to forget the people in those services.<\/p>  <p>  Many people suffering from mental health issues face a lack of services across the board and those with mental health issues are also at much higher risk of suffering from addiction, falling into homelessness, being unemployed and being imprisoned for relatively minor offences that lead to jail sentences, and this in turn often leads to a worsening of their condition.  Our prisons are certainly not the place to warehouse our mentally ill but many loved ones welcome it, as they believe imprisonment will eventually lead to supports and necessary care for a son, daughter, brother or sister.  They believe that if people go into the prison system, an assessment will be made and supports would be provided.  We know that in many cases when people are released from prison, they end up back on the streets and without the necessary supports.<\/p>  <p>  We also know prison staff are not trained to deal with these cases and facilities are not designed or equipped for such a purpose.  The same could be said of our homelessness services, with dormitory-style accommodation and rampant drug use being the last type of conditions needed by people suffering mental health issues.  We know many of the vulnerable homeless citizens placed in these settings go on to develop an addiction or fall deeper into the grip of drugs and alcohol, or they come into contact with dangerous and criminal elements, which only makes their problems all the worse.<\/p>  <p>  What do we say to a parent who comes to us looking for help?  We are supposed to be the font of all knowledge and people come to us and look for answers.  What do we say to the parent who says he or she has a child or children who cannot speak?  These people need support and wait years for an assessment, and for years following an assessment of need they still cannot get support for their child or children.  This is happening in my area, which is covered by community healthcare organisation, CHO 7.  Waiting lists for supports are getting longer so we can imagine the impact this has on a parent or parents when a child is suffering in trying to make himself or herself understood.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the key staff in this broken system have been seconded to tracking and tracing work for Covid-19, and again I cannot understand the thinking from the HSE that this is somehow acceptable or that these children can be left behind during this Covid-19 crisis.  As my colleague stated, Covid-19 will have a lasting effect, with months of lockdown and the stress of working from home possibly only becoming apparent in the months and years ahead.  Social isolation is at the greatest level we have seen and gone are many of the escapes that many people need.  I am not talking about the pub and a few drinks but sport and exercise have been curtailed and walks or hiking have been curtailed.  Friends are at the other side of a WhatsApp group instead of being engaged in human interaction.  We know the impact this has, particularly on older people who are isolated and unable to see grandchildren.  People could once get into nature but they are now forced to walk on grey pavement under streetlights on dark evenings, depending on where they live.  They remain isolated from others.<\/p>  <p>  Our already overly stretched mental health services may not be able to cope with what may come.  In my years as a public representative I have come into contact with hundreds of cases of people being tortured by mental health problems.  Families have been torn apart because nobody could help when a loved one was seized by a violent or paranoid episode.  We all know those stories and we have had parents come to us, crying their heart out, talking about the crisis happening in their homes.  We see the figures for domestic violence now and I am sure they are increasing.<\/p>  <p>  Older people often come to us.<\/p> <p>Their biggest fear is what will happen to their son or daughter after they die.  We have a big responsibility as a society and as Oireachtas Members to ensure the availability of supports.  We all know of the worry for parents of children with Down's syndrome, who are living longer these days, or parents of children who cannot speak or communicate and who cannot access supports or education.  We have failed those children miserably.<\/p> <p> We must acknowledge that mental health is every bit as vital as physical health.  We have never done so, regardless of the rhetoric from various Ministers for Health.  Our strategy for preserving and improving the health of Irish people must be comprehensive and holistic.  We must not just take care of the body but also the mind.  We have an enormous responsibility in that regard.  Again, I welcome this Bill and thank Deputy Ward for introducing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600047#VV00300","speaker":"1571","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606408200,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague Deputy Ward for introducing this Bill.  It is a very simple Bill, which I hope will have a positive effect on mental health services.  We need to place mental health on a par with physical health and improve the provision and quality of mental health services.  I have spoken in the House previously about a man whose son was experiencing mental ill health.  He felt it would have been better had his son been diagnosed with cancer because at least then there would be clear path to care.  Any family that has experienced mental ill health will be familiar with that feeling and this must change.  We must ensure that those who are experiencing mental health issues have a clear path to care in order that they can get better.<\/p><p>For too long mental health has been the poor relation of our health services.  Sadly, delays in diagnosis and treatment costs lives.  These people are not just statistics, they are parents, siblings, children, spouses and friends.  It is absolutely shameful that we do not have 24-7 services available to diagnose and treat mental illness.  Mental illness does not take the weekend off and neither should the care services.  Years of neglect, underinvestment and a lack of political will have left us with a broken system and it is high time it was fixed.  Mental health affects physical health and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  We must take an holistic approach.<\/p><p>Covid-19 has had a massive but unseen effect on the mental health of many people and it may be some time before we know the full extent of this.  I commend the work of groups like HOPE(D) in Newbridge and the way they have adapted to cope with the challenges posed by the pandemic.  They are saving lives but receive no money from the HSE, despite the executive referring clients to them.  I want to say to everyone who is struggling in this pandemic that even with the privileged position I am in, there are times when I struggle.  It is perfectly okay not to be okay right now.  It is normal to feel anxious, frightened, frustrated or worried about things that are outside our control.  People should be kind and reach out to one another.  They need to know that if they are not feeling okay, they are not alone.  <\/p><p>As someone who suffered with mental health issues when I was 16 years old, which is a long time ago, I know that if we do not look after our mental we will be in severe trouble.  People do not differentiate between mental health and mental illness.  In order to have no mental illness, we need to focus on mental health and teaching people how to keep mental illness at bay.  As my party's spokesperson for older people, I am also very concerned about the impact of Covid-19 on people in nursing homes and their families, particularly on their mental health, which is pivotal.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600048#WW00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1606408200,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I begin by thanking Deputy Mark Ward for bringing attention to the topic of mental health.  The importance of supporting good mental health and well-being has been recognised for some years now and never more than during the current pandemic.  The onset of Covid-19 has presented enormous challenges for people's mental health and the Government has responded rapidly by putting additional services and supports in place.<\/p>  <p>  The Government acknowledges the positive intention of this Bill and does not intend to oppose it.  Many Deputies will be aware that a very similar Bill was brought forward by a colleague in the last D&aacute;il, Deputy James Browne, who is now a Minister of State.  I distinctly remember speaking on and supporting that legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The stated aims of the Bill are to offer hope for better mental health care by ensuring that vulnerable persons with mental illness are cared for efficiently, when needed and on parity of esteem with physical health and to compel a change in attitudes towards mental health at the highest level of policy making and governance.  Its main provision obliges the Minister for Health to continue the promotion of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improvements in physical and mental health and in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of physical and mental illness .<\/p>  <p>  An equal standing within the healthcare system for mental health and physical health is something that we strive for every day.  The interdependencies between physical and mental health are well recognised.  WHO research suggests that key risk factors for poor physical health and reduced life expectancy are more prevalent among people living with a mental health difficulty than among the general population.  For example, people with schizophrenia are more than twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes when compared to the general population.  The incidence of respiratory and cardiovascular disease is also higher among those with a serious mental health condition.  Equally, there is a higher incidence of conditions such as anxiety and depression among those suffering from long-term chronic physical health conditions such as asthma and arthritis.  The need for a whole-person approach to achieving the highest possible standards of physical and mental health and well-being has been recognised in formulating our mental health policy, as is the need to support the wider psychological aspects of physical health challenges.<\/p>  <p>While the Government does not oppose this legislation, I have some observations to make on the Bill as proposed.  I am offering these with the benefit of having some knowledge of a similar Bill introduced in the previous D&aacute;il.  The aims of the Bill are broad.  It does not offer any guidance on what parity of esteem would look like in practice.  Given the vast spectrum of conditions that influence both physical and mental health, it is silent on what esteem for mental health should be compared to when assessing parity.  It does not include specific provisions for how parity of esteem would be achieved, implemented or measured.  The Bill's provisions appear different to the narrative in the explanatory memorandum.  As currently constructed, it is aspirational but unclear on what it would accomplish in concrete terms.<\/p>  <p>  I urge Deputy Ward to consider these observations in the interest of developing a precise and specific Bill that is easily understood in practical terms.  Without that precision, its implications are difficult to predict, and consequently will not be possible to quantify from a financial perspective.  I believe this is where the last Bill fell down.  I say all of this from a position of experience and in the spirit of the collegiality on matters of mental health that this House has traditionally enjoyed across all parties and none.<\/p>  <p>  I remind the House that the WHO defines health as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\".  This is an all-encompassing view of health.  It acknowledges that the determinants of health are multifaceted and does not recommend prioritising any one aspect above another.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Act 2004 provides that the HSE shall use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.  It also states that the HSE shall manage and shall deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.  It further states that the HSE shall integrate the delivery of health and personal social services.  Deputy Ward's Bill seeks to oblige the Minister for Health to \"continue\" the promotion of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improvements in physical and mental health.  I acknowledge the important role that legislation plays, as Members of this House will know.  However, when it comes to health, treatment and services are what we look to for healing.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for mental health services is a priority for the Government.  Budget 2021 saw the continued commitment to mental health with increased funding of &euro;50 million, bringing the annual budget to &euro;1.076 billion.  This represents an increase of over &euro;365 million or 51% since 2012.  The Government is committed to continuing to increase funding as circumstances allow.  The Department of Health and the HSE are currently finalising the 2021 HSE service plan, which will be published shortly.<\/p> <p>I am confident that this will give a balance of new mental health developments across age ranges and sectors of the population.  It will also cover the full spectrum of mental health, from mental health promotion and early intervention to acute and forensic inpatient care.  It will also ensure that greater attention is given to improved links between mental health and other services.<\/p> <p> With regard to policy, we recently published a new refreshed national policy, Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Policy for Everyone.  The Sharing the Vision policy does not replace that of A Vision for Change but instead updates our approach in the light of evolving and future needs.  The implementation of Sharing the Vision is obviously critical to its success and this is a core objective for me as Minister of State.  Last month, I announced the establishment of the new national implementation and monitoring committee framework that will drive implementation of the policy.  An independent chair for the committee, Mr. John Saunders, has been appointed and selection of the membership is currently under way.  Over the 10-year lifespan of Sharing the Vision, the committee will be integral to maintaining the momentum necessary to make the policy a reality and to hold stakeholders to account.  Implementation will also be progressed through planned additional investment for the sector under the annual budgets and agreement of HSE annual service plans.<\/p> <p> It is important that the implementation of Sharing the Vision is a collaborative process.  I intend that the committee and its associated specialist groups will be fully representative and will include strong service user, service provider and non-statutory sector participation.<\/p> <p> As the debate here this evening is about mental health legislation, I will take the opportunity to update the House on progress on the review of the Mental Health Act 2001.  The Department is currently finalising heads of a Bill to significantly amend and update mental health legislation, taking into account the 165 recommendations of the expert group review, which was partly informed by a public consultation, a comprehensive submission by the Mental Health Commission and Ireland's domestic and international commitments such as those under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The provisions of the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018 are also being incorporated into the draft heads of Bill.<\/p> <p> There are over 100 sections in the draft heads.  The Department has included detailed information under each head to allow for expert input from the Mental Health Commission and the HSE to be provided prior to publication.  This will allow the Department the opportunity to address any concerns as early in the process as possible.  The draft heads of Bill propose to extensively amend and update existing mental health legislation, moving from what has been described as a paternalistic approach in existing statute to a more person-centred, human rights-based approach.  The Department had hoped to submit these heads for legal advice by the end of 2020, however, the Department is currently awaiting further input from the HSE, which is expected in early December, and plans to consider the HSE's submission and finalise the draft heads prior to submission for internal legal advice and to the Office of the Attorney General, as required, in early 2021.<\/p> <p> A new part of the Act related to children is being advanced separately, and the Department has approached the HSE, the commission, the Ombudsman for Children and the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland for their expert opinions on the draft heads.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputy Ward for introducing his Bill.  Work is required to ensure that the final Bill is legally robust, specific and implementable.  I hope I have given some useful input on how the Bill might evolve and look forward to hearing the remaining contributions here this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600048#WW00300","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606408800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I apologise for not calling on the Minister of State earlier.

The Minister of State has provided the World Health Organization's definition of health, which is not simply the absence of disease or a condition.  Whatever about the World Health Organization's definition, the reality in our communities and in our health service is that there is not parity of esteem at this point in time.  We have to recognise that a societal challenge still exists.  Attitudes towards mental health and mental illness have significantly improved in recent years but physical and mental health are not viewed in the same way and that parity of esteem has not been achieved.  Deputies, Government and society all have a responsibility to tackle that issue.  That is crucially important.<\/p>  <p>  An issue that may, perhaps, be addressed more rapidly is the lack of parity of esteem or of equal treatment within the health service.  This can be seen in a wide range of areas.  There is certainly no parity in the resources available to mental health.  This lack can also be seen when one drills down into community services.  My area of Cork is part of the same community healthcare organisation, CHO, area as Kerry.  It would be remiss of me not to once again make the point that the numbers on waiting lists for psychology, psychiatry and child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in this CHO area are among the highest in the country.  In fact, the number on the waiting list for CAMHS is the highest in the country.  That problem has been outstanding for a very long time.  There are approximately 2,200 people on the waiting list for CAMHS in Cork and Kerry, 162 of whom have been on it for more than a year.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  These young people and their families are being left in a crisis situation for far too long.  <\/p>  <p>  A psychology position in CAMHS in the Cork north Lee HSE area has had to be readvertised as it was not filled.  That vacancy has been outstanding for well in excess of a year.  It may well have been vacant for two years at this stage.  That is unacceptable and it is a further sign that not enough emphasis is placed on these issues.  It is always a matter of being penny wise but pound foolish.  It may be questioned whether it is even penny wise.  When one fails to deal with things promptly, things escalate, people's issues and conditions become more severe and they need more extensive and more sustained treatment.  We have never dealt with these issues at that early intervention stage.<\/p>  <p>  The final point I will make in respect of parity of esteem is that there is an issue regarding discharges from the acute hospitals at times, although not always.  I have raised some of these issues with the hospital group in Cork and Kerry.  People who have been admitted as a result of mental illness or of difficulties or conditions relating to their mental health are, at times, discharged very rapidly.  I appreciate that some of this relates to the severe pressure on our hospitals as a result of the Covid situation but I have come across instances of people who I have fed into the system being discharged in situations which were not appropriate, in which there was insufficient preparation and in which supports were not in place.  One person I know of, who was not in the most severe part of their crisis, although they were still in a crisis situation, was left to their own devices and put out onto the street with very little support or guidance.  The networks were not there for them.  That is an area that needs to be tackled.  We would not discharge somebody with a physical condition unless we were confident that they had somewhere safe and secure to go.  With regard to parity of esteem, the area of discharges needs to be dealt with.  <\/p>  <p>  I will also emphasise once again that the resourcing issues in Cork and Kerry need to be dealt with.  The waiting lists are too long.  Young people and adults are suffering unnecessarily.  Their crises are being extended.  It is not good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600049#XX00500","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1606408800,"counter":510,"content":"<p>There are 15 minutes remaining before we must begin the wrap-up.

I agree with a lot of what has been said about the parity of esteem required in respect of mental health services and dealing with mental illness.  I also accept that the issue is not necessarily straightforward.  It involves some of the difficulties we deal with every day.  There is the question of whether someone has an actual diagnosis.  Some people are told they do not have a mental illness but rather a behavioural difficulty.  We need clarity.  Certain terminology is used quite often.  We need the policy to be that there is no wrong door.  This means we also need a proper system for dual diagnoses.  Given the services and resources we have at the minute, if some of these situations are not clarified and if resources are not brought to bear, all we are doing is putting further pressure on services that are not sufficient to deal with what they are already dealing with.<\/p> <p>It is as simple as that.  Across the board we have a bad history in this State in respect.  We had a history of putting people in institutions and locking them up.  We are all aware of the reality of what happened.<\/p> <p> At this point, we are not operating best practice with acute beds.  I accept not everyone with a mental illness necessarily needs hospitalisation but there are cases where it is required.  Excuse me if I am wrong on the exact figure but I am told we operate in and around 20 beds per 100,000 whereas in parts of Europe the figure is between 50 and 70 per 100,000 or higher.  This needs to be rectified.  I am also told that within Louth and Meath and my local HSE community healthcare organisation the level of bed provision is less again.  These things need to be rectified.<\/p> <p> We have a situation with regard to mental illness behaviours.  These may seem to many people like a mental illness but we are told that, without a diagnosis, what is at issue is no more than behaviour etc.  We end up with the Garda dealing with this.  Deputy Ward has already spoken this week on the situation.  Sometimes our jails are full of people who need acute services but end up in that situation.  All this needs to be rectified.  We need a holistic approach across the board and we need all stakeholders to be included.<\/p> <p> I imagine every constituency office is similar to mine.  People appear or we are given issues.  The issue may fall somewhere between mental illness, mental health, added disability or other situations and a lack of competence.  Sometimes it falls somewhere between mental health services and social care.  Really what happens is that the issue falls between the stools.  Sometimes we deal with parents who are trying to deal with a child of theirs who is 30 or 40 years of age with many issues.  The parents may be in their 70s and may not be fit to cope.  We need to look at some element of diagnosis and treatment.  We also possibly need to look at assisted living.  Where this is not addressed, the pressure goes back on these people.  Occasionally, this situation also puts pressure on either the Garda or mental health services.  It absolutely fails.<\/p> <p> I brought up another fact earlier when I talked to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on institutions or congregated settings dealing with disabilities.  I believe this happened in the Crosslanes unit in Drogheda recently.  I do not believe we have proper screening or testing to ensure staff do not have Covid-19.  We had an outbreak and we have difficulty sometimes with this.  The public health advice may say people are not close contacts because they are operating certain procedures with masks etc.  The fact is that many of our health settings were already under pressure without screening.  They will come apart at the seams.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to look at this situation.  I understand that in September or October that was what happened in Crosslanes in Drogheda.  I urge the Minister of State to come back to me on that.  We need to look at the public health protocols as well as testing and screening at these facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600049#XX00700","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606409400,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I will be as brief as possible.  I will support this Bill.  Fair play to Deputy Ward and Sinn F&eacute;in for their work on the Bill.  It is important that as Deputies and as a society we talk about mental health.  There has been a marked difference in the past five years in talking about mental health issues.  Sometimes, talking about something can halve the problem.<\/p>  <p>  This is about resources.  A Vision for Change was published 14 years ago.  The budgetary percentages were not fulfilled to tackle deficiencies in mental health services.  The new document, Sharing the Vision, sets out a parameter for fixing the vision.  That is important.  We have said numerous times in the Chamber that this is about early intervention.  When people get intervention early, there are better outcomes.  If people do not get intervention, then there are worse outcomes, especially around mental health.  The outcomes can be dire and people may simply die.  If we can get early intervention for people when they need it, the outcomes are better not only for the people concerned but for society, community and family.<\/p>  <p>  We talk all the time about reform.  There needs to be a radical overhaul of the health service in this country.  One thing Covid-19 has exposed is the fault line in our health service.  Covid-19 has revealed what is probably a new phenomenon in human health.  Today, the UN said a global mental health crisis is on the horizon or is in existence.  Covid-19 has amplified the anxieties and fears of everyone.  It can amplify depression, loneliness and all that comes with it.  It is imperative that we reach out to our neighbours and family.  These are simple things but they can make a major difference.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has spoken before about Covid-19.  It is important that now and in the coming years we look at the effect Covid-19 is having on society.  We need to put in place the facilities and resources that can help people get over it.  We will get over this pandemic.  However, we need to be in a better place not only in respect of our health service but our mental health services as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600050#YY00200","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1606409400,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputy Ward on bringing forward the Bill.  I acknowledge his vision and understanding of an area of well-being that, as this Bill suggests, has been left behind in terms of policy decisions and access to care and treatment.<\/p>  <p>  In talking about parity of esteem, it may be worth talking about what represents a lack of parity of esteem.  We see this with young people ending up in emergency departments or general hospitals when what they need is tailored mental health supports.  In 2019, the Mental Health Commission spoke of how children in need of mental health supports are ending up in general hospitals.  The commission said the reason for this was due to an immediate risk to the young person or due to the lack of a bed in a specialist child and adolescent mental health services unit.  The report went on to say that children and young people in crisis are left with the unacceptable choice between an emergency department, general hospital, children's hospital or adult inpatient unit.  This is one example of how a lack of investment in mental health services results in children having to present at overcrowded emergency departments or general hospitals which are not equipped to deal with their needs.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012, St Michael's inpatient psychiatric unit in Clonmel was closed.  The services were transferred to St Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny, leaving County Tipperary without any inpatient beds.  This means that many people in south Tipperary have to travel far from their homes, while those in north Tipperary have to go all the way to Ennis.  As well as the distance issue, St Luke's in Kilkenny has a record of overcrowding.  That decision denied us a key service.  It was a cruel blow to County Tipperary.<\/p>  <p>  Before his departure from office, the former Minister of State, Mr. Jim Daly, admitted that the wrong decision was made to remove the beds from Clonmel.  We have been unable to get a similar sentiment out of the current Minister of State.  This year I found out that &euro;2 million is being spent on upgrading beds at the same unit, but not for mental health.  It seems as though the money is available but only if it is not for the purposes of mental health services.  Since St Michael's unit was closed, all we have seen are delays with Jigsaw as well as a delay and a total lack of clarity in the development of a new crisis house in Clonmel.  The list of problems goes on for Tipperary.  At the same time, while a room has been put aside at South Tipperary General Hospital for people presenting with mental health issues, they still have to go through the emergency department process.  All of this shows how mental health services always take the back seat in overall healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  A similar lack of priority has been shown with regard to dual diagnosis for people with mental health and addiction issues.  It is widely held that if both issues are not treated together, then it is difficult to get the desired outcome.  The HSE has spent &euro;124,586 over a 14-month period and this resulted in the draft model of care.<\/p> <p>It went nowhere and the only resource available from that study is a link to the website <i>drugs.ie<\/i>.  This shows how, as Deputy Ward put it, mental health is the Cinderella of health services.  Organisations such as CARMHA in Nenagh are doing great work in this regard, and I again appeal to the Minister of State to hear what such organisations have to say and see what they do.  I appeal to everyone here to support this Bill.<br\/><br\/>I will finish with a question put to me by a 19-year-old girl from Carrick-on-Suir, and a community work student, who wrote to me about a rising mental health crisis in the south east and the difficulties young people encounter when seeking help.  She said:<\/p><blockquote>\tDeputy in our constitution it states that every child should be treated equally.  Yet here we are in 2020 with a multiple-tier health system in relation to mental health.  I say multiple because it's not as black and white as it may seem.  As a young person struggling, you are asked various questions, depending on your social status and your address.  There could be many or no services available in your area.  Now please explain to me how we are treating all children equally? <\/blockquote> <p>We have a tsunami of mental health issues coming after the Covid-19 pandemic and that must be tackled urgently.  I encourage every Deputy to consider this question and to support this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600050#YY00300","speaker":"1613","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606410000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>The Government does not wish to oppose the Mental Health Parity of Esteem Bill 2020.  That being said, further clarity is required regarding this Bill.  The aims of the Bill are general and aspirational in nature and differ from the background to the purpose of the Bill, as set out in the explanatory memorandum.  The Bill does not give any indication of how to achieve its stated aims.  While the intention of the Bill is positive, further work is required regarding what the effect of the Bill is intended to be and what the financial implications of this Bill could be.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, there have been many positives of late, with the provision of an additional &euro;50 million in the area of mental health in budget 2021.  Of this amount, some &euro;23 million will be allocated to commencing the implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of the new national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision.  This includes funding to improve child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and, more specifically, the appointment of 29 whole-time equivalent staff in CAMHS.  This increase in staffing can go some way towards reducing the current waiting lists so that children and young people, and their families, can access these supports more quickly where required.  It is also essential that these staff are deployed in the areas where they are most required, taking into account that the CAMHS waiting lists vary significantly depending on what area a person lives in.<\/p>  <p>  Mental health should be considered a disability when accessing certain services.  This is currently not the case, especially when it comes to allocation in respect of priority on housing lists.  I see this issue arising all the time in my clinics.  I also refer to the same issue in respect of accessing grants etc.  Help is needed in that respect and this is a major area which we must look at.  I am passionate about this area and I have raised concerns regarding it.  I will continue to raise this at the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.<\/p>  <p>  People dealing with mental health issues are the most vulnerable people and they matter, as the Minister of State is aware.  She is working hard on this issue, and we must ensure people feel that mental health is important.  Mental health is an issue we all need to talk about.  I recently proposed that Carlow town become a talking town and that our county capital become a place where people can access the help they need at any time without stigma, judgment or obstacles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600051#ZZ00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1606410000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I commend Members on this wide-ranging debate.  These contributions underline our shared goal of a mental health system that reaches the highest possible standards.  Going back to some points, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire rightly raised the issue of the CAMHS waiting lists.  It is something I have also discussed with Deputy Ward.  I am concerned about that issue.  The waiting lists are currently at about 2,200 people, but it does vary, as my colleague has just said, depending on where people live.  The extra &euro;50 million secured for this area in the budget, however, will mean 29 whole-time equivalent new staff working in CAMHS to drive down the waiting lists.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire was also concerned about the Cork and Kerry area.  I was informed this week by the person in charge of services there that two new appointments of psychiatrists were made in Cork and Kerry, so that should make a major difference.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Mythen spoke about Jigsaw, and that leads me on to Deputy Martin Browne's contribution.  Jigsaw offers supports for young people aged from 12 to 25 years old.  Prior to the onset of Covid-19, it was possible to self-refer, without the need for a referral from a parent, a GP or a teacher.  That is fantastic.  Jigsaw will open services in Bray in County Wicklow just before Christmas, and services will commence in Thurles just after Christmas.  Regarding Deputy Browne's contribution, because it is fair to put things like this on the record, the reason Jigsaw services in Tipperary were delayed slightly is because temporary premises were originally being secured.  The great news now, however, is that a permanent premises has been secured.  The lease has been signed and there were advertisements in the newspapers this week for seven posts in respect of Jigsaw services in Thurles.  There was worry among people living in Tipperary that this might not become reality.  Today, however, it is certainly a reality and the sign will be over Jigsaw's door before Christmas, in keeping with the commitment I gave earlier in the year.<\/p>  <p>  Mental health is one of the key priorities of this Government, and it is good that Members have the opportunity to debate these issues.  I will set out some of the topical issues in the area of mental health.  Many Deputies mentioned the Covid-19 pandemic, and it has presented challenges on an unprecedented scale to our health service, economy, communities and safety.  We asked the public to make sacrifices, the kind which would have been unimaginable this time last year.  The response to this request has been tremendous and has shown the very best of the spirit for which this country is famous.<\/p>  <p>  However, the pandemic has had a profound effect on the mental health of many people.  I hear from members of the public every day regarding the impact of these restrictions.  All the Deputies hear the same stories.  We have had to make changes in our services.  So far, our statutory and non-statutory mental health services have withstood this adversity and I acknowledge the significant efforts of the staff in doing so.  Acute inpatient and community residential facilities have remained open, though under necessary protocols.  I am happy to state that during the first part of the pandemic, some 85% to 90% of all mental health acute services remained in place.  Where numbers have been reduced in some settings, telehealth solutions have come to the fore to protect people using the services and the staff.<\/p>  <p>  Urgent cases determined by clinical assessment continue to be seen across the mental health services, including emergency departments.  HSE services have continued to operate at around 85% of pre-Covid-19 levels.  GP and hospital mental health services remain open, and people should continue to access these if they are concerned about their mental health.  The Mental Health Commission has put in place a risk framework, with contingency plans in every HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 and to protect service users and staff.  The Department has also introduced primary legislation to facilitate the continued operation of mental health tribunals, and this was recently extended to June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Returning to the subject of this debate, the goal of legislation for parity of esteem for physical and mental health must be carefully analysed to see if that can be achieved.  This sets challenges for all of us.  Significant thought and effort will be necessary to ensure that it is crafted in a way which fulfils its aims of improving outcomes for all, which is what Deputy Ward is trying to achieve.  We must be sure that any changes made are the right ones and are sure to have the effects which are intended.  I assure the House that my officials and I will review all the contributions which have been made and bring them to bear in all of our important work in the design and delivery of mental health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600051#ZZ00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1606410000,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I welcome the Government not opposing this Bill and I appreciate the support this Bill has received across the House, or perhaps I should say across the convention centre.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge some of the points the Minister of State raised and her observations on the Bill.  There was a similar Bill previously and I acknowledge some of the reasons which were stated regarding why that Bill fell.  This Bill, however, now progresses to Committee Stage.  I am happy that it will get the legislative scrutiny it rightly deserves and that it will become legally robust, as the Minister of State put it.<\/p>  <p>  I also acknowledge and welcome the Minister of State's appointment of the independent chair of the monitoring committee for the implementation of Sharing the Vision.<\/p> <p>That will help Sharing the Vision move forward.  I also call on the Minister of State to ask the HSE to appoint a national director for mental health because that is one of the things that will help restore parity for mental health.  The Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Murnane O'Connor, mentioned having different waiting lists in different areas for CAMHS.  We need to start moving away from this postcode politics.  We need the same level of service no matter what area one lives in or what part of the country one is from.  That is another way of restoring parity for mental health.<\/p> <p> This week marks a year since I was elected to the D&aacute;il in a by-election.  It has been an honour to serve in this House over the past year but it has sometimes been very frustrating as well.  Our previous private Members' Bill did not relate to the Minister's remit but it was about community safety.  Despite Government Deputies nodding their heads, agreeing with me and saying that legislation was good and valid, it was still voted down.  The reason it was voted down was because of party politics and because it was a Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  I am glad to see that party politics were put aside today and that this Bill will go to Committee Stage.  I said in my opening statement that I would work with the Minister of State, who is responsible for mental health, in Opposition, that I would hold the Government to account and that I would propose tangible and real solutions to issues relating to mental health.  Today is one of those days when something tangible happens.  Today, we did not just speak about change, we acted.  We listened to the people who are struggling with mental health issues and acted on their behalf.  As has been noted, this Bill is not a panacea for all the problems with mental health services, but it will start the process of making things better.<\/p> <p> To all the children mentioned earlier who are waiting for mental health appointments in CAMHS, we hear you.  We also hear the parents of those children.  To the children who are still being committed to adult psychiatric wards, we hear you.  To the man whose story was reported this week, who was left naked in his own urine in a prison cell, we hear you.  The voices of those experiencing additional mental health issues due to Covid are being heard today.  To those experiencing eating disorders, we hear you.  To those who have tried and failed to access services outside the nine-to-five and to anyone who has been affected by suicide, we absolutely hear you.  Some people are experiencing mental health issues for the first time, a large number of which are related to Covid, so to anyone who is feeling worried, anxious, depressed, upset or fearful, we hear you today.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State and her colleague said that this Bill is broad, aspirational and hopeful.  Mental health is such a huge issue and crosses so many spectrums that this needs to be broad.  As for being aspirational, we in Sinn F&eacute;in aspire to promote real, tangible solutions to mental health issues and we make no apologies for that.  We will certainly never apologise for offering hope to anybody.  We may all be in the same storm when it comes to mental health but we are not all in the same boat.  Parity is the boat that will result in everybody being treated the same when it comes to health problems, whether mental or physical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020112600051#ZZ00400","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606410600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I congratulate everyone involved with this Bill.
