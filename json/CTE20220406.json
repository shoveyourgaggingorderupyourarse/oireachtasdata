However, it is still good practice to use face coverings, particularly in crowded areas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear face masks when moving around the campus and in close proximity to others.  While the easing of restrictions removed the general requirement to maintain 2 m physical distancing, public health advice continues to state that maintaining a distance from other people is good practice.  It is important that everybody in the parliamentary community continues to be respectful of other people's space.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means that witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make any charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I am policy manager at Dogs Trust and I am joined by my colleague, Conor Brennan.  On behalf of Dogs Trust, we welcome the opportunity to assist the committee in discussing how we can work together to address the matters presented here today.  Our presentation will focus on microchipping and dog breeding establishments, with an overarching aim to explore collaborative solutions that advance dog welfare in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Dogs Trust has been working in Ireland since 2005.  Our mission is to bring an end to the destruction of stray and abandoned dogs through a national responsible dog ownership campaign and an education programme.  In 2009, we opened the doors of our rehoming centre in Finglas, Dublin and today Dogs Trust rehomes dogs all around the country through both our rehoming centre and our regional rehoming programme.  Last year, we rehomed 862 dogs and to date we have rehomed more than 20,000 dogs.<\/p> <p>  Since as far back as 2009, six years before the commencement of the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015, Dogs Trust has not only seen the value of the microchip but the power of the data that are recorded against it.  In that time, we have chipped almost 21,000 dogs in our care.  Outside of our rehoming centre, we ran national awareness campaigns, starting in 2013, pushing the message out to the public on the importance of microchipping, updating contact details recorded against the chip, and ensuring all dog owners are aware they must be in possession of their microchipping certificate.  Through our various microchipping schemes, we have assisted almost 29,500 dog owners to become compliant with the microchipping of dogs regulations.  That has been accomplished through the hosting of microchipping clinics, delivering microchips to dog owners most in need of our help via a dedicated network of vets throughout the country, and allowing dog owners to update or change the contact details registered against their dog&rsquo;s microchip free of charge during our national chipping week.<\/p> <p>  We were encouraged to hear the Department supply figures to this committee last week to the effect that 600,000 dogs have been chipped in the Republic of Ireland since 2017.  Building on this positive work, Dogs Trust Ireland believes now is the opportune moment to modernise the legislative framework to keep pace with other regulations and current trends in dog ownership.  We believe traceability is key and high-quality data are the means to produce meaningful traceability.  Therefore, greater emphasis must be placed on the quality of the input data as we have found that individual databases have different standards in terms of the quality of the input.  Greater obligations on database providers are needed with regard to all relevant details, including date of birth, breed, colour, markings, gender and owner contact details.  Widespread anecdotal evidence reveals that such details are currently not being kept to a requisite standard.  Greater emphasis should also be placed on the guidelines in place for databases and for collecting certified data.  With the update of the microchipping regulations, there is an opportunity to issue clear and mandatory requirements on registered databases operating in Ireland to ensure the highest quality data are held.<\/p> <p>  That is why we believe a central place for hosting data is an obvious next step for the advancement of dog welfare.  Ideally, a central database should be kept up to date, with a process implemented for the removal of deceased dogs.  It should provide one point of call for dog owners to update their details easily.  We recognise the difficulty in creating a single database as each database is run as a commercial enterprise.  If this is not possible, there should be a single repository for searching information.<\/p> <p>  We believe all data should be held in an accessible and digital format by database providers.  For example, some databases require the scanner of the dog to phone them to get the owner information, which delays reunification.  Having an accessible, unified location of the relevant data would bypass this issue as they could be obtained online.  In this way, all databases could be regularly shared with a central repository that cross-checks this information against similar databases operating in Ireland, for example, dog breeding establishment, DBE, licence holders; sellers and suppliers; and registered owners, trainers or breeders operating in the greyhound racing industry.<\/p> <p>  The importance of cross-checking the microchipping number against an owner that may hold a DBE licence or a seller and supplier registration number cannot be understated.  A simple change to introduce a mandatory field when registering or updating a microchip will open the door to full transparency for enforcement officials and registered rehoming charities.<\/p> <p>  We advocate for a streamlined central system for updating details that is easy to understand, not overly burdensome on the owner and, crucially, affordable to all dog owners.  Revised microchipping of dogs regulations should strengthen powers of authorised officials to fine owners where there are incidents of false information knowingly being submitted to the database or where there is widespread non-compliance.  Alongside this, a Government campaign could be run to increase owners' awareness of their obligations with regard to keeping their dogs' microchip details up to date.  This should, crucially, run in tandem with any engagement with database providers and registered breeders and sellers.<\/p> <p>  Technology is available to integrate the databases.  The central repository would need to be independent to address concerns regarding access to information.  This will lead to greater enforcement of responsible dog ownership and correct dog welfare practices.  On a much wider scale, compliance with the Dog Breeding Establishments Act and correct information displayed as part of the requirements under the rules on the sale, supply and advertising of pet animals are two clear examples.<\/p> <p>  We are encouraged that work is continuing behind the scenes with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and departmental officials to discuss options as to how best to tackle the issue of microchipping which, as far as we are concerned, can unlock solutions and enforcement for many welfare issues, including ear cropping.<\/p> <p>  As I realise the subsequent committee session will cover the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, I will outline Dogs Trust's hopes for the future review and implementation of the Act.  Following the introduction of voluntary guidelines in 2018 to supplement the Act, the then Minister of State, Deputy Canney, promised the Act would be updated.  This commitment was reiterated in the present programme for Government.  Close to three years on, we believe now is the ideal time to prioritise this important legislation and ensure the right structures are put in place.<\/p> <p>  Following engagement with Department of Rural and Community Development officials on the revised text of the Act, we believe three key changes to the Act will have a lasting impact on dog welfare in Ireland: a sufficient staff-to-dog ratio; greater transparency and accessibility of the DBE licence register; and the 2018 guidelines being placed on a statutory footing.<\/p> <p>  On sufficient staff-to-dog ratio, owing to the significant variation in workload between breeds and numbers of litters, Dogs Trust understands it is difficult to set a minimum ratio.  However, it is unreasonable and impractical to suggest that one staff member could properly manage 25 breeding bitches.  The current guidelines for DBEs states &ldquo;it is recommended that this will be equivalent to one fulltime equivalent per 25 breeding bitches&rdquo;.  In practical terms, workers must fulfil a thorough sanitisation programme for each of the 25 dogs as well as the number of puppies born to them, which could result in as many as 150 dogs under the care of one staff member during full-time working hours.<\/p> <p>  The staff-to-dog ratio must be sufficient to provide the level of care set out in the DBE Act and, although establishing the number of staff requires internal assessment, we do not foresee any circumstance where a non-human supervisor can come close to meeting these requirements even under the guidelines.  Indeed, the adoption of widespread mechanisation to fulfil socialising needs is cruel and deprives a companion animal of necessary human interaction.<\/p> <p>  I turn to greater transparency and accessibility of the DBE licence register.<\/p><p>The review of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act affords an opportune moment to empower the public with the knowledge of the environment a puppy or dog has been bred within before buying from a licensed DBE.  The current Act allows for a local authority to maintain a register of DBEs as it sees fit.  In practice, however, this has led to only approximately 50% of local authorities making the register available for members of the public to view online.  Instances of the register being kept up-to-date and what information is shared, in what format, is entirely uneven as well.  Empowering the public by mandating for the register of all DBEs to be made accessible online via each local authority portal and updated on an ongoing basis would allow for the traceability that should be available upon purchasing a dog from a DBE.  It would also facilitate the seamless creation of a centralised register where interested parties can easily access the key information for each DBE licence holder.<\/p><p> Regarding the guidelines, we are also eager to explore how the 2018 guidelines for DBEs will interact with any new revision of the Act.  We believe this is a great basis for strengthening the Act and should be recognised in primary legislation.  We recognise that the effective implementation of the guidelines cannot satisfy a one-size-fits-all approach.  The care required for a pack of hounds is very different to that for lapdogs.  The option of introducing separate guidelines or regulations for different types of establishments that come under the definition of a DBE, such as boarding kennels, rescues or hunt kennels, would be welcome and we are happy to work with the Department to explore this approach in a way that satisfies the wording of primary legislation.<\/p><p> Overall, any legislative changes should be looked at in the round.  Attention should be placed on how the updated regulations complement the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, the Control of Dogs Act and the Animal Health and Welfare Act, and we look forward to listening to the officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and from the Department of Rural and Community Development in this regard.  Some progress has been made in these policy areas but there is a worry that the impetus in recent years is waning and progress in key legislative pieces has stalled.  We believe that by maintaining the partnership between welfare groups and Government we can continue to drive effective change that leaves a lasting legacy and puts Ireland at the forefront of dog welfare in Europe.  I thank the committee for its time and I welcome any questions that committee members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022040600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649199600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, I welcome this opportunity to address the committee on the issues of canine welfare, including artificial canine insemination, canine fertility clinics, ear cropping and microchipping.  I am the chief inspector with the ISPCA and have been working with the society for almost 24 years.  The ISPCA operates a team of animal welfare inspectors who, since 2014, have been authorised under the Animal Health and Welfare Act.  This is a privilege which we value deeply.<\/p> <p>  In that time our inspectors have responded to over 27,000 allegations of animal cruelty and removed in excess of 8,000 animals from substandard conditions or care.  While the vast majority of these reports are dealt with by means of advice or instruction, ISPCA inspectors have also contributed to over 100 prosecutions for offences under the Animal Health and Welfare Act.  The ISPCA also operates three animal centres located in Longford, Cork and Donegal dedicated to the rehabilitation and re-homing of animals that are admitted by our inspectors.<\/p> <p>  The Animal Health and Welfare Act is a progressive piece of legislation that revolutionised the enforcement of animal welfare standards in Ireland.  However, as with most legislation, there is room for improvement.  The law, and those who enforce it, must also react and adapt to trends in society and it is some of these trends we will be speaking about today.<\/p> <p>  The microchipping of dogs regulations were introduced in 2015 and represent progressive legislation.  The regulations require that all dogs be microchipped and registered to their current owner with the details recorded on an approved database.  When it works, microchipping and registration is extremely effective.  It has been proven to be the most reliable method of reuniting lost dogs with their owners.  It allows for the identification of owners of dogs that are not kept under control and it can be used to hold those responsible for cruelty and neglect to dogs accountable.<\/p> <p>  Statistics might suggest that there has been widespread compliance with the regulations with most dog owners having their dogs microchipped but the reality on the ground is not so straightforward.  Registrations are all too often not kept up to date or the initial data recorded are not accurate or sufficient.  While a dog may be microchipped, that may not identify its current owner.  As in all areas of life, the compliant majority do the right thing but many others do not.  The fact is that in the world where I spend the majority of my working life there is little compliance with the microchipping regulations.  That is unlikely to change as there is currently virtually no enforcement of the law.  There are neither the required mechanisms nor the people dedicated to the task.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that the committee has previously heard from other witnesses as to the level of cruelty and suffering associated with the unnecessary and barbaric practice of ear cropping.  It is not just the pain that is inflicted during the procedure and its immediate aftermath.  Dogs can experience lifelong pain as a result of having their ears cut off.  The dogs are also impacted in other, less obvious ways, including their ability to communicate.  Dogs use visual cues to communicate and express emotion, and removing part or all of their ears severely limits their ability to do so.<\/p> <p>  Section 16 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act prohibits operations and procedures that involve interference with, or the removal of, the sensitive tissue or the bone structure of an animal.  Despite this, during the years that the Act has been in effect, dogs with cropped ears have become more and more prevalent, particularly the American Bully breed.  It is currently an offence to perform the cropping procedure, to cause another person to carry it out or to show a dog with cropped ears.  It is not an offence to import such a dog, to possess such a dog or to buy or sell such a dog.<\/p> <p>  While the ISPCA has submitted some files on this issue to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that have resulted in convictions, and there are more such cases in the system, they are very small in number compared with the amount of dogs that are being subjected to this mutilation on a weekly basis.  As the law presently stands, it is very difficult to prove offences in court.  The Minister has committed to a review of this aspect of the legislation.  The ISPCA very much welcomes this review and has submitted proposals with options including banning the importation, sale or supply, or even possession of cropped dogs. <\/p> <p>  The issue of public awareness is important.  There is no doubt that sections of the population not familiar with these breeds might not recognise that the dogs have been maimed but it would be a mistake to think that those involved in breeding, selling, showing and even buying these dogs are unaware of what has been done to the dogs and its illegality.  The truth is that the appearance of the dog after they are cropped is more important than the suffering they endure to achieve the desired look.<\/p> <p>  Canine fertility clinics and artificial canine insemination is an area with which the ISPCA has had little direct involvement yet.  We are aware that sperm is being bought and sold for thousands of euro.  We also know that canine fertility clinics are being established, sometimes by individuals with no veterinary training or expertise.  We have theories and suspicions about what procedures are being offered in such establishments but the fact is we really do not know what is going on behind their doors.  From what I have heard, and from what I believe the committee has heard, we do not believe that anybody knows.  That is the problem.  This is a new area in Ireland and the UK with which everyone is struggling to grapple and deal.  Our view is that it is an area that needs oversight and regulation.  I am happy to address any questions that committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022040600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Dowling"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for giving up their time to come before the committee and talk.

Representatives of Fido, one of the microchip databases, were before the committee last week.  They said that they record the colouring, gender and other information of the dogs concerned.

When we discover these issues, there seems to be little recourse as to what we can do to address them.  Each implanter is registered and identifiable.  There is normally a code associated with them on the registration so they can be identified.  There should be some sort of mechanism whereby, if there is a consistent problem with the information they are providing, it should be queried and questioned.  Last week there was a discussion about whether non-veterinary personnel should be allowed implant dogs.  There are some restrictions on who can do that.  Commercial breeders are not allowed implant chips.  The person cannot have any interest in the dog.  They cannot be the owner or related to the owner.  There are certain limitations.  However, there are still too many people with the right to implant dogs.  Even with some vets, there are issues with the information they provide.  We have queried what can be done about this and at the moment there does not seem to be much of an answer.  That suggests we should perhaps make a complaint to the Veterinary Council, which seems a very extreme step.  Surely it should be possible to raise this concern before it gets to that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022040600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Dowling"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649199600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I will just explain why it is so important that the information be up to date.  There are two reasons.  First is reunification.  If someone loves their dog and it goes missing, if it runs away in a park and the person does not know what has happened, they could be reunited if the information is up to date.  This is why we always encourage everyone to ensure they get in touch if they change their phone number, address or anything else.  They also need to make sure they change the details when they buy or acquire a dog by any means.  That dog should already be registered to whoever has the dog, who they are taking the dog from, no matter what age that dog is.  The certificate that belongs to that dog should then be passed over to the person and they can change the details.  Reunification is one major aspect but correct recording of details along the way also facilitates this sort of tracking and telling of the dog's story.  It enables transparency and enables owners to see where the dog has come from.  It enables rescues like ours to see what this dog has gone though, whether it came from a breeding establishment, was a stray, or turned up in a local authority pound and so forth.  If it is done correctly it can provide a lot of answers along the way.

It just checks whether the microchip belongs to this database or that one.  It would quicken reunification and allow people to see where the dog is coming from and where it started.  I might chip my dog on one database but if I give Mr. Dowling my dog and he takes ownership, he can register it on a different database.  It can change.  If there is a portal tracking these things, we can see.  Europetnet has that sort of European function right now if you were to check a number on that.  However, it does not provide contact details.  It is important that everyone knows that.  It does not provide the owner's number or address.  It just shows the dog was registered on this database or that database and it has a chronological function.

While on the one hand we are seeing a reduction in the number of docked dogs, and it is becoming more normalised to see Jack Russells, Dobermans and all those sorts of breeds that traditionally would have been docked in the past with long tails, at the same time we are seeing a proliferation of dogs with cropped ears.  A growing proportion of the population seems to have an interest in these dogs.  It is not everybody who is involved in canine fertility or breeding but some people who just like the breed.  Something to be aware of is that very often, whether the pups are cropped is the choice of the buyer.  The pups will be offered for sale and if the buyer chooses to have them cropped, they will be cropped at ten weeks of age.  The vast majority of the people involved in owning them are quite aware of this.<\/p><p>I use a photograph of a cropped dog in a presentation I do quite often and I ask people what is wrong with the dog.  The dog is immaculate other than the missing ears and a lot of people will not spot it.  In line with any education campaign we would have to address the deficiencies in the legislation because some people contact the ISPCA who say they have seen a Facebook profile of someone with dogs with cropped ears.  We have to explain that this may well be the case but that it does not necessarily represent an offence under the legislation or that it certainly does not represent an offence that we can prove.

It would make a lot of sense for them to be linked together.  The Deputy mentioned that a vehicle that is not licensed appropriately can be seized.  If a dog is not microchipped, theoretically, under the legislation, that is an offence and the dog could be seized.  However, it is not a practical option.  When we are talking about live animals, they are not like vehicles that can be impounded and stuck in a yard, or a bit of evidence that can be stuck on a shelf.  They are live animals.  They are very costly to maintain and there is also a welfare implication.  Certainly, as the Deputy has described, there is a disconnect between the licensing and the microchipping.

With that in mind and with a view to perhaps incentivising or encouraging people to microchip their dog, could technology be used?  For my own information, is it a universal scanner that reads all chips?  There are four different databases that probably relate to the four different producers of microchips.  I presume the microchips are all standard and there is a universal reader.  From my own knowledge, I know that to scan a dog, you need to catch it, have it in your possession and be very close to it.  Where are we with technology?  Does technology exist anywhere else in the world that can be used to scan a microchip on a dog from a distance and indeed, to tell, from a distance, whether that dog actually even has a microchip?  The point I am making is that down the line, if we get the legislation right and for enforcement, perhaps such a thing could be used as leverage to get people to microchip their dogs at an early stage.  It could be somewhat like the television licence man or whatever, and owners would know that there could be somebody passing on the road outside their fence that is able to tell from a distance that the dog is not microchipped.

It is very \"Tomorrow's World\" thinking.  I really like it.  Mr. Dowling can correct me if I am wrong and the ISPCA knows something that I do not, but I am not aware of any technology that exists like that.  To explain a microchip, it is described in legislation and has to conform to certain standards.  A microchip is around the size of a grain of rice.  It is that small.  It is put in the back of a dog in between the shoulder blades or around the neck area just under the skin.  It is not possible to see, from glancing at the dog, that it is microchipped.  A scanner is required.  Luckily, one scanner works on all four microchips, so that is one less problem we have to deal with.  It is brilliant.<\/p> <p>  Again, it is really about what is recorded against the chip.  The chip is useless unless there is anything good recorded against it.  What we have found is that the microchipping itself is not as much of a problem now as it was previously.  We spoke earlier about awareness campaigns and how the public need to know what a dog should look like and the correct appearance of certain dogs.  We are lucky in Ireland, with microchipping, because it has grown over a few years and there have been a lot of public awareness campaigns around microchipping, particularly with the its launch in 2016.  It really goes to show the effectiveness of good public awareness campaigns.  Referring back to what we discussed earlier, if we want to let people know what dogs really should look like, it is possible to run an effective public awareness campaign.  Microchipping has proved that.  We did research on behaviours and attitudes over the course of a number of years.  From around 2016 to 2019, there was a significant increase in the uptake of microchipping and people being aware that they had to have their dogs microchipped.  We are now seeing more dogs come in to our centre that are microchipped.  Where it is all falling down is what is recorded against them, as the representatives of the ISPCA mentioned earlier.  That is the really important aspect to it.<\/p> <p>  Of course, there is still an issue with ensuring that those who do not want to comply with the regulations become compliant.  We are very lucky that we have such compliant dog owners, who comply with the legislation and who chip and register their dogs.  In respect of those dogs that are not chipped, we have to figure out a way to make those non-compliant people compliant by chipping and registering their details.  To go back to the original point, recent surveys that we have done up to 2019 show that there is more than a 90% uptake in microchipping dogs.  It is about the correct data being registered against them.  On the Senator's point about technology, I hope something like that is developed in the future, because it would help a lot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022040600002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Lynch"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649199600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I would like to echo that.

With the information not being updated, sometimes that is caused by just a lack of awareness, knowledge, thinking and foresight.  Perhaps what we are dealing with is symptomatic of a bigger welfare problem.  For example, if an owner has not brought their puppy to a vet to have it vaccinated as a pup, they are not likely to have it microchipped.  It is all part of the bigger picture.

Unfortunately, I do not have enough information on the artificial insemination topic.  Perhaps the representatives of the ISPCA can speak to that.  On deceased dogs, it is a requirement under the microchipping of dogs regulations that deceased dogs are removed from the register or registered as deceased.  It is something that people might not be aware of.  In the turmoil and grief of losing a dog, it is not the first thing on an owner's mind to contact the database and register the dog as deceased.  It is something that could be communicated a lot more.  It is something that we would like to see databases being a bit more proactive on, as part of looking at the quality of the data that are in these databases and what we can do to ensure that those data are of top quality.<\/p><p>Part of this is checking whether the dogs are still alive or existing on the database.  It can lead to ensuring microchips are not being manipulated or used for another purpose.  What is to say that, if a dog dies, its microchip number might still be used if it is not be verified in any other way?  In Australia there is a system run by database companies.  A yearly reminder is sent to owners on the date their dog was registered asking whether they still have the dog, if their telephone number, email address or address changed and whether the dog is deceased.  It is as simple as clicking a button.  If someone is going through the emotional turmoil of losing a dog, it is just a reminder to click a button and it is done.  There is no having to call when the person is not there, no sending an email and no searching for the certificate and causing upset.  It is all automated.  This is something we would definitely encourage.

Would that help things?<\/p> <p>  I would like Mr. Brennan to elaborate on a second issue.  We are hearing that the dog breeding establishments legislation will be updated and we are promised that will require changes to the legislation.  Would the current guidelines be fit for purpose if they were brought into primary legislation or do they need to change?  I refer to the comments in Dogs Trust Ireland's opening statement on mechanisation and non-human supervision.

I know it does not fall under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but we very much welcome that this committee is addressing the issue.  It is to be hoped the Department will come before the committee to discuss it.<\/p> <p>  Dogs Trust is looking for joined-up thinking across the issue of the different pieces of legislation.  The question is whether that is the end goal.  It is a matter of Departments, particularly the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Rural and Community Development, looking to work together.  At present they are looking at different legislation across the issue.  They are reviewing all the key legislation.  From what we have seen, however, that has not quite transpired, so there is increasingly a lot of merit in this legislation falling under one Department, whichever it may be.  I stress that we are looking for an end result whereby there is joined-up thinking, but if the matter comes under one Department and that is what helps to bring this to fruition, all the better.  We would support that.<\/p> <p>  The guidelines were very welcome when they came out in 2018.  There is a lot of very good advice for the inspectors, for example, and on what dog breeding establishments should do within the guidelines.  I refer to hygiene, diet, clean water and so forth.  The problem is they are guidelines.  We would love to see them put on a statutory footing.  The one key issue within the guidelines I will raise is one that was referred to in our opening statement, that is, the ratio of one staff member to 25 breeding bitches.  That is completely untenable.  There could be 150 dogs and one full-time staff member.  That is a key issue within the guidelines and it needs to be addressed.  It points to some of Senator Boylan's other questions.  From having talked to the Department, we understand that even the idea of one full-time staff member to ten breeding bitches can be entertained, but that is a bare minimum.  Dogs Trust recommends one full-time staff member to seven dogs, not just breeding bitches, that is, one full-time staff member to three whelping wards.  That will give the committee an idea of the gap in standards that may exist in respect of dog breeding establishments.<\/p> <p>  It also points to Senator Boylan's question about mechanisation and non-human supervision.  To give the committee an idea of what is required, humans are needed in socialisation and habituation of dogs as well as in making sure there is no spread of disease and dogs are not in cramped settings and in their own excrement.  Those are the things on which humans need to interact with dogs.  They need to clean particular types of dogs in particular settings.  Automation and mechanisation does not bode well for the needs of particular dogs.  We would warn against that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022040600002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Brennan referring to automated feeding and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022040600002#J00700","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649199600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Yes, exactly.

That is where we come at it from.<\/p> <p>  As for puppy farms and illegal puppy farming, the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, I think, was seen as a means of ensuring there is a licensing business.  It was a baby step.  We had promises from the Minister and the programme for Government.  There was a recognition it was not in line with the modern perception of dog breeding.  A licence is needed only for more than five breeding bitches, for one thing.  There is a real need to strengthen the legislation.  Regardless of whether that would drive illegal farming underground, the concern should be whether the legitimate dog breeding establishments would have good welfare practices in line with the primary legislation.  That is the first port of call.  Addressing whether the practice would go underground follows, but strengthening the legislation needs to be a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022040600002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>The strengthening of the legislation leads on to my next point.

They give out the licences.  That is my understanding.  One of the problems we see repeatedly is getting access to those dog breeding establishment licences and getting access to the information on them.  I carried out an exercise whereby I contacted all the local authorities about this.  I went onto their websites first.  In lieu of legislation, in the very short term, should the Minister responsible for local government tell the local authorities they need to have the dog breeding establishments on their websites, easily accessible, and listing the number of breeding bitches as a first, very basic step?  That would then allow people to check if the information is in the advert in the first place.<\/p><p> I have more questions concerning local authorities and inspections.  If Mr. Dowling wishes to write to the committee in response to any of them, that would be great.  I understand the inspections are carried out by local authorities.  Are the local authorities resourced for that?  Is there a scattergun approach where some local authorities are very good but some are not?  Even though I am more likely to get a response than a member of the public, I have found it really hard to get information from local authorities about the number of inspections that have been carried out, the number of findings and whether a DBE has been closed down.

On the data piece, within the legislation, they must hold the records and make them available.  That is in its vaguest terms.

It is also key that there is an option to cross-check data, as the Senator described, against other databases.  It comes full circle and feeds into the new rules on the online supply of pet animals where, if one has a DBE licence, one gives the number.  What this does is empower the public.  Where there is a DBE registered licenceholder, members of the public can check where the DBE is, or its general vicinity, and they should be able to check how many breeding bitches there are and how many dogs are coming out of the dog breeding establishment.  It means that if members of the public choose to buy a dog, they know where the dog is coming from and they should know that the welfare standards are being upheld.<\/p> <p>  Inspections are key.  The Senator is right that there is an uneven standard across the country.  Local authorities have inspections.  It is important to stress that the guidelines contain a recognition that inspections can be unannounced apart from maybe the initial inspection of the premises.  Local authorities use that power.  The provision goes back to what is contained in primary legislation.  The guidelines, placed on a statutory footing, empower the inspector to say that this is in legislation and these are the hygiene standards, dietary standards and so forth.

ECN+ is intended to ensure effective and consistent application of EU laws, with close co-operation by its member states.  The Bill is also intended to strengthen the powers of the State in tackling white-collar crime, economic crime and corruption as part of the response to the Hamilton report, \"Review of Structures and Strategies to Prevent, Investigate and Penalise Economic Crime and Corruption\", which was published by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, in December 2020.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Deputy Troy, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is accompanied by his officials.

I thank all members for their support for the Bill at pre-legislative scrutiny and on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  As members are all aware, this Bill is long, and it is complex legislation.  The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to Directive 2019\/1 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018, to empower the competition authorities of the member states to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market.<\/p> <p>  The ECN+ directive is intended to ensure effective and consistent application of the EU laws with close co-operation by its members.  The ECN+ directive builds on the framework laid down in the EU regulation that sets up the ECN, namely, EU Regulation 1\/2003 on the implementation of the rules and competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  This Bill will implement one item from the programme for Government when it puts in place a new legal regime that allows the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, to use administrative financial sanctions when dealing with infringements of competition law.  The Bill will strengthen the powers of the State in tackling white-collar crime, economic crime and corruption as part of the response to the Hamilton report, which was published by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, in December 2020.<\/p> <p>  Since the publication of the Bill, some small errors have emerged, as have places where more precision or technical language should be used.  Also, other legislation that currently is being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, references similar terms.  It is the view of the Office of the Attorney General and of my Department, that standardising language across legislation that deals with the same principles and subject matter is extremely important.<\/p> <p>  Undertakings are dealing with an increasing number of regulations and legislation.  While this is better for society as a whole, it has never been the intention of my Department to introduce legislation that would needlessly hinder undertakings from operating.  It does not make sense to have different terminology across legislation drafted at the same time, and dealing with many of the same issues, except where a case can be made for its necessity.<\/p> <p>  As these legislative items that deal with similar matters are at a more nascent stage than this Bill, the need to standardise terms only became apparent in recent weeks.  I believe it is important to deal with these grammatical, technical and clarifying amendments in order that undertakings can better understand the rights and obligations that are being introduced in this legislation.<\/p> <p>  There are also more substantive amendments being introduced on Committee Stage.  I will give more explanation for the reasons and rationales behind them when we reach them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#B00300","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>We will now move on to the Bill itself and we will proceed section by section.

Section 35 of the Bill clarifies that the existing section 39(3) of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, covering the powers of authorised officers of ComReg, does not apply to the competition powers being introduced through this Bill.  Instead, two new subsections, (3A) and (3B), are included in section 39, which give the authorised officers of ComReg powers to mirror those of the CCPC when each is acting as a competition authority.<\/p><p>Because of the clarification in section 35 that section 39(3) of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 does not apply to authorised officers of ComReg in relation to competition matters, that subsection should not be included in the definition of what should be considered a breach of procedural requirements for competition investigation.  The provisions already refer to the new subsection (3B), which is the correct reference for investigations into potential breaches of competition law.

Amendment No. 4 introduces a definition for &ldquo;commercially sensitive information&rdquo; into the Bill.  It is important that there is legal certainty surrounding the key terms that are used throughout this Bill.  In the drafting of the Bill, which was published in February, it was felt that &quot;commercial confidentiality&quot; as a term was easily understood.  In legislation, terms that are in common use in an industry are understood to take on the meaning that they would have within that industry.  It was a concern that defining the term might be difficult and that if the definition was too narrowly defined, it may unnecessarily restrict the operation of sections of this Bill.  However, after discussing the matter further, the Department is of the view that it is more important that there is certainty for undertakings in how the legislation operates.  Therefore, a definition is now necessary.  <\/p><p>The definition, as put forward in this amendment, clearly defines the term as it is understood to operate in competition law, that is, information that is disclosed would create substantial and material harm to undertakings.  The intention is that the term &ldquo;commercially sensitive information&rdquo; will be used throughout this Bill.  I believe that by including this amendment, we will clarify the legislation and make it easier for undertakings to understand and to navigate the provisions that are laid out in the Bill.  <\/p><p>The remaining amendments in this group reflect the decision to replace the term &quot;commercial confidentiality&quot; with the term &ldquo;commercially sensitive information&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;commercially sensitive information&rdquo; is more widely used, particularly in relation to competition law matters.  Therefore, using it would provide greater clarity for undertakings.  This will work to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are clear and are easily understandable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#B01600","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 5, 27, 31 and 33 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

These amendments are not policy driven; they are merely tidying up the draft.

As section 35 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 covers authorised officers in relation to both competition matters and consumer protection matters, this amendment clarifies that this only relates to competition law matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#D05300","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 40:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 28, to delete lines 35 and 36 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;statutory duty, of the competent authority, a member of staff of the competent authority, an authorised officer or an adjudication officer the&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#E00100","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 41:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 29, line 7, after &ldquo;35&rdquo;

Section 15AF provides that adjudication officers are bound by ministerial regulations when making decisions.<\/p><p>However, there was no obligation that adjudication officers should have regard to any regulations or guidelines that may be made by the competent authority.  As adjudication officers are acting under the delegated authority of the competent authority, there are some guidelines of the competent authority that the adjudication officers should take into consideration in carrying out that delegated function while still maintaining their independence as an adjudicative function.  One example is guidance, which the CCPC is preparing on foot of stakeholder consultations, on a methodology on how adjudication officers should go about calculating an administrative financial sanction they intend to impose on foot of a decision taken.  In the interests of transparency and giving some legal certainty to undertakings, the use of a common methodology on matters to be considered and how such a calculation should be undertaken by adjudication officers is something that they should be bound to take into account.  However, that methodology would not, in itself, lay down what level of administrative financial sanction should be imposed.  This ensures that adjudication officers remain independent in their duties in that regard.  There are also other guidelines an adjudication officer should have regard to, such as how an oral hearing should be conducted.<\/p><p> These amendments are intended to clarify that, while remaining independent in their function of considering the results of an investigation and making a decision on whether an infringement of relevant competition law has occurred, adjudication officers should have proper regard to relevant guidelines on how they should conduct their decision-making role.  Amendment No. 88 clarifies the text in section 12(1).  Amendment No. 89 deletes the existing subsection (3), with amendments Nos. 90 to 92, inclusive, being consequential renumbering of the remaining subsections.  Amendment No. 93 expands the provision in section 15AG to allow authorised officers, as well as competent authorities, to follow such procedures for the conduct of an investigation as they consider appropriate, subject to the guidelines or other rules that may be in place regarding investigations.  Amendment No. 94 is consequential to the inclusion of authorised officers within this provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#E10100","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 89:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 59, to delete lines 1 to 3. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#F00300","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 90:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 59, line 4, to delete &ldquo;(4)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(3)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#F00500","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 91:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 59, line 6, to delete &ldquo;(5)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(4)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#F00700","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 92:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 59, line 9, to delete &ldquo;(6)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(5)&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#F00900","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 93:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 59, line 13, to delete &ldquo;a competent authority&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;competent authorities and authorised officers&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#F01100","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 94:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 59, line 14, to delete &ldquo;it considers&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;they consider&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#F01300","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 95 to 112, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#F01500","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 95:<\/p> <blockquote> \t.

The application for confirmation of the decision of the adjudication officer can only be made after the time period for appeal of that decision has expired.<\/p><p>These amendments are aimed at clarifying the meaning of the sections and fully transposing the ECN+ directive, while ensuring that the Bill is clear and unambiguous. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#G03600","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":406,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 134:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 81, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t&quot;(ii) An undertaking or association of undertakings the subject of an order on consent under section 15X(8) may appeal to the Court against that decision not later than 12 working days after the undertaking or association of undertakings receives notice of such decision under section 15Y.&quot;. <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#G03800","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 135:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 81, line 10, to delete &quot;(ii)&quot;

The CCPC brought to the attention of the Department the fact that there is little guidance in how limitation periods apply in cases of civil enforcement proceedings.  The Statute of Limitations Act 1957 contains a six-year limitation period for actions for breach of statutory duty.  In the absence of any express limitation period under the Competition Act 2002, the general six-year limitation period for actions for breach of statutory duty could be applied by analogy to civil enforcement actions brought by the CCPC.<\/p><p>To date, the CCPC's practice has been to adopt a six-year time limit for initiating legal proceedings under section 14A of the 2002 Act in order to reduce the risk that any proceedings could be found by a judge to be time-barred.  However, whether civil enforcement actions brought by the CCPC are subject to any statutory limitation period is an issue that has not yet been considered and adjudicated upon by the Irish courts.  Legal proceedings taken by the CCPC could potentially be characterised as a public enforcement action, for which there is no statutory limitation period.<\/p><p>With respect to the new administrative regime, the CCPC considers that it would be very helpful for the primary legislation to clarify that there is no statutory limitation period for the CCPC to initiate administrative proceedings.  Investigations into potential breaches of competition law are normally complex can take a long time.  For example, the recent investigation into price signalling in the motor insurance sector was started in 2015 and only concluded in 2021.<\/p><p>It is not intended to allow the CCPC to delay in taking proceedings, where those are necessary, but it is also important the CCPC is afforded sufficient time to undertake its investigations and gather all the evidence necessary for proceedings, and that those proceedings do not then fail due to timing issues.  I consider this to be a useful clarification for the CCPC to enable it to be more effective as it undertakes investigations and enforces competition law in the future in the public interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#G07900","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":450,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":451,"content":"<p>SECTION 22<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 153 to 155, inclusive, and 157 to 159, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#H00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 153:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 103, line 30, to delete &ldquo;definition&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;definitions&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>Amendments Nos. 153 and 154 include a new definition needed for section 10 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 on relevant competition law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#H00400","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 154:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 103, to delete lines 31 and 32 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo; &ldquo; &lsquo;Regulation of 2003&rsquo; means Regulation (EC) No. 1\/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty;<br \/><br \/>&lsquo;relevant competition law&rsquo; has the same meaning as it has in the Act of 2002;&rdquo;.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#H00600","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Section 22, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":458,"content":"<p>SECTION 23<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 155:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 103, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(a) in paragraph (c) of subsection (1), by the substitution of &ldquo;on its own initiative, in response to a complaint made to it by any person, or to assist with an investigation conducted by the European Commission or a competition authority of another Member State in accordance with the Regulation of 2003,&rdquo; for &ldquo;either on its own initiative or in response to a complaint made to it by any person,&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#H01000","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":460,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 156 and 160 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#H01200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 156:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 103, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(a) in subsection (3) by the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph (j)&mdash; <blockquote> \t&ldquo;(ja) shall promote the interests of consumers by providing information in relation to price increases in the energy and fuel sectors,&rdquo;.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>I am hopeful the spirit of agreement which has broken out recently will continue.  We shall see.  I submitted amendments Nos. 156 and 160 to enable me to converse with the Minister of State on the need for the CCPC to promote the interests of consumers by providing information on price increases in the energy and fuel sector.  This is a topical subject.  The CCPC already undertakes this type of activity in respect of the financial services sector and promotes the interests of customers by providing information concerning financial services.  The CCPC does great work, but what I am interested in hearing the Minister of State comment on is if he thinks that work could be expanded slightly to cover the energy and fuel sector.  In the context of the current energy and fuel crisis, consumers would be open to receiving easily understood and digestible information regarding price increases in the sector.<\/p><p>Turning to amendment No. 160, during the past 18 months when energy and fuel costs were rising and international experts and analysts were predicting further rises, little by way of information was provided for consumers.  Often, the information consumers get is that the price has gone up, after that has happened.  With that in mind, consideration should be given to tasking the CCPC with undertaking analyses, studies and surveys on energy and fuel cost increases and publishing the information, which will only benefit customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#H01300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for her proposed amendment.  I genuinely and fully understand the spirit in which it is being tabled.  We are all at one in this area.  We are all aware of the present volatility in electricity, gas and fuel prices.  In part, this is being driven by geopolitical factors and the war in Ukraine, which we all heard about earlier during President Zelenskyy's address to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  When we hear what the Ukrainian people are dealing with, we are fortunate we are in a position where we have an operating democracy.  While we can disagree, we do it respectfully.<\/p> <p>  The CCPC has publicly confirmed, and representatives from the organisation have appeared before this committee, that it is assessing a significant number of complaints received concerning fuel prices at the pumps, including in the context of the excise rate cut brought into effect on 10 March 2022.  As part of this process, the CCPC is engaging with the complainants and the industry and will obtain any additional information required.  The CCPC has publicly committed to providing an update on that work in due course.  When I met the chair of the body, I asked him to do that as quickly as possible.  The CCPC is conducting that work under its existing powers and in response to many complaints in the context of unusual market conditions.<\/p> <p>  The proposed amendment to section 11 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 encompasses several markets, covering electricity, gas and oil.  Several relevant State bodies already have responsibilities for these sectors.  Electricity and gas markets are interlinked in several ways and come within the scope of the sectoral regulator, which is the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  The CRU conducts market monitoring and publishes regular reports on conditions in the electricity and gas markets, including information on average prices, switching and renegotiations and changes in the market shares of suppliers and generators.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications provides data to the European Commission on consumer prices for the weekly oil bulletin, including home heating oil-gas oil, unleaded 95, and diesel and heavy fuel oil.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO&rsquo;s, monthly consumer price index, CPI, includes the component \"Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas &amp;amp; Other Fuels\" and is another way in which prices in these markets are tracked.  I believe the proposed amendment to section 11 of the 2014 Act is therefore not required as the CCPC&rsquo;s existing functions and powers under that Act are sufficient to permit it to undertake a study or analysis of any market, which may include energy and fuel markets.<\/p> <p>  I must also consider how the proposed amendment to section 11 of the 2014 Act could seriously impact on the ability of the CCPC to carry out its primary functions.  There is a risk that the proposed amendment could lead to an expectation that the CCPC would become a price monitor or regulator for the energy and fuel sectors.  This would be a significant change to the role of the CCPC and would create difficulties in the ability of the CCPC to deliver coherently on its primary functions.  Therefore, while I thank the Deputy for her proposed amendment, unfortunately, we are unable to accept it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#H01400","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>The CCPC already does something similar concerning financial services.

This Bill will give the CCPC additional powers so that if it finds companies engaging in uncompetitive behaviour, be it in the energy sector, insurance sector or any other, it will have for the first time the capacity to impose administrative sanctions.  A very welcome development in the directive and legislation, which I hope we will enact in the coming weeks, is that there will be a leniency provision.  This will give comfort to somebody in the sector with in-depth knowledge to come forward and assist the CCPC in doing its work.  When somebody in a sector exposes a matter or acts as a whistleblower, we can really get to the bottom of things.  This Bill will be very beneficial to the CCPC.  At present, the CCPC can conduct further analysis if it deems it warranted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#J00100","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I propose to withdraw the amendment but I reserve the right to table it again on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State and his officials for all the work that has gone into this Bill.

In the past two budgets alone, the CCPC has received an increase of over 30%.  It currently has 146 staff and intends to increase this to more than 200 by the end of this year.  If the CCPC assessment is that additional funding is required based on the structures required under this Bill, it can submit an increased Estimate bid as part of the budget 2023 negotiations.  This bid is subject to agreement by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment and, if approved, will be incorporated into the overall departmental Estimates package, which will be the subject of negotiation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for budget 2023.

Accounting for projected spending is the norm.

I get that if certain policy and other decisions are taken in the interest of the performance of the CCPC but, on matters such as funding and resources, I have a concern over what would occur if a Minister deliberately underfunded the organisation to ensure it could not do its job effectively.  There is no suggestion at all that any current Minister has any intention of doing this.  Should a Minister deliberately underfund the organisation to ensure it could not do its job effectively, the chairperson should be allowed to raise that, at the very least, with a committee, particularly where funding and resources are an issue.<\/p><p>This is more of a belt, braces and baler twine-type approach to insulate the CCPC from something that might happen.

I will give her a little context for where we are coming from.  The CCPC is a statutory body and the legislation underpinning it gives it statutory functions that give effect to policy.  It has a number of functions under section 10 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, which include the power to make recommendations to the Government on any matter impacting on consumer protection or competition, making recommendations to the Government on proposals for legislative change concerning consumer protection or competition, and submitting to any Minister proposals for amendment of an enactment, or for a new enactment, concerning consumer protection or competition.  Thus for the chair to criticise policy would effectively be to criticise the CCPC&rsquo;s own statutory functions, although I accept the Deputy is not talking about policy but resources.<\/p> <p>  Advice is given by the CCPC, and frequently sought by the Minister, in examining policy under the remit of the agency.  This is a fundamental tenet of the CCPC as the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, noted during the Oireachtas debate when the CCPC was being established in 2014: \"The objective here is not to direct the ... [CCPC] in any area where it has independent freedom of movement and its own statutory remit.&rdquo;  The prohibition on commenting on Government policy serves to protect the CCPC's independence in its enforcement functions.  The CCPC does not consult with the Department in respect of appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment or before the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is part of ensuring the CCPC has full independence in carrying out its statutory duties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#K00200","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I will raise a scenario, for example, where a Minister deliberately underfunds the CCPC to the extent that it cannot carry out its statutory functions and the chairperson appears in front of the Committee of Public Accounts or any other committee and is questioned on it.  If it happens to be Government policy to not direct funds in that way, the CCPC is precluded from commenting on that.  I am not suggesting it is a problem we have now.  As I said, this is something for the future, but to the extent that the CCPC may have the capacity to bring those concerns it could not do so if was considered policy, even though the Committee of Public Accounts or this committee are the very places it should be bringing those concerns.  I am not trying to bounce the Minister of State into accepting the amendment, but does he agree there is some merit in affording that protection?  He talked about the protection that is there and protecting the independence of the CCPC.  That is very important but, equally, it infringes on the CCPC's independence if it cannot come before a committee to talk freely about a matter of Government policy, which in this instance specifically relates to funding and resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#K00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I will point out the State is bound by EU law to fully resource competent authorities, including a competition authority.

That framework, as provided for in the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, is quite dated and in need of complete overhaul.

That is not to say that these powers will not be available to the CCPC.  I am assured that they will be introduced as part of that comprehensive exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#L00500","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Is the Minister of State withdrawing the amendment or deferring its introduction for the moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#L00600","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I am.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#L00700","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":524,"content":"<p>The Minister of State was going to seek clarification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022040600002#L00800","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I am moving amendment No. 168, which relates to surveillance.

The proposed amendment will not make any substantive changes to the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act.

Deputy Conway-Walsh had a view on the definition of a trade union.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with the student union piece first.  I am supportive of what Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in is trying to achieve.  The only reference to a student union in the body of the Bill is in section 16.  The other references to a student union are amendments to the Universities Act, the Technological Universities Act, the Regional Technical Colleges Act and the National College of Art and Design Act.  The amendment, if passed, would not change the definition of students in those Acts.  It is always frustrating when Ministers give technical reasons as to why an amendment does not work, but we need to reflect on how to achieve what the Deputy wishes to achieve.<\/p> <p>  I fully accept and want to be clear about the fact that student unions are independent bodies.  They are autonomous and established for the purposes of promoting the general interests of and representing students.  We all engage on a regular basis with the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and I want to thank it for that engagement, in particular during the Covid pandemic.  I met its representatives and discussed their views on what the Deputy is trying to achieve in the Bill.  I will consider this further between now and Report Stage.

I need to flag that there is some legal concern in terms of how we do this correctly and ensure there are no unintended consequences which I know the Deputy does not wish to have.<\/p> <p>  On amendment No. 6, I also intend to obtain some legal advice on this before Report Stage.  I note that the terminology recognising trade union and staff associations is used in other legislation in the education sector without a definition.  To be truthful, what we have tried to do is replicate what has been done in other legislation in the education sector.  I need to make sure there are no unintended consequences or knock-on effects in terms of definitions and how that transposes across other legislation.  I will consider amendment No. 6 further and may bring forward an amendment on Report Stage.

Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are my attempt to do that.  I note the Deputy's amendments Nos. 14, 16, 17 and 212.<\/p><p>These amendments address the objects of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, which provide that the HEA shall have regard to certain objects in performing its functions.  I am proposing an amendment to the object set out in section 8(1)(<i>b<\/i>).  The intent is to strengthen the provision with regard to the Irish language in the Bill.  It is now proposed that this object will read:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo support designated institutions of higher education in contributing to social, economic, cultural ... and environmental development and sustainability through leadership, innovation and agility; and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, such support shall include the promotion and use by those institutions of the Irish language. <\/blockquote> <p>The HEA is required to have regard to this object in performing its functions.  I acknowledge Conradh na Gaeilge's work in bringing forward this amendment.<\/p><p>I am also proposing other amendments in the Bill to strengthen the provision in relation to the Irish language, including an amendment to section 9, which we will get to later, regarding the functions of the HEA, and to section 33 with regard to the strategy for tertiary education.  As I said at the previous outing on this legislation, I am proposing ten Committee Stage amendments to strengthen the role and promotion of the Irish language.  As I did at the previous meeting, I again acknowledge the work of Deputy Conway-Walsh on this and, indeed, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, who I see has joined us now and who also corresponds with me on this matter.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 24, in section 9, which relates to the functions of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, provides that the HEA shall support &quot;the educational and skills needs of persons in Gaeltacht areas ... and outside of such areas with regard to the promotion and use of the Irish language&rdquo;.  I will flag at this stage that I may even look to further strengthen that.  I intend to engage with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media further on this between now and Report Stage.<\/p><p>Similarly, I will mention amendment No. 58 in section 33, which relates to the strategy for tertiary education, now so I do not need to speak to it later.  This provides that the Minister shall have regard to &quot;policies relating to ... the promotion and use of the Irish language&quot; when preparing the strategy for tertiary education.  This will ensure that the promotion and use of the Irish language will form part of the strategy for tertiary education.  This is important.  It is quite significant because the strategy will set the policy direction for further education for training and higher education and research for a period of up to ten years.  My team and I believe that we are achieving the same aims with our amendments Nos. 7 and 8 and the proposed amendments I outlined to sections 9 and 33 as Deputy Conway-Walsh's amendments Nos. 14, 16 and 17.  I am not being argumentative on them.  I think we have potentially landed at the same place between amendments Nos. 7 and 8 in this section and the amendments I am bringing forward in sections 9 and 33.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 212 proposes to insert &ldquo;to provide for the strengthening of Irish medium higher and tertiary education&rdquo; into the Long Title of the Bill.  I am not proposing to accept this amendment as the Long Title lists the general key provisions for the Bill.  I think this provision is too specific for inclusion in the Long Title.

I welcome the news that he will look again at further amendments.  That is good news.  One of the reasons I submitted these amendments along with Deputy Conway-Walsh was to try to get a debate around the additional - it should not be a burden - responsibility on the HEA.  Without sight of those, we will still argue these out and maybe persuade the Minister when he is putting his amendments together to take on board some of the content of the amendments we tabled.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 8, I am not sure about the wording and what is meant by \"without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing\" in this context.  What could be unfairly prejudiced by a duty to promote the use of Irish?  It is the phrase \"without prejudice\" I am querying.  It is a good debate and hopefully we will move forward with some of the amendments that myself and others have proposed.  I believe this would be important, even if the Minister mentioned that amendment No. 212 should not be included in the Long Title.  Often, when changes like that are suggested, they are left to one side.  If it is not in the Title, it is seen by those who have a duty to implement the legislation as not having been stated.  We have a job of work to do to make sure that as we amend the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022, nobody can be under any doubt regarding the duty the HEA already has in terms of the promotion of the use of Irish.

The central word in each of the amendments is &ldquo;transparency&rdquo;.  A matter being discussed by the committee at the moment is the future funding of third-level education.  We all acknowledge that there needs to be improved funding at third level, and while the State does make a very significant contribution to third-level institutions in this country, it is not the exclusive funder of third-level education.  We have a responsibility in paying over money to third-level institutions to make sure that the values of this State are reflected in how the money is spent.  For that reason, there should be an obligation on third-level institutions to provide details of transparency or from whence their other funding is derived so that the State can be happy that the values behind the other funding sources are commensurate with the values of the State.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 10 is a very simple one.  It proposes that after the word &quot;performance&quot; to insert &quot;improve transparency with regard to private funding streams&quot;.  If I am honest, I would prefer if it had even more teeth than it currently does.  It strikes me as an innocuous enough amendment at the moment.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 100 and 102 are perhaps more detailed.  Amendment No. 100 refers to &quot;including disaggregated data regarding private and public funding sources, and funding streams from entities outside of the designated higher education institutions that operate substantially for the benefit or under the auspices of the institutions, both inside and outside the State&quot;.  The reference to &quot;outside of the State&quot; is important in terms of knowing where the money is coming from.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 102 refers to &quot;a transparent, ethical framework for selection or acceptance of private funding streams&quot;.  That again is about ensuring that the funding that arrives into third-level institutions that complements the funding given by the State should be commensurate with the values of this State.  In one way or another, these three amendments go towards making those changes within the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#C00700","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I support the three amendments because we need greater levels of transparency on the private revenue.

For the record of the committee, I will state the factual position as of now in the legislation.  It is noted that conditions of funding apply when Exchequer funding is provided to a funded body.  As the Deputy has alluded to, there are not conditions relating to private funding sources, but he is arguing for the need for transparency around it, or at least more transparency in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Having looked at the matter, there are two areas in this Bill that are relevant to trying to achieve some of what the Deputy is trying to achieve.  Section 48 provides that: \"A designated institution of higher education\" or a funded body shall furnish to the HEA any non-personal data requested by the HEA, \"in the format so requested\".  This data may include financial data.  What we are doing in this legislation is enabling the HEA to request any data once they are not personal data - we all understand the reason for that - and the ability of the HEA to request it in a certain format, and being very clear that the provision does include financial data being provided to the HEA.  We believe that the enabling ability to do this is already provided for and that there is an ability through this legislation for the provision of data on private funding streams to be sought and secured by the HEA.<\/p> <p>  I also note the second change.  I am not sure we have discussed enough in regard to this legislation that under section 126 the HEA may \"issue guidelines, codes or policies to designated institutions of higher education\".  Again, it would be entirely appropriate that a guideline, code or policy could include the issue the Deputy is seeking on private funding streams.<\/p> <p>  It is important to give my clear view on the matter.  While colleges and universities in the sector have every right to seek private funding - some of that can be very good in terms of relationships and collaboration and we all agree with that - the duty in regard to being more transparent is important.  It is important not just for reasons of transparency but for the reputation of an institution.  I am aware that the joint Oireachtas committee has considered issues concerning human rights, for example, so I am entirely in agreement with Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh on the need for transparency.  The idea of ethical frameworks, guidance and codes of practice is entirely where we need to be.  Where I am not necessarily disagreeing, but where I intend to reflect further between now and Report Stage, is whether we need to be more prescriptive in legislation or whether we have achieved what we are seeking to achieve in sections 48 and 126.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#C00900","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":609,"content":"<p>This is something I would like to see addressed.

Each HEI functions independently in sourcing private income and this makes assessing the full scale and source of the private funds in the sector difficult.

I do not think they are controversial and I will take the Deputies through them.  Amendment No. 11 is a technical amendment to align the wording of section 8(1)(c) with section 9(1)(c).  We are changing the word &quot;from&quot; to the word &quot;in&quot;.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 20 amends section 9(1)(c) to &quot;secure and evidence value for money in the expenditure by An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s of moneys provided to it under <i>section 19<\/i>&quot;.

This is a new provision to replace the old section 9(1)(c) to provide that the HEA can assess the performance of funded bodies with regard to securing value for money in the expenditure funding provided to them by the HEA.  Amendment No. 200 is simply a consequential amendment reflecting the new provisions in section 9.<br\/><br\/>The other amendments in this grouping are from Deputies Conway-Walsh and &Oacute; Cathasaigh, namely, Nos. 12, 21, 28 and 29.  They are similar to some of my amendments but they are seeking to provide accountability and transparency in the use of funding under the Act.  I would argue that amendments Nos. 11, 20 and 31, which I am introducing today, provide for accountability and transparency and we have strengthened the original Bill as published.  It should also be noted that the designated institutions of higher education are fully accountable for the use of the funding provided under this Act in accordance with Part 3, Chapter 2, sections 37 to 42, inclusive, of the Bill, which provide for the provision of funding, conditions for funding, compliance with the conditions of funding and remedial and other measures.  We will get to a section on autonomy later in the Bill and we have been clear that while institutions are autonomous, they also have to be accountable for funding.  The idea that conditions of funding can be attached is an important development on Part 3, Chapter 2 of the Bill.  Section 63 of the Bill, which is the section on the accounts of certain higher education providers and the provisions on the keeping and auditing of accounts in the sectoral legislation, also provides a significant degree of accountability for the use of Exchequer funding.  It is in light of the amendments I am bringing forward today and the provisions we have put into this new Bill in section 63 and in Part 3, Chapter 2, that we are addressing and strengthening accountability in the Bill.  Therefore, at this stage I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 12, 21, 28 or 29.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#C01300","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I want to speak to amendments Nos. 12, 21 and 28.

Transparency is not negotiable but dictating what represents value for money could potentially infringe institutional autonomy.  It is not always easy to draw a line between education, research and beneficial outcomes for society but we know that all evidence internationally shows that strong and independent institutions provide the best education and research outcomes.  On amendment No. 21, again we oppose the term \"value for money\" because institutional autonomy means making choices on what does or does not constitute value for money.

We can all point to areas where there has not been value for money and there have been some high-profile cases that have damaged institutions, which none of us want to happen.  I want to be clear that there is no disagreement on autonomy or academic freedom and academic freedom remains the law of the land.  We have worked to strengthen autonomy and be clear throughout the Bill on the importance of same but it is entirely possible to be autonomous and at the same time be asked to satisfy the HEA on value for money.

Nowhere in the Bill makes any reference to the public nature of our higher education system.  The value of having a public education system cannot be overstated and the public nature of same should also not be taken for granted.  We have seen the wholesale commercialisation of higher education over the last ten years and in some cases we have seen piecemeal privatisation.  Most people would be shocked to find out that more than one third of the primary school teachers we train come from a single for-profit private college and that the same college is moving into nursing this year.  People would also be shocked to find out that we provide millions of euro in funding to private colleges through competitive funding.<\/p><p>This represents a chance to draw a line in the sand.  This limited reference to the public sector in the general scheme was taken out and in the Minister's briefing note on the Bill he highlighted the Bill's role in providing a pathway for private colleges to become designated institutes for higher education, which we discussed in the previous meeting.  This is also included in the Long Title as one of the key aims of the Bill.  I understand that nothing in this Bill specifically states that designated institutes of higher education will be entitled to public funding and having met the Minister's officials to discuss this, they assured me this was not the intention.  However the Bill is full of references to the HEA's role in supporting designated institutes of higher education.  I believe this creates a huge grey area.  Once private colleges become designated institutes of higher education, they will want State funding.  They already get roughly &euro;20 million per year of public funding and their case will only be made stronger by this Bill as it stands.<\/p><p>We want the public nature of the higher education system to be referenced and protected in the Bill in order to remove that ambiguity and place a strong emphasis on the importance of maintaining a public higher education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#D01100","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I wish to speak in support of the Bill and to reiterate a point made by Deputy Conway-Walsh in respect of primary school teaching.

I wish to be clear in respect of wanting to develop, enhance and protect a public higher education system.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh referenced the funding discussions on how to sustainably fund higher education.  I intend to bring proposals to Cabinet, likely this month, in that regard.  I look forward to coming back here to debate that.  My proposals will robustly address that commitment to properly support and fund a public higher education system.<\/p> <p>  I do, however, need to make a couple of brief points.  Deputy Conway-Walsh referred to her engagement with my officials on this issue.  It is important that there is a pathway in the Bill for an institution to seek to become a public institution, or a designated institution in the first instance.  I know the Deputy and I do not disagree on this.  I am not trying to suggest that we do.  There are institutions, however, such as Mary Immaculate College and the National College of Ireland, that do not currently have clear legislative pathways in respect of how they become a designated higher education institution, HEI.  It is important that we do not have to come back to primary legislation every time that happens because this is a sector that is evolving and changing.  That is the policy intent behind the pathway - no more and no less.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh is correct.  There are occasions when funding is provided to private and not-for-profit higher education institutions.  In fairness, she acknowledged that such funding is generally competitive funding.  If I withdrew that funding, I think she would give out to me because it is generally provided for very good reasons.  It is provided where we identify a sectoral challenge or issue.  It could relate to a specific group - I do not like the word \"cohort\" - of students in a certain region or a certain grouping such as disadvantaged students.  It is generally done where there is a need to respond quickly to an emerging issue.  I could reference specific examples - I am sure the Deputy could do so too - but I do not want to single out examples.  That is the purpose, however.<\/p> <p>  The strategy for tertiary education is the show in town in terms of an outline for how we want our higher education system to develop in the next ten years.  One of the key parts of the Bill is that the Minister of the day will prepare a strategy.  We will get onto that later in the Bill.  That strategy will show the policy intent for the following ten years.  That is where the policy intent should always reside, rather than in primary legislation.  Ministers come and go and elections happen.  The Bill allows the Government of the day to set out in the strategy for tertiary education how it intends to develop policy for the sector for the next decade.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy stated that designation does not entitle funding.  There will be institutions that want to be designated HEIs but are not seeking to become public institutions.  There will also be institutions that may wish to become part of the public system.  Indeed, the Deputy may wish them to become part of it.  I do not propose to accept the amendment for those policy reasons I have outlined.

Precarious employment has been allowed to spread throughout higher education.  This needs to be a specific responsibility for the HEA.  Governance of the sector must relate to the working conditions of all workers in the sector.  According to the OECD, Ireland's student to staff ratio is 23.4, which is far out of line with the OECD average of 15.1.  This can only be addressed by a new, sustainable funding model.<\/p><p>In an effort to address the need for student-facing staff, colleges have engaged occasional or hourly-paid lecturers.  These employees are not technically lecturers as lecturing staff are defined as those contracted to undertake a range of academic duties encompassing teaching, research and contribution and scholarly activity.  Across the higher education sector, different job titles or terms are used to describe those engaged in this manner, including part-time teaching assistants, part-time assistant lecturers, occasional lecturers, etc.  Those engaged in this manner are usually on short, fixed-term contracts and are only paid for their teaching.  They have no opportunity to engage in research work, even though being active in research is core to the role of a lecturer and the higher education sector.  Trade unions recently informed this committee that some institutes of higher education have failed to afford the terms of the public sector agreements to those engaged in this manner.  The precarious nature of this engagement is further compounded by the fact that there is no sectoral engagement on industrial relations matters across the university sector.  None of this will be new to the Minister.  I hope he will accept this amendment, or at least the principle that the HEA should have a role in this area.  It is something we have to tackle head-on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#F00300","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I accept the need to address the issue of precarious employment, and the need for the HEA and funding institutes more broadly to be active in this space.

To be very clear, academic freedom is something on which we are all agreed.  It becomes more important by the day.  To be very clear in relation to democratic values and everything else, academic freedom is the law of our land and remains so.  There is nothing in this Bill that in any way dilutes, modifies or changes the reality that academic freedom is fully and robustly defended and legislated for in this country.  I want to state categorically that this Bill does not affect the autonomy or the academic freedom of a university or any other higher education institution.  I do not think anyone can say this is a rushed Bill.  The process has gone on for a number of years.  There has been a lot of engagement and consultations with stakeholders, as is right and proper, to get this right.  At all times during the drafting and development of the legislation, protecting the autonomy and academic freedom of institutions was a key principle that was considered to ensure it would not be affected.  While I alluded earlier to the improvements we have made to the Bill by working together, I wish to be very clear that academic freedom is not something that was in any way missing or absent from the Bill.  Indeed, long before the Bill was even drafted, the key principle of academic freedom and institutional autonomy was protected.<\/p> <p>  Academic freedom is specifically provided for in section 14 of the Universities Act 1997, section 10 of the Technological Universities Act 2018 and in section 5A of the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006.  This Bill does not amend those provisions relating to academic freedom.  They come with us, as it were.  In addition, the objects of the Bill include a provision on academic freedom.  According to section 8(1)(f), in performing its functions, An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall have regard to the object of respecting \"the academic freedom of higher education providers and academic staff in those providers\".<\/p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has suggested, it is important to protect the freedoms of academic staff.  Given there is already provision in the sectoral legislation which comes with us as we pass this Bill, and considering the reference relating to the objects, we are categoric in our view, and on the basis of legal advice we have taken, that academic freedom will not be affected, diluted, modified in any way, shape or form by this Bill.<\/p> <p>  There is also a provision in the objects of the Bill on autonomy, which is interlinked somewhat, relating to designated institutes of higher education, \"to acknowledge the responsibility of designated institutions of higher education for the performance and governance of those institutions\".  While we are trying to get the balance right around transparency and accountability in some of the issues we were discussing, the autonomy of the institutions is very clearly recognised and protected in the provisions on the objects of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I should also say that section 37 relates to a funding framework for all designated institutions of higher education.  It relates to the schemes and programmes run by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, with the use of public funds, and not the courses run by higher education institutions, HEIs.  Therefore, in relation to amendment No. 99, it would not be appropriate to include provisions in legislation around courses and student numbers.  However, such a provision may, and indeed, one would imagine will be, included the performance agreement by the institutions and the HEA.<\/p> <p>  I genuinely accept the bona fides of Deputies &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Conway-Walsh, the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in on this issue, but I am very satisfied that academic freedom is protected in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#H01000","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's response.

It sets out in section 9 the functions of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s in planning higher education provision and research and it lists a number of functions.  They are not as explicit as we would like in its function relating to the Irish language.  That is why we believe that one of the functions should be to plan for a progressive increase of opportunities to study and conduct research through the medium of Irish.  At the moment that is not available for students.  While there are 16,000 students who pursue their education through Irish at second level they do not have the opportunity to continue their studies as Gaeilge.  There are some notable exceptions and there is progress being made but the Bill is not explicit enough in our view in terms of the functions of the An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s that they must plan for Irish-medium higher education provision at a much greater rate than it has to date and also that it should also have a duty not only in what is set out in the Bill so far to meet the needs of the individuals of businesses and enterprise, professions and so on but  also to meet the needs of Gaeltacht communities.<\/p><p>This duty should also cover Irish speakers nationally, as well as, for instance, the EU institutions that have specific needs in respect of the Irish language given the language's recognition and the number of translators that they set out in their requirements.  <\/p><p> One of the big changes that is going to be, for want of a better term, forced upon the Irish public service results from our passage of the Official Languages Act (Amendment) 2021 earlier this year.  As an Oireachtas we have now set a target of 20% of all recruits in this regard.  Most of the recruits to the Civil Service and public service have been coming from universities at certain grades but if we are to try to reflect the demand for 20% of recruits to the service, it will not be at clerical officer or messenger level or grade, which is the grade I was at when I was in the Civil Service and I believe they got rid of after I left.  There is a need for our universities to provide courses so that we have the ability to recruit those who are fluent in the Irish language and, therefore, it is required, not just because of the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, but where there is a function of an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s with regard to the promotion and use of the Irish language.  That amendment is well and fine but our suggestions in amendments Nos. 22 and 23 go further than that where they refer not just to the promotion and use of the Irish language but specifically address the provision that is now required under the Official Languages Act (Amendment) 2021, and to also cater for a need or a discrimination in some ways for generations, where there was no provision of Irish language courses in all aspects.  <\/p><p> The outliers in this debate are Ollscoil na h&Eacute;ireann, Gaillimh, which always had a specific role, and Dublin City University, DCU.  These universities proved that a successful course can be run and a number of people can come through a course, such as in the Fiontar section of DCU where people received business training and the university conducted out its course entirely through the Irish language.  I went to UCD, however, where there was very little in that regard.  I could study Irish if I wanted, which I did, but I could not study history through Irish.  I could sit exams in Irish but not study it.  If I wanted to study history at the time, I would have to have attended University College Galway, UCG, as it was at the time, and that is still the case today.  How many years later is it now and the provision has not increased.<\/p><p> One of the issues we will encounter later, where I have mentioned the 16,000 students at second level, is that there are even more students at primary school level.  We do not have the exact figures as to how many students are proficient in the Irish language or who attend Irish language schools at university level.  There are pupils who attend English-speaking schools who are fluent in Irish and who would also like to study through the Irish language, so there is a mismatch there.  Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 try to capture that and reflect it in greater functions in an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#J00900","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I find myself in agreement with the Deputy, not in where we are placing it in the legislation but in respect of what he is trying to achieve.

In section 34, there is a heading, &ldquo;Planning for provision of higher education&rdquo;, and within that, section 34(4) refers to an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s making recommendations to the Minister in respect of requirements for student places.  At the moment it lists a great deal of different things that it may make suggestions or recommendations about, but not about the Irish language.<\/p><p>I believe that the Deputy is on to something in respect of the need to look at how we strengthen such provision.  We could work with him in respect of what his amendment is trying to achieve in section 34 in, potentially, two places.  I do not want to be overly prescriptive in these discussions and we need to engage with him on this but, first, the legislation as currently drafted states: &ldquo; An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall plan for the provision of higher education in the State by maintaining an on-going review of the demand for it ... [and] may, for the purposes of <i>subsection (1)<\/i>, consult with&mdash;&rdquo;.  It then goes on to refer to assessing the demand for higher education at regional levels, and, in section 34(4), which is probably the most relevant subsection, the recommendations on places.  It is in sections 32 and 33, as currently drafted, that I believe we can currently work with the Deputy and I may well table an amendment on Report Stage.  I can engage with the Deputy before Report Stage on this.  I take the point he has made.<\/p><p>I was in Luxembourg yesterday at EU meetings and was talking to a translator.

I am not sure where is the best place to insert the amendment, whether it is in section 34 or in this section and I will reflect on that.  It is important that this new aspect be covered.  As the Minister said, the Bill has been in gestation for quite a long time, as had the Official Languages Act (Amendment) 2021, but it managed to get through the hoop a great deal more quickly and it has very significant implications for every aspect of public service.  I have reflected that and have had a number of meetings with different Departments, as Chairman of Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge, in trying to make those Departments aware of their, in some cases, onerous responsibilities now within a very tight timeframe, and the fact that the world has moved on.  The EU recognition jumped ahead of the Irish language in some cases and gave greater status and now, all of a sudden, we have to deal with that to ensure it is reflected here, which is good.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 39, which I did not mention but which I will move, deals with the fact that the current system does not capture the numbers who are in full-time Irish language courses.  The system has some information and states that there are so many engaged, as stated in answers I received back to parliamentary questions I raised recently in preparation for this Bill.  I was surprised, however, at these figures.<\/p><p>They were not inaccurate, but they were not full.  They were not complete figures that were usable for anybody.  It gave lists of students who had courses in which there might have been an element of Irish language rather than an Irish-language course.  We do not know the true figure but it is approximately 2,000 if one takes even courses that have a small portion of Irish tuition in them.  That is a big drop from the number of 16,000 going through schools.  Obviously, they are at different levels in secondary school.  I cannot remember the figure for primary schools although it is higher again and, thankfully, growing each year.  However, it means that there is a challenge for any institution, particularly the &uacute;dar&aacute;s, into the future.  If we capture it now, the planning can start for ten years hence so the courses will be available for the children who are in primary school now and coming through in the future.<\/p><p> That said, I have no problem withdrawing the amendments and working with the Minister to see if we can capture what we tried to do in these amendments in a Report Stage amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#K00600","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I take the point the Deputy makes regarding where best to place what he is trying to achieve in the Bill.

Cross-Border student enrolment is broadly seen as mutually beneficial in economic, social and cultural terms.

A targeted strategy is required to channel political support and bring about positive change.<\/p> <p>   In 2019-2020, 2,085 students from the Republic attended higher education institutions in the North.  This equates to just 3.5% of the overall student body in the North.  This has declined from 4,280 or  7.6% over the past ten years.  In terms of cross-Border student enrolment, the most recent available figures are for the 2020-2021 academic year and show that 1,624 students from the North attended higher education institutions in the South.  This means that students from the North make up less than 1% of third level enrolments in the South.

One of the arguments that I have put very strongly, and I pushed it at a bilateral meeting with the UK's Secretary of State for Education recently and raised it on a number of occasions with his predecessor, Sir Gavin Williamson, is that we need a piece of research to be done where we ask students from Northern Ireland why they are not choosing to study in the Republic and <i>vice versa<\/i>.

We also need to see collaboration in the north west.  The Deputy and I were at the launch of the Atlantic Technological University on Monday.  We need to see an opportunity now, for example for the ATU, to plug in and collaborate.  I am fully in agreement with the Deputy on this matter.

Amendment No. 41 is slightly stronger as it deals with &quot;Irish medium education&quot; and &quot;language planning&quot; rather than just &ldquo;the promotion and use of the Irish language&rdquo;.  Perhaps we can examine the matter.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 44 reflects on who will be nominated by the Minister or who will adjudicate on policy in terms of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  It is the membership of the board that we deal with.  Given the failures of the HEA over years, as we set up &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta we should have within its members those who reflect and will champion the interests of the Irish language community and Gaeltacht areas.  That is why we have stipulated in amendment No. 44 that at least one of the persons appointed shall be representative of a Gaeltacht area.<\/p><p>I do not know how specific the Minister wants to be, but there must be some way we can ensure those who work in Irish-medium education, such as an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Foras na Gaeilge and so on, can have a voice at that level so that what we have seen since the 1971 Act came into force is not repeated and we ensure the Irish language is a consideration at all times.  Iit should, perhaps, be the foremost consideration, but I am a realist and understand how society works.  At least, it should be a consideration throughout.<\/p><p> As regards amendment No. 46, we have had this argument previously.  I raised it during the discussion on the Official Languages (Amendment) Act.  It relates to the need for those who are chairs of various boards to have an understanding of the Irish language.  In the case of the amendment, we are asking that the Minister seek to ensure that the chairperson of the board is able to communicate proficiently in Irish.  It is not a significant ask, given that the vast majority of people in the higher education system have come through the Irish education system and, theoretically, many of them have that proficiency anyway.  The Minister may be surprised to learn how widespread are Irish speakers.  Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta celebrated its 50th anniversary last weekend.  It is an organisation that can find an Irish speaker anywhere in the world.  In the middle of the Ukrainian situation when the Russians were attacking, it was able to find a Ukrainian who spoke Irish and could explain exactly her circumstances and what was happening.  There are far more people with a proficient level of Irish than we give credit for; they just do not speak it regularly or do not get the opportunities to do so.  We need to not play down that but, rather, make sure that it flows, especially if we believe the Irish language is central to our education.  It is a small ask for the chairperson of the board to have that proficiency.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 49 is trying to ensure that 20% of members of the board have a proficiency in Irish.  This is another amendment that has been recommended by Conradh na Gaeilge.  I do not know if the Minister has listened to it on other amendments thus far.  The amendment proposes that 20% of the members of the board shall have a level B2 or higher proficiency in spoken Iris on the common European framework of reference for languages.  This relates to the system that is used for the Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge.  It is not a B2 in the leaving certificate; it is a specific ability that I believe is attainable by people who may wish to be chairperson of such a body in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#M02400","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":730,"content":"<p>What would we do if we do if we did not have Conradh na Gaeilge?  It is clear from my engagement with all Deputies on this series of amendments that it has been very proactive in respect of the Bill.  I do not think anyone in the history of campaigns has got 100% of what he or she is seeking.  Conradh na Gaeilge has managed to make a lot of progress.  The Deputy is correct.   There are areas on which I have a different view.  I will explain why that is the case.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy largely welcomed amendment No. 42, which I tabled, although I acknowledge that he prefers the wording contained in his amendment.  The rationale behind my amendment is that when a Minister is considering who should be on a board and what background and expertise that person should have, the promotion and use of the Irish language would  now be specifically included as one of the criteria that can be considered.  As one who has had the honour of being a Minister for a few years, I know the significance of this in the context of submissions received in respect of board appointments and the likes.   Let us say Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh is looking to be appointed to this board and there is a table with various columns for qualifying criteria, this amendment means that he could qualify because there will now be a criterion-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#N00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":731,"content":"<p>I think I would qualify on that one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#N00300","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":732,"content":"<p>The Deputy might qualify on many.  The amendment will make the promotion and use of the Irish language visible to the Minister of the day when he or she is going to fill the board. It will very much put that on his or her radar.  I believe it is quite significant and Conradh na Gaeilge does too.  I am pleased we have been able to do that.  That is the agreement bit.<\/p> <p>  Where I do have a different view is in respect of quotas on the board.  My fundamental problem with that is that there are so many groups that could make that argument.  One could argue that we should have a quota of people who are speaking up for or representing those with a disability or have a disability themselves, for example.  The Deputy and I would see great benefit in that expertise being reflected.  However, if one starts carving up the numbers on a relatively small board with specific ring-fenced quotas, the flexibility of the Minister to put together a competency-based board in the round is diminished.  That is my view.  I am making this point in a genuinely non-partisan sense.  I trust that the Minister of the day will make the correct appointments through a rigorous public appointments process and on the basis of the criteria set out, now including the Irish language as a specific criterion.  That is giving the Irish language a prominence that we have chosen not to give to some other areas that one could argue are of equal importance.  My worry is that if quotas of 20% were to be introduced in respect of various specific criteria, there could only be five such apportionments.  That is the challenge.  We have done this.  I did it in the Department of Health when I introduced the new HSE board.  One has to decide whether a board should be representational or competency-based.  I am not suggesting those are mutually exclusive but we are going for a competency-based board and the promotion and use of the Irish language will be one of the criteria.  That is my best way of explaining it.<\/p> <p>  I am a little terrified by the idea that appointees will have to show their results in a particular test.  For example, I appoint people to the board of Science Foundation Ireland.  They are very qualified and accomplished people.  I have never asked them to show me what they got in a science exam or a maths exam.  I am not dismissing these ideas out of hand; I am just thinking out loud somewhat.  I cannot think of a comparable situation in which we tell people to show us their grades but I accept that is the position Conradh na Gaeilge and the Deputy have put forward.  My view is that, comparing where we are at now with the HEA board and where we will be at as a result of the legislation, the visibility and promotion and use of the Irish language will be significantly enhanced in the context of its inclusion as a criterion for qualification for a person joining the board.  The Deputy and I will not agree on this but I believe that to go further could be somewhat unworkable or challenging in terms of trying to balance the ranges of interest and expertise one would want on the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#N00400","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":733,"content":"<p>I have absolutely no problem with withdrawing amendment No. 41, given the progress that has been made in the context of amendment No. 42.  As regards the other amendments, it is difficult in the context of putting a board together.  It is about ensuring that it is captured.  We all live in the hope that it will be captured in the way the Minister believes it will by virtue of the inclusion of the criterion in respect of the promotion and use of Irish, but we lived in that hope for many decades in the context of trying to promote the representation of women on State boards.  The change, however, only happened when we legislated for it.  Change might be needed in future to reflect our diverse society if that does not happen naturally.  One of the reasons Conradh na Gaeilge and I have argued for these amendments is because that has not been happening.  There have been opportunities in the past but ability in the Irish language was not seen as a benefit in the context of appointments to boards.<\/p><p>I am aware of the whole system of appointments to boards and the Commission for Public Service Appointments.  I too will be dealing with two appointments to TG4 at a Houses of the Oireachtas committee in the next couple of weeks and this, in some ways, is a novel approach with appointments through the committee and the Minister.  There are different ways in which appointments can be made.<\/p><p> I will press this amendment but I will have a look again at it.  I will talk to Conradh na Gaeilge and others to see if there is a way of capturing what we want to capture without being too onerous on the appointments system.  The key part we are looking for is to ensure the board has an understanding of the importance of the Irish language and to ensure an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s, which is what they are representing, has that to the fore.  Over the years I have found that people who do not speak the Irish language often do not understand the challenges those of us who do speak, or who want to continue education as Gaeilge, have, even on a day-to-day basis in just getting our rights and in our interactions with the State.  That is the frustration that has led to these amendments from Conradh na Gaeilge, and not just on this Bill.  It is also on a number of Bills over a long time.  The conradh would be first to acknowledge the huge progress in recent years in particular and progress by virtue of the fact the Minister has adopted some of its suggestions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#N00500","speaker":"1485","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":735,"content":"<p>To be helpful, there are two things.  While accepting it is not where the Deputy wants to get to fully, reading the wording in the Bill, the change is significant in that the Minister of the day is being told by the legislation that \"members of the Board shall be appointed by the Minister [of the day] from among persons who, in the opinion of the Minister, have sufficient experience and expertise relating to\".  The promotion and use of the Irish language is there; that is the change.  I have thrashed this through with Conradh na Gaeilge a few times.  Far be it from me to speak for it but I believe its concern is that while it may be grand and well intentioned to include this in the legislation, will anything have changed in five years or ten years&rsquo; time?  I can understand this and that it is built on years of experience.  Again, not to speak for Conradh na Gaeilge, but it was asking of me whether it would be possible to review the provision or check to see if had made a difference.  There may be some scope in that space to discuss it.  The Minister of the day cannot review his or her own appointments to a board.  I am being very honest with this committee in advance of Report Stage and I want to be helpful.  I am not going to find myself in a position on Report Stage of being in agreement with quotas.  That is being truthful and to be helpful.  Again, if I think the aim here is to make sure the new promotion and use of the Irish language as a criteria is impactful, I believe this might be the space in which we should constructively think between now and Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#O00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We now have significantly improved reference to the Irish language and its promotion in the objects and functions of the HEA.  This section needs to be read in conjunction with the provisions that already are in the legislation in terms of what must be contained in the annual plan, including the requirement to outline the proposed activity and specify the proposed allocation, the monitoring arrangements and how an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s shall have regard to its objects.  Those requirements now include the Irish language.  In fairness, when these amendments were being drafted, that was not covered.  The changes we have made mean the Bill now contains a number of additional requirements as to what must be contained in the annual plan.  There are four specific requirements and the annual plan shall now capture the changes we have made in regard to the Irish language.  It is my view that the issue is now adequately addressed.<\/p> <p>  In regard to amendment No. 53, which proposes to insert a reference to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, my view is that there are several places in which reference is made to consulting with other Ministers, as appropriate.  That captures the Deputy's requirement and ensures there is consistency across the legislation.  There will be occasions, under this Bill, on which the Minister of the day will be required to consult with other Ministers.  It might be the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in regard to the Irish language and, on another occasion, it might be a different Minister and in respect of a different matter.  The standard provision across legislation has generally been that requirements in this regard are captured by reference to consultation with other Ministers of the Government, where such is necessary or required.

I will look again at section 9, where functions and all of that are defined, to ensure that this is, in fact, captured in the annual plan.  If it is not, I will come back with a further amendment on functions.  The Minister stated that it is not necessary to be prescriptive if the functions already cover what I am seeking to cover.

Perhaps we could consider the range of amendments the Deputy has submitted on the climate and biodiversity emergency in the round.  I committed to doing this the last day.  We can see where there may be opportunities to strengthen this Bill, and I am happy to do that.  The Deputy is correct; my speaking note tells me we do not list legislation because it already applies.  Even from a clarity perspective, sometimes it can be cleaner not to do so as well.  I do, however, take the point he is making regarding the emergency in this respect and the need for it to be reflected in all legislation we enact.<\/p> <p>  Something else I would like to explore, and I am asking myself this question out loud, concerns section 126.  Again, this is a section we might perhaps be talking about after we have passed the Bill, because it is an enabling section.  It is significant that the section empowers the HEA in respect of guidelines, codes and policies being issued to designate institutions of higher education.  That enables the authority to issue new codes, policies and guidance encompassing the relevance of \"the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021\".<\/p> <p>  I imagine what committee members are wondering, because I would be if I was in their position, is how they can be sure the HEA will move on this aspect once the legislation has passed.  This is something I would like to reflect on.  I make this point regarding this amendment and more broadly as well.  Overall, we do not want to be extremely prescriptive in listing all guidance, codes and modes of practice in the context of a range of important issues, including the climate emergency.  We do, however, want an assurance that once the legislation is signed by the President and becomes the law of the land that something is going to happen in these areas.  There is a responsibility on me to reflect on how I respond to this aspect more broadly as well, because section 126 is significant regarding the ability to do things on climate.  <\/p> <p>  It is equally significant regarding other issues I have been working on with the committee.  These include taking a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment and consent, as well as many other issues that arise and that cause us, as a society, to say they must be addressed.  Undoubtedly, when this legislation is passed, whomever is Minister will be regularly asked in the D&aacute;il about section 126.  There are also references to this aspect in the consultation section and, therefore, I would like to reflect on the climate and biodiversity emergency with the Deputy and other members in the round between now and Report Stage.  I would also like to try to develop my own thinking regarding where the HEA is, and will, be concerning its priorities in the context of this new section 126 power.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#R00400","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":817,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":818,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 60 and 61 are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2022040600002#R00600","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":819,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 60:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 32, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(c) the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education,&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>On the same theme of the strategy in this legislation, all the conversations we have had about the sector for which the Minister is responsible have come down to funding.

I will begin by introducing in general terms the draft statutory instrument and the background to it.  The Office of the Ombudsman performs a vital role in ensuring good administration across the civil and public service.  Part of this role includes investigating complaints in regard to particular incidents and issuing findings.  Decision letters issued by the office to complainants will include all the basic facts and evidence gathered during the investigation process.  They also outline the position of the service provider as reported to the Ombudsman as well as the Ombudsman's evaluation of the merits of the case and the basis for any of his findings and recommendations.  To make the investigation process effective, there must be a certain space where the Ombudsman can engage with complainants, public bodies and staff members.  This is reflected in section 9 of the Ombudsman Act which restricts the dissemination of information relating to an investigation.  This facilitates the full co-operation of bodies under remit in the provision of all the necessary records required for the examination of complaints, the nature of which is often highly sensitive.  This approach is in line with what is seen globally in similar institutions.<\/p> <p>  On the other hand data protection rules provide for a number of rights to seek access to personal data as well as asking for personal data to be amended or deleted in some circumstances.  When the general data protection regulation, GDPR, was passed, it was anticipated there would be a need in certain instances to balance individual data protection rights with the ability of public bodies to carry out their statutory functions.  Accordingly Article 23 of the data protection regulation allows for data protection rights to be restricted in appropriate circumstances.  Under the previous data protection legislation, investigations by the Office of the Ombudsman were completely excluded by way of a statutory instrument.  That exclusion lapsed when GDPR and the 2018 Data Protection Act were passed.  This statutory instrument is part of the implementation process for the GDPR and will regularise the position of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office in line with what was anticipated in the data protection regulation.<\/p> <p>  Under Article 23 of the data protection regulation as well as section 60 of the Data Protection Act, rights may be restricted to protect what are referred to as important objectives of general public interest.  One of these is identified as avoiding obstructions to any official or legal inquiry, investigation or process.  In practical terms, what is at issue here is the potential for data protection rights that are fundamentally directed at privacy and the fair use of personal data to be used in a way that was not intended as a means of undermining, delaying or derailing the Ombudsman's office in the performance of its functions.  For example, an official named in a complaint to the Ombudsman may attempt to use data protection rights to access personal data relating to them and from there to seek amendment or erasure of those data to undermine or delay the investigation being carried out by the office.  Similarly, a complainant may attempt to use repeated data protection requests as a means of micromanaging the conduct of an investigation.  Such scenarios as these are far removed from the core purpose of data protection and would have a seriously detrimental impact on the ability of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office to do its important work.  In this context it is necessary to give the office of the Ombudsman the option to refuse to act on data protection requests only in some circumstances.<\/p> <p>  However, it is not a blanket exemption, as was the case under the previous legislation.  The proposed regulations take a measured and proportionate approach, providing for a number of safeguards to ensure they are not applied in a disproportionate way.  The draft statutory instrument is the product of a long and detailed engagement between my Department, the Office of the Ombudsman and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.  It has been approved by both the Data Protection Commission and the Department of Justice as being in compliance with the letter and spirit of the GDPR in accordance with sections 60(9) and 60(10) of the 2018 Act.  Under these regulations, data subject rights can only be restricted to the extent that it is necessary and proportionate to prevent an interference with the performance of the Ombudsman's functions in the particular circumstances.  Whether and to what extent a restriction applies to a particular request will to be determined case by case.  Where an individual is unhappy with the approach taken by the Ombudsman, it will be open to him or her to make a complaint to the Data Protection Commission.  The regulations are supported by a set of organisational policies maintained by the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office.  Under section 6(5) of the 2018 Act these regulations may be made once it has been laid before both Houses and approved by way of positive resolution in each.<\/p> <p>  In the circumstances, I recommend to the committee both that these regulations are necessary and that the approach taken is a meticulous and balanced one.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their time today and am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022040600002#B00300","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":896,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  This is exactly the approach that should be taken.  I have not seen, and I do not know whether we have received, a copy of the proposed regulations, which it would, of course, be important to see in terms of the detail.  I am glad to see section 60 of the Data Protection Act and Article 23 of the GDPR used properly.  Very often, when we are told things cannot happen because of GDPR and there are limits, it excludes the fact there are those very clear provisions where there is a strong public interest that could be served which allow for the appropriate making of necessary and proportionate regulations and which would be applied case by case.  Those are the big tests.  We often see either blunt attempts to create an exemption from GDPR or people saying their hands are more tied than they actually are.  We have come across this in such areas as social protection, human rights practice, adoption and personal information, and information related to forced adoption.<\/p> <p>  This is good.  This is an exemplary approach, and I commend the Ombudsman and the Minister of State on it, in that it specifically sets out the question of necessity of proportionality and it is also very clear that these regulations will be applied case by case.  In that context, in principle, I am supportive of it but my concern is that I have not actually seen the regulations.  It would ideally be good for us to see it because we know there is much difference in the detail in this regard.  Of course it is very important for the Ombudsman's office in particular to be a place where people who may be vulnerable in bringing a concern forward can engage and where that vulnerability would not be exacerbated or we would not have an avoidable chill effect in terms of people coming to the Ombudsman.  I understand the rationale for this.  I am happy with how it is being proposed to move forward, with the exception that I would like to see the regulations.

That indicates that the appeals process would also need to be dealt with in a timely fashion.<\/p> <p>  It is quite reasonable.  I do not have many questions on it.

My argument, then and now, is that we were all given leave by the electorate to raise any issue that was within our rights to raise.  That is virtually every issue.  We have to use our judgment.  We have to respect privacy and so forth.<\/p> <p>  However, by and large, the European Union in its promotion of GDPR was following other European countries many of which had ministers that had never been elected, a bit like the American system.  It rightly applies to people who were never elected.  It does not apply, however, nor should it be made apply to elected Members of the Houses of Parliament.<\/p> <p>  I have been asked, as I am sure other public representatives have, if we have the permission of the individual or the group to raise the issue.  What if we do not?  If we were complaining about the individual or group, would we have to get permission from them to raise the issue in that way?  What do we have to do?<\/p> <p>  All in all, giving the individual, Department or group that might be at odds in terms of sheltering behind the legislation an order not to give the information that is necessary adds up to a delay and slows down the process.  It continues to happen, as we speak.  The need, first, last and always, is to observe the right of an elected Member of Parliament to raise an issue in the House on any subject, or to raise an issue on behalf of or against a constituent, on behalf of the electorate or anybody within the House.  Intervening to that extent is an interference with democracy.  It does not work.

That impedes the progress of any investigation that might follow.<\/p> <p>  There is an increasing danger that to achieve speed in terms of efficacy and efficiency, about which I am not so sure, we should in some ways curtail the rights of Members of Parliament to raise and deal with the issues with which they were elected to deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022040600002#C01100","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":909,"content":"<p>As we all know, GDPR is a European directive.  We implement it but we do have some latitude in how we do it.  Part of it is that one of the principles in GDPR is that one can process data in a way that is consistent with primary legislation.  If one wants to use personal data in a particular way or if the State needs to use it in order to carry out its functions, one can pass a law to do that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how Deputies use personal data, it is a matter of fairness that when a constituent sends in personal information to a Deputy and asks for help with it, the Deputy checks with the constituent first that he or she is happy for the information to be taken and shared with other agencies.  I know it is a delay but it has to be done.  Otherwise, the person may be surprised the Deputy took his or her personal information and brought it around to a set of other people.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what a Member says in the Oireachtas, of course, Members have constitutional privilege and can make reference to people's personal data, if we want to, in the Houses, without fear of breaking any laws.  To that extent, our Constitution allows us to do that and that is part of our legislative basis.<\/p> <p>  When we look at GDPR, we try to make sure that there is a legislative basis for what we do with the data and that we use it in a fair way.  At the same time, it is always a balance of rights.  On one side, there is a person's privacy and on the other, the need to carry out the functions of the State to delivery services to the public.  The two have to be balanced up together.  That is what is happening with this exemption for the Ombudsman.<\/p><p>Many parliamentary questions are refused nowadays, presumably based on GDPR.  When we table them, the private information in the answers is not revealed.  Answers state \"details supplied\", which covers a multitude.  There should be a right to table a question on behalf of a constituent regardless.  A constituent knows full well that when he or she refers an issue to the elected representative, the latter will have to do something with it.  It is a waste of time on two counts if the representative has to go back to the constituent to ask whether it is acceptable to process a question.  That would be nonsense altogether.  I am not blaming the Minister of State for this, but it is a fact of life.  I have never seen that kind of application of the rules.  I am aware that the legislation is from the EU.  I opposed it all the way.  In the past couple of days, we had an example of the EU coming to a decision on the basis of the retention of information along lines that apply in any case.  I do not accept that at all.  The reality is this: the State needs to protect itself and run itself.  I am obviously pro-European, but an issue can arise if the EU or a branch thereof tells us that it is very sorry and that its interpretation stands, based on considerations of the European courts, if you do not mind.  I do not mind the European courts coming to decisions but I remind them of the important point that they must have regard to the rule of law in individual member states.  If they undermine it on the basis of freedom of information or the need for privacy, that is fine, but they need to be aware of whom they are doing it for.<\/p><p> There are several issues of importance to us, and we need to recognise them.  The concept of writing to somebody to ask for permission to raise the issue they want us to raise makes a laugh of the elected public representatives.  All journalists have to do is send in a freedom-of-information request; they do not have to ask anybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022040600002#C01200","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":911,"content":"<p>I take the Deputy's points.

I understand the Deputy's frustration from having asked parliamentary questions myself and from having had all the important information edited out.  I am not sure where it gets changed.  Is it a matter for the Office of the Ceann Comhairle or whoever sets the rules on D&aacute;il questions?  Perhaps we can make new legislation &mdash; we are all legislators &mdash; to allow for the information to be published at the time it is used, so it will be useful and will not be presenting information in the abstract.

Some ask for written consent from the constituent and some do not.  To clarify the position, there is a need for someone to set out a template for dealing with Members of Parliament, in particular, because we are here for a purpose.  Some of the regulations on GDPR are a little vague in that respect.  Clarifying the role of a Member of the Oireachtas is important.<\/p> <p>  There has been much consultation on the regulations, which I have to hand.

That will frame the answers I give to the Deputy.  As he stated, we are now in the final stage of the exit from the EWSS.  Most businesses will exit the scheme at the end of April and some businesses, mainly hospitality businesses that were affected by the 8 p.m. closing time, are due to exit at the end of May.  We currently have 22,000 employers and 260,000 employees supported by EWSS.  Although it is not possible to be absolutely definitive, we expect that by the end of this month, 18,000 of those 22,000 employers will exit EWSS.  That is equivalent to 160,000 employees.  We expect a considerable majority of the employers and a majority of the employees to leave EWSS in a few weeks, with the balance then due to exit at the end of May.<\/p> <p>   As regards modelling or analysis we have done in respect of the number of businesses that could find themselves facing challenges due to this, we have not been able to form a view in respect of businesses that could be at risk.  Indeed, we ran the EWSS for the duration we have to give businesses the best chance of being viable because they were viable before Covid hit.  I hope, therefore, that the vast majority of businesses will be in a position to return to successful trading, but I expect it will be towards the end of the year that we will have a better sense of whether the viability of employers will be affected.

It is simply the case that more workers are needed for some parts of our economy.  The Deputy is aware of the pressures on the work permit scheme as we try to bring new people into our economy to fill vacancies.  People who performed jobs in some parts of our economy before Covid hit are making the decision to change sectors and do other work.  The restaurant and hospitality sector, which is before another Oireachtas committee at the moment, is on the front lines in that regard.  As the Deputy knows, it is having considerable recruitment difficulties.  It has indicated in some of its pre-committee statements that it views this as a major challenge to having a successful summer period.

Sections 5 to 10, inclusive, list those schemes, including a number of them administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  One such scheme is referred to in each of the six debt warehousing sections as the scheme commonly known as the &ldquo;live performance support scheme phase 4&rdquo;.  Since the Bill was published, the name of that scheme has been amended in the way I described, and these amendments simply update the references accordingly.  I commend them to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#C00600","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":952,"content":"<p>On amendments Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, obviously, that is just a change of name.

Obviously, this was a very important provision that allowed for a bit of comfort and space for businesses.  We see that, across the sector, about 10% of the eligible debt for warehousing has been warehoused, about &euro;3 billion out of the &euro;30 billion.  Different companies responded in different ways in taking up the initiative.  Some are paying back the warehouse debt that has been paid while others are warehousing a portion of it.  About 5% of the businesses have warehoused all of the Covid-19 debt, which makes up about &euro;300 million and 12,000 businesses.<\/p> <p>  The period now is coming to an end and we will start the period of a zero interest rate for a 12-month period until the end of April next year, after which the interest will start to kick in as normal, so there is still that window of comfort for individuals.  However, we have seen, and this is probably understandable, a low level of insolvency during the pandemic because of these measures that have kept companies on life support in some cases and, in other cases, that were just a comfort they needed to be able to trade through.  However, we saw an abnormally low level of insolvency.  Has there been any modelling within the Department to show what will happen as this timeframe lapses, there is a requirement on the companies to start to pay back the debt and the interest starts to kick in?  There have been suggestions in some quarters that a substantial amount of the &euro;3 billion that is warehoused could have to be written off as bad debt as companies may fold.  I just want to understand the Minister&rsquo;s assessment.  As always with any of these schemes, and we went in with eyes wide open with this scheme, there was always going to be a case where the Government was not going to get everything back, but without it, we would have had companies fold left, right and centre.  Has there been any early assessment by done by Revenue or the Department on where they see the total amount of the &euro;3 billion?<\/p> <p>  Adding to that question, given where we are at with the war in Ukraine and with it being one crisis after another - a pandemic followed by a war and economic sanctions that are having an impact not just on households and workers but also in some sectors and businesses, particularly those that have higher energy consumption or cannot access the type of materials they would have accessed heretofore - is there any consideration within the Department to looking at the debt warehousing timeframes for specific sectors that would be affected by the ongoing war in Ukraine and the economic consequences that flow from that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#C00900","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":955,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  The key issue first is what the Government has done to try to offer support to companies that will be facing difficulty or viability challenges as we exit from the emergency supports that are in place.  As the committee will be aware, we have put in place two significant legislative changes to try to provide support to smaller businesses, in particular, that find themselves in this difficult point.  First, we amended the Companies Act 2014 through an Act that was brought in place recently to extend the examinership process and increase the threshold at which a company is deemed unable its debts up to &euro;50,000.  That was a change made by the Government to help companies manage this moment of transition.  We have also brought in the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, which is a kind of dedicated and specific process to help small and micro companies that may have to go through a period of restructuring.  We have looked to amend the examinership model to help companies in that way.  Critically, we have made changes in our procedures to help companies when they approach this point.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's question whether we anticipate how many companies will not be in a position to repay their debts, again, the answer is not at the moment.  However, Revenue will begin the process of outreach to those minority of companies that have continued to avail of warehousing and have not paid back any of their debt at all.  That is a small minority of companies.<\/p><p>Later in the year, when that outreach is complete, I think we will have a better idea as to what kind of liability issue we will face or whether a larger share of companies might be unviable than would normally be the case.  Revenue will start making contact with those businesses imminently.  It is worth noting, however, that 85% of companies have now either paid back their taxes in full in the month they were due or begun the process of doing so, showing, I hope, that we have got the balance right to date.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Doherty's final question as to whether we are considering amending the provisions we have in place in respect of an interest rate of zero increasing to 1% and then all the way to 3%, we are not at the moment.  I would not give consideration to any change at all before we do the budget.  The engagement now under way between the Revenue Commissioners and these 12,000 businesses will, I think, give us a helpful steer as to what the payment capacity will be like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#C01000","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":957,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":958,"content":"<p>Section 5, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":959,"content":"<p>SECTION 6<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":960,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 13, to delete lines 26 and 27 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(iii) the scheme commonly known as the Live Performance Restart Grant Scheme;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#D00500","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":961,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":962,"content":"<p>Section 6, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":963,"content":"<p>SECTION 7<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":964,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 16, to delete lines 1 and 2 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(iii) the scheme commonly known as the Live Performance Restart Grant Scheme;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#D00900","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":965,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":966,"content":"<p>Section 7, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":967,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":968,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 18, to delete lines 11 and 12 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(iii) the scheme commonly known as the Live Performance Restart Grant Scheme;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#D01300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":969,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":970,"content":"<p>Section 8, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":971,"content":"<p>SECTION 9<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":972,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 20, to delete lines 16 and 17 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(iii) the scheme commonly known as the Live Performance Restart Grant Scheme;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#D01700","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":973,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":974,"content":"<p>Section 9, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":975,"content":"<p>SECTION 10<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":976,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 22, to delete lines 19 and 20 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(iii) the scheme commonly known as the Live Performance Restart Grant Scheme;&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#D02100","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":977,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1649199600,"counter":978,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 10, as amended, stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":979,"content":"<p>Section 10 amends the warehousing provisions for refunds due to Revenue under the EWSS payments.

<p>  Amendment No. 7 provides the necessary legislative basis for the changes approved by the D&aacute;il under the financial resolution of 9 March.  That financial resolution provided for a temporary reduction in the excise rates for auto fuels amounting to 20 cent for petrol and 15 cent for diesel motor fuels, with a proportionate 2 cent reduction in excise on marked gas oil.  These reductions were provided for in recognition by the Government of the impacts of the current fuel price increases on households and businesses.  The measures are VAT-inclusive and will last until 31 August.  While these increases in energy costs are driven primarily by global factors, the decision was taken to alleviate some of these impacts through the domestic taxation of fuel.  The measures implemented provide significant mitigation of recent fuel price increases.  It is impossible, however, to offset all the recent increases just by using the taxation system.  The excise reductions strike the balance between passing on a needed benefit to consumers, protecting our ability to collect tax in the future and respecting the minimum rates allowable under the EU energy tax directive.  The excise reductions come in addition to a temporary and targeted emergency support measure for licensed hauliers announced by the Minister for Transport to address cost pressures arising from current high fuel prices.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 9 provides for amendment of the Long Title to include the excise duty reductions in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#D02900","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":985,"content":"<p>I wish to ask the Minister a number of questions about amendment No. 7.  As we know, it relates to the financial resolution that was passed and that is just now being put into statutory law to ensure that it does not lapse after the 90-day period, or whatever the number of days a financial resolution can last is.  I am conscious that none of us can predict where petrol and diesel prices will be in the coming months.  I saw that in my local garage yesterday diesel was up at 195 cent per litre.  I know that that can vary from area to area and that, depending on further sanctions, we could see different price increases and pressures over the coming period.  I am concerned that this measure will lapse on 1 September.  It may be appropriate that it lapse on 1 September if prices stabilise, but they could go in completely the wrong direction.  I am also conscious that the D&aacute;il does not sit usually on 1 September.  Therefore, if through the summer period petrol and diesel continue to rise as a result of international pressures, although it is to be hoped the war will be well over by then, there would be a challenge to deal with this.  I understand that the only way we could do this would be to reconvene the D&aacute;il and pass another financial resolution at that point in time.  I ask the Minister to speak to the fact that he has chosen 1 September as the date on which this lapses.  I am very conscious that there is normally no D&aacute;il sitting at that time, and I suggest that that may be the reason the date was chosen as opposed to dealing with the matter six weeks later in the budget.<\/p> <p>  I have a second question for the Minister.  He acknowledges that we could go further in respect of petrol and that another 10 cent could be cut off excise.  Nearly 11 cent could be cut off the excise duty on petrol without breaching the European rules in this regard.  Has any consideration been given, for example, to suspending temporarily the diesel rebate scheme and ensuring that all hauliers are able to avail of that 7.5 cent excise rebate, given it directly at the pump?  The benefit of that would be that not only would the hauliers - or certain hauliers because not all of them get the rebate - benefit from it but all other users of diesel would benefit as well.  That would be in compliance with the European rules, so there is a possibility there to reduce petrol by 10 cent more and diesel by 7.5 cent more by introducing a measure that would suspend the scheme where the rebate would have to be applied for.  The hauliers would still get that benefit because they get the rebate directly at the pumps, but every other user of diesel would also get it.<\/p> <p>  Another question I wish to come on to is about home heating oil and the fact that excise duty was not reduced on home heating oil.  In America there are advertisements that say \"This ad was approved by the candidate\".  I am not sure if the Minister approved the fake news Fine Gael put out saying there was no excise duty on home heating oil.  As we know, excise duty comes in the form of mineral oil tax, which has two components: a carbon component and a non-carbon component.  The document before us is very clear.  We can all read.  That issue, in fairness, has been cleared up, but the carbon component of the excise duty on home heating oil could and should be reduced, given the huge increase that has happened.  It should be reduced on a temporary basis to release the pressure on families.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, in three weeks' time the Government plans to increase excise through further increases in carbon tax on gas and home heating oil and a number of other fuels.  The Taoiseach has said that that will be offset.  What is the financial measure the Government plans to bring forward in the next three weeks to offset this increase?  For example, home heating oil will go up by &euro;20 a fill.  What is the financial measure or legislative instrument the Government will use?  Will the Government use this legislation, with the D&aacute;il in recess for two weeks so there will be one week left before the Government's carbon tax increase kicks in?<\/p><p>Will the Minister give the committee clarity on the schedule because the schedule deals with the increase that will happen on 1 May?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#D03200","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":987,"content":"<p>Regarding the different issues that have been brought forward, I first picked the date of the end of August-early September for the change that would be made in petrol and diesel excise in the hope that the energy price pressure that we are facing due to the war would begin to moderate and improve as the year goes on.  It is certainly not my intention to go back to the Government and ask for the D&aacute;il to be recalled.  The thinking behind that date had nothing to do with whether the D&aacute;il was sitting or not.  I will certainly keep under review the pressures that continue in relation to petrol and diesel, and then decide what is the right step to take on the current excise reduction.<\/p> <p>  On the question regarding the diesel rebate scheme, the Deputy asked whether I gave any consideration to cancelling it and making the change he referred to.  I did not.  While I will always face calls to do more, as the Deputy is making of me, and I understand why, the measures we have brought in for both petrol and diesel are considerable and ensure that the increase all fuel users are facing is not as big as it otherwise would be.  I know that is cold comfort with the challenge many are facing, but a 9 cent to 13 cent reduction per litre is still a significant response and is a measure that is costing the State many hundreds of millions of euro.<\/p> <p>  As to where we are with home heating oil, and the increase in carbon tax that is due to that, the Deputy asked whether I gave any consideration to reducing the carbon share of that excise tax.  The Government is committed to going ahead with changes to carbon taxing.  The Deputy made the point about the multiple crises we are facing.  The additional crisis we are facing, as he well knows, is in regard to climate.  This week alone, the United Nations warned all of us that we have so little time left to avoid a catastrophic decline in our climate.  The revenue from carbon taxing continues to play a very valuable role in trying to mitigate the effect of that damage and to invest in the areas that might make some difference to us in the future.<\/p> <p>  On the off-sets that the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste referred to yesterday and how they will be implemented, I am working with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, on that.  Of course I know the deadline is 1 May.  When we have decided what we will do in conjunction with the rest of the Cabinet, we will then be able to say what the legislative means will be, if needed, for implementing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#E00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":988,"content":"<p>I asked for clarity in regard to that.  Will the Minister clarify that the carbon tax is not hypothecated in law, that there is not a magic pool of money where carbon tax goes into one section, that it goes into the Central Fund and that there is a policy decision to spend that resource on mitigation measures, which not all happen?  If the banking levy, which is reduced as a result of the Minister's decision in the Finance Act last year, was at the same level as last year, it could pay for the lost carbon tax of, for example, not increasing home heating oil costs on people who are really struggling.  Home heating oil has gone up &euro;1,600 per fill and the Minister will increase it by &euro;20.  If one were to look for a dictionary example of a government out of touch, this would be a good example.  This would be an example of a society in crisis, trying to heat their homes, keep their family safe, and the Government's response is to push up the cost of home heating oil further in three weeks' time.  The argument that if we do not do this, it will take away from retrofitting or other measures, is not actually the case because it is not hypothecated in law.  Therefore, other resources from tax resources, such as the banking levy, which should be restored to the level it was at last year, could be used to fill that gap.  That is the first issue.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the mitigation measures the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Michael McGrath, are talking about, the Taoiseach gave a commitment that no person would be worse off as a result of the carbon tax increases.  Will the Minister give the committee that same commitment, that every person will be no worse off as a result of the increase he plans to make to home heating oil and gas in the next three weeks as a result of the increase in carbon tax?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#E00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":989,"content":"<p>If the Deputy wanted to open the dictionary and find an example of an opposition that has been dishonest, he would find Sinn F&eacute;in in the same dictionary.  Sinn F&eacute;in comes forward and claims it is serious about trying to make a difference to the potentially catastrophic decay of our climate, but it will not advocate any measure that is challenging in order to make a difference to that existential risk.  The Deputy knows that the majority of scientists and economists, who are trying to form a view as to what we can do to save our planet, are of the view that an increase in carbon taxation can play a role in doing that in conjunction with other measures.  The Deputy knows that.  He continues to make the case that such measures are not needed despite the level of challenge we are facing.  He makes the case that he wants to be honest and play a role in avoiding and reducing the climate change crisis we are facing, but he will not advocate a single measure that is challenging or difficult to do it.<\/p> <p>  I am being honest in acknowledging that if we are going to reshape our economy and help protect our society as we do it, in the face of environmental disaster, all the ways of doing it are not easy.  I do not take for one moment the Deputy's trite points regarding the Government being out of touch or not aware of the challenge people are facing.  Of course we are aware.  Of course I know.  Of course we appreciate the huge challenges that so many are facing due to the rising costs of energy and daily living.  Of course I appreciate that, but my appreciation of it cannot diminish the need for me to also be honest.  The honesty about what we face is that, because so much of what is happening is outside of our control, we cannot protect or cover all the cost in relation to it.  I am aware of the commitment the Taoiseach made in ensuring that nobody is worse off due to the changing carbon tax.  I will certainly work to bring forward measures to the Government that aim to do that.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about hypothecation, he is right in that it is not legally in place at present.  We have not set up such a fund, but it is also the case that every cent of the last three increases in carbon taxation have been set aside to go into measures to either help with the cost of fuel going up or to invest in things that could make a difference to our economy and society being able to manage climate change.<\/p> <p>  I think what the Deputy is suggesting in regard to his point on the bank levy is that if I had charged the bank levy for another year, I could have avoided some of the costs that are here.  However, these banks are going.  They are getting ready to leave.  When they leave, the bank levy they were paying will go with them, whereas the expenditure commitments I am referring to here that we will have to incur, particularly when it comes to climate change, many of them will be permanent.  With that in mind, using a bank levy revenue, even if I were to do what the Deputy has advocated, that might only be available for another year will not help with funding expenditures and needs that are likely to stretch way beyond that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#E00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":990,"content":"<p>The Minister questioned my honesty numerous times and put himself on a pedestal in terms of the honest politician and me, the dishonest politician.  There is nothing trite about me, a representative, having been elected by the people of Donegal with a substantial mandate, raising the issue of people in my constituency who are facing poverty and increased poverty as a result of the measure the Minister is advocating.  He says that he understands how they are suffering, but he will push ahead with the measure and push up the cost of keeping their homes warm.<\/p> <p>  I do not know but maybe the Minister was outside the country in talking about the experts.  His expert who was appointed to the advisory group was on national radio saying that this carbon tax increase in three weeks' time should not go ahead.<\/p><p>This was because there is a recognition that the price is going through the roof.  Carbon taxes and behavioural taxes have a role to play in changing behaviours when there are other options available to people.  We have seen an increase in the cost of filling a tank of oil, which two thirds of households in the west and the north west, and one third of households in the State, use as the primary source of heating their homes.  The price increase of filling a tank of oil has nearly doubled since the start of the year.  If there was going to be a behavioural change it would be that.  The point is that the Minister lumping on another &euro;20 every time one fills a tank is just creating more misery.  It is not going to make people run out and move to an air-to-water system in the morning or move to underground heating.  Most of these families do not have that type of resource.<\/p><p> I will make the point again that the Government's own expert on climate advice is saying that this is not the time to increase carbon tax on heating a home.  The Minister's own backbenchers have a motion down before the parliamentary party tonight calling for the Minister to see sense.  At least there is some hope in Fine Gael that not all of them are out of touch, but by God, if the Minister is not out of touch, he is telling me that he understands what is happening out there and he is deciding to go ahead with &euro;20 increase in home heating oil in three weeks' time, despite the fact that Social Justice Ireland has stated that people are at breaking point.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, one-parent family organisations and people on the front line are telling us this time and again.  Comments are coming into my constituency office, and I am sure to the Minister's constituency office, that people are not putting on the heating because they simply cannot afford it.  Where does the Minister believe that people are going to get the extra &euro;20 in three weeks' time?  It is easy for the Minister.  It is easy for people who have been elected to the Oireachtas because we are well paid.  It is easy for Ministers who are sitting round the table who are well paid and well looked after with all of their Garda drivers and all of the rest to say \"Look this is important and they will get through it somehow\".  A lot of people will not get through it.  For a lot of people, this is the breaking point.  The Government's role here is to protect people from the worst edges.  I am not suggesting that the Minister can do everything but he can do a lot more.  The very least that the Minister should do is do no more harm.  Yet, this is what he plans to do in three weeks' time by increasing the cost of home heating oil, by increasing the cost of gas, and by increasing the costs on these families and workers in trying to keep their homes safe and trying to keep their homes warm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#E00500","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":992,"content":"<p>I want to call out-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#F00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":993,"content":"<p>That is honesty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#F00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":994,"content":"<p>I want to call out what Deputy Doherty is doing there.

Many of us, at least those of us on the Opposition benches, have been arguing for some months that the Government should seek a derogation from the VAT directive to allow the State to reduce VAT rates on fuel and energy for a period of time.  This derogation could ensure that the VAT rate would not go up to 23% on the conclusion of that mitigating measure.  We know the Central Bank has estimated that inflation may peak at 8% this year.  This could be a conservative estimate.  The Exchequer returns today are very impressive given the current context.  Income and corporation tax and VAT receipts are up considerably on comparable months, namely, the first quarter of 2019 pre-pandemic.  VAT receipts are up by 17%, which is significant in anyone's language.  It is fair to say that a significant composition of the increase in VAT receipts comprises VAT charged on the increased costs of fuel and energy for householders and businesses.  There is a strong case and policy rationale for some of that VAT windfall to returned to the pockets of those who need it most.  Many of us on the Opposition benches have been arguing for the Government to seek a derogation from the VAT directive at European Commission level and it seems as if some headway has been made in that regard in recent weeks.  Could the Minister update the committee on what headroom is available to him in respect of the potential reduction in VAT?  My interpretation of the Taoiseach's remarks in recent days about mitigation measures leads me to believe that the Government may be considering a reduction in VAT on fuel and energy on a temporary basis.  Will the Minister confirm that this is under consideration by him and his Government colleagues and let us know when he expects to make a decision on the mitigation measures the Taoiseach remarked upon in recent days?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#H00200","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>Regarding Exchequer returns, I acknowledge that VAT receipts for the first quarter - in fairness to Deputy Nash, he used the base of 2019 as opposed to that of 2020 or 2021 - are strong.  However, I would make the case that if we look at where we are with excise, we can see it is down.  Excise is down for a number of reasons.  The first is that we have cut the rate of excise, therefore, we would expect to see excise tax receipts fall.  However, we have some concerns that this is the first tax head that is being affected by consumption within our economy beginning to change as the price of something goes up.  While Deputy Nash is not suggesting that the outlook in our public finances for the rest of the year is rosy, I still want to make the point that if we accept, and I do, that living standards are under pressure and many are facing real struggles, that is not consistent with tax collection or tax receipts across this year getting better as the year goes on.  I expect that as we move through the year, we will face challenges with regard to additional costs to which we must respond.  Next week, we will publish the stability programme update that will outline our best thinking regarding where we are with tax collection and growth for 2022.  There is no more flexibility available to me than when I announced the set of measures contained in the Finance Bill a few weeks ago.  In the ECOFIN meeting yesterday, I raised the case for flexibility for clarification regarding what is possible both under this and future VAT directives and that is being considered by the Commission.  I expect it will be some time before I get an answer and can understand whether that answer will be of help.

It is a live issue today because of what is happening and I take the opportunity to raise it with the Minister.  I have also raised with the Taoiseach previously.  What is happening in Killybegs is a disgrace.  The Minister needs to take an interest in this sector.  There are companies, that, in fairness, have been supported by Enterprise Ireland and other State agencies, and which are employing individuals, that are at risk if this practice that is happening in Killybegs continues with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.  The companies are in dispute as to how fish should be weighed when it comes onto the pier.<\/p> <p>  We have a particular issue with whitefish.  Whitefish has to remain in water.  Otherwise it cannot be used for human consumption.  We had a Danish vessel coming in on Friday.  The SFPA stated that they had to weigh a particular way, which meant it would be brought out of the water.  That meant it could not be used for human consumption and would only have to be used as fishmeal.  The Danish vessel went away and decided not to land.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday, we had a Norwegian vessel with 950 tonnes of fish on board.  The Norwegian vessel was told the same.  Prevented from landing, it went away.  It landed today at Derry port.  Derry port operates under the same EU regulations as Killybegs port because of the protocol.  The 950 tonnes have been offloaded at Derry port.  At the minute, there is a convoy of 40 lorryloads of fish carrying 950 tonnes travelling down from Derry back to Killybegs to get that fish processed.  We talked about the environment and the need to do more.  That is the height of stupidity.  Not only that, 56 workers were let go yesterday in the factory because they had no work for them because the fish did not land.  The Danish vessel is gone.  Another Norwegian vessel turned around and is away back to Norway because they heard about the craic that is going on in Killybegs.  If this gets out, as it is getting out, there could be long-term reputational damage.  This issue needs to be resolved.  Thankfully, there is a solution.  The industry itself has developed a weighing mechanism that the High Court has ruled can be used if it is externally approved.  It really needs to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  The issue in this section is interlinked with how the fishing industry is dealt with.  It is about the tax treatment of the decommissioning scheme.  An announcement was made on funding being provided by the Brexit Adjustment Reserve fund to tie up vessels and this funding was to cover quota cuts.  There were quota cuts as a result of Brexit, vessels had to be tied up, and under the Brexit Adjustment Reserve, money was made available.  Now we learn that, under this decommissioning scheme which is separate to this, the money that was provided to those who are in the decommissioning scheme, which is basically getting rid of their vessels for the tie up because of the loss of their quota, will be deducted.  This is not the way to treat this industry.  You cannot give with one hand and take with the other.  It is not fair.  There needs to be a proper approach to this industry.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn, my party's spokesperson on fisheries, is passionate about this, as is the industry itself.<\/p> <p>  I would raise with the Minister the need for him and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to sit down and look at how this scheme is operating from both a fisheries and a taxation point of view.  There are seven or eight companies based in Killybegs that do not process fish at all; they service boats.  The boats that they service are in the Irish fleet, but they also service Norwegian and Danish boats.  If they are not coming in, they have no boats to service.  There is an engineering capability.  It is fantastic that they are at the cutting edge but they are losing out as a result of what is happening in Killybegs.  That is three vessels in four days that turned around.  That is a serious issue.  It needs to be resolved quickly because the message is going out that Killybegs is not a welcome port for these foreign vessels and they are making a decision to not spend a day steaming in to Letterkenny and using up diesel - we know the cost of diesel at present - on the off-chance that they will not be able to land and that they will go back to Norway or go to Scotland or wherever they go.<\/p> <p>  The worst thing is I understand most of the blue whiting that was on Danish vessel was going to west Africa because it is a good fish, and it is a cheap fish for west Africa.  It is now going for fishmeal because once the water is taken out of it, it does not last and it will only be used as fishmeal.  Some of it was going to Ukraine as well.  It is ridiculous what is happening and it needs to be sorted out quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022040600002#K02000","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":1106,"content":"<p>I am aware that this matter is being dealt with by the SFPA, which the Deputy referred to.

The industry, which developed this machine at great cost to weigh this type of fish without destroying the fish - the fish are taken out of the water quickly, weighed and then put back into water - is willing to give the machine to the SFPA and the SFPA would run it.

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Muiris O'Connor, Mr. Jack Nagle and Ms Muriel Farrell.  Ms Farrell is an addition to the team and not on the original list the committee received.<\/p> <p>  We are here today to discuss the Sl&aacute;intecare progress report for 2021, published by the Department in February.  The report sets out progress made against the priorities and actions detailed in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023.  The provision of healthcare radically changed during the pandemic, as we are all aware.  As outlined in the end-of-year progress report, significant reform and innovation were delivered throughout our health and social services.  The voices of patients highlighted throughout the report reveal the reality of Sl&aacute;intecare in people&rsquo;s everyday lives and the outstanding work being done throughout the system to adapt and provide integrated services that put patients first.<\/p> <p>  I will update the committee on some recent developments this year, specifically on what has been delivered by the Department and the HSE in terms of reform since we last came before the committee in early February.  In late February, the Minister for Health launched the 2022 action plan on waiting lists following engagement between the Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  The plan contains 45 actions to reduce and reform waiting lists across four main areas of work.  These are delivering capacity, reforming scheduled care, enabling scheduled care reform and addressing community care access and waiting lists.  Implementation of the plan is governed by a waiting list task force.  This meets regularly and is chaired by me and the CEO of the HSE, Mr. Reid.  It is an extension of the approach and structure that we used for the short-term waiting list action plan that ran from September to December last year, and which saw a 5.4% reduction in waiting lists.<\/p> <p>  Projections for this year suggest that more than 1.5 million patients will be added to active waiting lists for acute scheduled care this year as post-pandemic pent-up demand for health services is released.  Through the plan, &euro;350 million has been allocated to the HSE and the NTPF to deliver services to remove more than 1.7 million people from active acute scheduled waiting lists.  This will result in a projected reduction in waiting lists of 18%.  It is hoped that by the end of 2022, based on implementation of the plans and the progress we would like to see, the number of patients on waiting lists will be at its lowest level in five years.  The plan will also make progress towards the achievement of intermediate waiting time targets as set out in the service plan.<\/p> <p>  Significant reforms are being progressed in tandem with delivering this extra activity.  These include modernising care pathways to bring care closer to the community, reduce the pressure on our hospital system and greatly enhance the availability and analysis of data and information.<\/p><p>Progress is largely on track despite the recent surge in both emergency department, ED, attendance and Covid cases.  No doubt, what has happened will undoubtedly have had an impact on delivery over the past three to four weeks in particular.  As the number of Covid cases comes down and the pressure on the hospital system eases, however, we will hopefully be able to continue to accelerate our progress on waiting lists.<\/p><p> Significant progress has been made with the regional health areas, RHAs, project since I was last before the committee.  The Government approved the geographies of the regions in the months preceding the pandemic and directed the Department to explore the organisational design, governance frameworks and funding methods for RHAs via a detailed business case.  Substantial work was undertaken by the Department in partnership with the HSE, and with input from the RHA advisory group, in the development of the business case, which was published yesterday.  Also yesterday, the Government approved the implementation of RHAs, another important landmark in the reform and modernisation of our health services, as envisioned under Sl&aacute;intecare.  RHAs will provide for the alignment and integration of hospital and community healthcare services at a regional level, based on defined populations and their local needs.  This is key to delivering on the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of an integrated health and social care service.<\/p><p> The allocation of resources by RHAs will also enable better accountability, oversight and evaluation of costs and health outcomes at a regional level.  A team of officials including representatives from the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Children Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is on track to produce a detailed implementation plan by the end of this year.  I am happy to engage with this committee, and other committees as necessary, to input into that plan.  The plan will cover how RHAs will impact on workforce and HR planning, funding allocation, capital infrastructure and governance lines.<\/p><p> Work has started on the development of a population-based approach to service planning and resource allocation.  Planning our services in this way will improve our ability to equitably allocate our workforce and capital resources.  As part of the Estimates process for 2024, a population-based resource allocation, PBRA, funding model will be used to allocate funding by RHA.  A shadow budget cycle is planned for 2023.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the Department will continue to engage with the public and a broad range of stakeholder to increase understanding of how Sl&aacute;intecare is building a better, more equal health system for all.  I am happy to answer any questions from committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022040600002#B01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649199600,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to meet to discuss progress with the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The Chair has already introduced my colleagues so I will not do so again.  Members will recall that I previously provided updates on the main elements of Sl&aacute;intecare progress at the February meeting.  As members will be aware, in addition to the mid-year report, an end-of-year progress report for 2021 has also been developed and we are close to finalising with the Department the Sl&aacute;intecare action plan for 2022.<\/p> <p>  I would like to focus on the following aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare progress today: the multi-annual waiting list plan; Regional Health Areas; enhancing community care programme; and the Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund.<\/p> <p>  On multi-annual waiting lists, a critical objective of Sl&aacute;intecare is to reduce waiting lists.  Since the last update provided, the 2022 waiting list action plan was launched on 25 February.  The plan allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF and details 45 actions to reduce and reform waiting lists.  The immediate focus of the plan is on the delivery of activity to reduce active waiting lists for acute scheduled care by 18% this year, which would bring the number of people waiting to their lowest point in five years.  In addition, the 2022 plan focuses on 15 high-volume inpatient and day-case procedures, including cataracts and hip and knee replacements, so that every person waiting over six months for one of these procedures, and who is clinically ready, will receive an offer of treatment.<\/p> <p>  The 2022 plan also lays the foundations for longer-term reforms in areas such as patient care pathways, key service reforms and data and information.  This is the first year of a multi-annual programme of reform to achieve the Sl&aacute;intecare targets whereby no person waits more than ten weeks for their first outpatient appointment and 12 weeks for their inpatient or day-case procedure.  Consistent with this, each hospital group has been set a target that by December 2022, 98% of all patients on our waiting lists will wait less than 18 months for their first outpatient appointment and 12 months for their procedure.<\/p> <p>  Of course, it is important to note that there continues to be challenges in the area of scheduled care, as Mr. Watt noted in his opening statement, with the most recent surge in both ED attendance and Covid cases.  We will continue to work closely with hospitals to ensure appropriate supports and plans are in place to deliver the 2022 waiting-time targets.  We are also working closely with CHOs to tackle long community waiting lists.  I will continue to brief members on progress in relation to these key areas. <\/p> <p>  Since the February update, we have continued to work with Departmental colleagues to take forward planning for the introduction of RHAs.  The focus of this planning work has included detailing the vision and objectives for RHAs, and the identification and scoping of key implementation work streams.  At this time, the work streams identified as part of the wider work programme are as follows: programme co-ordination; corporate and clinical governance and accountability; population-based resource allocation; finance; digital and capital infrastructure; people and development; and change, communications and culture.<\/p> <p>  In early March, a workshop was held involving the senior management teams from the HSE and the Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to provide an update on the position with RHAs and to consider, scope and refine the key implementation work streams.  Similar workshops are being arranged in the coming weeks for CHOs and hospital groups.  The HSE board will also be playing a lead role in overseeing the RHA agenda as it progresses.  A detailed implementation plan is being developed by the Department and the HSE with input from the RHA advisory group.  This will be finalised in 2022.  Transition to RHAs will take place during 2023 and, by quarter 1 of 2024, the expectation is that RHAs will be fully operational.<\/p> <p>  The developments under the enhanced community care programme, ECCP, continue at pace with 51 community health networks, 15 community specialist teams for older persons and four community specialist teams for chronic disease management now established.  Some 21 community intervention teams are now operational, with national coverage secured.  The GP diagnostics programme has facilitated 139,000 scans of various modalities in 2021 with a further 38,000 provided to the end of February 2022.  Crucially, key leadership roles have been and are being recruited which include 84 network managers, 82 assistant directors of public health nursing, 35 GP leads, 52 operational leads for community specialist teams and 54 consultants.  An individual population health profile has also been created for each of the 96 community health networks, containing standardised data on the demographics and health status of each community health network.<\/p> <p>  Members will recall that budget 2019 provided &euro;20 million for the establishment of a ring-fenced Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund to support service delivery which focuses on prevention, community care and integration of care across all health and social care settings.  This fund supported 123 projects and over 100 projects have now been mainstreamed into the healthcare system.  Overall, these projects have resulted in over 15,000 reduced referrals to scheduled care, more than 19,000 acute inpatient bed days avoided, and more than 8,000 patients removed from waiting lists.<\/p> <p>  My commitment, and that of my colleagues and members of the HSE board, to Sl&aacute;intecare reform is clear.  This was demonstrated over the past couple of years whereby, despite major challenges caused by the pandemic and the cyberattack, significant Sl&aacute;intecare reform and innovation was delivered across our health and social services as outlined in the mid-year and end-of-year progress reports.  I look forward to the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare action plan 2022 so that we can continue to report on and monitor progress of the reform programme.  As we progress and report on Sl&aacute;intecare initiatives, we are hopeful that we will build trust and confidence in the Sl&aacute;intecare programme of reform itself so that it is seen s delivering upon promised reform and improvements to Ireland&rsquo;s health and social care services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022040600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022040600002#C00300","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":1143,"content":"<p>On a point of order, can we get clarification on the business case document?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022040600002#C00400","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>There is a difficulty.

Does the Deputy have a copy of the paper?  Deputy Cullinane does.  The three options are keeping things as they are, establishing the model on an administrative basis, and establishing the model on a legislative basis.  I shall go through the differences between the options.  I will try to proceed quickly.  Option 1 would effect no change in the current structure, with its nine CHOs and the hospital groups.  That is obviously not where we want to get to with Sl&aacute;intecare.  Option 2 would involve what we call a HSE local model, with RHAs set up administratively within the HSE structure.  There would be six RHAs geographically aligned, involving integrated subdivisions of the HSE that replace the nine CHOs and six hospital groups.  The model would provide regional management authority and accountability and one population-based budget per region.  Critically, the RHAs would not have separate boards, and they would not have legal status on their own.  They would be set up administratively and the legal entity would continue to be the HSE, which would remain the employer.  There would be a strong HSE centre regarding the reforms Mr. Reid has set out.<\/p> <p>  The third model, which we call the separation model, entails six legally separate RHAs with a contractual relationship with the HSE.  We hope that it, too, would provide regional management authority and accountability and one population-based budget per region.  However, each RHA would have its own board.  Each RHA would be an employer, not the HSE.  The structure of the HSE centre would be broadly the same.<\/p> <p>  The difference between the two options that require change is that one would involve establishment on an administrative basis while the other would involve establishment on a legal basis.  Our preference would be to set up the system on an administrative basis.  We would ascertain how that would work, set up the structures and deliver on the policy objectives.  If legislative underpinning were required later, it could be achieved; however, to make progress on this within the timeframe, which would entail implementation and significant progress next year, we believe the administrative model is the best way to go.  Again, we have an open mind on it.  If legal powers were required, we might have to amend the existing legislation.  However, we do not envisage a full RHA Bill at this stage.  It could become necessary when we see how the model develops.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022040600002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":1157,"content":"<p>What is the case for selecting option 2?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022040600002#D00300","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649199600,"counter":1158,"content":"<p>It is on the basis we believe we can achieve the objectives &mdash; geographical alignment, integrated care, a budget per region, and improved accountability and governance &mdash; on an administrative basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022040600002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":1159,"content":"<p>Did the Cabinet sign off on option 2?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022040600002#D00500","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649199600,"counter":1160,"content":"<p>The Cabinet signed off on-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022040600002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649199600,"counter":1161,"content":"<p>As the direction of travel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022040600002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Muiris O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649199600,"counter":1162,"content":"<p>As the direction of travel, but we have been asked to develop a detailed plan.

I have brought several papers to our board over the past couple of years.  Right now, we are engaged in working through these matters.  This will feed into the new structures.<\/p> <p>  In very simple terms, there are a few strands to trying to strengthen accountability.  The first involves having clearly defined organisational roles and responsibilities.  There should be no vagueness regarding who is responsible for what.  The second involves the very clear delegation of responsibility in legislation, with people accountable in this regard.  The third involves the regulation.  These are all strands that we are working on.  Many of the professional grades in the health system are regulated but some are not, which means strengthening these.<\/p> <p>  Two issues arise over performance management.  The first is that we are not strong enough in performance management in the current system, which means our performance management will have to be strengthened.  The second concerns discipline.  Discipline involves a very complicated process within the health service.  It is quite dated, in some cases dating back to 1970s legislation.  These are strands that we regard as being part of accountability, for now and for the framework.  Simply putting in six RHAs on their own will not suffice.

When the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office was stood down, everybody's fear was that we would end up with departmental capture of Sl&aacute;intecare, and it is clear that is exactly what has happened.  There are no grounds for anybody to think things are going to be done any way differently as a result of this.  It is just more of the same from the HSE.  The problem with the HSE, in terms of a delivery model, is that it is top heavy.  It is highly centralised and there is a lack of accountability throughout the health service. There is no line of sight of the massive budgets the HSE gets every year and there is a sense of a black hole within the organisation.  What we wanted was a leaner centre, with power, decision-making and accountability devolved to the regions, but what we are getting is a more centralised organisation.  At the moment, there is a certain degree of independence for the hospitals and the hospital groups, or for the voluntary ones at least, but if they are to be combined and integrated with the community services, does that mean the HSE centre will now have even wider responsibility and greater control?  That is the way I foresee it working.<\/p> <p>  In case we ever needed an example of what does not work in terms of the centralised nature of the HSE, it is to be found in HR, as anyone working within the health service will attest.  It is impossible to recruit a nurse or a doctor because there is this big rigmarole whereby a business case has to be made to the centre, where it is considered, gets lost and comes back down at some point.

We are now literally going to appoint 82 assistant directors, which is one for every new nurse appointed in six years.  Of all the areas of healthcare there is a 27% increase, for example, of doctors, nurses and management, across all systems in the HSE, except public health nursing, which has only increased by 4% in six years.  To give an example from Cork city, an elderly gentleman, 80 years of age, was discharged from hospital more than six weeks ago and requires ongoing care.  However, a public health nurse has still not called to him.  In fairness to her, she is out sick, but there is no one there to step into her shoes.

The paper referenced Mr. Watt's &euro;81,000 pay hike.  However, people in middle and senior management grades had not had that.  It was seen as being a barrier.

First, in terms of the motivation or morale of managers, I have never seen in any organisation the response I have seen from the health service, from managers at senior levels and at all levels, over the past two years in response to Covid-19.  While morale is challenged on many different issues, it has not been a factor in terms of management's response over the past two years.  Managers at senior level have worked seven days a week, 18 hours a day throughout Covid-19.  I want to recognise and thank them for that.<\/p><p> Specifically related to Report No. 42, it is a process which has to be dealt with under the pay bargaining arrangements.

Not everything is about how many beds, what trolley capacity and what acute capacity hospitals have.  Sometimes a helmsman or helmswoman is needed.

The vast majority of people in this country want to see a different health system, one that is not inherently unequal as regards public healthcare.  What people want is less bureaucracy, more delivery and radical reform.  They want public healthcare at their time of need and they want it delivered in a very good fashion.  I presume that is what Sl&aacute;intecare is about, namely, universal healthcare.  That is the concept of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Does Mr. Watt believe in that concept and ending the two-tier health system?  All the indications in recent years have been that what is being delivered is Sl&aacute;intecare-lite at best and, at worst, that constant obstacles to reform are being put in place.  We need radical reform in our public health service.

I agree with the objective absolutely, that is, to build a public health system which addresses the two-tier issue and provides the type of healthcare that people want.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy and fully support that.  Overall, I have set out, as Mr. Reid and our team have previously, our commitment to this.  The Deputy and his colleagues will have to judge that on the basis of our delivery.  I am happy to be accountable for our delivery and to focus on the things in the report and the discussions we have had, which are the meat of what we are trying to do in the Department of Health and the HSE.<\/p> <p>  I would argue that there is very significant change, reform and delivery already.  Mr. Reid alluded to some of the stuff in regard to community care and the radical changes taking place in terms of what is called \"the shift to the left\" in the community.  There is much more to be done around recruitment and systems, and the RHAs will help in that regard.  Overall, however, I am fully supportive of this and I would not have taken on this job or sought it if I was not committed to the reform.  Making the health system better for everybody in terms of waiting lists and access to care is what motivates me and my team.  I know it is the same for Mr. Reid and his team.  That is what motivates us.  I am fully committed to this and look forward to driving the change.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane mentioned earlier the enthusiasm and excitement for the changes.

Ultimately, there is a private system in place.  It has been a key part of our system for a long time now and there are entanglements between the private and public system which we have to address and Sl&aacute;intecare sets out how are going to do that.  I think there will always be a private sector.  We need to look on it in some ways as something that the public system can access.

There are 228 deliverables and 200 of them are on track or are progressed on the basis of the report and 28 deliverables are progressing with significant challenges.  We have spoken about some of them, such as waiting lists, removing private care from public hospitals, and Sl&aacute;intecare in the context of what the Acting Chairman asked about.  The areas where there has been significant improvement is the increase in public capacity; the number of beds; the number of people that work in the public system; the streamlining of care pathways that has been talked about and I mentioned the waiting lists.  Another critical area is the recruitment for the enhanced community care programme and the different teams that we set up such as the community health networks, the community intervention teams, the chronic disease management teams and the disease programme for older people.  From what I see, and from what I am told about every day, this is starting to have an enormous impact in terms of the system.  I do not wish to downplay the other issues, because colleagues are working hard on all of them, so it is not fair to say that they are less important but that shift to the left is the biggest change that is happening, which is starting to have an enormous impact now on the health system.  Based on the plans that Mr. Reid set out in detail in his opening remarks, by the end of the year we will have further advanced these teams.  There has been enormous change, as well as the increase in the public health capacity.  It is not as obvious at the moment because we have 1,400 people with Covid and, with the separation of beds, that is having an impact on the reality of the capacity, but if we could get to a post-Covid phase, the initial staff and beds could make a difference in terms of addressing the waiting lists and preparing for next winter where we will clearly have challenges again.

He is absolutely correct.  The ultimate measure of this is, and should be, what is the public's experience when they come for their care.  We should always remind ourselves of that in any reform, one must come from the customers' side, in our case, the patients' side.<\/p> <p>  I will give the Deputy some specific examples of how we believe the situation has improved.  Waiting lists are an issue that is still far too big.  I gave some examples earlier.  Thankfully, more older persons are receiving care in their homes because of increased hours.  It is not as many as we would like but more people are receiving this care.  More people are getting their chronic disease and illness managed away from an acute hospital setting.  More people, including some 140,000 last year, are going to their GP and getting access to diagnostics without having to be referred to an emergency department.  We have put in place more beds.  It has been impacted by Covid.  Through our National Ambulance Service and various reforms, people have been treated outside of emergency departments.  It should not be the default to bring them to an emergency department.  We have more multidisciplinary teams caring for people in the community.<\/p> <p>  On the waiting lists, there are four key strands to our plan to make this better.  We had a focused short-term plan in December that reduced the waiting list by 5% in a short period.  The first strand is to increase our capacity in the public system, for which we have the investment to do that; second, to utilise the private capacity in the meantime; third, to provide extra funding for the NTPF for certain procedures; and as important is the radical reform of how we deliver care across a range of specialties.  We are looking at 37 specialties to see if patient needs can be addressed without having to go to a senior consultant.  Are there other roles and responsibilities whereby people can come forward for their care and get it?  I reassure the Deputy that will be the ultimate difference from the patients' experience - by radically changing how we are delivering the care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022040600002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":1370,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Watt wish to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022040600002#L00300","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649199600,"counter":1371,"content":"<p>I do not.

Offshore islands and their communities are an integral part of the fabric of rural Ireland.  The islands are also home to some of our most vibrant and culturally distinctive communities.  They are a vital part of the State's heritage and have a special significance in Irish culture.<\/p> <p>  We, in the Department of Rural and Community Development, are now undertaking the development of an islands policy as it has been 23 years since the most recent national policy was published.\u00a0 There has been significant progress in many respects for the islands since that policy was published, particularly in the areas of access and infrastructure.<\/p><p>However, there are other areas that must be addressed to make the islands more sustainable and to maintain or, indeed, increase their populations.  The commitment to develop a cross-government islands policy was a key measure in the programme for Government.  The Government&rsquo;s ambition in a national policy and action plan for the islands was set out in chapter 10 of Our Rural Future, the Action Plan for Rural Development 2021-2025, published last year.  Our Rural Future was developed following extensive consultation with people living and working in rural Ireland, including on our offshore islands, and in collaboration with rural stakeholders and colleagues across Government and State agencies.<\/p><p> As we emerge from the shadows cast by Covid-19, an unparalleled opportunity now exists to re-imagine and revalue what rural Ireland means to our society.  The vision of Our Rural Future is to maximise a recovery for all parts of our country and for all our people.  It is the Government&rsquo;s blueprint for the sustainable development of rural Ireland to 2025, with a framework to transform the quality of life and opportunity for people living in rural areas, including our offshore islands.  The policy aims to facilitate more people living and working in rural Ireland, with meaningful career prospects, including by capitalising on new digital opportunities, improving access to public services and adopting flexibility within sectors.  We have a unique opportunity now to capitalise on the changing nature of work, which has been significantly accelerated by the experience of Covid-19 which saw so many of us working remotely.  Our Rural Future contains more than 150 commitments across the whole of government.  Delivery of these will be reported on through a series of progress reports, the first of which was published in February and covered the actions in the 2021 Our Rural Future work programme.<\/p><p> With regard to the development of a national policy for the islands, it was recognised from the outset that obtaining input from island communities through a comprehensive consultation process was of crucial importance.  In December 2019, a consultation paper was prepared with input from the participating Departments to act as a basis to advance the development of an island policy.  It was agreed that officials from the Department would visit the islands in the initial stage of the consultation process, engaging directly with the communities and, where applicable, with the local development group or comharchumann representatives.  The Department undertook an extensive consultation process through in-person meetings on the islands, online meetings, questionnaires and submissions.  A small number of islands have recently requested that the Department hold an in-person meeting on their island, as it was not possible to visit them due to Covid-19 restrictions.  It is intended that these meetings will be held next month.<\/p><p> A large amount of data has been gathered to date through the consultation process.  What has emerged from the data is that, while many of the islands have individual or specific issues, a number of themes are common across the islands.  The main issues highlighted in the consultation relate to education, health, housing and planning, employment, broadband, transport and access to services.<\/p><p> An interdepartmental committee for islands was established to develop a national policy for the inhabited offshore islands at the beginning of this process.  This committee is made up of senior officials from across 13 Departments.  The committee has been meeting regularly and directs and oversees the development of the policy.  At the most recent meeting of the interdepartmental committee for the islands, participating Departments reviewed progress on the policy development and agreed the next steps to be taken.  It was agreed that the various Departments would submit a list of action points that they could undertake to further enhance the future development and sustainability of communities on our offshore islands.<\/p><p> The inclusion of the islands function under the remit of the Department of Rural and Community Development since July 2020 has enabled a more integrated and cohesive approach to rural and community policy development for island communities and their economies.  This closer policy alignment with the Department&rsquo;s suite of programmes which support community development, rural economic development and digital innovation is already yielding dividends on a number of fronts and will become more apparent as the national islands policy is developed.<\/p><p> The Department is already progressing additional actions and programmes to further support the island communities.  For example, the Department sanctioned funding of &euro;2.09 million earlier this year for various works on non-county roads on a number of islands in Donegal.  This was the culmination of ongoing dialogue between the Department and the local authority through various fora.  In addition, a new measure for our islands has been included in the CL&Aacute;R programme this year.  This has two aspects.  The first is island community transport, which will provide up to 90% of the total cost of a community bus or vehicle with an electric charging point which is powered by solar PV panels.  The maximum grant available will be &euro;100,000 for a vehicle, increasing to &euro;120,000 for a bus, where solar panel and charging point are included.  The second aspect is an island outdoor community recreation amenities measure, which will provide up to 90% of the total cost of outdoor community recreation amenities on islands, subject to a maximum grant of &euro;50,000.<\/p><p> The Department of Rural and Community Development has a strong track record of developing innovative policies and strategies in consultation with communities and stakeholder groups.  Our approach to the development of the new national policy for the islands is no different.  The island representative bodies, island development companies and the island co-operatives have been very effective over the years in supporting their communities and raising their issues of concern with the Government.  I am aware that the committee has met those groups on a number of occasions as well.  We see these groups as key stakeholders in the development of the island policy and we are committed to continuous engagement with them as the work progresses.<\/p><p> Overall, our vision is that the policy development process will lead to the agreement of a number of objectives across all policy areas to support, promote and empower our island communities.  Implementation of the policy through the three-year action plans will improve the quality of life of island communities by fully taking into account the unique context of each island and by developing a system of reporting and review that will promote accountability.  As noted in Our Rural Future, this new islands policy will be the first focused policy initiative for the islands for more than 20 years.  It will focus on providing new opportunities for islanders and building sustainable futures for island communities.  It will be developed in consultation with island communities and with input from across the whole of government to provide a blueprint for sustainable island development that will safeguard our island communities for generations to come.  We welcome the views of the committee as a valuable input into the policy development process and we look forward to the discussion today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022040600002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":1386,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Nic Aongusa.

It is interesting that sometimes a delay can play into one's favour because had an island strategy been delivered in January 2020 I think that we would now be dealing with a completely different landscape.  The Covid crisis, for all of its challenges, has presented opportunities to rural Ireland and significant opportunities to island communities that are prepared to grasp them.  In particular, remote working should now be a possibility if we have the broadband connection available.  The same goes for educational options for children who live on the islands and health.  If the island communities talk about themselves as potential lighthouse projects in terms of renewable energy then they should also be lighthouse projects in terms of the roll-out of e-health measures.  They could be hugely significant in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The delay has helped and an island strategy that was delivered in 2020 would now be out of date.  However, we need one and we must tighten the timelines.  We had hoped to have the strategy in our hands before we, as a committee, completed this unit of work.  This morning I spoke on Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta about the fact that we hope to have a committee meeting on an island, which will be an historic event, but it would have been great to have the policy in our hands so that we were not discussing it in the dark.  I ask the Assistant Secretary to outline the timeline and say whether she is confident that we will hit those markers.<\/p> <p>  I will now discuss interdepartmental workings and this week I submitted a parliamentary question on the subject.  An issue that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has referred to repeatedly is interconnection in terms of energy, communications and water provision on the islands.  We know that island communities are small and for that reason find it difficult to find representation and have a voice.  I think that this committee has played an important role in amplifying that voice but it does sometimes feel like the silos are difficult to break.  The Department responsible for islands is a small one and needs help.  Its initiatives need to be integrated with initiatives that are run out of other Departments such as the Departments of Transport, Health and Education, and the Department responsible for energy.  Do the witnesses feel that cross-departmental work and structures exist?  Are there still too many silos?  Do those relationships need to be improved in order to deliver for the people in island communities?    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022040600002#N00300","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1649199600,"counter":1400,"content":"<p>I will first address the point made about interdepartmental work.  The Deputy is right that silos are often difficult to break.  One of the biggest challenges for us across the civil and public service is to work across Departments, boundaries and agencies.  Our interdepartmental group consists of 13 Departments.  From the outset we have developed a whole-of-government approach to the preparation of the policy and we are committed to working with Departments on the policy.<\/p> <p>  In terms of e-health, another unit in my Department is responsible for digital development and it has been very active with the Department of Health in efforts to further the e-health agenda.  A number of pilot projects are currently being developed and they will take advantage of the opportunities offered by connectivity.  The Department, for example, identified an opportunity to use the connectivity provided by our broadband connection points network to develop a pilot e-health solution for a number of islands.  My Department is currently supporting a working group that is overseeing the establishment of dedicated e-health virtual consultation rooms, which will be located within the broadband connection points on both Tory Island and Clare Island.  This is a collaborative effort with membership of the group consisting of representatives from the HSE, Donegal County Council and Mayo County Council.  I stress that the initiative is being led by our colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The islands unit links in but other units, as I said in my opening statement, within the Department of Rural and Community Development are very much alive to the need to include the needs of the islands, and island communities, in all of our policies across both community development and rural economic development.  <\/p> <p>  In this collaborative effort e-health consultation rooms are being developed in consultation with local stakeholders and relevant clinical staff.  The e-health facilities will complement the HSE Attend Anywhere initiative and will be suitable for a range of virtual consultations.  The initiative is being developed on Clare Island.  An initial steering group met during the summer with the Cliara local development company, the Western Development Commission, HSE, NUIG and Cisco with a view to establishing a living lab on Clare Island.  The discussions are ongoing.  That is one example of very effective cross-government and cross-departmental work happening on the islands and being spearheaded by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  I acknowledge that interdepartmental and cross-departmental work are always a challenge because each Department has its own priorities and agenda.  Our challenge when we work on the national strategy is to tap into agendas that other Departments want to be prioritised, such as e-health, and we come to them and ask how can we help them to pursue their e-health priorities by using what we have got on the islands, namely the broadband connection points and island communities who are keen to work in a new way.  We have successfully developed that in e-health.  We will take that mindset and approach to the meetings of the interdepartmental committee in our discussions with other Departments.<\/p> <p>  On the whole-of-government piece we, as a Department, do not have responsibility for water systems or energy on the islands.  The roles of the local authorities are very important.  Again, our Department sees the local authorities as key stakeholders.  They are key stakeholders for us right across the country in terms of furthering the objectives of the Our Rural Future policy.  In particular, in terms of the islands, we engage specifically with the local authorities that have island responsibilities too.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022040600002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa"},{"type":"speech","time":1649199600,"counter":1401,"content":"<p>The Chair is very committed to the sustainable development goals and I have made the following argument at this committee before.

We can tell from the engagements we have had how important this policy is to people who live on the islands and what it will mean to them.  The Department will be aware that Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann has asked for a draft copy of that policy document.  The Department has spoken much about engagement and collaboration.  I would ask if that is something that would be actively considered by the Department given it is so important the comhdh&aacute;il is on board with this policy when it is published.  After all of the work, all of the time and all of the delay, the reasons for which I appreciate and understand, it is important we get it right.  There is no point in publishing a big ten-year document if the comhdh&aacute;il is not on board and if such representative bodies are not on board.  It is something the comhdh&aacute;il has requested and I ask that it be considered.  There is clearly still time to do that.<\/p> <p>  Housing is obviously a big concern.  It is something that has been raised by everybody who has come before the committee in relation to the islands.  I welcome that University College Cork is carrying out a survey of housing stock.  I presume that will feed into the work the Department is doing because it will be important when it comes to the housing part of that document.

I also agree that we need to do it in consultation and collaboration with the island communities.  We have an excellent track record in the Department of Rural and Community Development of engaging with communities and with our stakeholders in developing our policies.  I was personally involved in working on Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities, which is our five-year strategy for the community and voluntary sector.  When we developed that, we worked in partnership with a stakeholder group.  That was widely welcomed by the sector when it was published by the former Minister, Deputy Ring, in 2019.  I currently chair a stakeholders' group that oversees the implementation of the policy and I expect we can adopt that kind of model when we are working with the island communities on this policy.  We are committed absolutely to engaging with Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann right throughout this process and we will continue to engage with it as the work evolves.<\/p> <p>  The process of policy development, as the committee will be aware, is an iterative one - we did this also when we were doing the community and voluntary strategy - and takes a variety of different forums such as stakeholder engagement, informal meetings and ongoing dialogue.  We want to make sure we develop a policy that makes sense and is meaningful for everyone involved and to have all the conversations we need to have.  The in-person consultations we will now have on the two remaining islands will also give us a fresh perspective on the issues given the time that has elapsed.<\/p> <p>  It is important to say that, ultimately, decisions on the policy will be a matter for Government and it may not be possible to deliver on everything to which island communities aspire.  However, we are a while away from that yet and we are teasing out those issues.  Teasing them out is what the consultation and engagement process is all about.<\/p> <p>  We are very much committed.

That is a positive development that is taking place on the islands.  If it is successful, there is no reason it cannot be rolled out to the other island communities and on the mainland as well.  Sadly, the shortage of GPs is not only an island problem now.  It is right across this country.<\/p> <p>  Another investment the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications undertook over a decade ago was to bring high-speed broadband to every second level school.  The committee is concerned that has not been exploited to the full extent it should be in terms of broadening the subject choice at second level.  We would be grateful if, in Department's engagement with the Department of Education, Ms Nic Aongusa would bring that concern to its attention.<\/p> <p>  An issue relating to second level schools that was also raised this morning is that two of the five post-primary schools on the islands have small school status but the other three do not.  We have only five second level schools on the islands and surely they should have equality of treatment in terms of that small school status.  Will Ms Nic Aongusa bring that to the attention of the Department of Education as well?<\/p> <p>  In the context of the Department's engagement with local authorities and other Departments, the committee is strongly of the view that if there is investment to improve the water supply to the islands, ducting for fibre-optic and electricity transmission cables would be installed in conjunction, and if the electricity transmission cable is being upgraded, provision would be made to improve the water supply and the fibre-optic cable.  The big part of the cost in terms of delivering those two pieces of infrastructure is the physical ploughing of the seabed to lay the cable.  Surely, from an Exchequer, cross-departmental and value for money point of view and from the point of view of developing the islands, there should be co-ordination in that regard.  Sadly, the regulatory and planning mechanisms do not facilitate it, but through engagement with other Departments and local authorities, we should be able to come up with a broad-minded strategy that would achieve the targets that are set by the island communities to maximise the infrastructural investment when one project is taking place.  We would appreciate it if those matters could be taken back and fed into the interdepartmental working group.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank Ms Nic Aongusa and her officials for the engagement we have had with the Department, not only on the current work programme but in terms of the other engagements we have had with the Department to date.
