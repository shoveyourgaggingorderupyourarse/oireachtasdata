Peer reviews by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have consistently stated that Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation programme is of the highest quality. <\/p><p>Along with a group of like-minded countries, including other EU partners, the Government remains committed to making incremental, sustainable progress towards achieving the UN target of 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) by 2030.  The Programme for Government states that &ldquo;we will continue to make progress towards achieving the UN target of 0.7% of gross national product for ODA, as economic conditions allow and resources permit&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The Government reaffirmed its commitment to delivering 0.7% of GNI to ODA by 2030 in its Global Ireland Strategy. Ireland's new policy for international development, A Better World, was launched earlier this year and provides the framework for that expansion. In order to achieve this ambition difficult choices will be required between competing priorities, especially if economic circumstances change, and this will require ongoing careful planning and consultation with other Government Departments and stakeholders if a steady, phased and prudent approach is to be achieved.<\/p><p>Based on current projections for economic growth, which may change as circumstances evolve, achieving the 0.7% target by 2030 would mean more than tripling the current allocations to ODA, and require sustained, substantial managed increments given that the point of departure is 0.3% of GNI this year.  <\/p><p>The Government is already making progress, having increased allocations to official development assistance by 32% since 2014. Budget 2019 saw the highest increase in funding available in over a decade, with Irish official development assistance in 2019 forecast to reach almost &euro;817 million, an increase of approximately &euro;110 million and a 16% increase on the allocation announced in budget 2018.<\/p><p>Further sustained, managed increments will be required to deliver on the 0.7% commitment by 2030, taking into consideration the range of demands across Government and the capacity of the public finances to meet them.<\/p><p>I can send the Deputy in writing a table which sets out indicative allocations to ODA, based on current economic growth forecasts, which show a possible phased path to reaching the 0.7% target by 2030.

More than four years into the conflict, Yemen is the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis, with almost 80% of the population in need of humanitarian assistance. Ireland supports the efforts of the UN Special Envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths to bring about a political resolution to the crisis in Yemen, including his efforts to ensure implementation of the 2018 Stockholm agreement between the Government of Yemen and the Houthi de facto authorities. <\/p>  <p>   I am very conscious that this is a multifaceted and extremely complex conflict, involving a number of local, regional and international power struggles, often rooted in Yemen&rsquo;s historical divisions. The persistence of the conflict risks leading to further fragmentation, and I support efforts to resolve these issues. Unfortunately, recent efforts in Saudi Arabia involving the Government of Yemen and southern militia groups do not appear to have made progress. <\/p>  <p>   Ireland has raised concerns about the situation in Yemen in our bilateral contacts with a number of third states which are involved in the conflict there, including Saudi Arabia and UAE, and also Iran. In these contacts, we have emphasised the need for an end to human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law, and for full and unfettered humanitarian access. Most recently, for example, my officials raised our concerns about the situation in Yemen with the Saudi Ambassador in Ireland, during a meeting held last week. <\/p>  <p>  Illicit and irresponsible arms flows fuel violence and organised crime, terrorism and conflicts, thwarting sustainable development and crisis management efforts. Ireland does not have our own independent sources of information on illicit arms flows to non-state actors in Yemen, but we support international efforts to tackle and monitor illicit arms flows, through our support for the effective implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty, the 2018 EU Strategy on Small Arms and Light Weapons and the EU sponsored iTrace project. All EU member states have signed up to the Arms Trade Treaty, which exists to ensure that arms sales do not fuel conflicts, and to prevent arms from falling into the hands of non-state actors. <\/p>  <p>  Those countries which do have arms industries have a particular responsibility to ensure that arms do not ultimately fall into the wrong hands. If arms sold to Saudi Arabia have fallen into the hands of terrorists or non-state actors, obviously this would be a matter of deep concern.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland takes every opportunity to press for a political solution to the crisis in Yemen, and for an end to violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and for unfettered humanitarian access to Yemen.

Over time, Department websites are being moved to one single website, <i>gov.ie<\/i>, giving people a one stop shop for accessing information on Government services and organisations.<\/p><p>It is generally seen as best practice to pursue the consolidation of public service information into one consistent accessible website. <\/p><p>The most digitally advanced countries within the EU (see the EU eGovernment Benchmark 2018 - Denmark, Estonia, Austria, Latvia and Malta), have already moved to a single digital gateway approach. Furthermore, a 2016 market research exercise carried out by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform found that the concept of a single, online portal for government was positively received by both the general public and representative bodies alike. This view was again confirmed by a subsequent market research exercise carried out in late 2018.<\/p><p>Following a government decision in December 2017 to migrate all Ministerial Department websites to <i>gov.ie<\/i>, work has proceeded on this basis.  <\/p><p>So far, 5 departments have moved their website content to <i>gov.ie<\/i>- the Departments of the Taoiseach; Public Expenditure and Reform; Rural and Community Development; Transport, Tourism and Sport; and Finance.<\/p><p>As a part of the migration to<i>gov.ie<\/i>, content from websites is reworked and moved into the <i>gov.ie<\/i>website (for example, efforts are made to make the services content easier to understand through the use of plain English).  Post migration, the internet addresses for the new content within <i>gov.ie<\/i>is different from the addresses of the content, including documents, on the old websites.<\/p><p>The migration of a website to a new one with a different address necessarily breaks links to the old website content from external sources.  This happens in all website migrations, including the department websites in question.  This issue is temporary in nature as search engines re-index content on the internet, and also as external sites (that are not search indexes) update their links to point to the new location of content.  <\/p><p>Over time, the issue of finding broken links and being redirected to a department&rsquo;s homepage on <i>gov.ie<\/i>will become less and less frequent, and will eventually cease to occur. <\/p><p>To reduce the temporary impact of the website migrations, the occurrence of visitors to broken links within <i>gov.ie<\/i>is monitored via site analytics. In conjunction with each department&rsquo;s content manager, work is continuously being undertaken where possible to redirect such broken links to the correct and new location within <i>gov.ie<\/i>. Furthermore, prior to website migration into <i>gov.ie<\/i>, work is undertaken to pre-emptively set up such redirects to popular content so as to reduce the likelihood of this issue arising.<\/p><p>Between search engine re-indexing and the ongoing efforts based on website analytics, the user experience of <i>gov.ie<\/i>in regards to the matter the Deputy refers will improve over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700069#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700069#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[36419\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700069#WRC01800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the amount expended on the renewal of licences (details supplied) by his Department since 2009 to date in 2019; and the amount projected to be spent on the renewal of such licences by his Department over the next five years.","asker":"1226","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>IBM Notes, known as Lotus Notes prior to 2012, is used in the Department of the Taoiseach and is appropriately licensed.

Over four years of conflict have resulted in the world&rsquo;s worst humanitarian crisis, with the country&rsquo;s economy decimated and millions on the brink of famine. It is vital that we continue to push for a political resolution to the conflict that is driving this crisis. Ireland supports the efforts of the UN Special Envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, to bring about such a resolution, including his efforts to ensure implementation of the 2018 Stockholm agreement between the Government of Yemen and the Houthi de facto authorities. <\/p>  <p>  While the UN Special Envoy is mandated to focus his mediation efforts on the two main parties to the conflict, there are many other armed groups operating in Yemen and controlling a patchwork of areas across the country. I was very concerned to hear of a new front opening up in August in the southern port city of Aden, where forces who had previously fought against the Houthis have attacked government forces. <\/p>  <p>  I wish every success to efforts to promote negotiations between the Government of Yemen and southern militia groups, and I regret that the recent talks in Saudi Arabia have not yet led to success. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the humanitarian crisis, the persistence of widespread human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law is particularly worrying. I have put Ireland at the centre of UN efforts to prepare the ground for accountability in the long term for what has occurred in Yemen.\u00a0 Ireland is a member of the core group which helped establish the Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen at the Human Rights Council in September 2017. The Group&rsquo;s second report, released earlier this month, makes for sobering reading with conditions on the ground in Yemen having worsened. There continues to be a lack of accountability for the gross violations of international law committed by all sides. Ireland will push for a renewal of the Group&rsquo;s mandate at the Human Rights Council so that it can continue to carry out its vital work in recording and reporting on these violations. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has communicated its concerns about the situation in Yemen directly to the Saudi Arabian and UAE authorities on numerous occasions.

The EU welcomed the agreement as an important milestone and called on all parties to implement it in good faith. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste also warmly welcomed the signing of that agreement.

The zero rate for food and drink is provided for under a derogation from EU VAT law which allows Member States to retain certain zero rates for goods and services which were expressly covered in their national VAT legislation on 1 January 1991. The legislative provision for food and drink was in place on 1 January 1991; however, there was no legislative provision for food supplement products and therefore they cannot be legally zero rated.<\/p><p>Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils and Revenue&rsquo;s guidance simply reflected this. The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplement products was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector and has never been disputed by Revenue. However, the various VAT rating decisions published in its VAT rates database and other information made available in whatever form on food supplement products cannot override VAT law.<\/p><p>Revenue has acknowledged that the scope of its zero rating concession had broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplement products that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. Revenue acknowledges that this concessionary approach was unsatisfactory and led to diverging and inconsistent practices. There were continuous efforts by elements in the industry to expand the zero rate to products that should be standard rated, including products claiming to enhance male fertility, promote hair growth, boost tanning, avoid a hangover and reduce stress.<\/p><p>Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act. The expert prepared a detailed, scientific report that concluded that food supplement products are not conventional food. Based on the expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. Following this review, Revenue engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Act 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Act 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned until 1 November 2019. This will allow time for the\u00a0consideration of any legislative changes in the context of Budget 2020. <\/p><p>My Department carried out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. The consultation sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts and the Minister for Health. The results of the consultation were included in the recently published 2019 VAT Tax Strategy Group (&lsquo;TSG&rsquo;) paper as part of the Budget 2020 process.

However, as the matter raised relates to pension policy for the public service generally, I will address the questions raised.  <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, I should clarify that retirement lump sum payments made under public service pension schemes were not directly reduced by the Financial Emergency Measure in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation. The FEMPI legislation implemented measures that directly reduced the pay of serving staff and introduced a Public Service Pension Reduction for pensions in payment, subject to certain rates, thresholds and exemptions. As both the annual pensions and lump sum payments of members of pre-existing public service pension schemes (i.e. excluding the Single Public Service Pension Scheme) are directly linked to salary at retirement, the reductions to the pay of public servants would have had a knock on impact on the lump sum payment they received at retirement. <\/p>  <p>  However, because of what is known as the first &lsquo;grace period&rsquo;, those who retired between 1 January 2010 and 29 February 2012 did not have the first FEMPI pay reduction (imposed 1 January 2010) reflected in the salary rate used to calculate their annual pension or their lump sum. A second round of FEMPI reductions was imposed in 2013 (imposed on 1 July on public servants with an annual remuneration above &euro;65,000). The second &lsquo;grace period&rsquo; meant that those who retired from that point onwards (assuming their pay was affected by those reductions while still serving) did not have those reductions reflected in the salary rate used to calculate their annual pension or lump sum. <\/p>  <p>  In the cases referred to by the Deputies, retirement occurred after 1 March 2012 and so the retirement lump sum was calculated by reference to the salary rates in payment on 1 January 2010 (i.e. following the first FEMPI pay reduction). If the salary at retirement was subject to the second FEMPI reduction on 1 July 2013, the operation of the second grace period would mean that the lump sum would still have been calculated by reference to the 1 January 2010 rate. <\/p>  <p>  The two grace periods were the only protections given in relation to the calculation and payment of retirement lump sums in the context of the FEMPI legislation, and I have no proposals to make any change in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  As regards pension increases, the current pension increase policy for pre-existing pension schemes was agreed by the Government as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 (PSSA). This policy is essentially a time-limited (expires end-2020) resumption of the non-statutory pension increase arrangements, sometimes known as pay parity, which formerly prevailed, but which lapsed in 2010.

The starting salaries for a new entrant special need assistant and school secretaries paid on a public service payscale in 2012 was &euro;20,869. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of these staff is now &euro;23,999 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;24,602.<\/p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).<\/p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.  This agreement will benefit both 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring. <\/p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectorial issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically in respect of school secretaries, I recognise the very important work done by these staff, and the other support staff in the running of our schools.  I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  <\/p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.<\/p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of these surveys.  In these circumstances any industrial action by F&Oacute;RSA members is considered premature, not least because the period of the current arbitration agreement has not expired.  My officials are fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once the survey work has been undertaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700073#WRG04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":407,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700073#WRG04800"},{"type":"question","counter":408,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[37097\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700073#WRG04900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he has engaged with a union (details supplied) since it announced its latest intention to explore the possibility of industrial action.","asker":"1287","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":409,"content":"<p>Members of the TUI voted to accept the September 2018 new entrant pay deal and this agreement is benefiting 16,000 teachers within the education sector. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement.

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  <\/p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.<\/p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of these surveys.  In these circumstances any industrial action by F&Oacute;RSA members is considered premature, not least because the period of the current arbitration agreement has not expired.  My officials are fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once the survey work has been undertaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700074#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700074#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[37179\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700074#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to establish new schools in Citywest, Dublin 24, in view of the increase in population and projected growth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System, using data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.

This informed approach will help to reduce the incidence of obesity in our young people. <\/p><p>Schools are strongly encouraged to have a formal healthy eating policy that has been developed in consultation with students and parents. <\/p><p>Guidelines are available to schools on developing a healthy eating policy in Post-Primary Schools, which have been developed by the Department of Health and HSE. The healthy eating policy should outline how the school supports healthy eating practices through the promotion of healthy lunches and healthy snacks and other means. <\/p><p>My Department has issued circulars to all primary and post primary schools on the Promotion of Healthy Lifestyles. <\/p><p>In relation to higher education institutions, these are autonomous institutions and the management of their affairs are matters for the individual institutions concerned. I understand that the Department of Health, under its Healthy Ireland Initiative, is developing a Healthy Campus Framework in consultation with these institutions. This Framework adopts a holistic understanding of health, takes a whole campus approach and<b><\/b>aspires to create a learning environment and organisational culture that enhances the health and wellbeing of its community.<\/p><p>I hope you find this information useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700074#WRH05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Question Heading for question(s)  211","counter":496,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700074#WRH05600"},{"type":"question","counter":497,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[37293\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700074#WRH05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 540 of 23 July 2019, if the letter of intent has issued; if a letter of acceptance has issued; when construction will commence on site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1301","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":498,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the delivery of the project for Naas Community College has been devolved to Kildare and Wicklow Education &amp;amp; Training Board (KWETB). <\/p><p>The project is still at tender stage and the Letter of Intent has not issued yet.

Psychologists support schools in connecting with Primary Care Psychology Services and Child and Adolescent Mental Health services in relation to individual children and young people with mental health needs. Psychologists support and encourage the establishment of referral and communication protocols between education and health services at local level and work with others to develop community based mental health promotion strategies.  In addition NEPS psychologists provide support to schools in implementing Student Support Teams in Post Primary Schools. <\/p><p>NEPS also provides guidelines and resource materials for schools to enable them to deal with certain traumatic events which can adversely affect students and school staff. The guidelines <i>responding to Critical Incidents: Guidelines and Resource Materials for Schools<\/i>(2016) refer to preventive approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment. It also outlines how schools can plan for crises.  The publication provides support to schools at a potentially overwhelming time with practical step-by-step guidance for teachers and principals on how to respond when a tragedy occurs. The guidelines focus on alerting schools to planning processes, structures and actions which will better allow them to cope with a traumatic incidents such as suicide or suspected suicide, murder, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness of members of the school community. In relation to suicide, advice is also given on prevention and positive mental health stratagems and approaches.  NEPS psychologists will also, at the specific invitation of school authorities, attend at the schools immediately following such incidents to offer direct advice and assistance to school staff and students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700076#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Closures","counter":577,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700076#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":578,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[37665\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700076#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 458 of 6 September 2019 did not reply to the question posed; the reason the commitment to meet a deputation was not honoured before a decision made in relation to the subject matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":579,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[37667\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700076#WRK00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the consideration which was given to the concerns raised in Topical Issue Debate No. 3 of 2 July 2019 on the proposed closure of two second-level schools (details supplied) in County Cavan with particular reference to the commitment of the Minister of State with special responsibility for higher education to bring these issues to his attention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":580,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[37669\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700076#WRK00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if funding has been committed to a proposed project (details supplied); if so, when a decision was made; the level of funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":581,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[37726\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700076#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason detailed and comprehensive submissions (details supplied) forwarded to his Department were not acknowledged on the proposed closure of two second-level schools; his views on whether this manner of ignoring the views of local communities and organisations is unacceptable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":582,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244, 246, 248 and 252 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the decision making authority for any amalgamation is the Patron\/Trustees of the schools, and this is subject to the approval of my Department.

The Cybercrime Convention is very broad in scope and provisions of the Convention are provided for in criminal justice, interception, sexual offences, extradition, mutual legal assistance and copyright legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The most significant step towards ratification of the Budapest Convention was the enactment in 2017 of the first Bill in this jurisdiction specifically targeted at cybercrime.  The Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Act 2017 gave effect to an EU Directive on attacks against information systems, the main provisions of which reflect the key provisions of the Convention. <\/p>  <p>  This recent legislation therefore also gives effect to provisions in the Convention relating to offences against information systems and their data and search and seizure powers in respect of such data.

Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the Convention's requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) 2017 &ndash; 2021 contains a wide range of practical commitments to improve the position of people with disabilities in Ireland. It provides a mechanism for joined-up working to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to implementing the UNCRPD.\u00a0The NDIS Steering Group, which oversees and monitors the implementation of the Strategy, has\u00a0an important role in guiding progress in this area. The Group is committed to carrying out a mid-term review of the Strategy by the end of this year.\u00a0It is expected that the review\u00a0will examine how the Strategy is aligned with the articles of the\u00a0Convention and how the Strategy could be revised and built upon in order to continue progressive realisation of the aims of the Convention. The National Disability Authority (NDA)\u00a0also plays a critical\u00a0role in the implementation of the Convention, and will be carrying out a review of progress with respect to the Strategy&rsquo;s key indicators in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  Of particular relevance to Article 12 of the Convention is the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.\u00a0 The 2015 Act will abolish the current Wards of Court system by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871. Part 6 of the 2015 Act provides that adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements provided for in the Act on a phased basis over 3 years from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the 2015 Act can be commenced. The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020. \u00a0This lead-in timeframe ensures that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. <\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to take practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.\u00a0 The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published in April\u00a02017 and many of its recommendations have been implemented. In addition, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024 includes positive action measures to support the recruitment of people with disabilities in the public service and in the wider economy.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the practical measures outlined, the Deputy will be aware of a number of legislative developments to support the implementation of the Convention.<\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, my colleague the Minister for Health is progressing Heads of a Bill to provide legislative clarity on the issue of deprivation of liberty. A report of a recent public consultation on these draft legislative provisions is nearing completion, and every effort is being made to progress this legislation as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which contains key legislative amendments needed for compliance with the Convention, was published in December 2016. The Bill includes provisions to establish the monitoring framework required by Article 33 of the Convention to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention. It requires the involvement and participation of civil society, in particular, persons with disabilities, in the monitoring process.<\/p>  <p>  The monitoring framework will include both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) and the National Disability Authority (NDA) and will be governed by a formal Memorandum of Understanding. In January of this year, the IHREC established a Disability Advisory Committee, composed of a diverse group of persons with lived experience of disability. This will ensure the direct participation of persons with disabilities and the organisations representing them in monitoring how the Convention is implemented in Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The IHREC is best placed to make periodic independent reports to the UN, supported by progress assessments and statistical information supplied by the NDA.\u00a0 The NDA has expertise and information resources in relation to reporting on disability issues\u00a0and is carrying out work in a range of areas to support implementation; including the preparation of non-healthcare Codes of Practice under the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015, and review of progress with respect to\u00a0the key indicators of the NDIS.<\/p>  <p>  Significant year-on-year budgetary increases in the disability sector have positively impacted the lived experience of people with disabilities in Ireland. However, I recognise that daily challenges remain for many people with disabilities and for their families.\u00a0\u00a0 Addressing the needs and rights of people living with a disability and their families is a priority for this Government and my primary focus as Minister of State for Disability Issues. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities supports that priority in providing a comprehensive and robust framework for the realisation of those rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700078#WRM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":742,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700078#WRM02600"},{"type":"question","counter":743,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[37662\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700078#WRM02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when he plans to publish the sex offenders (amendment) Bill; the reason for the delay in presenting a stamped copy of the Bill to Cabinet; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":744,"content":"<p>I appreciate and understand the concern which communities can have in relation to the issue of rehabilitation of sex offenders and in relation to measures to protect public safety.<\/p><p>The General Scheme of the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill was developed by my Department following a comprehensive review of current law and administrative practice.

questions about IDA properties in Fermoy, as well as three separate questions each in respect of IDA property in Mallow and Carrigtwohill.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Fermoy, the Agency owns two sites consisting of 0.94 hectares in Rathealy and 6.05 hectares in the Business and Technology (B&amp;T) Park on the Dublin Road. I have been informed by the IDA that they are not currently in talks with any third parties about the sites. While these properties in Fermoy are suitable for investment, information on any visits to them by IDA clients is not available as the Agency only collates site visit data on a county-by-county basis. <\/p>  <p>  As for Carrigtwohill, the IDA owns approximately 65.5 hectares of marketable land in that area, comprised of 12.5 hectares on the Carrigtwohill B&amp;T Park and 53 hectares in the Ballyadam area. In Mallow, there are 0.68 hectares of marketable land at the Agency&rsquo;s B&amp;T Park there. While information on site visits to these specific locations is not available, the Agency is actively marketing the properties in Carrigtwohill and Mallow to potential investors.  <\/p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously, the availability of marketable lands, such as these, in advance of demand continues to be a crucial ingredient in the IDA&rsquo;s capacity to compete for mobile foreign direct investment (FDI). Not only does such a supply of properties help the Agency to secure high quality jobs but it also allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It therefore remains an important means by which the IDA can encourage and attract new investors to Ireland, particularly to regional locations.<\/p>  <p>  County Cork continues to be a strong performer in terms of FDI. This trend is continuing, with a steady and positive increase in employment numbers in IDA Ireland client companies in the County over the past number of years. There are currently 169 IDA client companies in Cork, employing approximately 39,000 people.  There have also been a number of recent significant recent job announcements by IDA clients including 400 jobs at VoxPro, 200 positions at Deutsche Borse Group and 100 new jobs at Forcepoint.  <\/p>  <p>  It is clear, not least from the County's recent performance over the last number of years, that Cork has a robust enterprise base and remains a highly attractive destination for overseas companies. Work will nevertheless continue, by both the enterprise agencies and the Government, to boost further investment and job creation in County Cork and the broader South-West region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700078#WRM06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Data","counter":779,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700079#WRN00300"},{"type":"question","counter":780,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[37567\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700079#WRN00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of applicants and participants in Brexit schemes and supports provided by her Department or agencies under her remit in tabular form; the counties these companies are located in; and the amount allocated and expended to each such scheme in each year since being established.","asker":"1271","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":781,"content":"<p>Since 2016, my Department and its agencies have put in place extensive supports, schemes and advisory resources to prepare Irish businesses for the potential challenges posed by Brexit by helping them to assess their preparedness and helping them to implement practical action plans in areas such as customs, supply chain and sourcing, and financial management.

statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":794,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 322, 336, 340, 353 and 359 together.<\/p>  <p>The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).\u00a0 The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.\u00a0 It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.\u00a0 NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.\u00a0 Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p>  <p>  In 2009 the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12-13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults.\u00a0 In September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.\u00a0 Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and is provided free of charge to girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  During the 2019\/20 school year, girls attending secondary school can still join the HPV girls only programme with appointments offered in HSE mop up clinics.\u00a0 It must be noted that vaccinated women and girls may still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p>  <p>  As you are aware, NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys.\u00a0 On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme, which offers HPV vaccination to all girls in their first year of second level education (generally 12 to 13 year olds), to a programme that also offers the vaccination to boys in their first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.\u00a0 A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys starting in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.\u00a0 However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for several reasons:<\/p>  <p>  - Vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;<\/p>  <p>  - Boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases.\u00a0 As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.\u00a0 Therefore, the gender neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.\u00a0 All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p>  <p>  Extending the HPV vaccine to boys will also provide direct protection to boys against HPV-related disease. \u00a0It also provides indirect herd protection to girls who have not been vaccinated.\u00a0 Another important factor\u00a0includes the additional protection provided by a gender neutral programme to vulnerable groups (for example, men who have sex with men) and the potential to improve the resilience of the immunisation programme to fluctuations in vaccine uptake and to the movement of individuals into and out of the country.<\/p>  <p>  For older children who did not receive the vaccine as part of the School Immunisation Programme the HPV vaccine can only be obtained privately from a GP.\u00a0 If your child is 15 years of age or older they will require three doses of the HPV vaccine in order to be fully protected.\u00a0 Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered free of charge by their GP.\u00a0 However, the cost of purchasing the vaccine privately is not covered by the medical card.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence\u00a0on this issue in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700079#WRN01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the HSE's National Service Plan for 2019, the NHSS is expected to support 23,042 people in 2019. The NHSS budget for 2019 is &euro;985.8m which is an increase of &euro;24.3m over its 2018 budget.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has noted that the number of residents in nursing homes whom are supported by the NHSS is ahead of forecast for the year to date. The latest available performance reports indicate that there are 23,236 people supported in the Scheme at the end of\u00a0July this year. This is significantly more people than forecast and this creates a challenge. The HSE has also advised that the cost of care continues to rise and the average weekly cost per bed is higher in 2019 than anticipated.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the available budget and the demand for support, the HSE releases funding in a managed way to ensure that the operation of the NHSS remains within the budgetary allocation.\u00a0To manage the available funds throughout the year, a national placement list for the release of funding is operated by the HSE, to enable it to operate within budget. Funding issues to applicants in chronological order, to ensure equity nationally. Approved applicants are placed on the national placement list in order of their approval date and funding is released to applicants in order of their place on this list. The length of time spent on the placement list depends on the number of applicants currently receiving financial support and the number of new applications. Where demand is higher, the time spent on the waiting list may increase having regard for the prudent management of the Scheme's budget.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working to ensure that the resources that are available are deployed in the most effective way possible and deliver the best outcomes for older people, and are also engaging extensively with the HSE in the context of planning for winter, including consideration of the response to dealing with the current challenges such as the high-level of delayed transfers of care. While this engagement continues the HSE has been authorised to undertake immediate action to mitigate the challenges. Engagement will continue over the coming weeks having regard to the Estimates 2020 process.<\/p>  <p>  Delayed Transfers of Care continue to represent a significant challenge to the Health Service as a whole, and for some hospital patients their ultimate destination will be into transitional care or long term residential care supported by the NHSS. However, there are a number of\u00a0challenges apart from those related to the NHSS, that lead to delayed transfers of care.

This reflects our three-pillar policy approach to achieving carbon neutrality without comprising sustainable food production. <\/p><p>My Department acknowledges that the target set for the sector to reduce emissions from 20.2 Mt CO<sub>2<\/sub>eq to less than 19 Mt CO<sub>2<\/sub>eq by 2030 is extremely ambitious and not without its challenges but the Teagasc MACC illustrates a suite of actions that provide opportunity for emissions reductions.  These include both efficiency measures such as the Dairy EBI programme and technical measures such as changes in fertiliser type or low emissions slurry spreading as well as a series of forestry and bioeceonomy measures.<\/p><p>To reach the target of 19 Mt CO<sub>2<\/sub>eq in 2030 will require us to manage the emissions profile from the sector between now and then through mobilisation of as many of these actions as possible as early as possible with high rates of adoption across our 139,000 farms.<\/p><p>The Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC) report further highlights the importance of early adoption by farmers of the measures outlined in the Climate Action Plan and illustrates the exposure that livestock numbers are open to if implementation of the Teagasc MACC is not achieved at a sufficient pace. Any hesitancy in take up of these actions will jeopardise our delivery on our committed targets and effectively bring the size of the national herd into focus. However, mechanisms such as the CAP reform, market incentives and regulation are all been investigated in full by all the relevant stakeholders, including industry, to mobilise the necessary actions as swiftly as possible. <\/p><p>The next Common Agriculture Policy will be fully aligned with this need to prioritise climate action.

Ireland has a comparative advantage in grass-based carbon efficient livestock production. <\/p>  <p>  The EU Commission JRC report (2010) found that Ireland is the most carbon efficient producer in the EU per unit of dairy production, and the 5th most carbon efficient producer of beef per kg. Notwithstanding this, inherent challenges remain for the sector in terms of contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s climate change and renewable energy targets. Throughout Europe, reducing greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture has proven difficult, with only a 1% reduction across the EU since 2005. While Irish agriculture emissions fell during the period 2005 to 2011, they have since risen, driven by larger herds and rising milk production reflecting the removal of milk quotas in 2015. However, while agriculture is contributing to emissions, it should also be seen part of the solution. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s policy position for the agriculture sector is an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. There are three strands to my Department&rsquo;s approach to carbon neutrality:<\/p>  <p>  1. reducing agricultural emissions;<\/p>  <p>  2. increasing carbon sequestration; and<\/p>  <p>  3. displacing and substituting fossil fuel and energy intensive materials.<\/p>  <p>  The All-of-Government Climate Action Plan to Tackle Climate Disruption sets a series of step-up measures and underpinning actions and proposed targets for all sectors including the agriculture, forestry and land use sector.

In total, Bord Bia has cumulatively undertaken over 200,000 carbon footprint assessments on a national scale to date, a world first. The Teagasc Sustainability Survey shows that the top performing third of farms emitted, on average, 9.6 kg CO2 equivalent per kg beef, compared with 14.9 kg for the bottom performing third of cattle farms. Reducing this variability is a real opportunity to make progress in reducing emissions from cattle production in Ireland. Therefore, the well-established and proven QA framework encompassing 33,000 farm visits per year offers huge potential to scale efforts to meet our climate challenges at farm level in particular with the implementation of the MACC measures. <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the agriculture sector as a whole will contribute significantly to Ireland&rsquo;s decarbonisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700086#WRU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1288,"content":"<p>Question No. 500 answered with Question No. 498.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Environmental Efficiency Scheme Pilot","counter":1289,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700086#WRU02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1290,"qnumday":501,"qnumall":"[37484\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700086#WRU02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the way in which the beef environment efficiency pilot scheme is compatible with recommendations of the report from the Climate Change Advisory Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1291,"content":"<p>The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP)\u00a0is a one year pilot to further increase economic and environmental efficiency in the suckler herd through better quality data on herd performance, specifically as it relates to weaning efficiency of the cow, supporting decision making on farm.

The Plan recognises that afforestation has a significant role to play in mitigation, particularly through carbon sequestration  and sets a  target of 8,000 hectares per annum of new planting. Achieving this target will be challenging, as recent trends have not delivered planting at this rate.  It is the case that farm forestry is key to increasing our planting rates, and it is of note that the majority of planting in recent years has been on farms, where forestry complements the farming enterprise and provides the farmer with an additional income source and a long-term asset.<\/p>  <p>  Successive national programmes have supported afforestation and I will continue to support farmers to plant trees through the provision of generous grants and 15 year premiums under the current Forestry Programme 2014 -2020.  These grants and premiums were significantly increased in 2018, with a view to encouraging greater uptake, and this has had some impact, particularly in terms of broadleaf planting.  <\/p>  <p>  A greater awareness of the multi-functional benefits of forestry will make afforestation a more attractive proposition for all land-owners, including farmers. That is why I have funded 15 promotional projects, at a cost of nearly &euro;1million to raise awareness of the environmental, recreational and social benefits of forestry. These projects, which run to end 2020, have a regional spread and cover a range of activities from educational to community-based initiatives to forest management and open days on woodland establishment.  This is in addition to the Teagasc Forestry Promotion Campaign 2018 &ndash; 2020 which has an important focus on educating the next generation of young farmers in forestry as they pass through the Teagasc third level college system. The campaign also includes promotion activities at farming events across the country such as the Dairy Open Day and Crops and Cultivation Open Day targeting farmers who may not have considered forestry as an option. <\/p>  <p>  Current farm forestry owners can encourage others to plant or even increase the level of planting on their own farms. These forest-owners are receiving assistance in understanding and managing their forest asset through Knowledge Transfer groups, where peer-to-peer learning and trained advisors disseminate information over a series of meetings.   My Department funds these groups with 37 new groups approved this year.  The message that needs to be more widely understood is that a valuable income can be secured from a forestry crop and this may go some way towards addressing the reluctance  to plant.<\/p>  <p>  We will of course also be examining ways in which farm forestry can be better integrated into the new CAP. This is to ensure that there are no barriers to planting while also providing for possible tree-planting measures under the new CAP through, for example, new agri-environment schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700086#WRU05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":1320,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700086#WRU05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1321,"qnumday":511,"qnumall":"[37597\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700086#WRU05300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the instructions given to agriculture and food attach&eacute;s to embassies that have such officials in respect of climate change commitments in the agrifood sector; and the job descriptions of each.","asker":"1366","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1322,"content":"<p>The role of the Agriculture Attach&eacute; is wide and varied and depends on the location of the posting.\u00a0 The main functions of the post include gathering and dissemination of information, including in respect of climate change, in both directions to and from the host country and to and from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.\u00a0 Other functions include trade assistance, development and facilitation in co-operation with Team Ireland and representation of Ireland&rsquo;s interests at EU and international level.\u00a0 All Agriculture Attach&eacute; roles include the development of relationships at both political and official level to ensure the positive representation of Ireland&rsquo;s interests overseas and\u00a0my experience is that such contacts are crucial.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, including our overseas Attach&eacute;s, is acutely aware of challenges we face as a society regarding Climate Change and\u00a0is actively engaged as part of the whole of Government approach in how we must go further in transitioning to a low-carbon, competitive, sustainable and climate resilient economy and society. <\/p>  <p>  The recent All-of-Government Climate Plan to tackle Climate Change sets out over 180 actions to meet Ireland&rsquo;s EU targets for 2030 (i.e. 30% reduction on GHG emissions based on 2005 levels) and sets an ambition of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 while acknowledging the national policy position of an approach to carbon neutrality within the agriculture and land-use sector. <\/p>  <p>  Our Agriculture Attach&eacute;s have a unique opportunity in their roles to disseminate Irish Government Climate Change Policy while also acting as a conduit for the learning and exchanging of international best practice to inform and update our own approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700086#WRU05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teagasc Activities","counter":1323,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700086#WRU05500"},{"type":"question","counter":1324,"qnumday":512,"qnumall":"[37598\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700086#WRU05600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he has requested Teagasc to develop a new MACC analysis for climate mitigation that includes scenarios with a smaller national herd as per the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council in its 2019 Annual Review.","asker":"1366","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1325,"content":"<p>My Department has noted the Climate Change Advisory Council`s Annual Review 2019 which sets out several different scenarios whereby methane emissions from the national herd can be reduced.

The Council notes that emissions from agriculture represent approximately one third of total emissions and that emissions increased by 2.9% in 2017 compared to 2016, and by 6.9% relative to 2014. The Council's Annual Review notes that this has largely been driven by the removal of quotas on dairy production, resulting in higher dairy cow numbers with an increase in milk production.   To address the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland, I published the Climate Action Plan on 17 June. The Plan sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Plan requires a significant step-up in ambition, with a target abatement range for each of the key sectors that contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions: Electricity, Enterprise, Built Environment, Transport, Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use, Waste and the Circular Economy, and the Public Sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan identifies a 10% - 15% reduction in emissions from agriculture, relative to business as usual projections. It sets out a range of actions to: reduce emissions on farms; promote afforestation and diversification of land use; develop opportunities in the bio-economy and in the supply of substitutes for fossil fuels; promote better management of peatlands and soils; and develop clusters of best practice. Implementation of these actions will, collectively, help to further underpin the environmental credentials of the Irish agriculture sector and better position it to meet the evolving expectations of both domestic and international markets. This, in turn, will help prepare the sector for longer-term restructuring and adaptation that will be required to meet our carbon neutrality objectives.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the costs of purchasing carbon credits for compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s emissions targets for the period 2013 to 2020 under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision 406\/2009\/EC (ESD), my Department currently estimates the additional costs to be in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required. This is in addition to a total of &euro;120 million that has already been spent as part of Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to meet its targets under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012), arising from which approximately 5,500,000 carbon credits are currently held by the State, which may be used for ESD compliance.

A high proportion of this is under agricultural and other uses, with 16% designated for nature conservation purposes. Peatlands represent 64% of our total soil organic carbon stock, representing the largest store of carbon in the Irish landscape.

Almost two thirds of renewable energy used in Ireland comes from renewable electricity. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has published and started implementing the Climate Action Plan, which sets out the actions which must be taken in order for Ireland to meet its climate targets. <\/p>  <p>The Climate Action Plan includes a 70% target of our electricity coming from renewable sources. The majority of this target will be delivered by an increase in on-shore and off-shore wind, as well as solar. However, when Ireland meets its renewable electricity target for 2030, having fully removed coal and peat from electricity generation, there will still be a requirement for back-up when the level of wind needed or the level of sunshine is not available. <\/p>  <p>  For example, in a recent 30 day period, 25% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity was provided by wind generation. However, over this same period, one day had only 4% of our electricty provided by wind and on another day it provided 62% of our electricty. To ensure that power is still available on a day or a week where there is very little wind, it will be necessary to consider the appropriate fuel mix in reaching 70% renewable electricity. <\/p>  <p>  In all projected transitions to a low carbon economy by 2050, gas will continue to play a role in sustaining the transition. It plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more CO2-intensive fossil fuels. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, gas-fired electricity generation is well placed to address the intermittency of wind and solar supplies and provide back-up flexibility and reliability for our electricity supply. While batteries, greater interconnection and demand side response will play a role, gas fired power stations will provide flexible and reliable electricity, particularly when weather powered, intermittent sources of energy can be very low for prolonged periods of time, possibly lasting weeks at a time. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to LNG projects, commercial developers have proposed a number of projects, including the Shannon LNG project and another project in Cork. Final investment decisions for these projects and compliance with any legal and regulatory requirements in relation to consents or permits are the responsibility of the project promoters. <\/p>  <p>  The production, sourcing, buying and selling of natural gas produced outside this jurisdiction would also be an operational matter for the undertakings involved. Any undertaking would be required to comply with EU law in this area. In relation to fracked gas in Ireland, the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Prohibition of Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing) Act 2017 provides for the prohibition of exploration for and extraction of onshore petroleum by means of hydraulic fracturing. <\/p>  <p>  All Projects of Common Interest must fulfil the conditions on environmental assessment procedures provided for in both national and European law. EU Regulation 347\/2013, which provides for the designation of a project of common interest, does not override the requirement to comply with environmental law. Any legal and regulatory requirements of the permit granting process, including environmental assessment, are the responsibility of the individual project promoters. Decisions on consents for the construction of an LNG plant would be a matter for the relevant consenting authorities, including the Environmental Protection Agency, where appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will undertake an evaluation of security of energy supply taking into account our transition to a zero carbon world so we can make decisions based on evidence. This review will include a full consideration of international evidence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700088#WRW03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Oireachtas Joint Committee Recommendations","counter":1441,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700088#WRW03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1442,"qnumday":557,"qnumall":"[37591\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700088#WRW03500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the efforts he has made to implement the recommendation regarding assigning overall responsibility for the peatland conservation programme under actions 131 and 134 of the Climate Action Plan 2019 and chapter 8 page 75 of the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1443,"content":"<p>Better management of peatlands and soils under Actions 131 to 134 in the Plan will support the protection and enhancement of the carbon sink function of peatland landscapes, including through assessment and implementation of mitigation options on post-production, peat extraction sites, and the implementation of measures for peatlands conservation.

The lack of consistency of care together with high staff turnover levels impacts directly on quality, and low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill the workforce. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care practitioners has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better child outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past 4 budgets the level of public investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare services has increased by 117%. The level of investment needs to continue to rise if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure staff wages and conditions will improve.<\/p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff. <\/p>  <p>  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. <\/p>  <p>  I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage levels. Under the terms of industrial relations legislation, for the process of establishing a Sectoral Employment Order to commence, the bodies commencing the process must satisfy the Labour Court that they are \"substantially representative\" of either the workers or the employers in the sector. I can assure the Deputy that my Department will readily co-operate with a Sectoral Employment Order process when it is under way. <\/p>  <p>  In the interim, I have introduced a range of measures to support employers to improve pay and conditions. These include a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; annual Programme Support Payments to recognise administrative demands; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer\u00a0full-time employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.<\/p>  <p>  I have set out my vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in\u00a0First 5,\u00a0which contains a commitment to develop\u00a0a Workforce Development Plan.

This general responsibility includes the provision of early childhood, primary, post-primary and higher education and the range of related provision and supports. Children in care, with the exception of the very small number in special care centres, access these forms of education on the same basis as their peers who are not in the care of the State. For the very small number of children who require special care (14 children at the end of Q1 2019), specialised educational and clinical services are provided by the special care centre.<\/p>  <p>  Education plays a critical role in every child&rsquo;s life, none more so than children who are in the care of the State. For children who have experienced disadvantage in their early life education can provide an opportunity to break the cycle of disadvantage and create a different future.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, educational needs form a central part of care planning for children in the care of the State. In the same vein, the aftercare provisions of the Child Care Act 1991 (as amended) require the educational needs of the child or eligible young person to from part of their statutory assessment of need for aftercare supports. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, provides a wide range of data relating to children in care and the wider child protection system. National administrative data on the educational experience of Ireland&rsquo;s care population is made available in Tusla&rsquo;s quarterly performance and activity reports, which are published on the Tusla website. <\/p>  <p>  This data provides detail on children&rsquo;s participation in education, including the number of children in care and the number of young adults in aftercare who are in full time education. The aftercare data has recently been developed further, with figures available from Q2 2018 for the number of young adults in receipt of an aftercare service who are (i) in Second Level education, (ii) in Vocational Training (including Youthreach schemes), (iii) in PLCs, (iv) in Third Level College\/University, or (v) in Accredited Training (e.g. Solas).

This income is derived, in the main, from a combination of rent payments from the tenant and monthly payments made by the local authority to the AHB in accordance with a P&amp;amp;A agreement which is in place for each of these properties. The Agreements entered into under this model can be for a long period of time, up to 30 years, which may place additional cyclical maintenance\/life cycle costs responsibilities on the AHB. <\/p><p>The main area in which specific management and maintenance fees or ongoing supports are provided relate to the now closed Capital Loan &amp;amp; Subsidy Scheme (CLSS).

Funding is available to cover elements of the cost of administering various agreements and related outlay in the initial period of a new property becoming available for social housing under various arrangements. Specifically, there are two separate forms of start-up funding available to AHBs which are funded by local authorities and recouped to them by my Department:<\/p><p>- Capital start-up funding up to 1.5% of the capital cost of either the acquisition, construction or refurbishment of the homes being made available under a P&amp;amp;A agreement that has received a Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) loan from the local authority;<\/p><p>- Leasing\/P&amp;amp;A start-up funding up to 5% of the value of the first year&rsquo;s P&amp;amp;A payment on a property.<\/p><p>In the case of CALF start-up costs, the capital cost is verified with vouched expenditure by the local authority at the signing of the Capital Advance Agreement, i.e. the loan agreement, and the start-up claims are subsequently drawn down post-completion of the properties.

Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers. <\/p><p>In relation to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, my Department understands from the relevant local authority that their Building Control Officer is actively engaging with the builder and the assigned certifier to ensure the issues involved are remediated and compliance with the Building Regulations is achieved, as a priority. <\/p><p>The Safe as Houses report referred to has been considered by my Department and while I can subscribe to many of the principles in the report, I believe that the established building control reform agenda, with its many initiatives, already provides a comprehensive roadmap for embedding a culture of compliance and accountability within the construction industry and for strengthening the building control framework generally.<\/p><p>It was through the <i>Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, <\/i>known within the industry as BCAR, and accompanying code of practice that the roles and responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, assigned certifiers have been set out and clarified. BCAR requires the owner to assign competent persons to design, build, inspect and certify building works he\/she has commissioned. They in turn, must account for their contribution through the lodgement of compliance documentation, inspection plans and statutory certificates.  <i><\/i><\/p><p>If and when issues arise whether pre, during or post construction, it is clear who has held the designated roles and who is responsible for addressing the issues. This facilitates and simplifies the inspection, implementation and enforcement role of the Building Control Authority. <\/p><p>The building control function has been strengthened by the establishment of the National Building Control Office, which provides oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of building control in local authorities. The inspections policy has been reviewed and developed to support local authorities identify risk and make the most efficient and effective use of the resources available.<\/p><p>In addition, the Government has committed to placing the Construction Industry Register Ireland, or CIRI, on a statutory footing. The Government approved the draft heads of a Bill to place the CIRI on a statutory footing and the Bill was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Committee&rsquo;s report has since been received. The Department is currently working through the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations and engaging with the Attorney General's Office, with a view to achieving publication of the Bill in early 2020. The main objective of the legislation is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with Building Regulations within the builder community. <\/p><p>The building control reform agenda&rsquo;s focus has primarily been on ensuring strong and effective regulation in the building control system and the construction industry and on improving compliance in the Building Regulations.

Whilst the role of institutional investors has grown, particularly in the urban apartment market segment, it remains relatively minor in terms of the overall residential sector as a whole.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In overall terms, the key elements of the Government&rsquo;s approach to addressing the issues in our housing sector are set out in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, and Project Ireland 2040, which set out a comprehensive set of measures designed to restore the housing market to a sustainable equilibrium. <\/p>  <p>  A generally accepted convention is that housing is deemed affordable where households, particularly low or moderate income households, are paying not much more than one third of their disposable income in meeting their accommodation needs. In order to support households that have difficulty in accessing affordable housing, a multi-stranded, targeted approach is being pursued in the areas of the country most affected. The measures are targeted at low to middle income households. <\/p>  <p>  Some of the actions taken by\u00a0Government include the trebling, to &euro;310 million, the funding available for key facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites.\u00a0 This fund supports the provision of homes to purchase or rent, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF).\u00a0 This fund will facilitate the development of c. 6,200 homes that will be made available to purchasers or renters at rates which have significant discounts on market prices. To date, funding of &euro;127 million has been allocated in support of 35 projects in 13 local authority areas. This funding will support the\u00a0delivery of almost 3,200 homes for purchase.\u00a0 Under the provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the homes that will be made available for purchase will be targeted at first time buyers.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Government is also committed to rolling out a new Cost Rental model. Under Cost Rental, rents cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only.\u00a0 I recently launched a development in Enniskerry Road, Dublin which is one of two &lsquo;pathfinder&rsquo; pilot projects for Cost Rental (along with the St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate site in Inchicore). Enniskerry Road will see the first units delivered with homes due to be completed for tenants in 2021. Tenants will pay &euro;1,200 per month to live in the two bedroom apartments. With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, this will provide households on moderate incomes with access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of advancing the Cost Rental agenda, I have convened a working group within my Department,\u00a0in conjunction with the Land Development Agency, the Housing Agency, and other bodies. This group is developing the policy\u00a0framework\u00a0for the broader Cost Rental model, to provide for a sustainable financing structure and to allow us commence delivery of units at the scale. Their work is being assisted by a research project that is being undertaken by the\u00a0European Investment Bank on our behalf.<\/p>  <p>  The new Land Development Agency will also contribute significantly to the delivery of affordable housing and has access to a tranche of State lands, which it is estimated could provide up to 10,000 homes.\u00a0 This would include 40% of the delivery being for social and affordable homes to purchase or rent.<\/p>  <p>  These initiatives complement other Government actions which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. While the State is playing its part in facilitating the additional supply of affordable housing,\u00a0institutional investors also have a role to play in a more sustainable, long-term property system by providing much needed rental accommodation.\u00a0 However, as Rebuilding Ireland makes clear, professional landlord investment can only be one aspect of a multi-pronged response to addressing current issues in the housing market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700093#WRDD06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1817,"content":"<p>Question No. 692 answered with Question No. 685.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homelessness Strategy","counter":1818,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700093#WRDD06600"},{"type":"question","counter":1819,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[37737\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019091700093#WRDD06700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the degree to which he and his Department are in a position to monitor the number of families or persons becoming homeless or at risk thereof in all areas across the country; the specific measures he plans to deal with this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1820,"content":"<p>My Department publishes\u00a0a monthly report on homelessness.
