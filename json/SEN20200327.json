First, I extend my condolences and those of the Fianna F&aacute;il group to the ten families who lost loved ones yesterday, as well as to those who lost loved ones in the past week due to Covid-19 and to those in intensive care.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha.  I also commend the Leader of the House on suggesting we clap front-line workers.  Many of us stood outside our houses yesterday at 8 p.m. and witnessed the clapping for the front-line workers.  It was very emotional.  It felt like a very small gesture but I think it was appreciated.  Obviously, the best thing we can do is stay at home and not encourage the further transmission of this virus.<\/p> <p>Another thing we have all witnessed in the past while is the fact that many hospital workers on the front line are lacking personal protective equipment, PPE.  If we look at other countries, we can see doctors and nurses fully kitted out in hazmat suits and really high-end PPE whereas in Ireland, we see bibs and masks.  There is a significant order coming in but I urge the Minister for Health to do everything he can to get this PPE to those who need it on the front line quickly and expediently.  <\/p> <p>Dr. Gabrielle Colleran from the Irish Hospital Consultants Association said this morning that she wanted people to know that those with non-Covid-19 symptoms should still go to hospital, particularly those with heart attack or stroke-like symptoms, because they have a pathway for care for those people and want to look after them.  <\/p> <p>I have three points to make about the legislation passed last week.  I understand that the Covid-19 payment is for those aged between 18 and 66.  As there are people over 66 who, although they are in receipt of the contributory pension still rely on their income from their jobs, which they have lost, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection should look into this.  We would also like to find out whether the wage subsidy scheme applies to company owners and directors.  We were told that the Covid-19 payment scheme would apply in full to part-time workers but now we understand they will only get &euro;203.  Could we get some clarification on that?  <\/p> <p>Finally, nursing homes are crying out for help.  There are 25,000 highly vulnerable people in nursing homes.  We know they are the most vulnerable.  Once this virus gets into a nursing home, it is very serious.  Nursing homes are looking for support, PPE, staffing and funding so I ask the Government to look into this as well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#B00200","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am cognisant of the time today.  Like everyone in here today, I begin by paying tribute to all those committing time, energy and resources to combatting the Covid-19 pandemic.  Whether one is a front-line salaried worker or a volunteer, support teams composed of employees and volunteers and tens of thousands of people are giving of their time, energy and money to navigate their way through this crisis and all must be commended.  Furthermore, in an era of information overload exacerbated by the global pandemic, it is critically important to disseminate credible, trusted and validated information and the Government must be commended on the publication of the public information booklet on Covid-19.  Truth and transparency are central to collectively tackling this scourge.<\/p> <p>I fully support this Bill and its capacity and additional mechanisms in exceptional circumstances to underpin an overall multifaceted strategic plan to deal with coronavirus.  There is no silver bullet.  This legislation will assist in the interim to protect tenants, landlords, medical staff and healthcare workers; support the re-engagement of Defence Forces; support employees and employers; and ensure the State can function through these challenging circumstances.  I applaud those behind the testing strategy and I support any initiative that can expand or accelerate the testing regime.  Testing and tracing, in conjunction with isolation and social distancing, can defeat this threat.  Testing in the Republic has been more advanced and broader than in the North and this must be acknowledged with 15,000 tests a day carried out here compared to around 1,150 per day by next week in Northern Ireland but we can never test enough.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ian Marshall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2486\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2486&amp;amp;pid=IanMarshall&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In addition, it must be noted that for testing to be effective it must be faster, engaging earlier and driving results quicker to really impact on containing the spread of the virus.  We need to continually follow the advice of medical experts and be led by them because testing has limitations around resources and time and therefore, when the case definition has changed we must support expert opinion about utilising resources to best effect.  This is in all our interests.<\/p><p>We have good companies in Ireland working flat out to assist in this battle, for example, companies such as O'Neills, who are better known for the manufacture of sports gear and clothing, which is now redirecting resources to the manufacture of protective clothing for medical staff.  A number of companies are working hard to develop tests and test kits for coronavirus, something we should support and assist to fast-track the development and supply of test kits.  In fact, a reference was made to this yesterday by a Deputy in the D&aacute;il who suggested that contact should be made with Randox, a company in Northern Ireland that is already developing test kits.  The interesting point for me is that one does not need to go to Northern Ireland, Randox is already operating in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p><p>I received a phone call on Wednesday evening from Senator Billy Lawless who is in Chicago.  He is grounded in Chicago as a consequence of Covid-19 and is unable to return to Ireland for the Seanad sittings and asked me on his behalf to wish all the candidates the very best in the upcoming election, but that was not the purpose of his call.  He called to apologise for his inability to vote to support any candidates in the upcoming Seanad election because even though he was able to present himself to an official to mark his ballot paper as supervised, he was unable to vote.  This issue was made all the more frustrating by the fact that his wife, Anne, and his daughter Clodagh were both able to vote, unsupervised, on the NUI panel.  It was not for want to trying.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, sent a personal note stating that he was unable to propose any amendment to the law or make an exception for any individual.  Furthermore, Senator Lawless also asked me to thank Martin Groves for \"his Trojan efforts exploring all avenues to enable him to exercise his right\", something, unfortunately, he was unable to do.  This is a further example of an issue concerning the functioning of the Seanad that must be addressed in Seanad reform to ensure this House remains fit for purpose and can operate along robust protocols and principles in an appropriate manner in the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#B00300","speaker":"1439","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Each of the first two speakers has doubled their time.

Several issues have been raised with me &ndash; I am sure with other colleagues too &ndash; which I have raised directly with the Minister concerning the procedures, for example, of the Mental Health Commission during this crisis.  It is important to ensure there is not too onerous a regulatory or administrative burden put on those trying to operate those procedures now, particularly for inpatients.<\/p><p>I wish to raise one other issue concerning the operation of the Seanad which has been reported on by Marie O'Halloran in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today, namely, whether an incoming Seanad can validly sit before the nomination of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees.  Our clear advice in the Labour Party, and my own considered view having looked at the Constitution and Standing Orders, is a view shared by my Trinity College Dublin colleague, Dr. Oran Doyle, and by Tom Hickey in Dublin City University, both of whom wrote a piece in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>yesterday expressing the view that the Seanad can be lawfully constituted without the Taoiseach's nominees.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is based on our reading of Article 18 of the Constitution.  Article 18.8 gives the Taoiseach a power that cannot be confined or contradicted by Seanad Standing Orders.  That power allows the Taoiseach to advise the President on the first meeting of the Seanad after a general election, regardless of whether Seanad Standing Orders require the nominees to be appointed first.  If one looks at Seanad Standing Orders, one can see that Standing Order 190 gives a power to suspend Standing Orders for a sitting.  Therefore, I do not even think it is necessary for us to amend our own Standing Orders to enable a newly constituted Seanad of 49 Senators to sit and validly pass legislation after next week's election before the Taoiseach's 11 nominees have been appointed.  I am aware a different legal view is being expressed in Government circles, apparently on the basis of the Attorney General's advice but a reading of Article 18 of the Constitution clearly implies that the Seanad would be lawfully constituted.  I say this in aid of the Government and, indeed, of all our efforts to ensure we can continue to operate through this crisis and address all the challenges that may arise and to ensure any further emergency legislation that may have to be passed may be passed.  I commend all those who are working so hard to prevent the spread of this virus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#D00400","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>There are different views on that.

Farmers have been very isolated and are very much by themselves.  I participated in a farm discussion group conversation on Monday, using a call-in centre.  That is the kind of scenario we need to start talking about.<\/p> <p>Farmers are also experiencing financial stress.  The closing of the marts last Wednesday has had a major impact on the agriculture community.  Farmers realise there is no need for gathering at marts but there has to be flexibility so marts can do farm-to-farm sales, which are not allowed currently under the legislation.  The legislation is allowing the movement of animals only for export.  Farm-to-farm movement through the mart system needs to be looked at again so farmers will have the ability to survive.  One of the issues the Cathaoirleach was so strong about years ago was farm safety.  The new farm-safety issue on farms is mental health.  We need to start talking about it and promoting it.

I pay tribute to all those working in our health system.  I thank them for their work, commitment and dedication.  At the end of the Order of Business, I wish to acknowledge and thank them most sincerely.  At a time when our food supply chain is so critical, I also wish to thank those who work in retail, those in our shops who make sure that our shelves are full of food, those who produce and supply food, those who clean our streets and those involved in tasks we take for granted.  We extend our thanks to all of these people.<\/p><p>Senators raised the issue of the Covid-19 Bill.  I am happy to defer to the Cathaoirleach's pronouncement to the effect that Members should engage on this matter during discussion of the Bill.  I ask Senator Ardagh to reflect on what Mr. Liam Woods said on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning.  We are running low on protective equipment and clothing but we are not out of it and there is more to come.  Ministers will address that issue during the course of the debate.<\/p><p>I thank those in the education system for their innovation in educating our young people today.  As the Cathaoirleach has said, the Twenty-Fifth Seanad comes to an end today.  As Leader, I thank the Cathaoirleach for his courtesy, fairness, good humour and impartiality at all times.  I pay tribute to him and thank him for his work as Chair.  I also pay tribute to the Leas-Chathaoirleach, who is retiring, for his unfailing courtesy to all of us.  We wish him well at this time.  I am sure he is anxious to be here next week for the count.  We thank him as well.  <\/p><p>We offer our thanks and compliments to retiring Members on the work they have done not only in this Seanad but in previous Seanads.  I wish all who are contesting the election good luck and every success next week.  Only 49 of us can be elected.  I hope that as many as possible of those 49 will be Members of this outgoing Seanad.  I wish all candidates well.  <\/p><p>I thank all members of the staff.  The Cathaoirleach has listed them so I will not go through them all but I thank them most sincerely for their courtesy and commitment.  I particularly refer to the staff of the Seanad Office, the Bills Office and the Journal Office and to our recording people who are here today who have to endure us, often at unsocial hours.  I pay tribute to Orla Murray in my office for her efficiency, courtesy and professionalism at all times.  Senator Marshall made reference to Senator Lawless's predicament with regard to voting.  We need to address that issue in the future.  <\/p><p>Today is not a day for a long Order of Business.  It has been a privilege and a huge honour to serve as Leader of the Seanad for the past number of years.  I thank all group leaders and whips for their courtesy and professionalism.

It is extraordinary that the legislation this Seanad will pass in its final hours will be among the most important ever passed in this House.<\/p><p>The provisions before the House could never have been imagined as necessary even a few months ago.  Who could have predicted that we would be challenged to legislate in the face of a global pandemic that is sweeping the world and killing tens of thousands of people?  Yesterday, Ireland lost ten people.  It was, by far, the darkest day of this emergency so far for us.  Altogether, Covid-19 has taken 19 lives to date and 29 lives on this island.  Families and friends are in our thoughts and prayers but, in truth, we know we must brace ourselves for much worse to come.  This is not nearly over.  As was outlined by the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, last night, this invisible enemy is just beginning its spread through our country and people.  We know from the experience of other countries and the mathematical predictions available that a great deal is still to come.  We also know from the experience of others that we can act, and those actions can make a huge difference to the spread of this virus and save thousands of lives.<\/p><p>We are far from helpless in facing the virus.  We continue to prepare our hospitals and healthcare settings through the heroic work of healthcare professionals ranging from doctors and nurses to cleaning staff, management, scientists, carers and caterers.  The message that can be most effective and that should be reinforced every day is that everybody must play their part in this national effort.  We know what we must do.  Social distancing, washing hands and staying at home matter.  Following the clear instructions of authorities and the HSE matters.  That will save lives.  We can all play our part, and we must.<\/p><p>We have seen emergencies in recent years in Ireland.  I have been in this Chamber many times as we faced the legislative and policy challenges of Brexit.  Yesterday the Taoiseach spoke about how the emergency laws we passed for the prospect of a no-deal Brexit gave us some level of provision to take off the shelf in the early days of this emergency.  That is very true.  However, while Brexit was in many ways a fight for our citizens' identity and livelihoods, this is a fight for our citizens' lives.  Circumstances now are far from ideal for legislating.  We are being confronted with a once-in-a-century crisis in the aftermath of a D&aacute;il election with no clear winner and in the midst of new Seanad elections, in which many of the Senators present are involved.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The public are not interested in excuses, however, nor should they be.  They expect us to do our jobs and to do everything in our power to protect them.  To tackle Covid-19, Ireland needs, from our politicians, the legislation before us and may need more in the weeks ahead.  It also needs a Government that is strong and stable; one that is realistic, ambitious and diverse; one that can last with the authority, mandate and majority to make decisions quickly, to pass legislation through the Houses at short notice if necessary, and to provide the leadership needed in the times ahead; one that not only makes the right decisions now, in the face of a global pandemic, but is also planning for a recovery that can inspire hope and confidence that we will emerge stronger and more united as a country; and one that is able to look to the future with optimism, based on a clear path forward that a Government needs to design.<\/p><p>Everything the Government is doing is shaped by prioritising the most effective response possible to combating Covid-19 and the impact it is having throughout society.  In light of the challenges that lie ahead, part of the priority for me must now be finding a way to work with others to design a basis for a Government that can command a lasting majority in the Oireachtas.  It is possible to get this done, and I believe it is possible to get this done quickly.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are working together through our negotiating teams to shape a process that, I hope, will encourage others to join us in designing this diverse yet stable Government with a credible mandate, not only to lead us through this emergency but also to focus on reimagining and reshaping Ireland for the better as we emerge on the other side.  I invite others to play their part in these efforts.  Ireland needs you.<\/p><p>Ireland's Government, as well as its civil and public service, has worked night and day to be as ready as we can be for the weeks ahead.  I again thank all parties and Independents for the responsible role they have played in this House and in the D&aacute;il, and I know we will see the same again today.  We have before us a suite of laws that cross multiple parts of government and that will impact multiple sectors of our society.  I will now outline some of the provisions for Senators and later, I hope, respond to some of the issues they will want to raise.<\/p><p>We are protecting renters and that important feeling of security in our homes, which is so vital for all of us at this time.  The Bill will amend the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2019 to prevent both the termination of residential tenancies and rent increases for the duration of this crisis.  The termination prohibition relates to cases where a notice of termination has been issued, including where the notice period has expired, and to future cases where a notice of termination might be issued.  The rent increase prohibition will prevent any rent increases during this crisis, a period that may be extended.  If any landlord in Ireland thinks he or she can ignore the law we are passing, he or she is very much mistaken.  Part 3 contains measures that will give the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government powers for disregarding certain periods during the crisis to avoid breaching statutory deadlines relating to planning and building development.  This is modelled on similar provisions in the planning laws that cover the Christmas period and is designed to avoid deemed decisions, or financial penalties where decisions are not being made within the statutory limits, and judicial reviews, where individuals contend that the process was not in accordance with statute.<\/p><p>Part 4 contains amendments from the Department of Health.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Bill contains a number of amendments to the Mental Health Acts 2001 to 2018 designed to facilitate the important ongoing operation of the mental health tribunals for the duration of the exceptional circumstances caused by the pandemic.  It will broaden the list of consultant psychiatrists available to the tribunal and extend the period in which the tribunal must make decisions.  It will allow for reduced physical contact by allowing a second psychiatrist to examine a patient remotely and it will allow for one-member, paper-based tribunals, minimising personal interaction.<\/p><p>The Bill is allowing the fast-tracking of recruitment to bring back those who have answered the call to help the health service in the front line.  It facilitates the re-employment of retired health sector workers by empowering regulators to adopt a more streamlined and simplified restoration process to the register of their profession for individuals who wish to respond to this emergency.  This includes doctors, nurses, midwives, dentists, pharmacists and other health and social care professionals, such as social workers, physiotherapists, radiographers, dietitians, opticians and occupational therapists.  With staff shortages in the health sector, possibly exacerbated by health professionals becoming ill, as many have, it may be necessary to redeploy staff to positions where they are carrying out functions outside their normal role.  We are enormously grateful to all of those who are answering the call.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces and garda&iacute; will also play a vital role in the challenging period ahead.  Part 5 enables the re-enlistment of former enlisted members to fill certain critical technical positions in the Permanent Defence Force.  This provision to enable re-enlistment will support the Defence Forces in responding to the current crisis and more generally thereafter.<\/p><p>We are ensuring that the most vulnerable communities in Ireland are being reached and supported.  The Bill includes measures from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Part 6 of the Bill includes provisions to amend the Civil Registration Act 2004 and Part 7 amends the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.<\/p><p>Part 8 contains provisions for a temporary wage subsidy scheme and demonstrates how we are all working together during this crisis.  The scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners as that is the most efficient way to do it, will see the Government contribute to eligible firms' wage costs by paying them a wage subsidy to be passed on to the employee on a temporary basis.  In simple terms, this is about keeping employees and employers together through this period.  It is a little like trying to freeze-frame what we have created over the past nine years in terms of an economy that is growing and functioning, with almost full employment, and trying to protect what has been created for a three-month or four-month period, with three months the period to which the legislation applies.  This is so that when we come out the other side, many of these companies, which will have been put under huge strain in getting through this from a cash flow and business perspective, will be able, we hope, to start from where they left off, or at least close to it, and not have to start a whole recruitment process, building a skillset across their businesses all over again.  From an employee perspective, there is the importance of job security through all of this, when the alternative would be effectively to be on a jobseeker's allowance, not knowing whether they will or will not have an employment opportunity in the autumn.  This makes sense for everybody.  Yes, it is hugely expensive, but this is an investment to get us through an emergency and out the other side, and to keep an economy and people's income intact and stable through that period, or at least as stable as we can deliver.<\/p><p>The scheme is targeted at all sectors and employers will be expected to top up the wages of employees, if they can afford to do it.  The wage subsidy to be paid shall be determined by reference to the weekly wages paid by employers to specified employees.  The payments are liable to income tax.  However, the subsidy is not taxable in real-time through the PAYE system during the specified period for the Covid-19 pandemic, although it will be taxable by review at the end of the year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In conclusion, time is not on our side today unfortunately.  If we cannot get this legislation passed, people will not get paid today and in the next few days.  It is as simple and blunt as that.  Politicians and civil servants are often accused of getting tied up in red tape, but the speed at which this complex legislation has been drafted is extraordinary.  I thank everyone who has made that happen.<\/p><p>If we have made mistakes, we will correct them in the weeks ahead and we will expect the co-operation of others in doing that.  This may not be perfect, but as we have been advised by the World Health Organization, WHO, if we try to design something that is perfect we delay for far too long to be able to put comprehensive responses in place in a timely manner so as to respond to emergencies such as we are facing.  If there are problems, we will look at them and try to correct them in time, but we need to get this legislation passed today.  We are asking for everybody's co-operation in doing that. <\/p><p>I thank everyone.  I will have a chance in another couple of hours to speak for perhaps five minutes.  In case, however, I do not get the opportunity, I thank those in the House today for the last time for their service.  To all those facing the uncomfortable wait for the election results next week, I wish them well.  All else, however, needs to be secondary to what we are doing today.  Hundreds of thousands of people are relying on us to get this done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#H00800","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I remind Senators that group spokespersons have eight minutes and all others have five minutes.

I thank the T&aacute;naiste for coming in.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill and the regulations brought in earlier in the week, especially concerning childcare.  As the T&aacute;naiste pointed out, the legislation to be passed is far-reaching and there are many sweeping measures that, at other times, we would have contemplated and scrutinised for much longer.  I also thank the parliamentary drafters and the officials behind this legislation who spent hours, I presume, putting it together and putting in our amendments.<\/p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il group has many amendments.  We do not want to delay the Bill, but we hope they will be taken on board in the future.  We might push some, but we probably will not, given the legislation has to pass today and the reality of the situation.  We will be going through our amendments and putting them on the record of the House.  Regarding many of the provisions in this emergency legislation concerning the health system, we are seeing our health system work in a unified manner now.  We hope that in a post Covid-19 Ireland we can take from this experience and that many of the measures which are transitory will become more permanent in the future.  I refer not just the healthcare system working in unison, but also giving tenants more rights and security of tenure.  We also saw a State-funded childcare system in the last few days.  That is something we should look at on a more permanent basis in future so that people will live in a better society and have a better quality of life.  We have also seen income supports, more of a living wage and, as was mentioned, fast-tracked recruitment.  Many of these measures should have been taken before this crisis.  It has taken a crisis to put them together in this legislation.  When a Government is formed, and I hope that is soon, I hope we are going to be in a different Ireland.  I hope there will be a different landscape and that it will be for the better of everybody.<\/p><p>I thank our communities, our neighbours and especially the front-line staff for their resilience.

We hope the Minister will take on board some of our suggestions and some other amendments from other Members of the House.  We want to work in a collaborative fashion and do the best job possible for the people of Ireland here today.<\/p> <p>It is worth making the following point again and again until the message seeps through.  The worst is yet to come.  I am saying that without trying to take hope from people but we will face into much more difficult times and we need to hammer home the message that people need to stay home.  It is okay for people to go out for a short form of exercise during the day, within their family unit, but it is not okay for people to meet up with their friends to go for walks or runs together, which I have witnessed.  This is not okay.  One can go out to get food or medicine but they should stay at home otherwise.  This is to protect our front-line workers, who we have applauded and paid tribute to but the best tribute we can pay to them is to stay at home.  It is also the vulnerable and older people within our communities who need to be protected by our actions.  I want to remind people that these people often bore the brunt of the last economic collapse.  They are the ones who kept the show on the road in a lot of families.  They looked after grandchildren, they kept the heads of their own children above water and they kept families together in the face of massive crises.  These are the people we need to show solidarity with by staying at home.<\/p> <p>I look forward to debating the legislation but we are mindful in Fianna F&aacute;il that it needs to go through as quickly as possible and that a stable Government should be formed.

To read some of the stories from people in the medical profession of people coming into hospital alone and dying alone is heartbreaking.

It is amazing how these things can happen in a crisis but I am not here to cast stones.  I compliment the Government and the Minister for Finance on getting the main banks to agree to the terms they have agreed to for the duration of the crisis.  There are some questions still to be answered such as, for example, whether someone who is not making mortgage payments for three months and who must pay those payments at the end of the crisis should not have them added on to the end of the mortgage instead.<\/p> <p>I congratulate the Garda Commissioner for the speed at which he acted to get members of the Garda out of Templemore and onto the streets.  When we see what has gone on with people spitting in the faces of elderly people and shouting: \"Covid-19\" as they run away, we clearly need a high Garda presence.<\/p> <p>I want to deal specifically with the Defence Forces, which I am sure comes as no surprise to the Minister.  The chickens clearly have come home to roost.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

When it comes to military advice, the Chief of Staff alone should be the person offering such advice.<br\/><br\/>The members of the Defence Forces have once again shown that, regardless of the crisis and personal danger, they are ready, willing and able to stand up to the plate.  I thank the Chief of Staff and wish him and his charges luck as they go forward.  I congratulate the crew of the <i>L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett<\/i>in Dublin, the <i>L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats<\/i>in Galway and the <i>L&Eacute; Eithne<\/i>in Cork for their speedy reaction in getting into place.  I thank the Army for supporting the Naval Service in these three areas.  In particular, I am mindful of my former colleagues in An C&eacute;ad Cath at D&uacute;n U&iacute; Mhaoil&iacute;osa, Galway, who are spread throughout the country.<br\/><br\/>I have tabled several amendments on how decisions will be made with respect to this legislation.  I am mindful of the fact that the legislation has to get through today and I will not be pressing the amendments to a vote.  However, I am putting several points on the record.  I note references to how the Minister will make a certain decision or to the Minister's opinion.  Surely, the Minister's opinions or decisions should be based on advice from the Chief of Staff.  Most of my amendments relate to the advice required by the Chief of Staff.  We cannot have politicians making decisions about operational issues within the Defence Forces.<br\/><br\/>The military service allowance was discussed yesterday in the D&aacute;il.  Currently, we have recruits, apprentices and cadets operating in front-line services in the military.  I am calling on the Minister today to take them out of service and put them back into training, where they belong, unless we pay them the military service allowance.  Student nurses have been paid and there has been no difficulty.  Let us treat the Defence Forces with the same esteem accorded to the health services.<br\/><br\/>I have referred the pension abatement issue to the Minister and the Taoiseach.  We cannot expect veterans to come back and abate their pensions at the same time.  A pension is a property right - that has been established for Members of this House many times.  We cannot continue to penalise members of the Defence Forces who put themselves forward to serve the country at a time of crisis.<br\/><br\/>I heard the Minister yesterday refer to re-enlistment for a six-month period up to three years.  The period of re-enlistment can be for no longer than the crisis requires it.  Veterans who return to the uniform at the request or need of the State need to be able to leave immediately the crisis is over and go back to their jobs.  More important, they need their jobs protected.  Yesterday, my colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Berry, protected the employment of those in the Reserve Defence Force with the amendment passed in the D&aacute;il.  I call on the Minister to make a statement today to the effect that those who return to the Permanent Defence Force and who then wish to go back to civilian employment will have that employment protected by the State.<br\/><br\/>The Reserve Defence Force is available to the State 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  I would like to see the Reserve used in this crisis.  Many highly-skilled people are ready, willing and waiting to come back.  I am sure that decision is with the Chief of Staff and I am sure he will take it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#M00300","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I support the Minister in his work with the Bill.

Many employed and self-employed people in agriculture will be impacted.  The agricultural industry is often faced with crises and, though it is not directly impacted by infection to animals, it will feel the knock-on effects.  People in agriculture are overwhelmed by the volume of information they are taking on board at the moment.  There is a great deal to digest.<\/p> <p>It should be stated to avoid any doubt that food and food supply chains will not be impacted by Covid-19.  Farmers will continue to produce food to the highest standards to feed the nation through the crisis.

It has produced <i>Have You a Plan B?<\/i>, which is a step-by-step document to assist with planning in the event of contraction of the virus, if that should happen.<br\/><br\/>Beef markets are under pressure.  International buyers are nervous like never before.  Carcass balancing demands will present huge challenges, which are compounded by the closure of hotels, restaurants, catering outlets and the cancellation of functions, dinners, weddings and celebrations, as well as the depleted market for the prime cuts of beef.<br\/><br\/>Multinational fast food chains have closed their doors and even though we all hope this is a temporary disruption, we should be alarmed that this would create upset in the market, albeit hopefully very brief.<br\/><br\/>Livestock marts have closed.  This will present huge challenges for many because the mechanism to deliver cash in a timely manner has been lost, where the ability to sell livestock at whatever stage of growth can stave off the threat of mounting bills and debts incurred in the normal process of running the business.<br\/><br\/>The social fabric of farming in rural areas is often around livestock marts.  The absence of the marts presents another problem, with the ever-present issue of social isolation.  Some less social-media savvy individuals depend on the marts for social interaction with friends and neighbours.<br\/><br\/>There is also the issue, which I believe has not been truly recognised, whereby as currency fluctuates with the impact of Covid-19, on an island that currently imports some 80% of feedstock and raw material from international markets, we could face increases in the prices of feed and fertilizer, putting even more pressure on profits and margins in these very much unforeseen circumstances.<br\/><br\/>I put it to the Minister that the past few weeks have highlighted even more the necessity to work together North and South, east and west.  The last few days have demonstrated that even though we have differing approaches, we are all working to the same objectives.  Even though timing and technicalities have not always been the same, the objectives have always been to protect life and to manage the people and the economy through a common foe.  As the pendulum swings back and forwards with regard to who is performing best, North or South, this is only a distraction.  What matters is who will perform best to save lives and protect people.  There are no winners or losers.<br\/><br\/>This is a unique moment in history, an aspect of which we in Northern Ireland are overlooking.  It is the first time since the Great War more than 100 years ago that the people on the island of Ireland, North and South, have a shared ambition.  Whether nationalist or unionist, republican or loyalist, people have united to fight a common enemy.  The last time this happened was the First Word War, with nationalist and unionist soldiers fighting shoulder to shoulder.  Then the 1918 to 1920 flu pandemic killed 50 million to 100 million people globally.  It was not discerning on creed or colour.<br\/><br\/>These are truly unique times and when we emerge from this crisis, as we will, we must capitalise on our ability to work together for the common good, to park differences and to strive to build a better economy together for all.  This pandemic is undoubtedly uniting people North and South, east and west.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to ensure that this momentum is maintained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#N00200","speaker":"1439","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>As we deal today with another suite of emergency measures in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, I want to address some specific items.

There are many reasons for this but above all we could put our whole planning system in jeopardy if the public cannot fully participate in the planning process and decisions going forward could face judicial review.  This would bring further problems to the planning system.<\/p> <p>With regard to the current state of play in the planning system, the briefing note referred to the consideration, and the basis for the amendment of the legislation, that if public offices have to close at some point, the ability to view information and make submissions by the public will be constrained.  Can we take it that these public offices are open at the moment and that people can go in to view planning files as normal?  I would say that many people do not know that.  If it is the case, and if some change is envisaged, is it coming soon?  Perhaps this is a difficult question to answer, but I believe it is important.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Obviously, when we pause our whole planning process and our deadlines, we are pausing future development in the country because the basis of any development we see is a planning permission or some other consent given by the State and this applies across the board.<br\/><br\/>There is another point referred to in the briefing which I could not get clarification on.  It states that the powers being provided to the Minister under this Part would address these matters by pausing processes for a time so that the decisions are not made but other work can continue to be progressed where possible in the interests of managing the overall economic aftermath of the emergency.  I wonder what is this other work that can proceed under the planning and development code because I do not know of anything that can proceed absenting any consents or permissions that are required.  This is not in the legislation <i>per se<\/i>, but it is to provide clarification of the underlying considerations.  The Minister might be in a position to clarify that.<br\/><br\/>Another matter is the temporary wage subsidy scheme, the fundamentals of which are good.  It is to keep the employer-employee relationship even though a business may not be trading owing to Covid-19.  However, I am sure the Minister will be aware that employment law practitioners and insolvency practitioners - in particular, Mr. Richard Grogan whom the T&aacute;naiste may have heard on the &quot;Today with Sean O'Rourke show&quot; - say that they would not advise any employer, especially somebody trading as a company, to avail of this scheme.  They point out that there are difficulties with the scheme.  In order to avail of this, the paperwork would see an employer de facto making a declaration that he or she is insolvent and in the case of a company, of course, if one is insolvent and one continues to trade, this is a matter of fraud on the part of the company directors.<br\/><br\/>Other issues were pointed out as well.  On the notion of a 25% drop in turnover, it is not clear what is the relevant turnover period that the comparison should be made with.  There are numerous issues.  Another that stood out for me was that where an employer is in a position to pay a top-up over and above the &euro;410 - it is a <i>pro rata<\/i>proposal - the wage the employer would pay would not be deductible as an expense of the business in the normal way that wages would be.  Normally, when an employer is trading, he or she pays wages to an employee and that is deductible before profit.  They seem to have a plethora of issues.  The bottom line, without going into the detail, is that there is a body of experts in this field, such as employment lawyers and insolvency practitioners, stating they will not advise their clients to avail of this.  I accept that is not the intention of it but perhaps the T&aacute;naiste can give us some clarity and reassurance on those various concerns that have been raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#O00200","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  As I stated when we met last week, I am conscious that, as Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister is also playing a key role in the global response to this.  If at an appropriate point in the debate there is an opportunity to speak to that, I would appreciate it because this is a global pandemic and we must be in international solidarity now.  Particularly, I am concerned for those in developing countries who Ireland has supported.  At a time when universal healthcare has been a demand from the global south for many years, this is surely a moment.  I note the proposals, for example, in relation to debt forgiveness for countries in the global south that might allow them to build their services and health and social services at a time of extraordinary global threat.  Those are proposals Ireland should support.<\/p> <p>I note the Minister has spoken about the fact that this is a collective challenge.  We all agree that this is a collective challenge.  He has asked us to trust, and we have.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have seen collective trust being placed in the Government, Ministers and our public services.  However, part of that trust must be a mutual trust that the Government: trusts members of the Opposition and other parties, all of whom share the common goal of the public good and public health at this time; really engages and listens to the proposals put forward; and trusts that all those elected here who are bringing forward ideas are doing so in good faith and with good intentions, not for their personal or political success but for the good of the country - that we are each other's collective watchdogs and agents in trying to do this work.  That is really important.  Trust is one of the most powerful currencies we have at this time along with that common consideration that flows from it.  Regarding that trust, I would also urge the Government, which has been very good in giving clear information in the early stages of this process and taking some very robust and responsible actions, to ensure that this same clear and forthright communication continues and is increased.  I know that many of us have written to Ministers seeking answers on issues.  I know they are overwhelmed but it is important that we can get those answers to pass on to others to keep social trust in place.  <\/p><p>Regarding PPE, we saw a real concern where there was a question of people being able to identify the problem and the lack of essential protection for those who protect us and those in our hospitals.  We must make sure we never seek to silence or obscure those voices but listen to them and that this listening is very palpable and heard.  Now we see that there is a response and I am very glad to hear that the shipments for our hospitals and health services are coming in from Sunday.  In terms of the community and voluntary sector where many are engaging and working with extraordinarily vulnerable people, the priority must be those who are working in situations where Covid-19 is known to be present but we must take into account asymptomatic transfer between extremely vulnerable people if we do not have face masks for those doing vital social and community care.  It is something we need to address soon.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste could comment with regard to that issue.  <\/p><p>In terms of trust, there are certain areas that have shown that they cannot be simply trusted but must be regulated.  We have seen those sectors such as horse and greyhound racing and the betting industry, which had to be told to shut down.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste to take action in respect of shutting construction sites.  In respect of the planning elements in the Bill such as where we need planning exemptions and exemptions in terms of building work that will be necessary as part of our collective national response to this crisis in terms of building health facilities and adapting premises, I ask him to address how we can ensure those will proceed in this planning hiatus and how we produce a climate where we permit what is necessary rather than assuming that all good practice is happening on building sites because everybody, including SIPTU, is telling us that it is not.  <\/p><p>I am concerned with regard to employers and will table amendments relating to the language of \"good intention\".  I would much prefer if we were clear, and I think it has been called for from the other side, around clarity on inability to pay, for example.  What is the rationale for keeping or not keeping staff on?  We need clarity of language.  I am concerned that some of the language is a bit ambiguous in that regard and I urge the T&aacute;naiste to clarify and tighten that up.  It will be important.  <\/p><p>Many Senators have spoken about Dr. Michael Ryan.  We are all extraordinarily proud of the work that he has done in the WHO.  We have heard many people quoting the fact that he said that speed sometimes trumps perfection.  However, the other thing he has told us is that, and he said it in the past two days, human rights, privacy rights and human dignity are also important considerations.  He said these must also be factored in and that we cannot put them aside in pursuit of public health because part of public health depends on respect for that rights-based approach to health.  That was something echoed by a number of UN rapporteurs in a letter they published yesterday where they spoke about ensuring that the public health response supports all of the public, including the most vulnerable - those with disabilities, the homeless, migrants and refugees.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is part of our public health response.  It is not something we add in later.  It is how we do it.  In that regard, there have been requests to move the vulnerable out of direct provision centres.  We cannot simply allow for persons to be moved out to intensive care units or to hospitals because we did not take the opportunity to put protection in place and to ensure safety.  We also need to look at moving the vulnerable, in terms of those who are homeless in Ireland.  We need to ensure they have a safe place to be during this crisis.  We will all work together.<\/p><p>I appreciate the very good points made by Senator Bacik on how we may constitute the next Seanad.  If 11 Senators are necessary, let them be 11 who can serve this national interest and not simply the interests of parties.  They could possibly be selected from parties but with that national collective interest in mind.  If not, then could we ensure that in the next stage of legislation in the months ahead, we build in three Stages so that we have the power and opportunity to amend or improve legislation in this House for that collective good?  Many of us will make points today but I do not believe we will be pressing amendments.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste will be able to answer us and that he can recognise that collective project we are in and that we are all mandated parts of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#P00200","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste is very welcome.

Sinn F&eacute;in is determined to play a constructive role.  We will demonstrate that today in the amendments we have tabled.  We will not push any amendment to a full vote, although we may put a couple of them to a voice vote.  We will withdraw some amendments too because we do not want to, unnecessarily, prolong this debate.  We want to deal with the business that needs to be dealt with, see the Bill through and get the support people badly need.<\/p><p>I begin by expressing my sympathy to the families who have already lost loved ones to Covid-19.  It was very shocking to hear the figure of ten and yet, as has already been acknowledged, we know there are worse figures, unfortunately, to come.  I pay tribute to all of our healthcare workers who are responding so magnificently to this crisis.  They are truly in the front line, putting their own health at risk in order to care for and save the lives of our loved ones.  The statistic that one in four persons who have contracted Covid-19 is a healthcare worker tells us all we need to know about the bravery of those people, especially those coming back into the service, like my colleague, Senator Devine, whom I know has volunteered already.  They deserve not only our respect and admiration but real delivery in terms of the issues on which they need support.  I refer in particular to the provision of personal protective equipment, PPE.  I listened to &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; this morning and I am glad to hear the shipment is coming in on Sunday.  I am also glad to hear that we have not quite run out of PPE but Senator Higgins's point about making sure we listen to workers on the front line is particularly pertinent in that regard.  Of course, it is not just healthcare workers, it is retail workers, power workers, transport workers, truck drivers, workers in factories such as Medtronic, which makes ventilators, where I used to serve as a union official, pharmacy workers, and the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>I was very struck by the quote from Jeremy Corbyn and I want to read it into the record of the House.  On his last appearance as leader of the Labour Party in Britain he said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe can all now see that jobs that are never celebrate[d] are essential to keep society going.  Think of the refuse workers, the supermarket shelf-stackers, the delivery drivers, the cleaners.  [He said, those grades of worker] are often dismissed as low-skilled.  But I ask, who are we least able to do without in a crisis &ndash; the refuse collector or the billionaire hedge fund manager? <\/blockquote> <p>He asked who is doing more for our society at this very moment.  I think it was a very powerful quote from Jeremy.<\/p><p>I want to address the issue of safety.  I welcome the statement from SIPTU yesterday.  It is very significant because SIPTU is by far the largest union when it comes to construction workers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->SIPTU put out a clear statement calling for the immediate closure of workplaces and building sites where workers are at risk of Covid-19.  The key point is that trade unions cannot close these sites.  Employers cannot close these sites as they are contractually bound to deliver.  We need the Government to shut down those sites.  Having given the T&aacute;naiste credit for so many good things this Government has done in recent weeks, I ask him not to dodge this because it is difficult.  Workers are at risk.  They are obliged to go to work until those sites are closed.  The only organisation which can close these sites is the Government.  There are 30,000 workers involved.  We all know that they are not safe.  We need the Government to act in exactly the same way it has on other issues.  We cannot delay on this particular issue.<\/p><p>The proposed changes to the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act, specifically the decisions to adopt Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s proposals to halt evictions and freeze rents are welcome.  I was disappointed, however, to hear those changes characterised by the Taoiseach yesterday as representing bad policy in the normal course of events and only being acceptable because of the current emergency.  Clearly our Taoiseach still remains unaware of the emergency in housing that has been ongoing for the past five years and more.  The Government should go further and ensure renters who do not have a tenancy agreement are also protected.<\/p><p>A provision was added by my colleagues in People Before Profit yesterday to protect people on licence.  We are not clear as to whether it does or not.  It would be helpful to know whether that amendment added to the Bill gives legal effect to protect people on licence in terms of their accommodation.<\/p><p>There is an issue with provisions to ensure people do not rack up a crushing level of debt in rent arrears.  We know this is a problem that will be happening.  We are asking the Government to consult with landlords, tenants and mortgage organisations to come up with a report on how this issue can be dealt with.  That is a reasonable request.  We will not push it to a vote today but under our amendments are looking for a commitment in this regard.  I ask other Senators who believe this is sensible proposal to give it verbal support today.<\/p><p>The proposals on a temporary wage subsidy are welcome.  Significant credit should be given to the trade union movement for its work on coming up with this model, alongside ourselves.  I share some of the concerns that Senator Mulherin referred to concerning Richard Grogan&rsquo;s article.  I do not know whether the T&aacute;naiste saw this article on the scheme.  My concern is simple.  The scheme has to work.  Employers have to buy into it.  Workers need to be engaged through it.  Then we can see a better status for our economy, as well as for working people and families.  Richard Grogan expressed particular concern in terms of fraudulent trading.  I would like to see those concerns addressed when the T&aacute;naiste responds.<\/p><p>The wage subsidy proposals do not go far enough, as noted by Deputy Pearse Doherty yesterday.  There is a danger that they could be open to abuse by unscrupulous employers.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes a model that will guarantee 100% of income up to &euro;525 a week for workers and the self-employed who are laid off due to this crisis.  My union, SIPTU, brought out a similar proposal.  Employers should have to make up the rest of the 30% of workers&rsquo; salaries in our view.  Under the Government's proposals, employers can just pay 1% towards employees&rsquo; pay and still avail of this scheme.<\/p><p>People naturally talk about the concerns regarding the cost involved in these proposals.  Can I remind Members that only ten years ago, we spent &euro;64 billion bailing out the banks?  By my reckoning, at &euro;300 million a week, that gives us a good four years to bail out people.

I thank them.  I take at face value what the T&aacute;naiste said about the legislation we are facing today, that is, that if there are problems they will be fixed in the coming weeks.  It is the Labour Party's intention to support the legislation today to ensure it passes speedily without amendment.  That is the only way we can get the legislation on the Statute Book quickly to support people in dire circumstances.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste is quite right that we have not seen the peak.  Unfortunately, we have already seen many people with serious illnesses pass away.  I offer my sympathy to the families who have lost loved ones in very tragic circumstances.<\/p><p>At the end of the Order of Business, we applauded the front-line workers, whom I call the real risk-takers, namely, the staff working in the hospitals, stacking the supermarket shelves, manning the tills and driving the lorries to make sure there is a food supply for the vast majority of us.  Those are the true risk-takers.  While we have not reached the peak and circumstances will become more difficult, we have to have hope and look to and plan for the future.  The T&aacute;naiste referred in his speech to planning for the recovery after the crisis.  After the crisis is over, we will really need to do more than stand outside the hall door and applaud the risk-takers, the people who have put their lives on the line, the very people who have suffered the worst over recent years, including nurses, supermarket workers, supermarket suppliers, those who work from day to day and the bin men and bin women who collect domestic refuge.  They have not been able to afford to buy their own homes or the super rents we have seen in recent months.  We have to plan to reward the real risk-takers to ensure that, when this is over, they will have the right to a home of their own, a place where they can rear their families.  We must reward them.<\/p><p>In many ways, when we talk about risk-takers, we talk about businesspeople and tax incentives to bring businesses to Ireland but we now know who the real risk-takers are.  It is the nurses, who are probably looking after somebody we love, who cannot afford to buy homes of their own.  When we get through this, I would like us to apply ourselves in the same manner to ensure that everybody, including every citizen, will have a right and entitlement to a home of their own.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the work the Government has been doing.  I acknowledge the T&aacute;naiste's statement that if there are mistakes, they will be fixed.  It is a matter of speed over perfection.  I acknowledge everything has that has been done to produce legislation that is as perfect as it can be but since we need it passed speedily, there will be risks.  I wish the Government and the country every success because we need to get this right to reduce the number of loved ones who will be lost in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>I am not standing for re-election to the Seanad.  I extend to my colleagues who will be re-elected my very good wishes.  I am aware of their hard work and of their diligence in considering legislation.  In this manner, in this time, speed trumps perfection.  We must move quickly to put in the supports our society badly needs.  I will not delay the legislation and will be supporting it as it passes through the House.  I hope the peak will not be as bad as we fear and that we can start planning for a good future for all our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#S00200","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House.

They are difficult times for families and for people who are waiting for results or waiting to be tested.  There is an eerie feeling.  As Senator Gavan said, when he drove through Dublin, there was very little traffic and very little movement other than people walking around town.  One thing that this has done is made everybody the same.  We are all in the one boat.  We are all walking around with our hands in our pockets.  It does not matter whether one is high and mighty or an ordinary person.  Everybody is the same.  They will get the same treatment.  That applies the world over.  This has brought the world to its knees.  I believe that there will be a solution and that we will find a way out of this.<\/p><p>The Government is to be complimented on the way and the swiftness with which it is dealing with the issue.  I believe that the present Government is the best to deal with this for the number of weeks that it will take to get on top of things.  If there was a change of Government right now, there would be new Ministers, with different people in different portfolios.  I think the people who are there at present are the best to deal with it at this time.  They know what is happening in their Departments and they know the people who have the responsibilities, rather than having new people trying to get their feet under the table.  While it is very important that a strong and stable Government would be put in place, and all of the negotiations should rightly take place, the present Government should be left in place until we get out of this crisis.<\/p><p>I am delighted that there is a sunset clause in this legislation and in the legislation that was passed last week.  It is very important.  It is also important that the T&aacute;naiste said that if wrongs are done, they will be righted.  I believe that when this is over, we should look at the legislation again to see where things went wrong and to see what can be made better.  We passed emergency legislation during the crash.  It had to be emergency legislation.  We never looked at things that went wrong or that may have been done better in any great depth afterwards.  We should have.  I will give an example.  In 2003 and 2004, legislation was introduced such that a redundancy payment of two weeks per year would be paid to employees, and rightly so.  The people who came out worst from the crash were small sole traders.  They had to pay for two weeks per year to all their employees, whether they went bust, downsized or whatever happened.  Where some of those were not able to pay some or all of the redundancy to their employees, in some cases, they pleaded inability to pay, but Revenue is coming after them now.  The only way out for them is that there will be a charge on their private house when they die.  This does not happen to big companies.  They have the option of going into liquidation and they can fold up.  It is different in the case of the ordinary individual or sole trader.  A number have contacted me.  They have been left with substantial bills.  In some cases, the State paid for the redundancy for the employees that they had employed.  When they die, their houses will be sold and the funding that was paid to the employees on behalf of the employer will be taken out of the estate of that person.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is unfair.  There was an anomaly in the legislation when it was brought in.  There was a clause under which 70% could be clawed back for the two weeks.  Michael Noonan, as Minister for Finance, got rid of this 70% claw-back in 2013 or 2014.  It has left some of the people I have mentioned in a very precarious position.  <\/p><p>I am delighted that the Minister has said that he will correct any mistakes that have been made.  I am sure that means we will look at the legislation we are passing today and at that which we passed last week.  Things will never be the same again.  Work practices are going to change.  More and more people will be working from home and from hubs.  The way in which work is done will be changed forever.  We will have to adapt and adopt new measures.  I presume new legislation will have to be drafted in respect of all of these different things that will take place. <\/p><p>I wish the T&aacute;naiste well in his endeavours over the coming weeks.  I also wish everybody in this House and the front-line staff, whom numerous speakers have mentioned, well.  These staff are a credit to the country.

I extend my deep sympathies to Senator Ruane on the passing of her nan.  I know they were very close.  In my time here, Senator Ruane has been an absolutely fabulous Senator and it was a pleasure to work with her during these four years.<\/p> <p>I will focus on the issues facing SMEs, if I may.  What has been said already is very true.  I will not go back and repeat all of it.  Senator Mulherin made a point which relates to section 28(3) or 28(4) and to company law and companies or small businesses acting fraudulently.  In order to get this funding one must sign a declaration stating that one's business's turnover has fallen by 25% and that it cannot keep going.  From a legal and company law perspective, that is a significant challenge.  Senator Mulherin is well placed to comment on that area because she is a lawyer and understands that space.  There are a couple of other areas of interest as well.  There are a couple of issues with the model.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2482\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2482&amp;amp;pid=PadraigOCeidigh&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One big issue is what is happening with many companies whose costs of operating are increasing significantly.  It should not be measured on sales but on sales minus cost to achieve this.  One might have many sales or the same number as last year, but that does not mean one is making a profit or that one's cash flow is positive.<\/p><p>I spoke to the T&aacute;naiste a couple of weeks ago and I greatly appreciate the interaction he and the Taoiseach shared with me regarding small and medium-sized businesses.  There are 250,000 of them in the country, employing almost 1.2 million people.  I asked at the time, and am asking again now, if we could set up an urgent SME task force with SME people who are on the front line in the task force to offer the knowledge of what it is like to do this.  SMEs want to employ people and to keep their businesses going.  As the T&aacute;naiste said when I spoke to him earlier, there are two parts to this.  We have to keep our head above water now, which is primarily about liquidity.  However, what happens when this finishes and we are back to some sense of normality?  Those companies and businesses must get up and running again rather than continue in survival mode.  Another slightly different strategy is required in that regard.<\/p><p>Two policies are being adopted by the ECB, Europe and other countries throughout the world, including Ireland.  One is a monetary policy that is focused on the Central Bank and what it is doing, which is decreasing interest rates.  That is fine, but interest rates are low anyway.  It is increasing money supply by buying Government and corporate bonds.  The ECB has relaxed the rules under which national central banks must operate to create greater monetary flexibility.  Then there are the fiscal policies that governments are introducing.  I must conclude, but I ask the T&aacute;naiste to ask his colleagues to set up the SME task force as soon as possible.  I was on a webinar this morning with approximately 100 SMEs.  They employ over 300,000 people.  Some of the issues they raised were extremely interesting and important.  They are wearing the jersey as much as everybody else.  They are as passionate about their employees and our country as are employees and everybody on the front line.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a bheith ag &eacute;isteacht liom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#V00600","speaker":"1431","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; leis an Aire agus leis an Rialtas agus iad i mbun a ndualgais sna seachtaine agus m&iacute;onna at&aacute; romhainn.  This is a time when every dimension of our civic, civil and economic life is being subjected to a sustained, unprecedented and profound series of shocks.  Our language and discourse, both public and private, is now dominated by idioms of virology and disease containment measures and our naturally fluent manner of interaction with each other is now shaped by a cautious and necessary distance.  We have been returned once again, reluctantly and through no fault of ours, to the economic language of emergency fiscal measures and possible recession.<\/p> <p>It is fair to say, however, that we are experiencing a surge of the right type, not the one we hope and pray will not overtake our health system.  Communities have dug deep and displayed their resilience.  There has been a surge in compassion, bipartisanship and humanitarian outreach.  In the starkness of our predicament the ethos best expressed in the gospel of John, that greater love nobody has than he who lays down his life for his neighbour, is also on view.  Of course, there is sadness.  There is also the best and worst in human nature.  It was troubling to see the case in Spain, although I do not know the detail of it, where elderly people were abandoned in nursing homes and some of them were found deceased.  Even here some members of our community have still to wake up to the need to be selfless in their behaviour in terms of coming together and so forth.  We must bring out the best in each other.  There are great exemplars.  There is the story of the old priest in Italy who gave up his ventilator so a young person could have it.  There are also our healthcare staff who are doing wonderful things.  They risk laying down their lives when they knowingly go into a more risky situation on our behalf.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It makes all of us wonder what we as individuals can do.  We are all in different circumstances and will all have different ways in which we can play our part in being patriotic and good, responsible and caring members of  community.  We need to see the best side of our nature now.<\/p><p>I compliment the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health, the Chief Medical Officer and all the experts for giving the country the leadership it needs at this time.  We have disagreed on matters, some of them serious, but it is good that they are effectively bringing people together.  With only one or two exceptions in all the discussions and debates I have heard, the language and the examples given have always sought to unite people by emphasising what we all in society believe in and are on board with.  I urge them to continue giving the leadership they are giving and not to be afraid to speak out strongly to any group or section of the community about the need to avoid modes of behaviour that may be unthinkingly selfish or not sufficiently heedful of the impact they might have on others.<\/p><p>We are all most certainly our brothers' and sisters' keepers now.  The institutions of the State have demonstrated their capacity to respond with speed when the common good is threatened and when the architecture of our national and international financial system was moving towards collapse.  That gives us all hope that a pathway through this suffering and discomfort is possible.  We as a Legislature can scrutinise legislation only in a limited way compared with what we would normally be called on to do.  We depend on the Government and Civil Service to get it right as much as possible, as often as possible, in these fast-changing circumstances.  The T&aacute;naiste will understand, therefore, that there will be issues we will wonder about, and we will wonder whether certain aspects are being covered, although we know that some aspects will not be.<\/p><p>In recent days, I spoke to an elderly person who receives a limited State pension and is dependent on the small income they receive from a small rental property in a rural town.  That income will be gone, of course, because the tenant can no longer pay the rent and they are not in a position to get any kind of relief from their bank.  I was not able to give an answer to that person and it would be difficult for the Government to give answers on such cases in the short term.  One thinks in particular of people in the disability sector, who have asked whether disability service workers might be prioritised for testing alongside hospital workers, a forceful argument.  They hope that the costs arising for section 39 employers with regard to Covid-19 will be met equally to those of the HSE and section 38 agencies.  They are all legitimate claims from people coming from different areas of social contribution.<\/p><p>To touch briefly on a fraught issue, I heard the Minister for Health's response on the workings of the abortion legislation in respect of remote consultations.  All I would say in that regard is that we should think carefully about the matter.  There were debates on the issue in the UK House of Commons and House of Lords in which it was confirmed that a physical meeting would continue to be necessary as a safeguard for the woman and to protect her health and well-being.  I acknowledge that given that the situation is moving fast, there will be issues on which we might agree or disagree, but in whatever measures are taken, I ask that the Government think carefully about unforeseen consequences of a kind that none of us would want.<\/p><p>It is our job as legislators to urge the Government to consider all such matters.  We accept that not everything will be got right and that mistakes will be made that will have to be undone as soon as possible.  For now, however, I thank the Government for what it is doing.  It will have our support in getting the legislation through today.

We have been planning for quite some time to ensure that we would have sufficient stocks.  We have effectively done a deal with Aer Lingus, which is going to fly charter flights in and out of Beijing - dozens and dozens of them - to bring back PPE that is being purchased with a contract that involves Ireland spending well over &euro;200 million.  My understanding is that this is buying what would normally be considered about 13 years worth of PPE for our health system all at the one time, potentially to be used in the next three to five months.  The start of those shipments will come through in the next few days - it is expected on Sunday - and, of course, other PPE is being made available from other sectors of industry and other sources in different parts of the world.  However, the bulk of what will come into the system in Ireland is expected to come from China, in particular the initial stocks in the coming days.<\/p><p>I congratulate and thank Paul Reid and his team for the extraordinary work they are doing, not just in Ireland but also in other parts of the world, to make sure that our healthcare staff get what they need in terms of clothing, equipment and protection.  I want to thank all of our hospitals, healthcare institutions, nursing homes and so on, which are managing with the stock they have right now, which will be bolstered very shortly, I am glad to say.<\/p><p>I also want to thank the many Members of the House who indicated they are not going to push their amendments.  We will read all of the amendments carefully and if there are real issues behind those amendments that we need to respond to, the Government has a responsibility to do that.  I want to give Members that very strong signal today.  However, we need to get this done today.  That is why I want to thank all of the parties here for indicating they are not likely to push amendments or, if they do push them, it may just be to a voice vote.  There is enough experience in this Chamber to understand the consequences of amendments being accepted here, and the need to go back to the D&aacute;il to get this legislation concluded, which would delay very significant volumes of payments for people who need them shortly.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of the Defence Forces.  As a former Minister for Defence, I understand a number of the points he raised quite well.  In the medium term, we need to commit to setting up a separate commission for defence in regard to pay and conditions, and so on.  They are a different category to every other worker in the country.  They are our last line of defence and they are a resource that needs to be always there.  That needs to be taken into account in the context of ensuring we have the capacity to recruit the numbers we need and, obviously, the consequences for pay and conditions that flow from that.<\/p><p>I want to deal with the issue of those who are coming back to re-enlist in order to assist in a national effort, particularly when many of them may be in other employment that is inactive right now.  We need to ensure that people who leave the Defence Forces in a few months time, having come in to assist during this emergency, will, of course, have jobs to go back to.  I will raise that issue directly with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who will be here during Committee Stage to answer Members' questions.<\/p><p>With regard to the points raised by Senator Marshall, as always, he is a rock of sense in regard to the need for North-South co-operation.  In an emergency, we all have the same objective.  Regardless of political background, ideology or identity, we are neighbours and friends on this island, who should be working together to save as many lives as we can, and we will.  I got a letter last night from Colum Eastwood, asking questions around whether an employer south of the Border, which was employing employees who are travelling from North to South, could get the subsidy.  That is something the Senator can clarify with the Minister for Finance in a few minutes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->My understanding on that is clear.  The Revenue is not making wage subsidy support payments based on the address or nationality of a person.  This is about supporting and ensuring the connection between employees and employers remains intact.  That should also apply to companies close to the Border.  <\/p><p>Regarding employment law practitioners raising issues that may well be relevant to this legislation, this is a time for people to have a can-do attitude and to try to ensure this legislation works, and not to try to undermine it.  We will make it work.  The Revenue Commissioners last night issued new guidance.  I got correspondence this morning from several business people which stated the guidance has been greatly helpful in clarifying some of the questions they may have had yesterday and that are being answered today.  We are asking all employment law practitioners and experts advising companies to ensure that this works for their clients so that they are not excluded from the benefits that will flow from it.  We can do that if we work together and if we ensure companies seek their advice from the Revenue Commissioners, and not from politicians.  If important questions that need answers come from advisers and employment law practitioners, let us look to the Revenue Commissioners to provide clarity, flexibility and assurance on those questions so that this emergency legislation works for as many people as it possibly can to protect jobs and incomes.  That is what we are about here.  <\/p><p>Regarding the contribution from Senator Higgins, she is correct.

Senator Higgins is right, of course.  Whatever challenges we face here in protecting our citizens, reinforcing the health infrastructure and the staff behind it, we have to ask the question as to how on earth some countries, with extremely limited resources and effectively no health infrastructure, are going to have the capacity to respond to the pressures they will face in the weeks and months ahead.  That will certainly be to the fore as we prioritise and decide how we will spend the hundreds of millions of euro that we spend in development aid, assistance and the partnerships we build in doing that.<\/p> <p>I take the points made regarding direct provision centres and homeless people.  I give the assurance that we are working on that.  Several Senators raised concerns regarding construction sites.  In respect of everything we do, it is important to say that the decisions we are making on guidelines for employers and employees all originate from our public health emergency team, led by the Chief Medical Officer.  The advice they give is that if a workplace can comply with the social distancing guidelines, if employers can ensure they are protecting their employees and their workforce, and if they are not in the categories we have named to close temporarily, then the responsibility is there for an employer, interacting with employees, to ensure a safe workplace is provided.  If that cannot be provided, then those workplaces should close.  We want to link the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, and others that are going to be working with employers, to ensure the guidance is being respected on site so we can maintain employment where it makes sense safely.  Nobody, however, is contending or making the point that we should be requiring people to work in an unsafe environment through this emergency.  There is no economic justification for that and this Government will never attempt to justify a workplace staying open on that basis.  I want to make that very clear.  <\/p> <p>I also want to make sure that I answer everybody's questions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I take the point that some wanted to go further with wage subsidies and some wanted to require employers to make sure workers get 100% of their salaries.  This is an emergency and there are some employers that will not be able to pay.  There are others that will be able to pay.  We need to do everything we can to make sure that those companies that can pay do pay but we also need to ensure that those companies that cannot pay are not essentially pushed into insolvency unnecessarily.  This is about protecting a work environment and as many SMEs as we can through this crisis so that they can grow, expand, employ people and pay good salaries when this is all over.<\/p><p>On the SME task force, I will speak to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys about that again.  I reassure Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh that the Minister and her Department have a stakeholders group where they listen to employers, trade unions and many other stakeholders that are linked to employment and SMEs.  That being said, maybe there is a case to go beyond that and to allow people who understand and have lived through what it takes to build an SME successfully and survive through good times and bad to give a more direct and detailed input.  I will come back to the Senator on that.  For those working in SMEs who are listening today, there is updated guidance on the Revenue Commissioners' website and I encourage people to look at that.<\/p><p>On Senator Mullen's contribution, this is about bringing people together and that is what we are trying to do.

The operation of the rainy day fund has the kind of steps and checks built in that Senator Clifford-Lee is proposing.  What makes the times we are in so different is that it is entirely possible that a decision might be needed to change the guidance we are giving to various Departments and local authorities.  We may need to make it quickly at a point when it is simply not possible to trigger sittings of the Houses of the Oireachtas, let alone gain their consent.<\/p> <p>If this were not an emergency, it is likely that what Senator Clifford-Lee is looking for would already be contained in the legislation.  Given the exceptional circumstance that we find ourselves in, however, it will be a decision made by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government in consultation with the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is emergency legislation and it is due to lapse.  I do not believe it would become the norm for these kinds of powers to be triggered in a way that did not require the consent of the Seanad and D&aacute;il.

I emphasise again to Senator Clifford-Lee that I believe it is incredibly unlikely that this would set any kind of a precedent for use in legislation at a normal time.  Even during our economic crisis all emergency legislation in that period required either consultation with the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, or required engagement with both Houses.  An example is the FEMPI legislation, whereby there was a requirement each year to lay a formal report with regard to where we stood, and if any change needed to be made with that legislation it had to be done through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If legislation crafted during an economic emergency required the role of the Oireachtas, the only reason it is different here is because this is a public health emergency in which a decision could be taken that requires action within hours.

I note that certain other provisions in the Bill have wider descriptions in how they might be extended, whereas the description around the extension for the stay on evictions, for example, is a lot narrower.  For the other areas there is quite a number of iterations and explanations of the public health emergency and the form it might take, which would allow for extension as necessary.  I concur, of course, with Senator Clifford-Lee that, whenever possible, we want this to be in public consultation with the Legislature, which is important.<br \/><br \/>On the core issue of the emergency period and the measures for safety that are taken under that time, I am concerned that the framing in the Bill is quite narrow.  The framing is specifically on the threat to public health as related to Covid-19, it is contiguous to the Covid-19 disease and not to the after effects or consequences, and on the need to restrict movements of persons.  Those are the narrow bases.  The Minister has heard articulated very well on the Order of Business in the Seanad and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that we were already facing a crisis in housing.  There are many public health emergency consequences that will flow from this crisis that may affect a person's ability to pay, a person's ability to respond to an eviction order, and whether or not persons can find suitable or other alternative housing within a period of time.  I am concerned about the framing of this.  Consider the rationale in a stay of eviction, similar to the rationale in the stay of a rent freeze, both of which were pushed for as measures for the common good in the past.  If, however, we have an extraordinarily narrow definition of those, and which is too narrow in this case, I am concerned that the common good that may be served after a period of time when contiguation is not explicitly a risk but where persons may have lost income, lost livelihoods, have other underlying conditions, have other health concerns, and do not have anywhere to go to.  I am worried that the Minister might not be giving enough flexibility to allow, for example, an extension of a stay on evictions to cover those related public health and common good concerns. <\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When we come out of this, there will be other very serious consequences.

I have tried, in the case of amendment No. 6, to echo the language that we have elsewhere in the Bill.  If we are providing for all of these kinds of criteria elsewhere in the Bill, why make it so narrow when it is the bit that protects vulnerable citizens and protects people from evictions?  Why is that a harder bar than those applying to some of the other protections?<\/p><p>Amendment No. 8 is to insert these other issues which are recognised as concerns elsewhere in the Bill, specifically, the policies and objectives of the Government to protect the health and welfare of members of the public, and the role of adequate housing in protecting public safety.  Both of those are good reasons when the Minister may need to extend a protection against eviction or extend a rent freeze.  That is my concern.  That is the basis for these amendments.  I hope the Minister can address it.<\/p><p>Lastly, I refer to the role of adequate housing in promoting public safety.  I have mentioned that direct provision is not adequate housing in this time in terms of public safety and well-being, not only of the individuals in direct provision, whether or not those with symptoms are isolated.

I welcome the Bill and the provisions relating to housing which implement a ban on evictions and a rent freeze for the period of the Covid-19 emergency.  This will initially be a three-month period that can be extended by the Government under section 4.  However, I am concerned about the criteria that will be used to decide whether such an extension is in the public interest.<\/p> <p>While I recognise this is emergency legislation in nature and focused on Covid-19, it cannot be ignored that it is being implemented in the context of an extreme housing crisis.  The Government should be looking to use and extend this power to provide relief to renters and families.  In light of the amendment passed in the D&aacute;il yesterday, it now also includes local authority tenants, Traveller communities and approved housing body dwellings which encompass some of the most vulnerable in the State.<\/p> <p>It is in the public interest to keep people in their homes during and following a public health crisis and to prevent greater homelessness where people are at the greatest risk of spreading the virus.  However, this section only lists the nature of the virus itself and the need to prevent the spread of the disease as criteria for the extension.  It includes no recognition of the wider social impact of an eviction and the disproportionate damage that would do to the public good and public safety during and following the current crisis.  This is why I am tabling amendment No. 7, which contains the vital recognition on top of the Government's own criteria.  This amendment is also needed because this section is not aligned with other provisions in the Bill such as the extensions to the Mental Health Act which are extended to November whereas these provisions for the vulnerable in the housing market are only in place for three months with limited opportunity to extend.<\/p> <p>Moreover, the criteria for time period extension for planning applications under section 9 and the provisions on redundancy in section 27 are broad, comprehensive, specific to the policy issues at play in those sections and include an assessment of the economic impact of Covid-19 but when it comes to preventing evictions, rent increases and homelessness for our citizens, the Government is not including the full range of factors and should determine such a decision in the legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There has been no provision so far with regard to renters who need to access rent allowance.

At times like this, we all feel loss in terms of being able to be with our families in different ways due to this emergency.  That is a factor in why it is so vital that we have measures in place to address the needs of those in different forms of accommodation and housing.  To respond to the different issues raised by both Senators, the reason the timing in this Bill is different versus other Parts of the Bill is because of the severity of the advice we have received from the Attorney General.  I believe that if I was to be in front of the Seanad this afternoon and proposed the implementation of these measures regarding evictions and rent increases that went on for quite a period, Senators would be asking me the understandable question as to why this was different to the stance taken by the Government on these issues for a number of years.  The reason for that is because the continued advice we receive from the Attorney General is that the balance between the common good and the public good and the role of property rights and private property is a very demanding one.  The clear advice we have received from the Attorney General is that the only rationale we can use for the suspension of evictions and rent increases during the period is a public health emergency.  That is the reason the timing with regard to this is different to other parts of the legislation and why the criterion is so clear, that is, that it must be linked to a public health emergency as opposed to the grave economic or social challenges touched on by the two Senators a moment ago.<\/p> <p>I will address an issue raised by Senator Higgins.  It is very important that even as we are grappling with the difficulties of today, we find time and space to think through what would be the difficulties for our society post Covid-19 because we will cage this virus and find ways of containing it and restoring our country to public health but when we do that, it will be the case that there will be consequences from this emergency that will spill over into what I hope will be a period of resumed public health and we will need to think anew about how we deal with those potentially very severe difficulties.  The Government or the next Government will do this but to go back to the core point raised by both Senators, namely, the reason why we have such a definitive link up between the suspension of evictions and rent increases for a period of time and a public health emergency is because that is the very clear advice we have received from the Attorney General and we cannot broaden it beyond a definition of an emergency, which is a public health one.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#EE00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

We have seen those who have done that, and we have seen those that have not made that choice.  The common good is our remit, effectively, as representatives of the public.  We are elected by the public for the public good.  The social, public common good is our core responsibility but I recognise business and property within that also have a role within society.  I note simply that if it is the advice of the Attorney General that the common good needs to be balanced and that we are not able to address the very serious health-related and social good-related consequences that need to be addressed following Covid-19, such as the health emergency and housing emergency we had previously, as well as the social cohesion issues that arise from a fractured society where people do not have the basics of shelter or food, then that will need to be addressed in a constitutional referendum in the future or we will have to challenge it at the highest level through the courts.  We need to have law, including constitutional law that can fully serve the common good.<\/p><p>At a European level we have seen state aid rules put aside and rightly so.  We have seen a renewed focus on public services.  We cannot have laws with, for example, the ratchet clause, that make it impossible for public services to be fully delivered and for states to respond through public services as they need.  Again, it is just a useful balance and a reminder when we discuss these issues and when we plan for the future.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has read books and discussed the role of the State.  We have seen that it is the public delivery of public services that has been the core front line of response to this crisis across the board.  It may be that services will need to be delivered nationally again such as public housing and public transport.  If those are areas that we need to take within our own control as states and on a European basis so that we can ensure that they function for the good of citizens, then that is what we must do.  That will be part of the architecture of our future response also.  I understand the advice the Minister has received and I think it is disappointing.

Public health is a much wider point and feeds so much more into the common good that is being defined within this legislation.  It is a misuse of the term &ldquo;public health&rdquo;.  It is not only public health when every social class of society is being impacted.  After this, there will still be a public health crisis but it will be among those who are more vulnerable and who have not been able to bounce back after a period of economic collapse, poor health and evictions.<\/p><p>How does the Attorney General define public health in this instance?  It is only being used regarding a pandemic and in terms of balancing this off against property rights and how long we can actually ban evictions for.  Is the common good and public health only a thing when it is impacting every single person?  Is it then of lesser value when it is impacting large communities, minorities and marginalised groups because their public health and the common good for them also should matter post what is laid out in the legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#FF00900","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>The Senator is making valid points but we are dealing with section 4, an extension of the emergency period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#GG00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I was speaking to the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#GG00300","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Entitlements to remain in an occupied dwelling during the emergency period and so forth are in section 8 which is further on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#GG00400","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>It is in relation to the criteria.

There are going to be big questions that we will have to answer regarding the role of the State and the commitments that citizens have.  Those questions will not only be on a national level but at a European and global level.

I am very much hoping that I will not have to.  It is incredibly important that, even as we are battling with a health emergency of this scale, we can still stand by the commitments we have given to citizens on the provision of housing and accommodation.  One of my personal lessons from the period between 2008 and 2012 is that when one makes decisions that cut back on expenditure in those areas, one just defers greater social need into the future.  I am going to do all I can to avoid all that happening in these circumstances.  I cannot guarantee that all funding, as is currently made available to everybody, will stay the same indefinitely.<\/p> <p>On Senator Mulherin&rsquo;s second point on capital expenditure, I want to do all I can to preserve levels of capital expenditure that we have particularly in housing.  We are going to need to rebuild our economy quickly.  We are already well aware of the housing needs that we have.  If we begin to say we are going to cut that expenditure now, what will certainly happen is that this need will grow in the future.

I will deal with the amendments first before I respond to Senator Gavan's question.  I propose not to accept the amendments tabled.  The reason is that section 5(1) provides that a landlord cannot serve a notice of termination during the Covid-19 emergency for any reason.  The limitation on the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords will only be in place during the extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Bill provides for the Covid-19 emergency period to be of three months' duration to begin with.  This period can be extended by Government order if necessary.  We aim to restrict the movement of people to stall the transmission of a disease.  However, it is provided that a tenant cannot accrue security of tenure rights under Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act due simply to the passage of time during the emergency period.  The Government considered it fair and necessary that any landlord who is delayed by Covid-19 in carrying out a legal eviction should be in a position to carry out the eviction after the Covid-19 emergency on the same basis as before.  There will be no further need to restrict the movement of people on health grounds.  If someone has been in a tenancy for less than six months before the Covid-19 emergency and the landlord had intended to terminate the tenancy at that time, and still intends to terminate after the Covid-19 emergency, the intervening emergency period should not count in the six-month tenancy required for a tenant to accrue Part 4 security of tenure rights.

It goes back to the point I made about access to rent allowance.  With the emergency Covid-19 payment being so easy to access, there should be something similar for renters so that they do not go into arrears during the emergency period and when it is over, there is no reason for landlords who say they intended, but did not intend, to get rid of the current tenant.

On Senator Ruane's point, if we discover any loopholes in the drafting of this legislation which need to be addressed, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Government will act on them, notwithstanding the limitations we will face for some time with regard the future of this House.  The objective driving this part of the legislation is to give as much security as possible to renters at a time of great change and great risk.  If we become aware of any unintended consequences or loopholes, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will do all he can to address them.<\/p> <p>I am not in a position to give Senator Gavan a definitive answer to his question.  It is our view and the view of the Minister of State, Deputy English, that the amendment which Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith gained the assent of the D&aacute;il for last night does not do all that was intended.  We will have to study it now to determine what unintended consequences might arise, particularly in the area of the rent a room scheme.

The obligations of landlords are unchanged across this period.  My understanding is that if they are giving notice of arrears, they must give a 28-day response period across that time and if they are seeking to give notice of termination, they must give 28 days of that as well.  It is 56 days overall.<\/p><p>As regards the point Senator Clifford-Lee raised in respect of her amendment, rent supplement and the ability to provide rent supplement will be given a higher level of flexibility than is currently the case.  We know that the income of many people who are renting at present will decrease very sharply.  However, I should point out, and this refers back to a question Senator Ruane raised on this section, that landlords need to think carefully about what the rental market will look like post Covid-19 as well.  Perhaps this point applies with particular force to the commercial sector as opposed to the residential sector.  When we emerge from Covid-19 it might well be the case that those who are renting different forms of accommodation, particularly in the commercial sector, may have more choice available to them than was the case in January.  All landlords should think about the value of keeping a good tenant and having a long-term relationship with that tenant as they make choices during this period.<\/p><p>I am not in a position to give a definitive answer to the question Senator Higgins put regarding student accommodation and the different forms of accommodation that are covered by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's amendment.

Some of these persons are members of the regulated professions who have let their registrations lapse, including doctors, nurses, midwives, dentists, pharmacists and healthcare and social care professionals.  The current legal provisions for restoration are detailed, however, and in some cases restoration to the registers can be a lengthy process.  The Bill's provisions seek to facilitate the rapid restoration to professional registers of qualified and experienced healthcare workers who are answering the call to return to practice.  The Bill empowers the regulators to adopt a quicker restoration process for these professionals, who are already known to them.  These are professionals who have satisfied the regulators that they are suitably qualified and experienced to treat patients and who are now stepping forward to answer the call during the Covid-19 emergency.<\/p> <p>The Senators' amendment addresses an issue which is important, that is, the ability to promptly register nurses and midwives who have not been registered here but who have either trained or worked in the UK.  General nurses who have trained in the UK benefit from automatic EU-wide recognition of their qualifications under the professional qualifications directive.  Registration of those nurses should be straightforward, subject to their requirements of registration, including the evidence of identity, confirmation of good standing and so on, which need to be received.  As a right to apply for registration already exists for this cohort, we cannot support the amendment.  I accept that some concerns have been raised around a number of individuals who are encountering difficulties in registering.  I share the strong support that was expressed in the D&aacute;il last night for the need to ensure these persons can become registered here quickly.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has undertaken to consult with the health spokespersons and the regulators on these cases.  We can deal with this through the Minister's office by consulting directly with the relevant regulators to try to ensure that if people want to register here, having been qualified in the UK, they can do so quickly because we need them.  We cannot accept the amendment to the legislation, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#PP00200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister's explanation.

I am partially reassured by the Minister's response.  It is an onerous registration process.  Perhaps after this emergency when we come through the other side of it, we can reflect that a lot of what we do is quite onerous and a bit plodding and it prevents speed of action.  We need to look at every area of our lives, legislation, policy and procedures, etc., always being mindful of risk and safety.  I know there are about 100 nurses from the USA, and I made representations in this Chamber a few years ago on behalf of three of them, who were not considered competent or were not allowed to become practising nurses here because of the strict criteria of a set time for clinical hours and a set time for theory hours.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to look at that.

Anyway, well done to the Minister on pay for the student nurses.  However, many more front-line staff and students may be left out.  I am thinking of radiographers in particular.

The same applies to many of my retired colleagues in nursing and medicine and many others besides who are prepared to come back and work in whatever way they can.<\/p> <p>I agree with what Senator Devine said.  The registration processes are tedious and onerous but now is not the time to visit that.  In an emergency we do this to get us through.

I am seeking assurances on the construction industry.  I have a letter from a lecturer in the construction area who is highly concerned about the safety of sites.  I hope the Minister will reiterate that there will be an increased inspection rate on sites.  Perhaps some mechanism can be put in place for people who take the view they have to work because the site is open but who may be uncomfortable doing so.  Perhaps there is some way they can alert the authorities on the safety issues involved.  I will qualify my comment by saying that construction is really important to us, especially with a housing crisis and the building of new hospitals and temporary accommodation to deal with a surge that might come.  At the same time we cannot compromise the personal safety of people working in the industry.  I would be grateful if the Minister would say something about that.<\/p> <p>I was going to mention another issue under mental health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#QQ00500","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I let you stray a moment ago, Senator.

I can assure Senator Reilly that the State has made no decision at any point that would allow a building site that is not safe for people who are working on it to continue to stay open.  We want to ensure that we can help employers, be they on building sites or elsewhere, where work continues to go on in a way that is consistent with guidelines as outlined.  If there is not consistency with the guidelines and workers are working under undue risk, then those sites should be closed.  The guidelines from the public health emergency team are clear on that.  As a result of this there will be increased effort to engage with employers to make sure the guidelines are being observed on building sites and on other work sites.<\/p> <p>With regard to section 39 organisations, I know exactly what Senator Humphreys is saying.  I am dealing with a section 39 hospice in my own city given the pressures they are under financially.  They are being asked to do a lot more than normal with regard to community care and so on.  The financial implications will have to be factored in later in the year and we will have to show flexibility.<\/p> <p>I do not disagree with the sentiment of the amendment.  If nurses or doctors who have qualified and have worked in the UK want to come to work in the Irish system, and they have a track record, they would be a very positive addition here.

Before making a renewal order, the responsible treating consultant psychiatrist examines the patient to determine if he or she is still suffering from a mental disorder.  An independent consultant psychiatrist also reports to the tribunal on whether the patient is suffering from a mental disorder, having also interviewed the treating consultant psychiatrist.  Normally, in the absence of this legislation, that second independent psychiatrist would be required to be part of the decision-making process.

There are a number of minor exceptions to this.  For example, where a patient is detained on a six-month order, the patient can request an additional review at or after three months.

This proposal is to make progress on that and to ensure we do not lose the humanity that allows for people's recovery and allows them to have a voice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#WW00100","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I will withdraw the amendment.

The HSE has been able to suspend abatement in pensions.  It has been able to pay student nurses a full wage.  Cadets, recruits and apprentices, who comprise a very small group, are at the front line.  Our cadets are handling the tracing calls for the HSE.  It is extremely onerous and tough having to ring people to tell them they may have been in contact with somebody with Covid-19 and may be infected and to listen to the horror stories coming back.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

They are doing full duty.  The military service allowance must be paid to them for no other reason than equality with all other sectors in the economy.  Pension abatement has been waived within the HSE and it should be waived for members of the Defence Forces returning.  With regard to the period of time that people are expected to return for, we cannot tie them to six months or three years.  These are people who have left the Defence Forces and who have good civilian jobs.  They are currently available to the State because of the situation that we find ourselves in and many will be happy to return, but we must give them an assurance of two things.  One is that they can leave without any cost to themselves when the economy changes or the virus is beaten, and the second is that their jobs will be protected.  The Government did that for members of the Reserve Defence Force last night.  We need to do it for members of the Permanent Defence Force too.  The buck stops at the Minister's desk.  I ask the Minister to treat the Defence Forces with the same degree of respect that we have given to the health service.  Last night, we stood and applauded all front-line workers.  We did the same thing again today in this House.  I ask that we deal with the Defence Forces with the same degree of respect.  Respect is measured by how we treat them.

I want to highlight an issue for the Minister.  Is he aware of the crisis in respect of travel agents?  Travel agents across the country are facing bankruptcy because they are having to pay refunds to people who have booked holidays but the airlines and cruise operators are refusing to offer any compensation.  They are in breach of European law in this regard.  Other members of my party and I have been inundated with queries and concerns about this issue.  This wage subsidy is a crucial support to these people but it will be no good to them if this Government, through the Minister's Department, the Department of Finance, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, does not insist that operators refund travel agents just as they have to refund their customers.<\/p> <p>I will give the Minister a prime example.  We have heard about all the good work the Government is doing with Aer Lingus and about the special flights it is running but it is refusing to compensate travel agents.  I have a specific example regarding a passenger in Cork.  By law, travel agents have to refund moneys to passengers who cancel plans because of Covid-19.  So do the airlines and cruise operators but they are not paying back money.  We need intervention in this area if we are to save these jobs.  This was the most appropriate section of the Bill under which to raise this issue.  <\/p> <p>I wish to briefly make a second point.  If it should come under the next section, I will raise it at that time.  People who work in the South but live in the North qualify for the wage subsidy but they do not qualify for the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  I cannot understand the justice in this.  We asked the Minister about it yesterday but did not get a response.  If people who are resident in the North are working and paying taxes in the South and then lose their jobs, why are they not entitled to that &euro;350 PUP?  It is completely wrong and it is partitionist in the worst possible way.  Surely, after all the progress we have made, a person employed in the South losing his or her job in the South should satisfy the qualifying criteria for the PUP.  The idea that this Government, or any Government, would discriminate against people for living in the Six Counties is absolutely disgraceful.  I hope that the Minister will confirm that is not the case.

It is unusual to include in legislation something that is to drift into the mind of an employer and what the employer might mean and what the employer might regard on balance when we have those mechanisms.  Insolvency and bankruptcy have been discussed, but potentially more relevant to the issue is ability to pay.<\/p> <p>If there are organisations and companies where the subsidy is being exercised, and I urge companies to exercise this provision in respect of protecting their staff, it should not be regarded as a subsidy that allows the company to continue to increase the wages of the highest paid in the organisation or to give share dividends or other bonuses.  My amendment simply sought to provide that we would not have a situation where there are bonuses and wage top-ups at the top level if the State is effectively subsidising the wages at the lower levels.  I had hoped that it might have been possible to have a legislative provision on that.  We might have to revisit it in future extensions, but the Minister might give me an assurance on how he plans to address both issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#ZZ01400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators.  I was not aware of the issue raised by Senators Gavan and Conway, but I will raise it with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is just one of the series of issues that are developing now as our economy responds to the public health emergency.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport are making great efforts in other areas to deal with the concerns of travellers.  I will ensure the matter raised by both Senators is raised with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and his Department.<\/p> <p>Regarding the issues raised by Senators Mulherin and Higgins, I will give a brief context for this section in the legislation.  Some 11,000 companies have now enrolled in this programme.  That shows the breadth of the challenge that is approaching.  In other circumstances one could point to that type of enrolment and feel a degree of satisfaction for putting in place a scheme that can make that type of difference to companies, but it is an indication of the challenge that is approaching and the necessity for a programme such as this.  The programme was conceived at great speed.  I have no doubt there are issues we will have to address and that there will be anomalies and issues of detail that will require work.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask that companies bear with us as we work on this.  If nothing else, the Revenue Commissioners will tonight become an institution of the State that pays people, which shows the kind and speed of change that is happening.<\/p><p>On some of the issues that Senator Mulherin referred to, my explicit message, as articulated by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners earlier, is to encourage companies to contact the Revenue Commissioners directly.  At a time of great stress for companies, when there is much uncertainty, there is no need to add to that.  They should directly contact the Revenue Commissioners and gain advice on how they can participate in such a programme.  There are criteria.  To companies that have concerns about whether they are in or out, I ask them not to approach Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas about that.  The only people who will decide whether a company meets the criteria are the Revenue Commissioners.  Companies should not divert their time by approaching a Deputy or Senator, nor place a Deputy or Senator in such a position.  They need to engage directly with the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>On the points raised by Senator Mulherin about turnover, the definition will vary as we engage with companies.  The most likely way in which decline in turnover will be worked out will be to examine what the expected turnover would have been in quarter 2 and to compare that with an equivalent period, most likely quarter 2 a year ago.  It is not unworkable.  These are issues that companies and the Revenue Commissioners will be able to resolve very quickly between themselves.<\/p><p>As for declarations of insolvency, the very outcome we are trying to avoid is companies becoming insolvent.  We are trying to ensure that if companies are in a position where they are in difficulty, they will be still in a position to retain a relationship with their employees and keep them involved.  Participating in this programme is all about ensuring that companies are in a position whereby when our economic health recovers, they will be able to rebound, without having put their employees on the live register.<\/p><p>I am not in a position to answer the question about the deductibility of wages from corporation tax.  Nevertheless, the detailed guidance from the Revenue Commissioners on how the scheme will work has been published and I hope the question will have been answered therein for those who have raised it.<\/p><p>On Senator Higgins's questions about the amendments she tabled, the reason we used the term \"best efforts\" and its corresponding definition was that it is conceivable that, as this emergency evolves, some companies will be able to add to the subsidy.  If they are able to do so, we want them to do so.  We want them to be in a position where they can ensure that the wages they give their employees include, and perhaps constitute the majority of, a \"top-up\" payment that they are able to make themselves.  Where companies can add to the subsidy, we want and expect them to.  We recognise, however, that it could become the case that companies simply will not have income coming in and as a result will not be in a position to pay wages to employees.  What would normally happen in such circumstances is that the employer would cease to exist and the employees would become unemployed, but that is what we want to avoid happening.  The company would continue to exist and would be able to maintain its relationship with its employees, particularly those on lower wages  What is likely to happen in such a scenario is that the State will pay the employees' wages for a period.  This is a huge change for the State but we are dealing with extraordinary circumstances and this is what we need to do.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> In regard to whether an employer would be in a position to pay bonuses or higher wages to different members of the company, one of the definitions we have put in is the inability to pay normal wages.  I will simply say that having put in place this scheme and then exited this scheme, hopefully, depending on the public health circumstances, if, later in the year, the Revenue Commissioners discover that employers who are benefiting from the scheme were paying higher and unchanged wages to other members of the company and paying them bonuses, it is pretty likely it would be the subject of action from the Revenue Commissioners.  There are many risks with this scheme but, as I said in the D&aacute;il last night, while there are risks, the greatest risk is that if we do not put something like this in place, many hundreds of thousands of people who are currently working might not have a job in a few weeks.  We cannot let that happen, which is why we are doing this.  That is why we have a reference to \"best efforts\".  As I said, it would be our absolute expectation that if a company is in this scheme, more senior members of that company would see their own wages change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#ZZ01500","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":353,"content":"<p>There was also the issue of pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, for people living in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#BBB00200","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>As I understood the issue last night, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was studying the issue.

The existing provisions in section 3 of the Redundancy Payments Act already provide that periods of temporary lay-offs do not break continuity of employment, and this will include temporary lay-off periods due to Covid-19.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Similarly, short-time work does not break an employee's continuous employment.  The Senator may be referring to reckonable service as opposed to continuity of employment for the purpose of the calculation of a redundancy payment.  Reckonable service is regarded as a week within continuous employment during which the employee is actually at work or absent from work due to specific reasons, such as carer's leave, parental leave or certain periods of sickness and holidays.  Periods of short-time work are classed as fully reckonable for the redundancy payment calculation, as the person is actually at work.  <\/p><p>The emergency measure the Government has brought forward is intended to prevent mass redundancies over a short time.  In many cases, the period of temporary lay-off, which is not counted as reckonable service, will not make a significant difference to overall redundancy payments.

In normal circumstances, it is understandable that a shopping centre wants to have life and vibrancy and does not want big empty premises opening and closing when it suits them.  This amendment seeks that in these exceptional circumstances, we would not require tenants to keep premises open for these specified periods because there is clearly other legislation to suggest that non-food shops should not be open.

A lot of these landlords are from big organisations so maybe they should step back and question whether those people who have been loyal to them over the years as tenants will come back and have vibrant businesses again.  However, if they drive them to the wall now by demanding rent, they will have nothing but empty premises when this comes to an end.<\/p> <p>In the area of shops, this Government has done everything it can to advise businesses on what is and what is not essential.  It cannot dot every \"i\" and cross every \"t\" and it cannot have a list of every single business in the country.  I already made the point to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, that the likes of these storage boxes that people can rent are not an essential service.  They do not need to be open and they are putting their staff at risk.  I mention the companies that provide supplements for the fitness industry, for example.  These are not foods, let us be honest about it.  They are something that people do not need to get in order to survive.

Rates levied in 2020 were not levied under the 2019 Act but under the original rates legislation, which remains in effect.  Notwithstanding this, and given the issues as raised by Senator Horkan, along with the unprecedented nature of the challenges arising from the Covid-19 situation and the challenges therefore being faced by many ratepayers, the Government has agreed with local authorities that they should agree to defer rates payments due from the most immediately impacted businesses, primarily in the retail, hospitality, leisure and childcare sectors, until end of June.  The measure will be implemented by each local authority in its own area and was announced by the Government last Friday.  Any ratepayer who has had to close temporarily or significantly curtail operations during the Covid-19 period should contact his or her local authority with regard to any rates payments falling due to the period to the end of June.  Local authorities have been asked to publicise this arrangement and put in place dedicated contact arrangements for ratepayers.<\/p><p>The Senator is correct that these rate payments are a very important source of income for local authorities.

In the last few weeks of the campaign sometimes it was difficult to talk about trying to get oneself elected when there were so many things going on in people's lives and businesses that are far more serious and significant in terms of how people are going to exist.  I wish everybody the best.  I wish the very best to the Minister and the Government.  I also wish the very best to whatever form of Government we will have in the coming weeks, and whoever is involved in it, in making sure that our country emerges from this awful pandemic and crisis as best we can.  I am happy to play my part, as is my party and our group in the Seanad, in whatever happens.  I wish everyone in the country the very best.

This may be the last time I will ever speak in this House.  I will let the Minister know on Thursday morning.<\/p> <p>First and foremost, I thank my colleagues for the support that I have always had since I entered this House.  I thank the Government for the way in which I have always been treated.  Any time I ever sought information or assistance I always got it.  When one sees the words \"emergency measures in the public interest\" on the front of a Bill, it strikes horror in the hearts of all Irish people dating back to 2008 or thereabouts.<\/p> <p>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Government for putting the citizen at the centre of this legislation, for thinking of the people of this country first, making sure people have incomes and that they have something to look forward to in what must be the blackest days in some of our lives.  As I wandered around the supermarket, which I have only done twice since we were asked to stay at home, when I went out for essential supplies I was amazed to see how afraid people were as I walked towards them and how they looked towards the ground, almost embarrassed to say they were afraid.  I would be lying if I said I was not petrified myself of the likely outcomes of this virus.  I hope to God it passes my door and does not enter the doors of anybody that I know.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has done a good job.  He has put the citizen first.<\/p> <p>My final kick is that the Minister should please go back and have a look at the Defence Forces and do something about the military service allowance.  The members are decent young men and women who should be training as cadets but today they are taking phone calls.  It is the same thing for apprentices and recruits.  I ask the Minister to do that as my final, final word in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#JJJ00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":450,"content":"<p>That is the third time today the Senator has made that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#JJJ00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I give high praise to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and all Ministers for the work they have done throughout this terrible ordeal our wonderful country is going through.  I do not often agree with Senator Craughwell but I always agree with him on defence matters.  I have spent the past four years harassing the poor Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on behalf of the Defence Forces.  On my last day I will not leave without giving one last push, that is, that the Defence Forces would be paid a fair day's salary for a fair day's work, which is what we have always sought in here.<\/p> <p>I was very honoured to have been elected here in 2016.  I have served to the best of my ability over the past almost four years.  It has been a great honour to have worked with everybody here of all parties and none.  I hope anyone who wants to be back will be back and that those who decide not to come back will have a wonderful future.  Throughout the crisis what has been said all along is that we should pull together by staying apart.  We must do that and we must keep saying that because people get complacent.  When we leave here today we need to keep pushing the message that we need to pull together by staying apart.  I thank the Minister and the Government.  In parting, I believe the next Government we have will be critical for the country.  I strongly believe that the next Government should be a Fine Gael-led Government.  I am not bothered by the fact that it is 35 seats versus 37 seats.  Fine Gael has shown that it is the best Government in times of crisis and that is the direction in which we should be going.<\/p> <p>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your courtesy and how fairly you have always run the House.

It has been an extraordinary Seanad in terms of the real changes it has made in law and in policy which has affected people's lives.  Private Members&rsquo; Bills and ideas which came from different sides of this House have gone on to become law and shape lives.  Democracy, as the Minister said, really does matter.  We have just come out of the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions which reminded us that human rights and laws matter, even in war.  Human rights and laws matter when democracy matters, even in times such as this unprecedented challenge that we face.<\/p> <p>The choices people make in terms of election are important.  I urge those who can safely do so to cast their votes today because there are still elections under way.  It is important because the choices they make affect the space and decisions we make together.  If I am lucky enough to be in the next Seanad, I hope the Minister will recognise the key role the Seanad and its expertise has to play as we face into the next challenges.  Whatever government may form, be it a national unity government or negotiated one, the Seanad will always give an additional expertise and different perspective.  The 11 Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees should be those who can really contribute to this national debate and decision-making at this time, be they from a party background or not.<\/p> <p>I commend the Minister for the work of the Government, particularly under duress at this time and for emphasising the importance of continued, active and civil engagement with all parties in the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>I wish us all safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020032700002#KKK00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1585310400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I am making a ruling now.

We will come out of this stronger.  When we do, however, we have to look at who are the true risk-takers.

I wish the incoming Seanad the very best of luck.  It will be very difficult and mistakes will be made.  All parties and individuals have to realise this, regardless of what Government is formed.  The Government is acting at such speed that there will be mistakes, but they will not be made on purpose.  Mistakes will be made because the Government will want to do the best it can as quickly as it can.  A personalised attack should not happen.  We have to seek to have a Government that acts in the best interest of the citizens.  I accept that and accept that there will be mistakes made but the Government will not be setting out to make them.  It will be trying to deliver a really good service to citizens.  In that regard, I applaud whatever Government comes in.  Over the next weeks and months, I will do my share voluntarily in whatever way possible.  I wish the incoming Government the best of luck.
