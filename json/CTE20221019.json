I previously said to this committee that neither I nor the Government would be found wanting when it comes to trying to addressing the question of sustainable funding.  In working with this committee to make progress, we really believe sustainably funding higher education has a profound impact for our economy, society and the citizens we all serve.  Therefore, I am pleased to be with here today to discuss our progress in implementing Funding the Future, our policy response to underfunding in the sector.  Indeed, earlier today we had an implementation group meeting where we had a chance to meet with all of the stakeholders.  This is an implementation group which I co-chair with Professor Anne Looney and Professor Tom Collins.<\/p><p>However, it would be remiss of me not to note the work of this committee in its report on sustainable funding.  I thank the committee for sending it to me.  As I outlined in my written response, a great many of its recommendations very happily dovetail with our priorities in Funding the Future,<i><\/i>particularly the focus on staffing ratios and on quality and how those two important strands inter-relate in higher education.<\/p><p>The committee will recall that Funding the Future<i><\/i>went beyond being a direct response to the European Commission's Directorate-General reform review because it also tried to settle the question of the funding model and the funding gap.  It provided a clear and detailed economic assessment as to the funding options presented in the Cassells report.  As was requested by this committee in 2019, the Government ruled out the possibility introducing student loans in the system.  The Government committed to a multi-funded model of additional Exchequer investment and employer contributions through the National Training Fund.<\/p><p>In this year's budgetary process - this was an important development, and I hope a welcome one - we also committed to publishing an annual paper in advance of the budget on the cost of living and the cost of education in Ireland.  That enables Government, the Opposition, stakeholders and this committee to scrutinise the various options available to reduce the cost of education for students and their families.  The first of these assessments was published by my Department in August and it informed our decision-making in the Estimates process.  I am sure we will have a chance to get into the detail of Funding the Future as we work through the questions.  I will take my comments on as read, other than to say we are providing significant additional funding this year that will see a significant increase in staffing in the sector, which is important; a reduction in the staff-student ratio; and an opportunity to build capacity in the technological universities in regard to that.  There will also be funding that will enable joint programmes to be co-designed across further educational training and higher education.  This is a really key aim.<\/p><p>In terms of student accommodation, I want to be very clear on it.  I have been pretty upfront about this and I do not think the current student accommodation strategy is fit for purpose.  Much has changed in the world since it has been in place and we need to develop another one.  The last thing we need to do is to start writing that now.  The first thing we need to do is to look at the universities that have planning permission and to get building.  That is what my Department is working on.  It is finalising a proposal, which I intend to take to Government in the next few weeks, that will try to see Exchequer funding for the first time put into helping make student accommodation projects on publicly- or university-owned land with planning permission viable.  As we get into 2023, we will look at replacing the existing student accommodation strategy and we look at the technological universities and others and their capacity to develop accommodation.<\/p><p>I want to touch on the issue of PhD students.  We had a discussion on it during oral parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il last night.  I committed on that occasion to carrying out a national review of PhD student supports, PhD stipends and how we look after our PhD students in this country.  We have a lot of work to do.  I have been very clear that this needs to be an external review and I would like to share the terms of reference with the committee.  The scope of the review will include current PhD candidates' supports.  This includes: financial supports, such as stipends, SUSI and others; the adequacy, consistency and equity of current arrangements across research funders and higher education institutions, including equity and welfare considerations; the status of PhD candidates and this debate around the student versus the employee, including a review of international comparisons and models; the impact on the funding of research programmes of any adjustments to current rates of support; graduate outcomes for PhD graduates, including return on investment and benefits to the learner; future-proofing supports; and visa requirements and duration for non-EU students, mindful that this is a matter for the Department of Justice and will require collaboration with that Department.  In the coming days, I will announce the external chairs of that group.<\/p><p>These are requirements and duration for non-EU students, mindful that this is a matter for the Department of Justice and will require collaboration with that Department.  I will announce the external chairs of that group in the coming days but I wanted to share that with the committee.  It is my aim for it to conclude its work in early 2023.  <\/p><p> On the issue of North-South cross-Border enrolment, I would like to thank the committee for its thoughtful contribution to the question of North-South enrolment in tertiary education in this report, and specifically its series of recommendations.  The Chair will be aware that I have provided under a separate cover a detailed written response to that report and it is a very timely contribution to the question of North-South student mobility.  I am convinced not just of the need to facilitate mobility, but also to ensure that firm foundations of collaboration between further and higher education institutions are protected and enhanced.  There are common challenges facing education systems, North and South, and it is in the interests of all of us on the island of Ireland to ensure that every young person and every person on the island has access to the best possible educational opportunity.  This is vital not only to our shared economic prosperity but to underpinning peace on the island.  I also expect in the coming days to be able to make a significant announcement on the development of all-island research centres which I know is something this committee supports and has an interest in.<\/p><p> The final issue the committee asked me to touch on briefly and I am sure we will then engage on it, is with regard to the withdrawal of accreditation for the applied social care course at the Dublin Business School, DBS.  I fully respect CORU's role as an independent regulator.  That is right and proper.  I also fully support the regulation of the profession.  It is a good step forward in terms of standards.  There must be appropriate mechanisms to ensure fitness to practise and the protection of the most vulnerable in society, so regulation is being introduced and the system is currently undergoing the transition to accreditation.<\/p><p> The social care workers register is due to open on 30 November 2023.  This would begin a two-year transition period for existing practitioners to apply to register with CORU.  On 30 November 2025, the title \"social care worker\" is due to become a legally protected title in Ireland.  My officials are engaging with all relevant parties and will continue to do so.  I have been very clear regarding the need for refunds from DBS to students and a recognition of the difficulties they have encountered.  I also believe we need to look at how we ensure students can continue their studies and how they can transfer where possible to the Technological University, TU, Dublin.  I want to thank TU Dublin for a very active engagement with Quality and Qualifications Ireland and DBS and for all their efforts to work out a solution for DBS students.  I am happy to share more information in the questions.

I will go straight for it so in terms of North-South enrolment and the Minister's comments on it.  I welcome some of the Minister's comments but am a bit concerned that he talks about what has already been done.  I acknowledge the good collaboration between some of the institutes, and the research hubs and the development in that regard.  There is still greater potential there.  It is the student mobility part that we have to take very seriously.  I am disappointed and maybe we can have further discussions on why I think we need targets.  It is a bit like increasing female representation in politics if we do not have targets.  I feel we are a quarter of a century after the Good Friday Agreement and it concerns me that we still have such a low number of students going from North to South and South to North.  There is a much wider issue here than education in terms of embedding peace and reconciliation, and increasing the understanding that we need across the island.  I see the way those who are at third level from North and South engage and it does not matter what their constitutional aspirations are.  The engagement that is there and that then spreads out in third level institutes is really positive and something we need to do.  I ask that we look to see what more can be done there with the shared island unit.<\/p> <p>  I would particularly like to highlight the recommendation around adjusting grades from A-levels into leaving certificate points because that is probably the single biggest barrier to students from the North coming South.  It has become more acute in recent years as we have had grade inflation in this State.  It is something we need to look at further.  We will have a number of witnesses before the committee to discuss this further so I ask the Minister to keep an open mind on it and see what ways we can work together specifically to get rid of some of these barriers.  I know from talking to students and parents from the North that it is easier for someone from the North to go to Oxford or Cambridge than to go to the University of Galway, Dublin City University or one of those.   We have to hear that and try to unblock those things so I hope we will have further discussions on it.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome the setting up of the review group.  Deputy Harris said in May this year that the funding gap would be closed over the next three budgets.  Is that still the Minister's intention?  <\/p> <p>  Regarding student accommodation, I want to ask about the links to affordability and how the Minister will ensure it.  If third level institutions were to borrow all of the money they would have to charge roughly more than &euro;12,000 per year to cover the cost of student accommodation as it is at present.  That is not affordable accommodation as I know the Minister will understand.  <\/p> <p>  We talked last night about the PhD researchers and we need to look at the apprenticeship model to see what we can learn from that and how we can put that into place.<\/p> <p>  It is very important that each of the CORU students have a place and have a pathway.  There needs to be lessons learned for the future from what has happened to them.  I want to see each and every one of those students have a pathway and obviously be reimbursed.  We have a responsibility, albeit that their education was being provided by a private institute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#B00700","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Conway-Walsh.  I wish to assure her that my position on North-South is not just to list all we are doing and all that we have done.  I genuinely share her view and am more convinced by the day from my engagement North-South, and from my visit to Queen's University Belfast where I gave a guest lecture over the summer months outlining my vision for an all-Island approach to higher education.  It makes sense.  I agree with the Deputy that regardless of one's political persuasion, the community one comes from in the North, on an island as geographically small as the island of Ireland it makes sense to work together just like we are in healthcare.  As I said in my opening statement I also believe it makes sense beyond education.  It makes sense in terms of embedding peace, in terms of getting to know each other and having a better understanding.  There have been a couple of developments.  The Higher Education Authority Act 2022, as I am delighted to now call it because the HEA Bill is now the HEA Act if anyone is wondering, is now the law of the land.  We will move to commence that.  We engaged on Committee and Report Stages on this legislation.  It is a very clear function now for the HEA in terms of the promotion of cross-Border collaboration on higher education.  It is now a function of the Higher Education Authority, very clearly and explicitly in that law.<\/p> <p>  Second, we are currently carrying out research to try to move beyond the anecdote in terms of student mobility and why people come or do not come North-South or South-North.  I do not mean this in any way regarding Deputy Conway-Walsh's comments because she could legitimately throw it at me too.  We are doing this research through the HEA to try to get under the bonnet as to what is going on in student mobility.  We have the common travel area but why is student mobility somewhat stuck North-South and indeed east-west?  We hope to publish that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#B00800","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>We have outlined that in the report.

I will not take too much time on this but there are a number of real actions that we are taking to try to accelerate all-island collaboration in both further and higher education.  In 2023, will see the development of the first all-island apprenticeship, likely in the area of construction.  Construction workers move around the island and it makes sense for the apprenticeship model.  Also in 2023 there should be an all-island approach to medical education.  We are almost there and have a bit of work to do.  There has been a lot of really good work by my colleagues on that issue.  We will likely see this month, if not next month, significant announcements on all-island research centres.  We will talk about that.  As soon as tomorrow I will be updated by officials on the work our Government is doing to advance our commitments on the New Decade, New Approach deal as regards Magee College.  I know this is an important interest for this committee and I will keep it closely informed.<\/p> <p>  On the &euro;307 million, it is my intention to close this gap as quickly as possible.  I want to see this gap closed ideally in the lifetime of this Government.  That is where the three budgets comment came from.<\/p><p>It is true, as we have discussed before, that ensuring people had food, light, heat and so on had to take priority in the measures we took in what became a cost-of-living budget.  However, we managed to receive significant investment and I am pleased with how it has landed with the implementation group for Funding the Future.  I will send the committee a note rather than taking up its time on this.  There will be an additional &euro;17.8 million for the universities and specialist colleges to strengthen capacity and resources, including effective staffing and reducing the staff-student ratio.  The technological universities will also receive &euro;17.8 million to strengthen their structural capacity in staffing and posts.  Increased funding of &euro;2.4 million will be allocated to medicine places and I am particularly excited about the &euro;2 million to develop, co-design and co-deliver programmes between further education and training, FET, and higher education, HE.  These are the additional Funding the Future measures and this is what the additional money will do.  I will send the committee a detailed note on that.<\/p><p> The question on accommodation and affordability is valid.  It is also the focus of our work.  We cannot hand out taxpayers' money and be mute on the issue of affordability.  I cannot get to where we are going immediately because I need Cabinet approval but I intend to go before the Cabinet committee on housing this month.  We will make proposals on how we believe we can help to get a number of projects that have full planning permission unstuck.  That is step one.  We have set up a specific unit in the Department dedicated to student accommodation.  There are a number of ways to slice and perhaps address the issue of affordability.  I will be happy to come back to this committee for its views and input once those proposals are available.<\/p><p> Regarding the PhD issue, the Deputy referred to the apprenticeship model last night in the D&aacute;il and again in the committee today.  I spoke about whether a PhD student should be treated as a student or an employee.  Different countries do different things.  What is the best model?  The scope of the review is broad enough to cover all of that.  It is clear this will not only be about the appropriate level of stipend.  That is important and it needs to be higher, but we also need to consider what other issues need to be addressed such as terms, conditions and pathways.<\/p><p> In the interests of time, I can send the Deputy and committee a note on DBS.  The work on this matter is ongoing.  The committee will be aware that a total of 85 learners were impacted by DBS.  It is a private college but I do not say that to wash our hands of the issue.  We want to help.  Of the 85 learners, 15 graduated in 2022 and 2021, 37 were part-time learners and 31 were full-time learners.  The 15 graduates have the option - and I am not trying to speak for them because I take the point that everyone is an individual - to avail of grant parenting provisions to become eligible for the register.  The existing students who have not yet graduated need to see how they can continue their studies.   Both TU Dublin and the Open Training College, OTC, are likely options but conversations are ongoing and we will continue to keep the committee updated about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#B01000","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the team from the brand-new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  It is fantastic that we have this Department that is driving change and legislation, including the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022 which is ground-breaking legislation.  It will drive funding in the third level sector.<\/p> <p>  It is great to see the detailed update the Minister gave to the committee.  The &euro;1,000 reduction in the registration fee provided for in the budget is extremely welcome.  Parents and students have been given a deadline of the end of November to engage with their colleges and share their account details.  I will also highlight that the SUSI application deadline is 3 November 2022 for any students who need to apply for that.  The Minister is considering a review of that scheme as well.  Hopefully the double payment will be made in December.<\/p> <p>  I was at a great event in Ballinasloe on Tuesday.  The brand-new Technological University of the Shannon, TUS, in Athlone is establishing learning gates.  I was not sure what a learning gate was.  It is where students can come together and have a space to learn.  Ballinasloe Area Community Development has a meeting room that students can access.  They can access courses online and study in an environment where other students can also meet.  The technological university will open 11 learning gates in the next few weeks and is even considering opening one in Dublin.  It is phenomenal that we are seeing this outreach.  I want to see campuses and centres of excellence in our regions, especially in Roscommon and east Galway, because that drives regional investment in our areas.  It also drives excellence in academia because it engages and shows there is a focus.  We need to see investment in the regions as well as in city centre locations and to work with different agencies in local areas to promote that.  I am interested in the Minister's thoughts about regional development and how TUS has been able to do that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding PhDs, it is fantastic to see the review.  Having worked in Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, I am aware of the challenges relating to supporting PhD and master's degree students.  The Minister indicated the review will examine the status of PhD students, the stipends - of course &euro;500 has been allocated in the budget - and international comparisons.  Will the Minister provide a timeline?  Is there a country that the Minister thinks manages PhDs best and is the one to look at?  I am looking at the quality we have.  Ireland ranks highly in expertise in many sectors and research areas through its principal investigators.  Those principal investigators drive the funding that comes through SFI and the Irish Research Council, IRC, and then brings the PhD teams to Ireland to deliver and develop excellence here.<\/p> <p>  The Minister highlighted student accommodation as being one of the Department's key priorities, with a dedicated unit.  I was delighted to hear about a 674-bedroom development when the Minister was visiting the brand-new University of Galway.  Will he provide a timeline for that?<\/p> <p>  It is wonderful to hear about Funding the Future.  The Minister stated the implementation team had been recruited.  Will he update the committee on any outcomes from that?<\/p> <p>  I am happy to see the co-design between FET and HE.  In relation to education and training boards, ETBs, I have a few questions about how the Department funds SOLAS which delivers FET and ETBs, but the Department of Education funds the administration and running of those organisations.  Does the Minister have any comments on that?  It can sometimes be a challenge in how we develop the staffing and capacity to deliver these courses, which the Minister stated is crucial, especially on the FET and HE side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#C00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The Senator covered a lot of ground so I hope she will bear with me.  I thank her for working with me on the Higher Education Authority Bill.  I enjoyed and appreciated her input.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased we have managed to reduce the student contribution fee by &euro;1,000 on a one-off basis.  I am equally, if not more, proud that we have come up with a proper structure to look at the issue of registration fees and grants in the round from next year.  Senator Malcolm Byrne and I debated this point at different times but I think we have landed in a good place, because we have said everybody will receive &euro;1,000.  That is a cost-of-living measure and like many cost-of-living measures, it is universal and will be paid before the end of the year.  Some 94,000 students will benefit.  From next year, we have made a permanent reduction of &euro;500 and linked it to the SUSI system.  We have introduced an income threshold of &euro;100,000 and a reduction of &euro;500.  That gives me and any future Ministers or Governments the ability to look at the registration fee as part of the overall grant system in future budgets.  That is a good way of doing it as we will not be having separate conversations about SUSI and the registration fee.  We are looking at the system and structure of the cost of education.<\/p> <p>  One of the good ideas to come out of the Funding the Future paper was a recommendation by one of my officials that we publish an annual cost-of-higher-education paper in advance of the budget.  It has been done by the Department of Social Protection for many years.  Papers on tax and welfare are published.  We had not exactly been forgotten, but we were not up in lights in advance of the budget.  This means that every year the Oireachtas, media, stakeholders and everyone else will get to see, debate and consider what could be done to help to reduce the cost of education, how much it would cost and the best choices available.  That can only be good.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased that SUSI will issue double payments on 16 December 2022.  That will come at a welcome time for many families and crucially the SUSI grants will rise by between 10% and 14% from January 2023.   Last year and in most previous years, when SUSI grants rose, students had to wait until the following college year.  They will rise from January 2023, which is important considering the pressure people are feeling.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in hearing more about the learning gates and perhaps going to see some of them.  It is a good idea.  The technological universities at their core are about regional development.  They are about bringing access to education into the regions.  They are about moving beyond the outdated concept that all roads from an educational point of view must lead to a big city.  We have had a lot of success in recent years in setting up technological universities.  I thank the committee for its work on this.<\/p> <p>  Capital investment is badly needed in the facilities. We will have an announcement at the end of this month or the beginning of next month on significant capital funding for technological universities.  Many have applied.<\/p><p>That will come shortly.  On research, we are making sure there are research-intensive institutions, looking forward to the ring-fenced funding for the TUs that will come through the European Regional Development Fund.  I think it is a fund of approximately &euro;80 million.  The third is a meaty piece of work.  There is a lot of work going on in my Department and with the OECD on academic contracts.  Again, this is not about foisting something on people; it is about engaging and offering the contract so these TUs can reach their full potential.  Now that they are set up, they are the three big things that are important.<\/p><p> On the PhD review, the timeline is that it will kick off in November and conclude in early 2023.  We need to talk to them first, but I will announce the external chair or chairs of that by the end of the week, I hope, or certainly in the next week or so.<\/p><p> On the 674 beds in Galway, I had a chance to view the site when in Galway with the Senator for the renaming of the University of Galway.

The membership of the implementation group is quite broad but it contains the heads of SOLAS, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, Irish Universities Association, IUA, the president of the Students' Union, the general secretary of ICTU, representatives from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the head of Aontas, representatives from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Department of Education, my own Department, IBEC and me and the two co-chairs, Professors Tom Collins and Anne Looney.

I join with the previous speaker in congratulating the Minister on the Department and its success.  Some of us were unconvinced as to the necessity of a new Department but it has proven its worth.  It is now a feature and a fixture and deserves to be.  The Minister made a success of it and that needs to be acknowledged.  We share many aspirations about free education, particularly in the area of literacy, which he has done great work on and I congratulate him on that.<\/p> <p>  On the cross-Border piece, I want to focus on one issue today, if I might, which feeds into the cross-Border discussion.  On teacher training, to put it delicately, there is an issue regarding the cohort of teachers we are training and the qualifications that necessitate their access to teacher training courses.  Barriers to teacher training are placed in front of young people from certain backgrounds. They might be from disadvantaged or Traveller backgrounds or they could be from the North or overseas.  Some of those barriers relate to the Irish language.  This is a difficult one to verbalise because many people feel very strongly about the Irish language, as I do myself; I have a degree in Irish.  I try to pronounce my name to people with great difficulty in every election.  The serious point is that the requirement of the standard of Irish to enter training colleges needs to be challenged.  What we need in teacher training is a diverse population of teachers in our primary schools that reflects the children they are teaching.  It is still a very white, middle-class teaching profession.  It does not reflect a new Ireland or any new Ireland we want to promote.  The Irish language could also be seen as a barrier, particularly in terms of the North.  Would it not work better, considering the new Ireland we hope to engage with, to have people from more disadvantaged backgrounds, who may not have had higher level Irish as an option in their second level school?  They certainly might not have had the chance to go to the Gaeltacht three summers in a row for financial reasons.  Would it not be better to focus on their ability to learn and teach Irish when they are in training college, rather than as a requirement to get into training college?<\/p> <p>  It is still such a powerful profession.  If someone comes from a minority, be it ethnic or any other kind of minority, particularly disadvantaged children, and if he or she has somebody from his or her community as a learning and educational leader in the classroom, it is incredibly powerful.  While it is not the only barrier, perhaps the Irish language requirement could be tweaked a little, not in any way to reduce the quality of Irish language teaching in the classroom, but to do it in a way that teachers are empowered to teach Irish better when they are in training college, rather than having that funnel exclude some people who may not have had the opportunity to learn Irish at second level.  They could be students from the North or a disadvantaged background or abroad.  How powerful would it be to have somebody who came here as an asylum seeker working as a primary school teacher?  The one reason they probably cannot is the requirement to have Irish entering teacher training college.  It is an issue I have tried to pursue for a long time.  At one point, we had a number of students from DEIS second level schools in my constituency learning Irish and getting grinds in Marino Institute of Education.  That was a solution.  Some managed to achieve the required Irish language level and they became teachers.  We were proud of that, but it is not a long-term fix.  I wanted to bounce that off the Minister, to use this platform to raise it and see if he has any sense of how we could move on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#D00400","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I should acknowledge, because it is the truth, that the Deputy was the first Oireachtas Member who spoke to me about the issue of adult literacy.  We have been doing a lot of work on it as a Department, trying to advance some of the issues we discussed.  We now have a national programme office set up to deliver the new adult literacy for life, ALL, strategy, as well call it.  Probably more importantly, flowing from that, we are actively putting in place regional literary co-ordinators.  Key to the progress of this strategy is that it is not a document that resides in Dublin or the Department or an office, but that we empower communities to see what they need to do in their area to roll out literacy initiatives.  For some, that might be through their local sports club or other local organisations.  However, I acknowledge that there is significant work going on.<\/p> <p>  Before straying, the issue of teacher education still resides in the Department of Education and the initial teacher education unit.  I can certainly refer these views to them and seek a view and engagement from them.  Having acknowledged that it is within their area of responsibility - this is a personal view - but in general, as we try to reform the education system, we should be more concerned about the standards somebody has obtained upon exit of university, as opposed to on entry.  That is not a bad philosophy to approaching this.  We have seen good practice in the likes of Dublin City University, DCU, which the Deputy will be familiar with given his geographic location.  We have seen good examples from DCU where they go out into communities, particularly into socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, to identify potential teachers among young people through local community groups and sports clubs and try to mentor, identify and encourage them to take the plunge.<\/p> <p>  My Department has the programme for access to higher education, PATH, bursaries, which are access to education bursaries.  There are specific bursaries now in place for members of the Traveller community who wish to access teacher education.  That is a slightly wider point I am making than specifically around the Irish language issue.  I will certainly feed those views back.  In general, and I saw it in my time at the Department of Health, diversity in professions is a good thing.  If our professions are not diverse, it stores up a lot of issues, including the lack of role models and identified people for all communities.  Professor Anne Looney, who is probably well known to the Deputy, is co-chairing our implementation group.  She leads the teacher education initiative in DCU.  I might seek a more informed view from her as well.  I am happy to share that with the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#D00700","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials.

The Minister will appreciate that my job over the next five and a half minutes is not to spend my time praising him but to focus on a couple of the key outstanding issues.<\/p><p>I will put one question directly, before coming to others.  The Minister made a commitment that the sum identified in Funding our Future - &euro;307 million, which is the funding shortfall for the higher education sector - would be addressed over three budgets.  While I appreciate his point, I think that the &euro;40 million in the budget this year only went part of the way and represented a disappointing movement on the &euro;307 million shortfall.  There are two budgets left, however, assuming the Minister remains in the Department.  That means we are going to have to look at an additional &euro;130 million, or more, in each of budgets 2024 and 2025.  How confident is the Minister that the balance of the sum that has been identified - the shortfall - will be delivered?  How committed is he in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#D01100","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I am very committed.

I have had great support from the Taoiseach on this.  I want to genuinely acknowledge that, but it will require a collective effort from the whole Government.  There are a couple of reasons to be hopeful.  One, we need to grapple with the National Training Fund surplus.  I am not suggesting that it is easy; it is not.  If it was easy it would have been done already, but it still needs to be done.  For anyone watching these proceedings, the National Training Fund is an account that employers across the country pay into.  It has a very large surplus, which will amount to over &euro;1 billion shortly.  It is on track to go to over &euro;2 billion in the coming years.

I am not saying it should, though.  I believe it is a pot that needs to be considered.<\/p> <p>  I would like to mention a second issue that did not get enough of a hearing, although it got a fair hearing today at the implementation group from the sector, which I appreciate.  We all talk about the &euro;307 million, including me.  We are all committed to filling that hole.  We did something else in the budget, however.  If we had not done it, the hole would have grown.  There &euro;307 million in money owed to the sector.  I acknowledge the work of my colleague the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, on this.  We got agreement for the first time to fund every new additional student entering college from September at the new higher Funding our Future rate.  Every new additional student who goes into college from September will be funded 25% more in terms of funding to the university than students currently.  As that washes through the system, for want of a better phrase, it means we become sustainable from this moment on.  I said very clearly to the IUA and others that if we had not done that - if we had announced a larger sum for the core funding but not done that - we would have created another problem.<\/p> <p>  The third thing is that this is year one of implementation; it truthfully is.  It is the first budget we have received for Funding our Future.  Of course, we would all have liked it to be higher but we had to balance it with the cost-of-living pressures for students and their families and the significant investment we put into that.  It will require time to build up our own capacity as a sector in terms of delivery.  There are some key things, as we said at the implementation group today.  We will need to prove that the &euro;40 million makes a real and tangible difference, particularly in terms of staffing ratios, and does not - I am not suggesting this will happen - disappear or go into block grants.  I think it could make a difference of at least half a point in the staff-student ratio this year.  That is a tangible thing.  When we go back to the Estimates discussions next year, we will be able to look at what we did with the &euro;40 million and imagine what we can do into the future.

As the Minister knows, there is a significant cost to higher education institutions to be able to provide such accommodation in a way that will be affordable to students.  The only way that is going to be done at present in most cases is where there are supports made available from the State for the provision of student accommodation.  I know the Minister has indicated support for this.  Will we be able to see that for 2023?  Can we see that in a way which ensures that at the start of the 2023-24 academic year, we may be able to see a level of State investment to support on-campus student accommodation?

Thankfully, it is more than that.  At a Cabinet committee on housing in July, I think, the Taoiseach and I strongly put forward the view that there was a need for an intervention and the Taoiseach provided his imprimatur for this to happen.  Since then, we have been working on developing proposals for how we can unlock or unstick, in the first instance, universities that have planning permission today.  This is not a critical comment on them; far from it.  It has not been viable for them to build.  We will be returning to the Cabinet committee on housing this month and then, ultimately, to the Cabinet to try to press \"Go\".  I imagine it may be done project by project.  Affordability will be an element.  We cannot have a situation where the State is paying money and is agnostic on the issue of affordability.  I will not read out the entire list of those with whom we are working closely.  I can share the list with the committee.  There are five traditional universities today with planning permissions to build.  If you look at the totality of that, you are talking about a significant number of beds that could be built.  Will all these beds be built for 2023?  Of course they will not.  That is not what the Senator is asking.  If we are to move beyond the annual September crisis around student accommodation, at some point somebody has to take the bull by the horns and try a new model; that is what we are going to do.<\/p> <p>  The second piece will have to involve the technological universities.  The Senator will be familiar with the position in the south east.  With the exception of the former Waterford Institute of Technology, they have never built a student accommodation bed.  I am not being critical of them because they had not been allowed to do so under the borrowing framework.  We have now clarified under the borrowing framework that they can.  When we met the chairs of the governing authorities, our message to them was to get ready and begin to prepare their plans.  That will be coupled with the new student accommodation strategy.

I think the Senator and I agree on that.  He has raised this issue of PhD students quite a lot with me.  This short, sharp review has broad terms of reference but is focused at the same time.  It involves external people.

It is very worthwhile that the Minister is available to the committee to give us constant updates because it is a new Ministry.

Given the limited time, I want to focus on one area the Minister has come here to speak to us about and that is PhD candidates.  We are doing another piece of work at the moment around mental health supports within primary and secondary schools.  One of the things the stakeholder groups have raised with us as an issue is recruitment of those who support.<\/p><p>We already know through child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, that it is an issue but we have a backlog in this country when it comes to psychological supports in education.  I know the Minister is aware of this and that the working group is also working on it, but there are three types of PhD students going through psychological research programmes and two of those are funded through the HSE.  More recently the students on the counselling programme are also funded since this budget, but the last are the educational psychology PhD candidates.  It is very hard to explain or understand why that is, particularly as they all come to their courses from the same route.  These candidates do 300 hours of work placement, often with CAMHS and some of it with disability services so they are hugely valuable for us, even while they are doing that training.  Looking at the clinical psychology PhD candidates for instance, they are being paid a full-time salary for their work as a PhD candidate.  Only 18 of these educational psychology PhD students are due to graduate in the next year, or possibly in 2024.

There are a couple of things here.  The points made by the Senator highlight the need to overhaul the system we have in place in terms of PhD supports.  We have been looking at this very intensively particularly in recent weeks but also in recent months.  The situation is that my Department pays stipends through our agencies such as the Irish Research Council, the IRC, and Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, which are at an equivalent level of &euro;18,500 each.  Some PhD courses do not have a stipend.  Some are paid directly by their institution such as those in the Higher Education Institutions, HEI, but that level is decided by the HEI from their block grant generally.  Then some PhD students are paid through private sources or private funding received by their university.  In relation to the specific issue raised by the Senator, for the health programmes, the HSE and the Department of Health fund to recruit.  The Department of Education is not within my remit but I believe it is considering this for educational psychologists.  I said this in the D&aacute;il last night but the broader point I want to make is that as part of the review, we need to look at the fact that we do not actually have a minimum recommended stipend in Ireland.  There are so many different types and there cannot be a minimum.  I will pose the question as opposed to pre-empting the outcome of the review.  Should there not be a floor for the level of stipend supports for all PhD students in Ireland?  At the moment there is not.  I looked at this in the context of the budget, even those funding schemes within my remit that I can provide financial assistance to, or at least easily provide financial assistance to, are not 100% clear either.  The PhD review we are announcing this evening will be an opportunity to tease through those issues but on the specific point the Senator makes in relation to that relatively small number of students, the responsibility lies with the Department of Education.  My understanding is that it is considering a model similar to that used by the Department of Health.  I will ask officials in the Department of Education as a result of this exchange to interact with the Senator directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#F00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>While I appreciate responsibility lies with the Department of Education, the problem for the Minister's Department is that people are taking a different route because they are funded and at the end of the day, they become qualified psychologists.

I am certainly not suggesting it would be and that is why I referenced the body of work that my Department tends to do with this external review about PhD support students, the consistency of those supports and how they are applied.  I accept that 100%.  The Senator touched on another issue on which I will not go into too much detail in case I frustrate the Chair, but it is the issue around workforce planning.  I will be blunt with this committee and say I am really concerned about this.  There have been examples of good practice particularly in recent months.  I am really proud of the work my Department, the Department of Health, the HSE and others have done in relation to medicine places.  I can sit here this evening and tell the committee there is a funded multiannual plan to increase medicine places over the next number of years.  Some 60 extra places went in this September.  The deans of the medical schools did great work and I thank them, and the HSE also.  All of that is great but I cannot say that exists in many other areas of the public service and that frustrates and worries me.  As a Minister for some time, I know that funding initiatives can be announced but if there are not people to roll-out these in terms of the delivery on the ground, it will not make progress with waiting times and lists.  I am very passionate about the need to accelerate the engagement with other Government Departments.  They need to see this relatively new Department as a resource and properly interlock with it on workforce planning.  How many speech and language therapists do we need in Ireland and how many occupational therapists and nurses?  It is not only how many we need but how we actually get there together.  I am not being critical.  I have seen exchanges on health committees where people get tetchy when these issues are raised.  This is not criticism of any other Department but we are all public servants here and we need to step up to the plate.  We need to properly plan the workforce.  I do not intend to become pen pals in terms of correspondence between my Department and others in relation to this issue.  It is too serious.  We now have settled the question of medicine and I want to praise the Department of Health for its work on that but we need to now do it in relation to health, social care and disability professions.  I know the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, is up for this; as is the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  If I continue in this role, a key priority of mine in 2023 will be the whole issue of workforce planning.  My Department is now engaging at an official level with a number of Departments on this as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#F00400","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions.

Will the Minister bring us up to date on that?  I am not sure if that question has been asked already.<\/p> <p>  Second, what collaboration has the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Housing had with the likes of Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Cork City Councils where some of our bigger third level institutions have real issues in trying to accommodate students?  The financial contribution the Government gave back to students in the recent budget is very welcome but it is being offset by the cost of accommodation.  The students had their walkout protest last Thursday.  You hear of some students living in tents - I do not know but that is the information that is out there.

It is palpable.  It is difficult and challenging and we really want to look at practical ways of helping.  That is why we have taken immediate measures between now and the end of the year with &euro;143.5 million of direct financial assistance going to students and their families be that the double Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, payment just before Christmas; the increase in the student grants that will kick in from January; the refund of &euro;1,000 additional funding for the student assistance fund, which can perhaps be viewed as a hardship fund; extra supports for postgraduate students and an additional increase in the PhD stipend.  These are practical measures we wanted to take now to help people and in recognition of the fact that when you look at housing and student accommodation, there are two parts to it.  There is affordability and supply and in relation to affordability some of the measures taken in the budget will genuinely assist.  For the information of the committee, figures as of today show there are approximately 2,065 rooms, what used to be called digs, available for rent across the country.<\/p><p>These are advertised on student portals and the like.  When I meet students and talk about this I understand it does not work for everybody but it is working for thousands of students.  It does work sometimes for people who have a spare room in terms of the cost of living impact.  We have made a number of changes around social welfare rules to make it easier for people to keep the living alone and the fuel allowances and the pension and rent out the spare room.  While people say there is nothing available on Daft.ie or Myhome.ie I encourage any student or parent to look at the various digs options available.  It is certainly better than some of very difficult scenarios that I sometimes hear of.  That is not me saying that is the long-term solution or an optimum policy.  It is not.  It is getting on with building.  I want to be very clear and I have said this directly to the Technological Universities and will be saying it when I am with the Chairman and Senator Byrne when I am in the south-east on Monday, so let me say it again here.  We are ready to talk and want to talk and are open for business in terms of the Technological Universities and the borrowing framework.  They know this, in fairness, and they are working hard on this.  We will work with them to accelerate and develop any plans they have to deliver student accommodation.  It will be really important for the success of the TUs, Technological Universities, because they are about serving their region but also about attracting people into the region to study and to do that you need accommodation.  I agree with that.<\/p><p> On the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and his officials for the excellent collaboration between my Department and his.  We are extremely grateful for the work they are doing with us and for allowing us to take learning from some of the schemes they have put in place more broadly in society.  We are interacting with the Cabinet Committee on Housing and we will be back to that committee this month as well on that.  On the issue of affordability I have acknowledged the measures we are taking in the budget to put money back in people's pockets.  The reason we are doing it is because we know people are experiencing rising costs.  I know the Chair did not ask me but I should say, because the Chair and Senator Byrne regularly talk to me on this, the South-East Technological University moving ahead with securing the new site for the Wexford campus is a massive priority for us.  There is funding set aside in my Department and I acknowledge and thank Mr. Enright, the chief executive of Wexford County Council, and the council for the role they are playing to secure that site for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#F00800","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>That leads me on to my next question.

There is a great leadership team and governing authority now in place which really hit the ground running in their formal launch on Monday.  I do not mean this in a flippant way but we are not in the business of buying sites and using taxpayers' money for sites for them to sit idle.  We are in the business of purchasing sites and expanding footprints because we buy into the argument and into the compelling vision that there needs to be a modern fit-for-purpose campus in Wexford.  I was really impressed when I visited the campus in Wexford with the Chairman and Senator Byrne and with what is going on there.  I was not impressed with the facilities that people have to work and learn in.  I met some very inspiring students there particularly around the whole area of lifelong learning, people who told me very bluntly and very clearly that they would not have been in higher education were it not for being able to go to the Wexford campus.  We now just need to provide them with a fit-for-purpose campus.<\/p> <p>  The Chair is also right to indicate it is always good to be truthful in this.  The site was secured and then we get on to the planning etc.  These are processes that take time but these will be processes that we will work with the Technological University to progress as a priority.  These are autonomous institutions, as they remind me, and the governing authority sets out its own strategic priorities.  We will see an expansion in Waterford and I am clear on that.  There are plans for Carlow and there are plans for Wexford too.

I had a very good conversation there with the president, a very impressive individual, about her and her management team's vision for the future of the Marino Institute of Education.  I launched their strategic plan that day.  There is a really important conversation about Marino and where it fits and I say that in a positive way, about where it wants to fit in our higher education landscape and the HEA Act 2022 also gives us opportunities to accelerate those discussions.  We have discussed this in relation to a number of institutions.  I do need to be honest and of course I will meet with Marino and the president and will engage with her on this and other issues.  However for clarity, and it is always important to be clear on these things, the reduction of &euro;1,000 is linked to the payment of a &euro;3,000 registration fee.  There are lots of different students in lots of different scenarios across the country.  The way I think of it in my head and the way I explain it to the public is if you are levied the &euro;3,000 fee you are automatically entitled to the &euro;1,000 reduction.  If you are not, you are not.  That is not to be in any way dismissive but it is just to be truthful.  That is where we started in terms of reducing the cost of education.  We do intend to do more. We are engaging directly with Marino on this and we are assessing the situation.  My understanding is that Marino sets its own rate for non-approved courses so there is an engagement going on with Marino but it is the free fees initiative, the &euro;3,000 fee, that the &euro;1,000 reduction applies to.  Any other fee that is not from the free fees initiative does not currently quality for the reduction.

They came to see me in Leinster House.  There is at least two higher education institutions that I am aware of and I am sure Deputy Conway-Walsh is aware of that are currently looking at engaging with the HEA on preparing for en expression of interest for target programmes including veterinary.

I would like to meet this group as mediators with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue.<\/p><p> This is a personal view.  I am frustrated that, as the Deputy rightly says, every year so many young people leave to go to, I believe, Poland and Hungary to study to become vets.  There clearly is a demand from young Irish students to study veterinary medicine.  I have also heard from a number of colleagues in the House and from vets themselves that there is a particular shortage of vets for larger animals in rural areas.  We are engaging on this.  There will be a process involving expressions of interest through the HEA, which is obviously the appropriate channel.  They are autonomous institutions and need to express interest.

I am joined by Ulster Bank&rsquo;s director of corporate affairs, Ms Elizabeth Arnett.<\/p> <p>  As the members know, our phased withdrawal is progressing and we have made sure to keep the committee informed at all stages.  We have committed to a phased, orderly withdrawal to minimise job losses and support all colleagues with training and development, with a preference to deal with strategic banking counterparties, where possible, who can provide customers with full banking services in the Irish market.  We commit to helping our customers move to a new provider as safely and as seamlessly as possible, with plenty of advance notice, and to keep branches open throughout our choose, move, close campaign to ensure customers have access to branch support during their six-month notice period, where possible.  There has been no bank-wide voluntary redundancy scheme in the first half of 2022, and it is highly unlikely that we will see large numbers of redundancy exits this year.  In addition, we have committed to dealing with our non-performing loans in the later stages of our withdrawal, to allow customers who are in difficulty as much time and support as possible to return to a performing position.  We are delivering on all of these commitments as our withdrawal progresses.<\/p> <p>  Today, I would like to outline the current position and the next steps for our current and deposit account customers, and we are happy to take questions on any aspect of our withdrawal in the discussion and will endeavour to answer them subject to the normal commercial considerations.  We announced our plans for the closure of our current and deposit account customers a year ago, in October 2021.  Six months later, in April 2022, we formally began writing to customers to ask them to choose a new provider, and move and close their current and deposit accounts on a phased, rolling basis, giving them six months&rsquo; notice to do so.  We have been communicating multiple times and in multiple ways with our customers throughout this six-month notice period, and there are a number of channels available to them to close accounts.  We have engaged in significant advertising and marketing campaigns, as have other important stakeholders such as financial service providers, the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  The campaigns have been constant, and one can hardly turn on the radio, open a newspaper or go online without hearing a message about moving to a new provider.  This might seem excessive sometimes but a programme of this scale that requires so many customers and stakeholders to act, requires this level of communications.  Based on our independent research, the communications have worked, and our customers are universally aware of what is happening and of what they need to do.<\/p> <p>  In addition to our customer communications and in recognition that many other stakeholders external to Ulster Bank would need to play a part in ensuring customers could safely choose, move and close, we commenced a proactive programme of engagement a year ago.  To date, we have held over 1,200 stakeholder engagements, from large-scale roadshow events to regular, one-to-one meetings.  Many committee members or colleagues in their constituency or parliamentary teams have attended some of these events.<\/p> <p>  Our objective is to ensure we employ all communication channels to ensure customers are aware of the action they need to take and the supports available to them.  I thank all stakeholders for their ongoing support.  While communications are a central part of our activity, it is second only to providing practical support and outreach to customers.  In this regard, we are very proud of our front-line teams and the lengths to which they have gone to support our customers, and I take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank them for that.<\/p> <p>  By way of example of the sorts of initiatives we are implementing to provide practical support to customers, we have changed our branch hours to allow more time to support customers move their accounts.  We have hosted teams from other financial institutions in our banking halls, so they are on site to open accounts for our customers.  We have a full range of supports for vulnerable customers, details of which we have shared with the committee.  We have carried out additional proactive contact to customers who might need more help, such as those in financial difficulty, older customers, heavy branch users and customers at the end of their six-month notice period.  We have made it easier for customers to close their account in-branch, on the telephone and digitally.<\/p> <p>  We are already seeing trends that show a significant reduction in reliance on branches for our customers, with in-branch transactions down by 49% and falling each week.  At the same time, other financial providers have made it easier for customers to open accounts and we have seen many initiatives in this regard.  I will not mention any specifically, but we can see from the enormous number of accounts that have been opened this year - on average 12,500 a week - that the supports put in place by other financial providers are working.  In some instances, accounts can be opened digitally in a matter of moments but, equally, for customers who do not want to open accounts digitally there is no significant delay for appointments, with the Central Bank reporting an eight-day waiting period for appointments.<\/p> <p>  We have also mirrored our process and approach for our business customers, providing them with six months&rsquo; notice to choose, move and close as well as multiple letters, prompts and calls.<\/p><p>Having a working current account is crucial for businesses to be able to pay their employees and suppliers, receive payments and carry out all their financial duties.  The switching or closing process can typically take longer for a business customer because requirements are often more complex, so I have been engaging proactively with these customers since they received their first letters, and in many cases before then, to ensure they have the support they need.  If a customer does not switch or close a business current account, it could have implications for the business in terms of paying employee wages, paying suppliers and receiving payments for its goods and services.  Ulster Bank is asking employers to communicate directly with employees who continue to have Ulster Bank accounts to remind them to change their details to avoid any disruptions to salary payments.<\/p><p> We believe we have taken all reasonable steps to support customers to choose, move and close and, to the best of our knowledge, other financial institutions have also taken appropriate steps to encourage customers to choose, move and close.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, we have significant outreach to customers, with a focus on those approaching the end of their notice period for current and deposit accounts.  In the past four weeks we have made, on average, approximately 10,000 calls a week, successfully contacting an average of 6,000 customers per week.  In these calls, our colleagues ask customers if they need support ahead of the end of their six-month notice period.  The majority of these customers are telling us that they have taken action or are in the process of doing so, and already have their move well in hand.  Most customers are telling us that they have opened a new account and need to complete the transfer of their transactions.  A small percentage tell us they will now take action, while a very small number of customers have asked us for more time due to personal circumstances.  We have now written to the vast majority of customers who need to close their account, which means almost every customer has begun the six-month notice period, with some more advanced than others.<\/p><p> Before I go into the detail of what has been happening, I wish to share one of the learnings from the past six months.  When we started this process, we believed the primary metric for success would be the number of accounts that have closed.  However, a far more important metric is the degree to which a customer is reliant on the account.  When a customer has an account with another bank and his or her salary and other payments are going into that account and the direct debits and so on have been moved to it, the customer is no longer reliant on his or her Ulster Bank account.  The customer might never come back to close the account with Ulster Bank, so in such instances we can close the account with no impact on the customer.  What is important is that the customer has safely moved to a new provider and is no longer reliant on Ulster Bank.  Understanding that reliance, through detailed analysis, has helped us to target more effective communication which, in turn, has driven customer behaviour.  For example, members may have heard our adverts targeting customers making nursing home payments or customers in receipt of social protection payments.  We have also highlighted salary payments because nothing says you need a bank account more than if your main source of income is banked there.<\/p><p> How have customers been responding?  Some customers have gone beyond their six-month notice period and some other customers still have more than five months&rsquo; notice left.  As such, looking at the headline numbers across the entire population will not tell one very much about customer behaviour and the customer response.  Of our personal current account customers who received their first formal notification in April and May, 71% have either closed or materially wound down the level of activity in their current account or left it inactive and dormant, and that percentage is increasing every day.  Since our submission last Friday, 80% of our first set of customers have either closed or are inactive on their accounts.  We have contacted most of the remainder of these customers as a final reminder and most of them are reporting that they have opened a new account elsewhere or are in the process of moving their payments to a new account.  Broadly, this trend is emerging in the other tranches of customers and we are not seeing anything in the numbers that at this stage would change that trend.  This is evidenced in a number of ways.  For example, 171,000 Ulster Bank accounts were in receipt of social protection payments at the start of the year.  This number has dropped by more than 80% to approximately 30,000.  Since we submitted our report, it has dropped to 28,000.<\/p><p> What happens now?  From the outset, we committed to an orderly and phased withdrawal of the bank from the Irish market.  This commitment is more important than ever as we commence the process of freezing and closing accounts.  Therefore, in line with our commitment, we will take a considered and careful approach to account closures.  We will continue to assess external, operational and other factors to ensure that the right number and type of accounts are progressing to the account freezing and closing stages.  As a reminder, our closure process has an additional step built in.  Customers have six months&rsquo; notice to choose, move and close.  On or after the six months, the account is frozen for 30 days and then moves to closure.  This is an important interim step and, for some customers, may be the trigger to ensure they are no longer reliant on Ulster Bank.  We will also take time to understand the account profile and what impact, if any, freezing the account will have on the customer.  That will determine the point at which an account moves forward into the closure process.  Ultimately, all accounts will move into the closure process, but in the initial round of closures we will take a very precautionary approach.<\/p><p> What does this mean for customers at the end of their notice period?  As some customers are past or close to passing their six-month notice period, a number of things will happen.  These will be dependent on the needs of the customer.  If a customer needs more support, which may or may not mean more time, we can provide that - the customer just needs to let us know.  If a customer is still reliant on the account after the six-month notice period is over, we will try to make contact with the customer again to ensure he or she has all the requirements needed to complete the move to a new bank and service provider.  We will not freeze or close the customer's accounts at this time but it is essential that the customer continues the process of moving to another service provider.  According to customer feedback and independent research, most of these customers have a bank account elsewhere and are in the process of moving, so we believe they are on the way to completing the process.<\/p><p>If we freeze an account on which a customer is still reliant, we can temporarily reverse the freezing of the account for a short time once the customer contacts us.  If a customer is no longer reliant on an account but it is still open, with no activity or a low level of activity, the customer can expect the account to be frozen and closed on or after the six-month notice period.  This precautionary, careful and controlled approach means that where a customer is reliant on the account, we can tailor the closure to the customer's individual requirements, and the overall closure of accounts is managed to maintain an orderly process for customers, the industry and other key stakeholders.  Right now, we have a temporary pause in the commencement of this activity to accommodate the additional social protection payments announced in the recent budget.  Even though more than 80% of customers in receipt of a social protection payment have taken action on their account, there are some who have not done so and they have the potential to be the most vulnerable.<\/p><p> We will start the process of freezing and closing accounts in a controlled and careful way on or after 11 November, beginning with customers who we believe are no longer reliant on their account.  We will take a planned break in freezing accounts for Christmas.  During this break, accounts that have already been frozen for a month will continue to close unless the customer contacts us, and we will continue our outreach to customers reliant on their account during that time.  We will recommence the programme of freezing and closing accounts in the new year, so it is important that customers realise that once their six-month notice period is over, their account will be in line to be closed, but there is help available if they need it.<\/p><p> It is important to remember that Ulster Bank is closing.  We need to provide certainty for our colleagues as to when they can expect to leave the bank so they can plan for their futures, and we need to be clear to customers that it is in their best interests to be with a new financial provider that can support their needs into the future.  We have endeavoured to ensure that all reasonable steps have been taken to support customers to choose, move and close.  We will continue to do so throughout this process.<\/p><p>I thank the members for listening and am happy to take their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane Howard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Howard.

I am grateful for the opportunity to address this committee.  I am accompanied today by my colleagues Dermot Kieran, chief financial and products officer of the bank, and Darragh Lennon, director of retail distribution.  We look forward to a constructive discussion regarding the closure and switching of current accounts and related issues as KBC exits the Irish market.<\/p> <p>  A number of key milestones in relation to the planned orderly exit of KBC have taken place since we last met with the committee.  The agreement relating to the sale of performing loan assets and deposits to the Bank of Ireland Group received approval from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on 24 May 2022, after which we ceased accepting new applications across all products.<\/p> <p>  We have also been informed that the Minister for Finance has instructed that the ministerial order confirming his approval of the transfer to Bank of Ireland be drafted.  Subject to the completion of the remaining procedural steps, the transfer is anticipated to take place in early 2023.<\/p> <p>  We have started communicating with our customers on the next steps associated with the transfer of products to Bank of Ireland.  As part of this communication, we have provided customers with a comprehensive product guide outlining clearly what is happening across all products and the actions required of customers in each case.  When we last attended this committee in May of this year, I expressed our determination to protect the interests of our customers and staff to the greatest extent possible as we conduct an orderly exit from the Irish market.  It has been and will remain a key priority for KBC Bank Ireland to support our customers at every turn and to communicate effectively with them, ensuring they have all the information they require, understand the actions they need to take, and have sufficient time to take those actions.<\/p> <p>  KBC current accounts are not part of the transaction with Bank of Ireland, which means that customers are required to move and close their current accounts.  Managing this process has been an important priority for our team and we have dedicated significant resources to ensure the process is as smooth as possible for our customers.  I am happy to report that, in partnership with our customers and supported by our dedicated staff, we are making good progress and account closures are tracking materially ahead of plan.  I would like to now provide members with an update on that progress.<\/p> <p>  As outlined previously when we attended here in May, we estimated, based on our data and analysis, that 52,000 of the 130,000 total number of KBC current account holders may need to open a new account or move to a new provider.  Today, our estimates show that the 52,000 figure is down 25% to 39,000.  I can also confirm that 55% of all current account customers have now received account closure notices, and these notices will continue to be issued into the first quarter of 2023.  Priority customers, including those in a vulnerable position, non-digitally enabled customers, and people over the age of 65 were prioritised from the outset to give them sufficient time to transfer their accounts and 95% of that group have received their notifications.  Of this prioritised group of 4,400 customers, only 700 remain with an active account today.<\/p> <p>  There has been a 110% increase in current accounts with a zero balance, with an overall reduction of 26% in current account balances since May.  The number of direct debits is reducing at a rate of 3,000 per week.  Another key indicator of activity is the level of social welfare payments being made into current accounts.  This has decreased by 32% from May to September, with just 8,500 accounts remaining in receipt of social welfare payments.<\/p> <p>  We can confirm that 10% of current accounts have been closed by customers since May, which is above our projections.  The first wave of account closures, which consists of inactive current accounts, will commence in December 2022.  The closure process will proceed from that point onwards in four-week cycles, continuing until August 2023.<\/p> <p>  As previously communicated, 90% of all customer service queries are handled through the contact centre and 97% of active KBC current account customers are digitally enabled.  KBC has increased by 65% the staff dedicated to serving customers in the contact centre and by 25% in our operations centre since the announcement of the agreement with Bank of Ireland, ensuring that strong service levels are maintained and the average call waiting time for talking to a colleague in the contact centre in KBC remains less than 30 seconds.<\/p> <p>  We know that a digital first approach to banking is preferred by our customers and this is supported by our recent research which found that 81% of KBC customers surveyed prefer to close their account digitally.  In November, KBC will be able to support customers to close their current accounts via the KBC app.  Our hubs, which are not traditional bank branches as they were primarily designed for sales and not for operations, are used by a small number of our customers for support and they will remain open to support with switching or closing until after customers have transferred to Bank of Ireland.  Based on our customer data, we expect that those current account holders who are more likely to want to visit a hub, will have already closed or switched their current accounts before the closure of any hubs.<\/p> <p>  We have a dedicated care team for customers who may need some extra help and support during this time.  Our care team has lots of experience supporting customers with different needs and continues to support vulnerable customers through the current account closure process.<\/p> <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to thank KBC Bank Ireland staff who continue to go the extra mile in servicing the needs of our customers in what is a challenging period for them also.  A successful engagement process with the employee council, which represents staff interests, culminated in that body securing a redundancy package that compares very favourably in the sector and we continue the principle of consulting and communicating on an ongoing basis with staff directly. <\/p> <p>  On the subject of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, or TUPE regulations, and the transfer of staff to Bank of Ireland, I can confirm that the TUPE consultation with Bank of Ireland concluded in July and that all eligible staff have been communicated with directly regarding the transfer of their role and how their employment terms and conditions have been protected.  It is still too early to state the number of employees who will transfer to Bank of Ireland, as they are entitled to waive their TUPE rights up to the point of migration in 2023. <\/p> <p>  In conclusion, I believe we are making good progress on the subject of current account closures and account switching where we continue to place the interests of customers at the centre of the process, providing every support we can in doing so.<\/p><p>As stated, we are also heavily focused on the well-being of our staff and we will continue to engage with them to ensure that their best interests are protected as we continue the orderly wind-down of the bank.  My colleagues and I are happy to take any questions the committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Jansen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#E00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I was wondering if we all should go home, given that the CEOs have told us they are ahead of target and everything is going so well.

An active current account could have 70 or more transactions in a month.  If we think of all the times people use their current accounts to tap for a coffee, pay a mortgage or whatever, an active current account on which they are fully reliant will have a high number of transactions.  If a person's number of transactions is between one and five, it is not unreasonable to assume, primarily because customers as well as independent research are telling us, it is very unlikely to be that person&rsquo;s main bank account.  What defines reliance here, for example, would be where a person has a bank account elsewhere.  That person would be less reliant on Ulster Bank.  If a person has payments, salaries or a Department of Social Protection payment going into that account, that person is more reliant.  Let us face it, unless there is something going in, it is very hard to make payments out.  If payments are not going into that account and into another one, again reliance is even less.  If the balance is extremely low, a person will not pay the ESB or electricity bill out of that.  Again, the reliance is even less in that case.  However, we accept there is a qualified judgment on our part in relation to those numbers of transactions, which is why we have the additional step of being able to reverse the freeze within 15 minutes if the customer states they are still reliant.  However, at that point we have the conversation with the customers as to how much support and time they need and whether we can get them an appointment in the other banks.  We invite them into our branch where we have Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB in the banking hall and ask whether we can get it done for them.  That is a very important step to get attention for customers who, bear in mind, have had six months&rsquo; notice and any number of contacts.  Rather than jump straight to closing the account completely, irrespective of the numbers, we have introduced this step.<\/p> <p>  We have done two things for customers who are reliant on their account and have two sources of data on that.  We have been talking to those customers and they are telling us they are banked elsewhere.  We have also researched separately to verify that fact.  We know that 80% of the customers who are heavily banked have a bank account elsewhere.  We know 96% of them know their account will be closed and 91% are telling us they will take action within the next four weeks.  What we have seen over the past two weeks in terms of the changes on the numbers of accounts that are opened and closed, that are not reliant, that have no balance, or that are heavily reliant actually bears that out.  We want to avoid a situation where we are closing accounts where customers are reliant on them.  However, we have told customers that if they leave the account, we will close it for them.  We have said that we would do that and we need to finish that process for customers.  However, the objective is to make sure there is no reliance on the account.  If there is reliance, we can reverse that very quickly and engage with the customer.  We need to keep the momentum going in terms the overall journeys for customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Arnett"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Of the 5,400 who have some level of activity on the account, as things stand, if nothing changes between now and two weeks from Friday, how many of those accounts will be closed or suspended?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#F01100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I think those numbers will change again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Arnett"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>We all hope so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#F01300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>They changed over the weekend and they will change again.

We have reviewed approximately 400 cases of very vulnerable customers and power of attorney is an issue that often arises.  Where we can and where we are very confident that there is not a customer safety issue or a question of financial vulnerability, we can work with - it would be wrong to use the word \"bypass\" - the customer and his or her family, and the other bank, to ensure we are moving the money into a single name account, into the other bank, without having to go through the costly process of attaining power of attorney.

A local person can go into a nursing home and resolve the issues.  We have a customer support line, which is open seven days a week and which has received approximately 8,000 calls.  We have had contact with approximately 70,000 vulnerable customers.  We have done a large outreach to the stakeholders, including Safeguarding Ireland, etc., that represent vulnerable customers.  They have been helpful in giving us a practical compass as to how to respond to customers without putting obstacles in the way, while also maintaining the absolute integrity of the financial safety and security of the individuals in question.

We are four months into a 14-month process and the number of customers we see as needing another account or needing to undertake significant switching activity has reduced by approximately 25% in those first four months.  We are seeing good traction every week, as Mr. Jansen mentioned in his opening statement, around the moving of direct debits.  That number is dropping by approximately 3,000 per week and we now have approximately 135,000 direct debits attaching to any of our current accounts.

While people may have switched their accounts, they are having difficulty switching over their direct debits with various utility companies, which I will not name.

We are very conscious of the fact that our withdrawal put a lot of emphasis and pressure on other stakeholders, other banks and the direct debit originators because a customer cannot fully complete the journey without the support of those stakeholders.  We started a very early process of engagement across the industry.  We were all involved in that.  We brought in what we considered the top 20 direct debit originators, including the large utility companies, the telephone service providers and the insurance providers, to inform them of our plans and the number of accounts coming through.  We have, by and large, seen a very positive response from those service providers, making it much easier for customers to change their details online or over the phone, and just having the information to hand for customers.  In the past four weeks, BPFI hosted a session with direct debit originators to attempt to check how things are going.  Direct debit originators that started early are further ahead in their engagement, it would be fair to say.  Those are more in the energy provider space.  I think those companies are more tuned in.  Perhaps that is unfair because it would imply that others are not, but those companies engaged with us on these issues from a very early stage of the process.<\/p><p>We have seen a huge decrease in the number of direct debit transactions across the board, not just in the early tranches.  We have seen the levels come down.  We have not come across any situation where it is prohibitively difficult for customers to make the changes.  If customers do have issues, we raise them directly through our engagement with the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, which is engaging with the direct debit originators.  There is nothing I can point to that could be described as a blocker in terms of the issues and concerns.<\/p><p> Initially there was a concern that if everybody used the switcher process, it might be a challenge for direct debit originators, but we are finding that most customers are driving the process themselves, with about 10% using the switcher process and using it effectively.  One of the concerns we have is that customers who do not close their accounts may not fully conclude their direct debit processes.  They might assume we are going to close the account but the direct debit will not get taken from the account.  There could be unintended consequences if an account is left open, so we are watching those sorts of things to make sure that does not happen.<\/p><p> In terms of payments in, the big one according to our engagements is the Department of Social Protection.  As I said earlier, we are about 85% of the way there, but as we move on in that process, we are going to see more and more vulnerable customers who have not made the change and we are going to work very closely with the Department to resolve that with them.  We have exchanged data and the Department is contacting customers directly whose notice period is coming to an end.  The contact from us and from the Department is proving to be very effective.  Over the weekend, for example, another 2,000 accounts moved on.  It is a work in progress and the broader external communications campaign supports all of that.  In the later tranches, we are seeing customers starting to make changes earlier in the journey.

We have seen that with the Department of Social Protection in particular, which has conducted a really strong campaign with customers.  We have seen our social welfare payments dropping by 35% in the first four months of our programme, which is very positive, and 90% of what we have left are child benefit payments.  That is a positive as well in that the likelihood of vulnerability is lessening as we get through those.

I welcome the opportunity to present the Bill to the committee.  I am assistant secretary in the Department of Health.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Caitriona Mason and Ms Bronwyn Conway, from the bioethics unit in the Department.  I would like to outline the rationale behind the introduction of the Bill, before briefly addressing some of its main provisions.  As members will be aware, the purpose of this Bill is to ensure safe access to termination of pregnancy services.<\/p> <p>  Since 2019, when the termination of pregnancy service commenced within participating maternity units and general practices across Ireland, there have been periodic reports of demonstrations and anti-abortion group gatherings outside facilities providing termination of pregnancy services.  We are mindful of the distress, anxiety and damage to the health and well-being of those subjected to such protests, which risk, in some instances, deterring women from accessing the medical care they need.  This is particularly true considering such demonstrations often disproportionately affect the most marginalised and vulnerable sections of our society.  In light of these incidents and cognisant of their impact on service users and providers, the Minister for Health is committed to delivering on the programme for Government, which promises to \"establish exclusion zones around medical facilities\".  In furtherance of this objective, the aim of this general scheme and its underlying policy is to protect the right of a woman to access a healthcare service safely, with privacy and dignity, and without facing unsolicited attempts to influence her decision.  It will also protect service providers and their staff in the course of their duties and responsibilities.  <\/p> <p>  We can all agree that it is in the public interest to ensure that healthcare services, including termination of pregnancy services, can be accessed safely and privately by those who need them, and this is what this general scheme proposes to deliver.  Primarily, this is achieved through the creation of safe access zones.  The proposals aim to establish a 100 m safe access zone around all healthcare facilities that can provide termination of pregnancy services, not just those that currently do, including, for example, all hospitals and GP practices.  This is to ensure that the legislation will not highlight the specific service sites where termination of pregnancy services are currently provided and will allow them to continue in relative anonymity.  Within those zones, conduct which is intended to, or may reasonably have the effect of, influencing the decision of a person in relation to availing of, or providing, services related to termination of pregnancy will be prohibited.  Head 4 sets out a comprehensive, though non-exhaustive, list of such behaviours.  The goal here is to ensure that conduct aimed at impeding access or influencing the decisions of service users or providers within these zones is addressed to the greatest extent possible to allow the legislation to deliver on its objectives.  In addition to these provisions, further protection is afforded by head 6.  This head aims to prevent, repeated behaviours amounting to intimidation or harassment, including campaigns aimed towards healthcare providers, irrespective of where they are committed.  The purpose here is to mitigate against the impact, that could arise from such conduct, on a service provider&rsquo;s choice to offer termination of pregnancy services.  It is also to ensure that the potential provision of termination of pregnancy services is maximised to the greatest extent, and to avoid disproportionate impacts on access to and provision of services geographically.  <\/p> <p>  However, in advancing these proposals, it is recognised that protecting the rights of service users and service providers must be balanced against protecting the rights of those engaged in legitimate protest.  In balancing the various rights involved, the general scheme restricts specified conduct, but also aims to limit the scope of such restrictions to that which is strictly necessary.<\/p><p>To this end, head 5 sets out specific exemptions that may apply in the context of prohibited conduct within safe access zones and the corresponding offences.  In doing so, this head also further acknowledges and promotes, on a proportionate basis, the balancing of various human and constitutional rights.  Critically, this head further makes clear that the Bill will not impede, impact on, prohibit or criminalise anything done by healthcare and other staff of the healthcare provider in the normal functions of the healthcare service.<\/p><p> The proposed legislation preserves the right to protest against abortion and speak out in favour or against it, apart from in the limited areas to be covered by safe access zones.  Additionally, to ensure an appropriate balance between countervailing rights, the Department has engaged with the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Data Protection Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties seeking any observations they may have on the proposals.<\/p><p> In regard to enforcement, it is essential An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be provided with relevant powers to manage and respond appropriately to offences under this general scheme, and these are mainly set out in head 7.  Overall, in keeping with the principle of proportionality, the general scheme provides for a graduated approach to enforcement to ensure that any restriction on rights is minimised.<\/p><p> Finally, head 8 sets out the penalties arising from offences under the scheme, which have been provided for on an escalating basis, where harsher penalties may apply at the discretion of the court for repeat offences.<\/p><p> The development of a dedicated, stand-alone safe access zones legislation will comprehensively address, and mitigate insofar as possible, the potential for a person's access to a termination of pregnancy to be impacted or influenced at the point of access.  It will provide additional assurance to healthcare providers that they will be afforded protections should their services become the target of specified conduct that could interfere with their service provision and staff.  In putting these protections in place, the legislation will deliver on a programme for Government commitment.  The Minister is anxious to see the Bill drafted as quickly as possible in order that it can be introduced to the Oireachtas, and the Department will continue to work closely with the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in drafting the final Bill, recognising all the complexities involved.<\/p><p> I thank committee members for their patience and attention.

I welcome our guests and thank them for their contribution to the legislation.  I am in two minds as to its effectiveness.  We have to go back to the original provisions of the legislation, the constitutional provisions and the legislation as published.  It was intended to address the issue whereby a service was available to women who wished to seek that service, at their discretion, under the assumption they could do so without appearing to be the target of anybody who feels they may be breaking the law.<\/p> <p>  I am not a supporter of abortion for abortion's sake and I do not think most people are, but what is at issue is whether women can access whatever services may require, or men either, for that matter, in all the public hospitals that are listed as providing the service, without being identified.  I foresee a problem in that the legislation, in trying to help, may find itself to be counterproductive.  By virtue of the exclusion zones, the identification of all such hospitals, centres, GPs and so on is going to be obvious to the protestor, and that is going to cause unnecessary pressure.  I do not know how effective the exclusion zones will be, how they will be managed and whether they will be respected.  In the US, they have not been successful; there have been constant pressures and attacks by groups of different mindsets.  As a result, women have been frightened by what has been put before them in the sense of protests, and that is understandable.  I accept what this legislation is trying to do, but I am not sure it will do what was intended.<\/p> <p>  I am not certain it is a good idea to identify areas where given services, such as terminations, are available because that merely does a favour for those who want to protest, and protesting may not be the only thing they want to do.  It could have serious consequences for the people the legislation is trying to protect.  My views on the subject are well known.  I am not certain, again judging by the experience in the US, which I have studied, that it is a good idea to identify the locations.  It is difficult to protect the people who need to use such services for whatever reason.  I am concerned we will find it is not possible to protect people, in which case the legislation will be seen to be weak and the protestors will achieve victory, for how long I do not know.  Whatever about the ready identification of hospitals and health centres where services under the legislation are available, I do not know how the enforcement of the 100 m ban can be applied, especially throughout the country and at different times.  Instead, I would emphasise the need to ensure that services, as envisaged under the legislation and supported by the referendum, are readily available to those who have a need to avail of them as and when required.<\/p> <p>  Various reasons have been put forward as to why there should be changes.  Some of the changes proposed might be for the better and others might not.  I was a member of the original committee that examined the issue and I voted for the changes, simply to improve and protect the services available to those who might need to avail of them and to remove any stigma or identification of their situation in order that they could confidentially avail of the services as and when they required.<\/p> <p>  I will vote for the legislation.  I am merely pointing out what I see as potential difficulties and I would like a response to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#B00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Many of the considerations the Deputy raised are very live in our work on the legislation.

We are determined to support their roll-out as envisaged as part of integrated care.

That in itself offers some protection.  No one can know the purpose of anyone's reason to access a health service so there is some privacy afforded there and we will not make the mistake of zoning in on those services that are currently providing termination of pregnancy services because we want the numbers providing these services to continue to grow as the service rolls out.

That applies to any service that might be sought in a hospital, health centre or wherever else.  There must be a fair amount of anonymity such that if a service becomes a target, or those who want to protest identify particular locations, then the failure to adhere to the constitutional approval and the legislative provisions is in question.

I wanted to make that point.<\/p> <p>  I move to the HSE submission.  I have a number of points to make because the context is important here and some people will ask why we need this legislation.  The HSE submission makes the reasons very clear because it refers to weekly, and sometimes monthly, anti-abortion protests outside maternity hospitals, mainly in Dublin, and also outside GP surgeries.  It refers to the display of religious imagery and messages, graphic images of foetuses and, in some instances, physical and verbal aggression.  No woman or person should be subject to any type of intimidation or physical or verbal aggression from anybody when entering a healthcare premises.  The fact that this is happening on a weekly or monthly basis is unacceptable.  The HSE submission also states some GPs are willing to provide the service but are concerned about potentially attracting protests.  Again, that is a reason we need this legislation.  It also refers to the potential for significant psychological impact on women.  I think we can all agree that if women are subject to harassment and intimidation, it will have a psychological impact on them.  The submission sets out very clearly why we need this legislation, as do the submissions from other organisations.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions on heads 4 and 6.  Head 4 refers to \"prohibited conduct\".  It seems to be the lesser of the charges.  Persons convicted - it is a summary conviction - of an offence under what would be prohibited conduct in head 4 are liable to a class E fine for a first offence, a class D fine for a second offence and a class C fine for a third offence.  What is \"prohibited conduct\" in the context of this head?

I will start by stating I fully support this legislation and certainly most members of the committee will do all they can to ensure its speedy passage when published.  There is no doubt that the current frequency of protests outside healthcare facilities is extremely disturbing and upsetting for people availing of services.  It is worth repeating that everyone in this country has a right to access all legal health services free from intimidation and harassment and that has to be the starting point.  The other aspect of this of course is that these protests have a very chilling effect on the provision of services, both in terms of GP and hospital services.  We have to remind ourselves that we still are at a very early stage in terms of the provision of abortion services on a countrywide basis in that currently, only 413 GPs have a contract for the provision of terminations.  We are still at a point where only 11 of the 19 maternity hospitals provide termination services.  There is a very long way to go and there is no doubt, particularly in rural areas, that the threat of protest does not encourage people - GPs or hospitals - to provide services.  That is why this legislation is absolutely necessary and we need to have it in place very quickly.<\/p> <p>  I will raise a number of issues with Mr. O'Connor about the heads of the legislation.  First is an issue that came up in feedback the organisation Together for Safety came across, namely, the need to ensure that industrial action is protected at hospitals and at GP surgeries.  To what extent has this been provided for and how does the Department intend to ensure this legislation does not cut across the right to industrial action, which is obviously a very basic right? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#D02000","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  She has summarised the reason for the legislation superbly well and we also are highly conscious, with the service being in its infancy, of the chilling effect.  The actual protests cause harm and distress but we think fear of protests is constraining the roll-out.<\/p><p>We are conscious of the incompleteness of the roll-out of services but encouraged by the trajectories.  Eleven of the 19 maternity hospitals are currently providing this service and we think there will be two or three more within a year or so.  Likewise, the 413 GPs mentioned are only one eighth of the total number of GPs in the country.  Again, the review by Marie O'Shea will look at geographical dispersion but, without breaching confidentiality, just to reassure us and see what we can do to support the services.<\/p><p> On industrial action, the Department took a view that protests by staff and the trade union or other related industrial action is not within the scope of prohibited conduct under the proposed legislation.  We feel that it is unlikely that such activities would fall within the scope of head 4(2) as such activity is not intended or could not reasonably have the effect of influencing a person's decision to access termination of pregnancy, to interfere with a person's access or the provision of a termination of pregnancy service.  I can very clear state that it is absolutely not the policy intent to prohibit industrial action within the safe access zones.

There is no point in having legislation on the books unless it is clearly enforceable from a practical perspective.  One of the concerns to arise is that under the proposed legislation, in order for an offence to be committed under head 4(7), a person must have been previously issued with a warning pursuant to head 4(5).  It is very hard to get one's head around how that would work in practical terms so please talk us through that.  What about record keeping?

I thank the Department's staff for working so hard on this legislation, progressing it and engaging with the Seanad Bill that came through.  It is worthwhile saying at this stage that this is incredibly complex legislation and the Department must strike the right balance.  As much as I want this legislation to be enacted urgently, and we must seek to have this done by Christmas, I am very aware that we must be quite delicate with the legislation and make sure that we do this work correctly.<\/p> <p>  I want to discuss the reality of enforcement and, funnily enough, I want to talk about the word \"curtilage\".  Any architect in the State will know the word well as it is very well set out in our conservation legislation.  I have a concern around how we might treat the grounds and decide where 100 m begins, and how the service provider engages on the issue.  Many of our older health service buildings are on land that looks almost institutional so they have gates and a carpark.  So if we set this at the entrance then 100 m will still allow people to be directly outside a hospital, for example.  That is the nature of our estates and healthcare buildings in this country.  It might be worth looking at the definition of curtilage in other legislation but certainly it is meaningful in terms of planning and other issues.<\/p><p>I would like to talk a little bit about that.<\/p><p> I would also like the witnesses to talk about the responsibility of the healthcare provider in deciding where the 100 m is, even with the curtilage or the front door.  Are healthcare providers or GPs expected to draw a line on the ground, as when we were queueing for a shot during Covid, or will the Garda take on that role?  Within that, I also have a concern around some of the requirements if service providers continue to see people outside.  I am wary of anything that relies on a service provider to report because, ultimately, the service provider staff might have their own opinions about these issues.  A lot of responsibility would be put on the service provider.  Perhaps we could start with all of these issues around the implementation part of this.<\/p><p> I am glad that the HSE is talking with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At the beginning, groups like Together for Safety have been engaged in this conversation.  There has been a statement from the Garda that we do not need this legislation and I am interested to see whether maybe it cannot be enforced, which is an issue.  I wonder where that change happened.  I am asking all of the questions at once and hopefully the witnesses can answer them.<\/p><p> I also want to know about inclusive language within the text.  I would like to see a recognition of pregnant people rather than just women.  This affects families and people of every group.<\/p><p> The Department has outlined this a little bit but I would like to know about the definition of \"intimidation, harassment and aggression\".  There is a gender issue here.  I believe it came up in conversations with the Garda regarding what people define for themselves as intimidation.  Often it is not engagement in any way.  One does not have to reach out to somebody or offer them a leaflet to intimidate them.  One can intimidate another person just by being a presence.  I would like quite a broad interpretation of that.  Under head 6, is there engagement about persistent harassment on social media for service providers, many of whom are on social media?  I am sorry that I have thrown some tough questions at the officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#E02000","speaker":"1559","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.

Thank you for letting me in, Chairman.  I want to pick up on the last point first.  In January, it will be four years since the legislation to allow women to procure abortion in Ireland was enacted.  Straight away, when it was passed in 2019, there were pickets and protests outside GP surgeries and doctors' clinics.<\/p><p>The legislation was passed in the spirit of many promises that were given, some of which are still being enacted such as the provision of free contraception and looking at free sex education in schools so that as a whole package, the need for intervention in crisis pregnancy will be undermined but crisis pregnancy will also be able to be dealt with.<\/p><p> Four years is a long time to have something that was shadowed in the legislation, that is, the provision of safe access zones, not even being close to being passed yet.  This has been said by many Deputies and Senators but the question of urgency cannot be overemphasised.  This will not be passed before January 2023.  I am quite sure of that from hearing what the witnesses have said, which means that four years on, we do not have safe access zones.  That is very worrying.  To repeat what has been said, this has a chill effect on the provision of services.  We have seen this particularly in parts of the west and north-west of Ireland.  We hear accounts of GPs pulling out of delivering the service or being on the list of those willing to deliver because of threats of intimidation and fear.  There was an account of a GP in the west of Ireland whose home was actually threatened.  This GP lived near work and was providing the services.  Threats were made all the time to this person and their family when going to and coming from school and carrying out normal day-to-day things like shopping.  It is really important that a strong signal is sent out that there is an urgency about the legislation.  There is a proposal of some kind of public awareness campaign about the legislation.  Perhaps Mr. O'Connor could talk a little bit about that.  I would emphasise that issue of urgency and trying to get a time from the Department as to when we will see this through.<\/p><p> There is the question of the right of confidentiality for women who will be seen by protestors going in and out.  Many of them would be in abusive relationships, for example, so they need to keep their own affairs private.  This is all the time under threat when we do not have these safe access zones.  The question of this providing a chill effect to the provision of services is not just something that happens in Ireland.  The World Health Organization recognises this and has done research on it.  I want to really emphasise that.<\/p><p> One thing I want to ask, which others have also asked about, is the question of industrial relations activity.  Mr. O'Connor can go back over the argument again that it is not perceived to be under that particular heading where industrial relations activity is prohibited.  Sometimes, however, industrial relations activity is unofficial and would, therefore, be perceived by an employer as being illegal.  We need to be careful about this.  It would still be industrial relations activity albeit unofficial and seen as illegal, which may then fall foul of this legislation.   Therefore, we should go back to having the specific clause that excludes any kind of strike or protest activity by cleaners, doctors, nurses or health workers of any sort inside an abortion care setting.  We will be proposing that and we will try to amend the legislation accordingly.  I would love to see it coming from the Department, however.<\/p><p> I am kind of baffled as to why the Department did not go along with the Bill that was going through the Seanad.  We would have had this much earlier had we co-operated with the Bill going through the Seanad and looked at maybe amending, changing or adding to it rather than taking this length of time.<\/p><p> I am concerned, as are others, about the definition of \"curtilage\" and whether a car park or playground nearby or whatever is included in the definition.  I am also concerned about how protests will be controlled.  It is true that protests of this nature do not have to be in your face or all over people shouting and roaring at them.  It can be carrying an abusive or disgraceful symbol or whatever, as frequently happened outside the gates of the D&aacute;il during the course of the debate around the eighth amendment.  We need to get much more clarity on what we are talking about here.  I have one or two more questions but I will come back to Dr. O'Connor on those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#G03000","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy very much.  I can assure the committee of the urgency with which the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnolly, regards this.  He has prioritised it in the autumn schedule.  The Deputy is right; it was something initially intended and envisaged to be encompassed within the 2018 legislation.  It ran into complexity and there was an imperative to progress that Bill with a view to establishing the services.  The chill effect is something about which we are deeply conscious.  It is a delicate time in the roll-out of new services, in a sense, and the Deputy referred to issues about the geographical distribution of services.  The particular chill effect that can occur in maybe a rural setting is something about which we are very conscious.  It is part of the intention of the Bill to create a safe environment in which services can be delivered.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is so right about people's privacy and dignity.  It can be a very difficult and vulnerable time in people's lives when they need to access medical services.  It is so vitally important for their dignity that their privacy and safety is protected in accessing those services.<\/p> <p>  We are so immersed in the drafting that we have not thought yet about a public awareness campaign but it is actually a very important thing that we will do.  We will engage now with colleagues who can help us in that regard.  We have some excellent colleagues in the women's health division in our press and communications section so we will take that on board.  I thank the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  On confidentiality, one of the excellent policy decisions made by the D&aacute;il in 2018 was the incorporation of these services as part of an integrated set of primary care, GP and hospital services.  We do not have the American-style abortion clinic, as such, as a real focal point.  The purpose of any visit by any private individual to a health facility cannot be known.  There is confidentiality.  As the Deputy said, however, absolutely, we do not want people accessing those legally provided health services feeling any discomfort or distress arising from protests in the vicinity of the services.<\/p> <p>  Our policy intent is clear on industrial relations activity.  We absolutely do not seek to undermine industrial relations activity.  I take the Deputy's point that it is not always official and can be spontaneous and unofficial.  We will absolutely work to ensure that all types of industrial relations activity by any workers are not encompassed or undermined in any part of the country.  We are looking at whether that might be a specific clause or exemption, which might be necessary, or else the prohibited behaviours within the zone will be refined to a place where they can clearly not be presumed to encompass industrial activity.  I hear that the Deputy's advice is to get specific on an exemption in relation to it, however.<\/p> <p>  We can absolutely see such similarity with the Private Members' Bill in many ways.  We are deeply grateful to Senator Gavan and all the Senators and Deputies who contributed to that.  Members will see it is evident that our current scheme builds on their work in the area in many respects.  However, it is acknowledged that legislating the area is complex and challenging from the perspective of balancing competing constitutional rights.  All the work we are doing now is work that is always necessary with any legislative vehicle.  That Private Members' Bill helped us greatly and we have built on it in the work we are doing now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Muiris O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":403,"content":"<p>To conclude, I am glad that has been acknowledged but I am concerned about the repeated expression of the words \"complex\" and \"difficult\" in the discussion of and approach to this legislation.  We are not reinventing the wheel.  Many countries have safe access zones.<\/p><p>The World Health Organization, WHO, has done research on this subject.  It is not like we are taking something brand new and we must be terribly careful about it because it is so complex.  It is not that complex.  Once we get the co-operation of all the players involved, especially An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it should not be a complex matter.  We already have, for example, laws like the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, where garda&iacute; can go up to people and tell them to stop what they are doing, not to stand somewhere and to move on.  If the people concerned do not do so, they can then be arrested under the auspices of that Act.  It cannot be so complex that it has taken us so long to do this.  I will finish with that comment, and by repeating, as others have done, that there is an urgency for this legislation to come through.  It sends out such a bad signal and it is having a chilling effect on what is already a fragile service, especially in parts of rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#H00300","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Muiris O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I welcome all the witnesses.

I agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith when she says that we should not overly complicate this and that there is existing legislation on public order offences that are quite similar.  However, at the same time, we should accept that it is complex.  There was a lot of discussion between the Department of Justice and the Attorney General.  How I would see it is that any legislation is obviously subject to legal challenge.  I think we can safely bet that there are organisations which will challenge this legislation in the courts.   For that purpose, I think it is really important that all the i's are dotted and all the t's are crossed, and that it is robust.  That is really important.  We do not want a situation where it is challenged in court and a judge decides that it is unconstitutional.  The more that we can be explicit and clear in terms of what the Bill does, and should do, the better.  Ensuring the balance of rights in it and that it is primarily motivated towards helping people and women is the right approach.  I accept that.<\/p> <p>  On the different submissions we have received, three issues have come up in over half of the submissions, which I think this committee should support.  The first one that has been raised is to recommend the clause to exclude from the ambit of the Bill anything done in the course of industrial action, within the meaning of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  While I acknowledge that Mr. O'Connor has dealt with that, it is something we should do.  The second is to place an obligation on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to maintain a record of warnings, and the language used in the Bill should be \"shall\" and not \"may\".  That is important from an enforcement perspective.  When we see the submission from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we will see what it says but I think that is really important.  I have some experience of this in local areas where there has been antisocial behaviour in communities.  It can be quite difficult for local authorities to prosecute in such cases.  The only way they have been able to do it is through proper recordkeeping, whereby a process is put in place where complaints are made and then registered.  Where there are records of persistent complaints, the judge can look at the overall picture, as opposed to one individual case.  That is important, and we should look at the same sort of process there.  That is a second recommendation that is consistent across many of the submissions we have received.  The third concerns inclusive language, which I think we would all agree on.  Mr. O'Connor has outlined practical issues in relation to it but I think we need to come back to it.  If those three areas could be accommodated within the Bill, it would go a long way towards helping us in our work.<\/p> <p>  I want to come back to the issue of enforcement and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If I were to make a recommendation, and I will, in terms of how we proceed in our work, I think we need to hear directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I think we should hold a hearing and invite representatives of the Garda in.  We will have a private session later, in which we will discuss our next steps.  For me, that seems to be the most logical approach because at the end of the day, there is broad consensus, as far as I can see, from all of the submissions in relation to the purpose of the Bill and its intent.  I outlined some of the recommendations that have been made to strengthen it.  The one area where we need to get it right is in enforcement, for all the reasons I outlined earlier as well.  I think it is important that we hear directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and not simply receive a submission.  <\/p> <p>  Looking at head 7, and the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, just so that people are clear on exactly what is being proposed, it states \"A person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a direction under subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence.\"  It goes on to state \"A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may arrest without warrant a person whom the member has reasonable cause for believing is committing or has committed an offence under the Act.\"  It also states that if it is felt that a person who is approached by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in contravention of the Act, if it becomes an Act, that person will be obliged to state his or her name and address.  If the person does not, that is an offence.  It seems to me to be quite clear what the powers are.  It then depends on whether An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na believes it can actually enforce the powers, which, from the Department's communications, seems to be the case.  However, I believe it is important for us to talk it through.<\/p> <p>  There are issues in relation to the confiscation of electronic devices and other equipment or material.  There are many explicit areas here where it makes clear what an offence is, which I am pleased about.  However, the more explicit we can be, and the less subjective, the better.  I have a concern about us trying to broaden out some of the terms, such as \"harassment\".  I get why people would advocate for it but my concern is that if we are too broad, it would be problematic if there was a legal challenge.  I am deeply conscious of that.  We know that there are people who do not want this Bill to progress.  They have their right to do that and are entitled to their own opinions; I am not taking that away from them.  However, as someone who wants the Bill to pass, I want it to be legally sound.<\/p> <p>  That was not really a question as such, it was more to make the point that this has been a useful session.  I believe we can help and support the Department in progressing this legislation as quickly as possible.  However, I do not think we can do our work and conclude pre-legislative scrutiny until we hear directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is my sense of it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#K00400","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":438,"content":"<p>That will be a decision that is made after the meeting.

It is recognised that protecting the rights of service users must be balanced against protecting the rights of those engaged in legitimate protest.
