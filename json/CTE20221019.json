Taken together they outline the array of concerns the organisations have about the EU nature restoration regulations.  I have a number of questions.  I will ask them all and perhaps each of the organisations can respond to whichever questions are most pertinent to them.  I hope that will allow other members to have an equal opportunity.<\/p> <p>  In the first instance could the farming organisations give us a sense of what the implications of this regulation are for their members as it currently stands in draft form?  That would be welcome.<\/p> <p>  Members may or may not be aware a discussion is ongoing about evidence this committee heard last week on the interpretation of Article 9.  It specifically arises, and the context given was the Bord na M&oacute;na rewetting, as regards whether there will be a limit on non-agricultural, or it being capped, in terms of its impact on peatlands.  It has been suggested to the committee that the cap is 20%.  Regardless of how much other land is incorporated, farmers would be expected to make up 80% regardless of what else happens in society.  I am aware that all the organisations have independent advice and guidance and are experienced in interpreting EU law.  Therefore, it would be useful for this committee to get a sense of their interpretation of that article.<\/p> <p>  The third issue I would like some of the representatives touch on is the aspect of international trade.  There has been an increase in discussions on the implications of trade and how the trade deals agreed at EU level fit into obligations and regulations applied to Irish and European farmers.  In respect of this regulation, which could have far reaching consequences, do the witnesses have any view on how it could be applied in the context of implementing existing and agreeing new trade deals with third countries that do not apply the same level of regulation to peatlands?<\/p> <p>  My final question is based on the witnesses' knowledge and experience of dealing with EU institutions and EU regulations.  Do they believe this regulation will be implemented in its current guise or what scope can they see for amendments?  Have any of the organisations had contact with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications that will be responsible for negotiating the position at Commission level?  If so, can they outline the feedback they received and where they believe this is going?  Considering at least one member state of the EU has already voiced an objection, do the witnesses think it is likely that other objections will follow?  Should the Irish Government lodge an objection to this regulation or is there scope to amend it to address their concerns?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#B00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I will respond to the Deputy's first and perhaps fourth questions.<\/p> <p>  Impact assessment is the key issue.  We are asking the Government to make a commitment that some form of impact assessment will be done before it is too late.  It is my understanding that much of this will begin to happen in November.  The first piece will be rolled out in November.  Critically an assessment must be done at national level to fully measure its implications.  We have heard different figures and totals for different types and amounts and of land, but we do not know.  We are unfortunately living in a vacuum.  I suggest the first thing the Government needs to do is assess the impact of its potential.<\/p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Geraldine O'Sullivan, to respond to the Deputy's second and third questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I will follow up on what Mr. O'Brien said about the impact.  We have clarity on the drained peatlands.  We have some figures and we understand that is a measure under agriculture.  The issue we are concerned about is under Article 4 which applies to restoration and the wider enhancement and re-establishment of habitats.  That is where we lack clarity about the impact of this regulation and that is why the full impact assessment is essential.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's comment about Article 9 and the cap of 20%, it is also our understanding that 80% of the measure will be the responsibility of farmers who must rewet and restore that area.  In examining the regulations, it occurs to me that we need to move that measure from Article 9 to Article 4 because that is where the wider landscape is considered.  The responsibility for the measure will not then only be on farmers.  One is looking the wider landscape and at letting the member state to determine which areas are best suited to that kind of restoration.  That should be moved out of Article 9 and should not be the responsibility of farmers.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's comments about the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, we met with the environmental committee in the Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations, COPA, yesterday.  The farming organisations of all member states are concerned about the implications of this.  Some member states have carried out analysis and found the impact on production and farming goes far beyond what they initially thought it would.  I cannot stress enough that we need to understand the land area and cost involved as well as how it will be managed and resourced at a national level.  If this is a legally binding target and if we miss the target by a small percentage, we are potentially open to a legal challenge.  This cannot be pushed forward without an understanding of the extent of what is required and the costs associated with it.<\/p> <p>  In drafting this regulation, it was identified that the reason the biodiversity targets were not achieved was that there was a lack of funding and resources.  That was a key reason previous biodiversity targets were not achieved.  It is thought that CAP will fund this regulation.  CAP does not have the ability to do so.  If this regulation is pushed through, we need to see a dedicated funding mechanism for biodiversity and nature restoration and it must be fully costed and understood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I will try not to be repetitive.  Deputy Carthy asked a question about implications for our members.  It will devalue our land.  It has the potential to sterilise.  We saw that in the past with the hen harrier when there was a small incentive under the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, but they disappeared after a short time.<\/p><p>There is a huge fear there, as was alluded to by others.  An impact assessment needs to be done to get a handle on its implication for farm families.  It could undermine their viability.  Ultimately, it could lead to a move away from the land.  One thing that struck me when I was involved in the Food Vision group was when it brought in a department official from Northern Ireland and his one fear regarding biodiversity was that there would be land abandonment.  It is the greatest threat to biodiversity and something to be borne in mind.<\/p><p> On international trade and this regulation, how concerned are our EU negotiators when they are involved in trade talks with Mercosur countries?  What questions are they asking on the environment?  Are we playing on a level playing field?  These are things I would be extremely sceptical about.  That leaves us at a severe disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McCormack","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>To follow on from Mr. McCormack's comments, Deputy Carthy asked about the implications for our members.  If you look at history and what happened in the birds and habitats directive, we have members across the country whose land was substantially devalued by the implementation of that regulation.  They have seen their land sterilised and the next generation move away from farming for the simple reason that they could not develop their farms.  That was 15% of the land area in this country.  To be quite honest, the treatment of farmers under that was horrendous.  People were treated very poorly under the habitats and birds directive.  It would not give farmers confidence that they are going be treated any better in the future.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the 20%, we have concerns about that.  If you read the European Commission's document, it states that these measures should cover at least 20% of the EU land and sea areas by 2030, and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050.  It is 20% up to 2030.  After that, as far as I am aware, there is no limit.  To be fair to farmers out there, they are certainly engaging in environmental issues, but to be quite honest, the way they are being treated at the moment and the raft of regulations coming on them is making it very difficult for farmers to engage constructively with such regulations.<\/p> <p>  On whether it will be agreed in its current guise, from our perspective, we hope it will not be.  The reality today is that the CAP has effectively been hijacked; it is trying to turn the CAP into an environmental policy.  It is completely underfunded for what is required under environmental matters.  We would say very clearly that if we want to have nature restoration, we need to work with farmers, not against them.  At the moment, the direction in which this policy is going is working against farmers as opposed to working with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Enright"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  I will highlight a couple of issues that came to light in the course of reading the document and engagements we have had with CEJA at European level.  A lot of the focus in this committee in the previous hearing was around peatlands and drained peatlands.  When you delve down into the detail of the document, it references aspects that will affect every single farmer in the country.  I would like to bring the committee's attention to some of them.  The first point mentioned earlier was about restoration of peatlands.  It references, loosely, the word \"restoration\" on many occasions in the document.  Under Article 4, the only definition that contains a restoration measure is rewetting.  That is the only option there currently for the restoration of peatlands.  There is a piece at the end of the document that refers to Article 12.  It outlines the restoration plans and their implementation.  I bring the committee's attention to a piece on the reporting national governments must do.  It states that an indication of the subsidies which negatively affect the achievement of the targets and the fulfilment of the obligations set out in the regulation must be reported back to the Commission on the occurrence of each reporting period.  I do not know whether our question can be answered but could a negative subsidy mean that if the subsidies we give farmers under the likes of our dairy calf to beef scheme, beef schemes, CAP payments or basic payment are deemed to be supporting agricultural activities, which are not in unison with the objectives of this, put those payments to farmers at risk?<\/p> <p>  The second point, which is applicable to all farmers, comes as one of the main seven objectives of the overall document around point 3, which outlines to the following issues.  It outlines that in agricultural ecosystems, the overall increase in biodiversity must be measured and there must be a positive trend for the grassland butterflies to farmland birds, but the main point here is the stock of organic carbon in cropland mineral soils, which refers to all cropland soils in the country.  If the trend is not positive for soil organic carbon in all of those soils, what are the implications for all farmers?  If the trend is in the wrong direction, does that mean they are going to be penalised or that they will have to introduce restoration measures that are not defined within the document?<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was around trade.  At the moment farmers in the EU and Ireland are being put through enhanced measures, if that is what you want to call them, in terms of eco schemes and biodiversity to meet the objectives of the Green Deal.  However, we have other players in international markets who are supplying products competing with European products within our market.  We are speaking about putting further restrictions on the ability of agriculture and farmers to produce food, while potentially importing food from third countries which are not keeping pace with us, even with the gap they are at.  That gap is widening.  From the point of view of a farmer producing food in Europe and in Ireland, it does not make any sense for a young person or any farmer in that context to be embracing the measures that are set out in all of these environmental practices and so forth, which are very beneficial, while the EU on the other hand is agreeing trade deals with third countries that will not be implementing the same standards.<\/p> <p>  Before I ask Mr. Hanrahan to comment, the final point to round off all of the discussions that we will have today is on the importance of securing certainty for young people to enter the sector.  That is something which cannot be lost on the committee or the stakeholders within the industry.  Given the uncertainty around the future in certain sectors and the future in relation to the implementation of some measures in the new CAP and under the biodiversity measures, a serious investigation and assessment are needed on the impact of this on the whole industry and on any measures brought forward and the impact they are going to have on securing a future for young people in the sector, not just in Ireland as it is a problem across the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>To follow on from Mr. Keane's point, first, we need to have clarity around the accurate measurement methodologies for carbon sequestration.  Otherwise, we do not know what we are here to try to set out to achieve.  Second, if it is implemented, we want clarity around the timeline duration and the funding and proposals and what benefits there are for farmers, if any.  Also, any restoration should be carried out through landowner agreement, not designation.  There is a need for clarity on the implications for adjoining landowners and in the case of rewetting land.  It does not just impact our members or the members of the other organisations here; it impacts all of rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Hanrahan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>There was a reference to moving land out of Article 9 and into Article 4.  That would remove it from agricultural activity, I believe.  Article 4 is not defined as agricultural land; it is defined as habitat.  Depending on how hill land is going to be defined in this restoration directive, it is going to have serious consequences for that land because Article 4 is not about agricultural land, whereas Article 9 is about restoration of agricultural ecosystems.  Article 4 states that there is going to be a re-establishment of areas not covered by those habitats.  That means there will be a reversal of improved hill lands.  Everyone knows that if you improve hill land, it will a costly exercise but reversing it will be extremely costly.  How are those costs going to be met?<\/p><p>This will be a legally imposed target.  We cannot see a funding stream identified anywhere in this document.  There is plenty of funding for developing ecologists and administrative staff in Europe but we cannot see any funding for the type of cost that will be imposed on farmers to meet this legal requirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Condon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Condon for that.  To cover Deputy Carthy's points, on the first question on the implications for our members and for all farmers, we would have major concerns.  We would see it not as just a rewetting and a farming issue of farming.  There is a property rights' issue here if EU legislation can dictate what happens with one's property and if it can insist that one has to rewet it.  This is different from what is happening with the designations because they told one what one cannot do.  This is not only going to tell one what one cannot do but it is also going to tell one what one has to do.  That has clear implications for property rights and we need to be very aware of that.  That is not just with farming.  Once we start to impinge on property rights as regards farmland, we have to ask the question as to where that stops.  We need to be clear on that.<\/p> <p>  As regards Deputy Carthy's question on international trade, when he asked that question I was thinking about whether we are going to expect farmers to rewet land and take large areas of land out of agricultural use while at the same time trading with Brazil where more rainforests are cut away.  That does not make sense.  Maybe it makes sense to people at EU level if they want to sell Audis or other things to Brazil.  There is that trade side of things.  From our point of view, it cannot and should not happen.<\/p> <p>  On the implementation of this at EU level, first, when one looks at the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and I know we had differing views here on CAP, approximately 70% of what was originally proposed by the Commission was in the final CAP plan.  Approximately, 30% was changed.  What we have to think about here is the 70% that is there, if that is where we end up.  We need to make sure the harder elements are taken out.  I would like to think that this would not happen at all but I am also a realist and I know that maybe we will have to find a landing ground in there.  <\/p> <p>  As regards the member state, we have asked that this committee turns this down and passes a motion stating it will not entertain it and put pressure back on the Cabinet.  As to whether that will happen, we hope it will happen but I do not know if the committee has the power to do that.  It will be down to what flexibility member states get.  The CAP allowed for a certain level of flexibility.  Will that flexibility be in this as well?  I will finish on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Roddy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The implications are very serious for farmers.  I point the committee to Article 9(4) which refers to peatlands.  We are talking here about peatlands that have been reclaimed and that are in many cases productive agricultural land.  It has set out that by 2030, 30% of such areas will require restoration measures, of which one quarter will be rewetted.  It goes to 50% of such areas by 2040, of which at least half shall be rewetted, and 70% of such areas by 2050, of which at least half shall be rewetted.  That is a substantial impact.  Then there is the wider story of restoration measures for 20% of all agricultural land, and ultimately all ecosystems, by 2050.  We are talking about a substantial implication for much of the land in the country.  That is the first critical point.<\/p> <p>  This regulation is full of complexity and ambiguity.  Our concern would be that there has been no engagement with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on this with farm organisations to date.  This is part of a bigger pattern that troubles us whereby grandiose plans emerge from Brussels based on headline figures.  If we roll back a bit, this goes back to the EU biodiversity strategy where essentially a bit of horse-trading at Brussels-level led to a target of 30% of land being designated, one third of which would have strict protection on it.  These kind of ideals are being set at a high level without any understanding even at high levels within the member state.  We have asked the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine what this means and the truth of the matter is that it is not clear.  When we come back to this particular off-shoot of the EU biodiversity strategy, the proposed nature restoration regulation, we understand the Minister is minded to be supportive of it but we do not know on what basis and what discussion has been held at Government level to justify that particular position.  Our view would be that Ireland should, in the best traditions of EU negotiations, start out with a hostile antipathy to this because this has profound implications.  <\/p> <p>  Economic impact assessment was mentioned earlier.  That is absolutely essential.  There are financial implications of this, which are quite immense.  One figure I heard was 870,000 acres of peatland.  With land at &euro;10,000 per acre, that is &euro;8.7 billion worth of land potentially transformed from productive agriculture to less productive or non-productive.  This is big money.  The document itself suggests that the administrative costs for this are &euro;14 billion.  If the bureaucrats administering it are going to spend &euro;14 billion, can one imagine what the cost implication will be for our members whose farming activities are going to be totally decimated and whose land is going to be completely devalued?<\/p> <p>  Our concern is that the history of designation has been a lamentable one where for a long number of years people with designation had no scheme to compensate them in any way for the implications of it.  For example, we had the hen harrier farmers but there were many others as well.  Originally, there were National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, schemes.  They were then defunded.  The agri-environmental schemes were totally and utterly not fit for purpose for the people who had designations.  For those reasons, farmers are terrified of what is potentially coming down the track on this.  The key thing we want to say for a start is that there must be proper analysis of this and engagement between the Government and the stakeholder representatives before we go anywhere.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Deputy Carthy's question about international trade deals, an interesting point here is that when the Mercosur deal was done certain caveats were put in which essentially said that countries like Brazil would not do any further damage to rainforests or take further measures that would further damage their climate change situation.  It is interesting that we now have a new piece of legislation, a regulation, coming in at EU level that was probably not foreseen when the Mercosur deal was negotiated.  If one was to try to apply the logic that has been applied to European farmers, one should say that the equivalent in Brazil would be to look at all of the rainforests that were cut down over the past 70 years and tell them they have to restore them.  That would be the equivalent to what is being asked of European farmers for a start.  That is not going to happen because it is not provided for in the Mercosur deal.<\/p> <p>  The point is that we are hamstringing our farmers more and more in Europe and we have no possible way of putting equivalent conditions on trade deals that have now been signed and sealed although not delivered yet, and there is a long pattern of that.  That is what we would have to say to start with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Punch"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will make a comment now.

There has been much mention here of impact assessment statements but from a food production perspective, and playing devil's advocate, if this were to end up as is being predicted, what impact would it have on European and Irish food security and on forestry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#E00400","speaker":"1651"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Would Mr. O'Brien like to answer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#E00500","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>On Deputy Collins's questions, unfortunately, the two answers are \"No\" and \"No\".  We have had absolutely no consultation from anybody on this and on what it is going to look like.  As all of the farming organisations have said, we need an impact assessment done immediately because at this stage many of us are flying fairly blind.  We are dealing with big legislation coming from Europe.  We do not know how much our own Departments have fully analysed this, but most certainly the impact assessments will need to be carried out because the financial damage this could possibly do to our rural community and our farmers is absolutely appalling.  That is really the most important thing from that is to say the answer is \"No\" and \"No\" unfortunately.  That is something we would like clarified.<\/p> <p>  On food security, and Senator Daly's question was about food production, if we are actively being asked to reduce our agricultural production activity on a piece of ground, obviously that will have an impact on food production.  This is something that we need to fully analyse.  Ultimately, as an industry, 140,000 farmers are farming and are depending on their income from agriculture.  If we are actively asking them to reduce farming activity, no matter what the figure will be, whether it is 10,000 farmers or 40,000 farmers, we do not know until this impact assessment is done.  If we are asking them to desist from agricultural production, then the only financial mechanism that look to be in place at this moment in time is CAP funding.  We are asking them to actively devalue their land as a result to receive CAP funding.  That is fundamentally flawed in our view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Would Mr. McCormack like to speak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#E00700","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Collins, there was a serious deficit as regards consultation with the various stakeholders.  As regards a cost analysis, as I said in response to Deputy Carthy, we need to see an impact assessment in place because it has a huge impact on the potential viability of a farm for the future generations, or maybe for a period of time where there needs to be an income for both generations in advance of a transfer.<\/p> <p>  As regards Senator Daly's question on food security and food production both within Ireland and the EU, we have seen over the last couple of years, initially with Covid and then with war in Ukraine, that food security was an issue.  It was the one thing that was scarce on the shelves in our shops and supermarkets.  It would potentially have a huge impact on our ability as a nation, as primary producers initially, to maintain production or output.  It would not be possible.

There is a bigger question here in terms of the economic assessment, which will be carried out on what effect it will have on farmers.  The bigger question, from a rural economy point of view, is that if you take the land area being talked about out of productive capacity, what effect will that have on the wider business circle that supports farming communities?  There is going to be an impact on your local co-ops, your local garage man, your local feed merchant and your local vet, who we will be speaking about later  A figure was mentioned earlier by Mr. Eddie Punch of 871,000 acres or thereabouts having to be rewetted.  That is an area a little smaller than the size of Tipperary.  If you want an impact assessment of the food that is produced out of the county of Tipperary, I think there is &euro;1 billion worth of exports of dairy alone from Tipperary.  In terms of an impact assessment, it is not very difficult to figure out what impact that is going to have on the country as a whole.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the impact on food and on forestry, and coming back to an earlier question Deputy Carthy asked, in terms of objections raised, I think Sweden and Finland are the only two countries that raised an objection.  The Swedish have carried out an assessment which shows that this will impact on 30% of their land area, from which nearly the majority of their forestry is supplied, and that is one of the major economic drivers in that country.  Naturally, at a time of high input prices and when wood-related products are scarce, they are concerned about that.  Similarly in Ireland, if you are looking at it from a food security point of view, we have no definition or indication as to what soil types are going to be affected or the areas it is going to be in.  Is it going to be tillage, is it going to be dairy or is it going to be beef?  What impact is that going to have not just in this country but in terms of international exports?<\/p> <p>  There is a huge task to be done by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  To follow up on a comment made in terms of funding, many different funding streams have been mentioned.  I think there are 12 potential funding streams laid out in the document.  However, the only funding stream committed to is &euro;100 billion for the implementation of biodiversity measures.  This may give members an insight into the foresight and support from the origins of this document not just for the agricultural sector but for rural economies if the single line item referring to funding is dedicated solely to ensuring biodiversity measures as opposed to the economic impact it is going to have on landowners.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Liam Hanrahan wants to make a brief comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>To follow on from Mr. Keane on the food security point of view, we farm in west Clare where there is a large amount of low lying flat land, including peatland.

It is interesting that the document states a public consultation process took place.  That is listed.  An online survey was conducted between January and April 2021 and 111,000 replies were received.  It is interesting that 97% were in favour of more aggressive EU restoration targets.  The figure of 97% is close to the results of some of Vladimir Putin's referendums in Ukraine so I do not know how much attention we can pay to it.  When we talk about this, we must also recognise that what is being proposed will hard-wire the EU biodiversity strategy into legislation.  It is a massive document and has major implications for us, but no consultation has taken place on that.  It has been sitting there since May 2020.  We have tried to engage but it has been minimal.

It seems we are being told not to worry any more about generations of work.  Some of this land has been improved by maybe three or four generations and it is good agricultural fertile land today.  People's fathers and grandfathers worked the land to improve it.  It is shocking that 350,000 ha will be defined as in bad condition in Ireland.  The regulation wants to go back 70 years.  How can this be achieved without cutting food production and food security?  Is that to be cut back?<\/p> <p>  The ICSA is alarmed that no engagement with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has taken place.  There has been some discussion about the biodiversity strategy but none about this regulation on nature restoration.  How can the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications go gung-ho to Europe and support this?  I would like him to study the film \"The Field\" and Bull McCabe for his homework because that is not a fairly tale.  That is how strongly people feel about land they have reclaimed and improved over the years.  He ought to go and watch that film a few times so he can realise this is how strongly people feel.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, the ICSA is concerned that government representative groups are totally left out of the access to justice.  Where is the access to justice for farmers whose land will be taken away and restored or rewetted?  We should all be asked whether the Government is acting in the best interests of the Exchequer in agreeing to a clause that will tie the State up in legal actions for years to come.  It can fund all these NGOs and do all these things but it will tie up the Government for years in litigation.  In particular Article 16 will have to be refused or shot down in its current form.  Ireland needs to put up a big battle against this.  As my colleague said, we cannot take out arable land equivalent in size to Tipperary and turn it back into a bog or bad land.  That is land that has been improved over the past 70 or 80 years by generations of people.  People who do not realise the implication of what they are doing are making regulations.  I saw big drains being closed by flagstones.  That land was first improved by the current farmers' grandfathers many generations ago and now all that work is useless.  People cannot stand for this.

This is a complex and drawn-out process, as we all know, where consultation with stakeholders will presumably, or should, take place and will inevitably take place with environmental groups.

I am conscious that other members want to come in, so I am just going to make a few points.  I am reading a book at the moment about the ideas, aspirations and objectives of Davitt's Land League, which contains so many of the reoccurring themes we are talking about.  Last week we had the mushroom production sector in.  I talked to those involved and told them get political.  The next day I did three or four interviews with various journalists about it.  What I meant was that it was about time we got political.  It is great to see the farm organisations represented here because the harmony and the singing off the one hymn sheet does not always happen.  Irish farm organisations need to get political and I say that loud and clear.  For years they were highly organised, highly motivated, highly co-ordinated and the political establishment in Leinster House sat up and listened.  They were a force to be reckoned with.  They were a political organisation but somewhere in all of that, they become slightly watered down.  I see in front of me today a resolve, a strength and the ability and capacity to mobilise a national campaign.  That is when farm politics really matters and I would encourage the organisations to do that.  I just want to say that at the outset.  It is shocking in terms of communication but that in itself somewhat reflects on the political establishment, but that is the reality of it.  It is terrible that no full cost-benefit analysis has yet been carried out on the impact on large and small scale agriculture and on rural populations.  We hear so much about rural Ireland and the political commitment to rural communities but we have been talking about the water extraction Bill and about peat in horticulture, nursery stock, agriculture and in the mushroom sector again and now we are talking about this.  In a matter of days and weeks we are talking about ongoing issues and challenges that are attacking both the livelihoods and sustainability of farm incomes but, more important, of agricultural communities.  I do not need to lecture the organisations as they know this but I just want to let them know we are picking that up on this side.<\/p> <p>  I have read all the submissions and want to thank all the groups who made them.  Six recurring or common themes kept jumping off the pages of all the submissions and they were as follows.  There is a need for new funding outside of CAP.  The lack of financing has been identified as a key failure in the EU meeting its 2020 biodiversity targets.  The proposal lacks clear and long-term financial support for nature restoration with the majority of this expected to come from CAP funding itself, and there are some issues there.  Restoration can only be achieved if it is not dependent on CAP budget and is funded through a dedicated financial mechanism for biodiversity and restoration.  Long-term restoration requires long-term resources and not short-term measures, and I think we would all agree with that.  It is necessary that restoration is funded through a dedicated financial mechanism.<\/p> <p>  What I am saying is that we hear loud and clear what is being said.  The organisations should unite, mobilise and bring their cause to community halls up and down this country.  Put the leverage on the politicians, on the political establishment and the main political parties, the tripartite coalition Government, that is in place.  They will have to sit up and they will have to listen but, more important, they will be motivated politically to listen and to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#G00600","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Would Mr. O'Brien like to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#G00700","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>There were many questions from Deputy Fitzmaurice so I will pass them along to the IFA committee.

Regarding the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the question on phase one, as Ms O'Sullivan said, our understanding would be the sectoral target in the LULUCF.  We are looking at mapping and assessing peat soils.  I know Teagasc is currently doing so also.  This is a requirement under Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition, GAEC, 2.  We had a big battle on that a year ago because, as Mr. Condon referred to, there were proposals at EU level under CAP to take away the agricultural activity on peat soils.

We were happy to support that because the Burren is quite popular.  When we saw the detail of the proposal when it came out, we withdrew our support because, as was said, it talks about rewetting of peatlands and a number of other things.  Although I know some farmers have done quite well out of it, the other big issue with that particular scheme is the proportion of money that goes to the scheme on administration and environmentalists, as opposed to the money that is going to the farmers.  I think it is &euro;25 million but I could be wrong.  Out of &euro;25 million in total, I think there is something like only &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million going to farmers.

Perhaps Mr. Condon wants to think about that and come in on it.<\/p> <p>  We were asked when we became aware of it.  I think it was around early September.  It has been in the pipeline a while when you look at everything else and at what is happening regarding crossland use and the GAEC, 2.  A project was proposed by University of Galway around restoration of peatlands.  That specifically mentioned the removal of CAP payment from people who do not rewet lands.  This went out to Brussels at the time and would have been highlighted in some sectors.  I tried to find it on my phone.  We can share it with the members when we find it.

Farmers are going to look at this and see that it is not going to affect them now, and that is a concern.  It is a concern to try to motivate farmers and to recognise the real threat that there is.  Against that, restoration is not something that happens by clicking your fingers.  There is a lead-in time for that, so the fact that targets have been set is a clear problem.  It is not just about 2030 and 2050.  In order to deliver targets in 2030 and 2050, we are going to have to start implementing actions in a year or two years' time.  Farmers are going to see that.

According to an expert who gave evidence to this committee, emissions following the rewetting of formerly agricultural land can be very high and could persist for decades after rewetting.  Based on this evidence, an NGO could take a case that its right to a clean environment under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is being impaired by rewetting and that such rewetting of agricultural land is not compliant with prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources under Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

On Deputy Fitzmaurice's question around the land use change, I think we are in broad agreement about the procedures Ms O'Sullivan laid out and Mr. Enright spoke about.  Similarly, none of the details around what is going to happen regarding that have been imparted to us as of yet.<\/p> <p>  On the Burren Life project the Deputy spoke about, we have supported EIPs and investigations on that.  We also have some members involved but in terms of wider-scale support, we have not been involved.<\/p> <p>  On the impact of the 20% to achieve targets, our interpretation of that is quite black and white.  It is very clear within the regulation which states that of the maximum area that is to be rewetted, up to a maximum of 20% can be achieved from peat extraction points.  From our side, unless there is something to the contrary, it is fairly black and white that 20% can be taken from peat extraction points.  Currently, with 80,000 ha under Bord na M&oacute;na, that does not even meet 20% of the overall amount of land they are speaking about.  It is currently 352,000 ha.<\/p> <p>  We also have serious questions and concerns about Article 12, where it refers to the organic soil carbon content in all carbon soils and that it must have a positive trend.  I am not sure how anybody proposes to do that, when we are currently only doing the research that can tell us how much organic carbon is stored in our soils.  Teagasc has, I think, 15 or 20 different soil towers that are establishing that at the moment.  I am not sure about the timeline.  We have outlined in our document that there is talk of putting this into practice in 2024, to have plans in by the end of 2026 and to come into force in 2027.  The research by Teagasc will not be completed on a large scale even by that stage.  What are we basing the baseline measurement on?<\/p> <p>  The other question on the measurement implications is on the role other soils, aside from peatlands and so forth, will have in terms of reducing the impact on emissions and habitats.  As was rightly pointed out, how can one be sure that a measure conducted by one farmer does not affect the land outside the ditch?  The last time I checked and drained land at home, water did not know where the ditches were.  If Mr. Hanrahan is doing something on his land, how does it not negatively impact on my land right as well?<\/p> <p>  On the restoration question, there are no other definitions or references given for what restoration looks like other than rewetting.  That is the only measure mentioned in the entirety of the document.  Where it breaks down is that we must have 30% of such areas done by 2030 and at least one quarter rewetted.  We are going to have to rewet them all to meet that.  That is the reality of it.<\/p> <p>  On the question of tick-tacking between us and other member states.  We have engaged with our European young farmer partners in CEJA and are meeting them next week specifically on this.  The Swedish, Finnish and Norwegians have serious concerns about this, as do some of our members in eastern European countries, as the implications for frozen soils also come into this.  Obviously, that does not affect us but affects other EU members states.<\/p> <p>  Envisaging the problem down the line, while Mr. Hanrahan may be a bit younger than me, I have the luck of being one of the youngest members in the room.  The Deputy may be trying to retire others in the room, but I hope to still be farming in 20 or 30 years' time.  That is my ambition.  Having the durability and persistence to stick it out is something we will need to have no matter who is sitting in the positions representing the organisations here today.  Letting something like this slip through is simply not an option.  All doors and accesses to agriculture must be kept open, no matter if they are in this habitats directive or in Bills before other groups proposing measures around access for young people.<\/p><p>We must all unite behind those to make sure all doors are left open for young people.<\/p><p> As regards the final question around the environment and what has been sent forward from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, our understanding is that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage also has a role to play here because the habitants and the biodiversity directives fit under the remit of the Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  We have not had any engagement or the Department has not reached out to us on any of these points and I am not sure whether any of the members know what engagement has gone on between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications or the Department responsible for implementing biodiversity measures which is the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.

We can basically say we are looking at much of the country here.  My questions arise from the countries that are objecting.  What is our position?  It is not just the D&aacute;il that can object.  The Seanad can object as well and it has a massive role to play here.  We can object on the principle of subsidiarity so we need to look at that and at what is in the regulation and see how we can tie in one with the other.  I have two questions.  The first is around the timeframe for objecting.  The committee members probably think I should know.  Normally it is eight weeks from when the document is presented to the Council, etc.  Can we get clarity about how long we have before these objections have to be in for what we call the yellow and the red card procedure?  Have we missed the boat here?  I certainly hope we have not but I would like to know the timeframe.  If we cannot halt this project so it can be substantially revised or thrown out, which could happen, we then get to the point where there has to be agreement with the Parliament and the Council of Ministers, and there are real opportunities to influence there.  As Mr. Roddy mentioned, 70% of what was in the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, proposal from the Commission ended up in the final document and that generally tends to be the way.  It is not without precedent that draft directives or regulations have been completely reversed and that is the kind of territory we are in here.  There is much more I could say but I want to give others a change to get in.<\/p> <p>  I support what Senator Boyhan said about these being political decisions and we need to know where political parties and Government stand on this.

This is extremely serious legislation, a very serious regulation, which could result in a potential land-grab so it is concerning.  My constituents and the farm organisations in Laois-Offaly have been very proactive in highlighting this and the fact that the rewetting of peatlands is serious and it also takes away control from the landowner.  Only today, the Chair hosted a good briefing on forestry and we all learnt about the importance of afforestation in meeting our climate action targets.  We are currently behind with that and with meeting the 8,000 ha per year.  That means we are now going to have to plant more forestry.  These environmental NGOs are doing too much dictating and are being funded to the hilt by the taxpayer.  I have called for them to be defunded because it is criminal that they are getting &euro;5.2 billion of funding every year.  Some of those taxpayers are farmers and they are the people these NGOs are punishing much of the time.  I have made no bones about calling for these organisations to be looked at and overhauled.<\/p><p>You are talking away control from farmers.  There is a need now more than ever for afforestation and a forestry policy and for more uptake on that.  Again, it is the farmers choice, if they want to do that.  These environmental groups cannot have it every way.  My question is on the assessment and the need for analysis, which I fully support.  It is ludicrous to do something without having the fundamental piece such as an assessment or analysis done in advance.  Some member states have done that.  That is great as at least some are showing leadership on this issue but have these states influenced the direction of agricultural policy?  The reason I ask is that I was very disappointed to see that a KPMG report commissioned by the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>on emissions - it was a particularly good report, I might add - was not taken on board.  My concern is if this analysis is done in other member states, we need good examples and evidence of how it is going to influence agricultural policy.  We need buy-in from rural Deputies and we need unity among rural Deputies and Government now more than ever.  I will certainly work with any Deputy who is sensible and pragmatic but we need to make sure we get this right and resist any attempt to instigate a land grab.  I will help in any way I can.<\/p><p>Mr. Keane referred to Sweden in terms of the analysis and the objections were also mentioned but I would like to see some evidence on how the agricultural policy was influenced.  That is what we need to do in here.  There are more than 12 Green Party Deputies in Leinster House and we need to see action.

It is grand to see young farmers here who are concerned and who hope they can live out their lives farming.  At one time it used to be a privilege, an honour and an advantage when the farm was given to the young fella that inherited the farm.  It was an advantage for a long time but now it is a millstone around their necks.  If they were to do what their fathers who handed it down to them, did, there is a fair weight on their shoulders to do the same thing in 30 or 40 years' time when they hand it down to their sons or daughters.  That is the worry I have when you hear this kind of carry on about rewetting lands after farmers in our side of the country anyway, including myself, got grants to drain places.  I broke my leg in a drain when a stone fell in on top of it, so I know what it is.  I boil with temper when I hear all this carry on is going to happen.  The result of this could be that farmers will be forced to carry this out.  Like the young fellow said earlier, we will be wondering about what the next fella is doing.  I could bring you to my own field.  The upper part of the field might be drained to catch the water.<\/p><p>Where will the line be drawn?  In fields like that, are we going to rip them asunder?  Where we have been cutting silage for many years now, we will only have half the field left.  It could be different on better land but I have to talk about my side of the country.  I am on the other side of the hill from Mr. Kelleher.  I took the presenter from Radio Kerry to an elevated point in Kilgarvan and I asked him what he made of what he could see.  In places like Kilgarvan - it is replicated all around south Kerry, down into Ballingarry, which is north-west Cork, and over the other hill into south-west Cork - all you have are a few fields maybe in one corner of the place and the rest of it is all bushes, bog, rock and every kind of misfortune you could ever think of.  There are places you could not even walk through.  I asked him how much of that ground was being fertilised.  Ground that is green is peaty ground.  It is black ground as well call it.  It is reclaimed ground.  Where is the line going to be drawn here?  Those fellas have enough land and are sequestering carbon already.  It is like giving medicine to some fella before the doctor comes.  We are not being told what we are already sequestering.  Before we go one step further, that is what should happen.  We should be told what we are sequestering.<\/p><p> We have fellas who will not let us cut hedges along the road.  They say we are hurting the wildlife, the birds or whatever, but there is another side to the ditch.  We are not insisting that the hedges have to be cut there.

We have had incessant rain in Dublin today and I would say there is not a provincial town in Ireland that has not been beset by flash floods today.<\/p> <p>  The very idea of thinking we could rewet 20% of the country and somehow cope with it is beyond all bounds.

That is the equivalent of two and a half times the amount of land we are farming in County Longford at the minute.  It is extraordinary and we need to put it into context to let the non-farming public realise what is entailed.  That is effectively rewetting County Longford.  I know many of the wags on Twitter will say that might not be any harm but the people of Longford are very attached to their bogs and waterways.  It is easy for someone at European level to think these things and that they are great ideas.  There has to be unity among the rural Deputies - I agree with Deputy Nolan in this regard - whether they are in party, in government or Independent.  I take my lead on agricultural matters from my colleague, Senator Paul Daly, and from the Chairman, Deputy Cahill.  Let there be unanimity in the House.

Like other Deputies and Senators, I was dipping in and out of a meeting.  The economic impact this could have on our agricultural entities has not been quantified in so many ways.  We are looking at the co-operative movements, the meat factories and all the way down to the merchants.  If were to bring this forward, the 20% rewetting proposal, it would have a huge economic impact across the rural hinterland.  A real study needs to be done on what that would mean for these entities, for us as a community, for us as a farming community and for west Cork and Longford.  These rural entities would in so many ways be grossly affected.  I do not know where one would go to quantify it.<\/p> <p>  The big thing here is that the majority of rural people and farmers did not realise this would affect the majority of farmers.  They thought it would affect a minority of farmers.  The majority are going to be tied into this.  That will be the pinch point here.  This is going to affect you, whether you are in dairy, beef, sheep or  forestry.  You are all in the circle here and you are all tied in, with the potential of anything up to 20% or more of your land being rewetted.  What that would mean for you, as an entity, whether you are sustainably farming, is probably negative.  It would probably mean that you will not be in a position to hand on your farm even though, like all of us, you try to build up your farm to move it on.  You do not want to go backwards.  That is probably where this measure is going to go.<\/p> <p>  We had a session last Wednesday.  These sessions have been really informative for the general public.

Whether it is dairy or beef, it is processed adjacent to our rural towns, it is the backbone.  In many cases, such processing is the primary employer within that town, the driver of the rural economy in the area and the spin-off for other activity.

We have representatives and substitutes on the committee but considerable work will have to be done there.  On the one hand, one is off to a bad start if one starts in ENVI.  On the other, it is on a working group which is linked to the Environment Council of ministers of the environment.

I am not entirely sure the Department of Agriculture has the resources to deal with it either.  I was told by Department officials they thought some of these measures may be voluntary but who is going to volunteer to sign up for rewetting?  There is also discussion, by the way, about carbon credits and there is work afoot in the EU to decide whether farmers can be given some financial reward for storing carbon, but this is a hugely complex and not widely understood area.

With Article 16 on access to justice we are creating the ultimate crank's charter and that is a real problem.  Deputy Nolan is right when she says that they have unbelievable funding from the State.  As Mr. Punch said, farming groups - not just us, but also community groups - are left bereft of funding.  I am conscious as well of the McKenna judgment in the High Court around the divorce referendum, which called for equality of funding.  We need to make two decisions.  This committee does not have the power, unfortunately.

Deputy Harkin asked for our understanding of what is happening in this regard at EU level.  I understand it is due by the end of 2023.  It is going to follow a strategic process similar to the CAP strategic plans, namely, 24 months to form a plan, six months for observations by the Commission and then six months for Ireland to respond to any changes proposed at Commission level.  We understand that the European Parliament agriculture committee has been asked to provide an opinion on it, but the rapporteur on that committee has not yet been appointed.  There is obviously work to be done with Irish representation on that committee to ensure the voices from this room, the Oireachtas and other places are reflected in the contributions from that side of things.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lombard spoke about an economic assessment and an enhanced environmental assessment, which has been mentioned a number of times.  We have question marks over what exactly is going to be measured in an enhanced environmental assessment.  If there is no baseline for what the environmental footprint or outlook is on peatlands or organic soils now, what exactly is the baseline to be measured from?  What improvement is going to be measured over the course of this period of time?  Until an actual baseline is established, I am not sure what is being assessed.<\/p> <p>  On the question of an economic assessment, I return to some of the other points we made earlier.  Article 12 of the regulation speaks about the content of the national restoration plans.  There is an irony in here as well.  Article 12(2)(m) refers to an indication that the content of the national restoration plans must give \"an indication of the subsidies which negatively affect the achievement of the targets and the fulfilment of the obligations set out in this Regulation\".  From our understanding, that puts all payments that support any kind of production on farms at risk.  Article 12(2)(n), irony of ironies, refers to \"a summary of the process for preparing and establishing the national restoration plan, including information on public participation and of how the needs of local communities and stakeholders have been considered\".  Up to now, there has not been much consideration or assessment of what is going to impact on our communities or on rural people.<\/p> <p>  Deputies Fitzmaurice and Danny Healy-Rae and others spoke about the need to ensure there are young people left in rural areas.  Many members of our organisation are from parts of the west of Ireland where other environmental measures have taken place, including large forestry plantations that are very important for the environment also.  We are talking about a doubling-up of the impact of these measures on such communities.  I cannot remember the last time a coniferous tree walked into a post office and posted a letter.  Flooding bogs in these areas is going to have a huge impact on the social fabric in these communities as well.  Our members in GAA clubs and many other clubs in these areas are finding it difficult to field teams at under-10, under-12 and under-14 levels.  This is the reality of what is happening in these communities.  As has been mentioned, measures like this will, at the stroke of a pen, impact on our rural communities.  If all of these measures as currently proposed are brought forward, it will be a case of the last person out turning off the lights.

The compensation route is definitely a port of last resort.  I have seen it before with designated land.  We were promised good schemes for that land when it was designated and the funding dried up very quickly.  As well as that, the capital value of the land has been completely destroyed.  It probably has less than 20% of the capital value of undesignated land.  It baffled me how it was allowed to happen at the time.<\/p> <p>  As a committee this is the second session we have had on this.  An awful lot of questions have been raised in this meeting.

These proposed regulations from Brussels could have huge implications not just for rural Ireland but for our whole economy and we as a committee intend to put a lot of effort into getting a defence of Ireland's position put in place to ensure common sense prevails.  We have seen it with the war in Ukraine and food security, and also with forestry security.  We had a forestry briefing this morning.  There is huge competition as it is for land for forestry.  If this goes ahead as proposed, we can forget about the forestry industry in this country.  It will be over.  That is leaving aside the arable land they will be trying to foreclose on.<\/p> <p>  Our guests will be in this room again discussing these proposals.  I thank them for their participation this evening.  It was a very worthwhile discussion and it has briefed us well on where the farming organisations are coming from.  I will now suspend the meeting to allow our guests to leave and then we will commence our second session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#N00400","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666134000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 7.39 p.m. and resumed at 7.45 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666134000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Senator Tim Lombard took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Welcome back.

Some of them have been here before and we have been dealing with this for the past two years.  The committee did a report on the veterinary medicinal product side.  The fertiliser regulations were added to the Bill and they are coming in together.  From the veterinary medicine side, we did a report previously and even had some of the witnesses in previously.<\/p> <p>  We heard recently from the merchants, such as the Independent Licenced Merchants Association, ILMA, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, and the Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU.  The veterinarians are in next week and we have heard from the Department.  Today, it is important for us to hear the farmer&rsquo;s advice in how both parts of this Bill will ultimately affect the farmers and what changes they would like see, if possible, within the Bill.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome all of the opening statements.  Like everyone else who has been here previously, ourselves included, there is nobody arguing about the need to deal with antimicrobial or antiparasitic resistance.  Everybody sees that and is well intentioned that this needs to be done.  It is about the &ldquo;how&rdquo; - the most effective way to do so - without jeopardising farmers&rsquo; incomes and livelihoods.  In particular, two issues seem to have come to the top of our agenda through our previous deliberations.  From the veterinary medicine side, the word we are getting loud and clear from other witnesses we have had in previous weeks is that antiparasitics becoming prescription-only medicines could well be the death knell for the merchants, in particular, and many of the co-ops.  Part of the ambition of the regulation would have been to enhance the availability of veterinary medicinal products, however, we are hearing it will actually have the opposite effect to that.  Already with the antibiotic side of things, the merchants and co-ops will say that the prescriptions are not filtering through to them.  We had people here who put on the record that their sales of intra-mammary are down 90% since they became prescription only.<\/p><p>It is important to hear the farmers' voice on that.  A number of issues have come up, the most pressing of which is still outstanding.  It relates to the fertiliser regulation part of the Bill.  I refer to the Border issue and how that may be handled.  The Border was also a strong player in our conversations on the veterinary medicines.  The Border issue is linked with the burden on the farmer.  We have heard the potential problems that could be faced by the pharmacists, the merchants, the co-ops, the vets and the Department officials.  We want to hear how this Bill, if it goes through in its current format, will affect the farmers.  What role have the representative bodies played to date?  Have they had much or any consultation with the Department on either of the two topics included in the Bill?  I think I have asked enough questions to keep the guests talking until the other members come back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#O00300","speaker":"1651","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>In its current form, this Bill is overly complex and needs to be simplified.  If you read through the fine print, you will see there is the potential for a farmer or a farm family to be fined up to &euro;100,000 for a breach of it.  That is a huge fine.  Obviously, I fully endorse the Senator's comments as regards antimicrobial resistance and the need to move it on.  We need to do this in a pragmatic way that will deliver for farm families and deliver opportunity.  There needs to be common sense in the legislation.  The prescription-only status of antiparasitics is a huge issue.  Quite rightly, the licensed merchants were predominantly involved in the co-op movement.  We know from discussions we have had with vets in various different parts of the country that they would be quite happy to see that arrangement stay in place, with the co-ops providing merchant credit, as it is termed.  It can be an issue for farmers at different times of the year if they put in a bunch a cattle and want to dose them and go through that routine.  It may be the date of slaughter before the cash flow would come.  Many of the vets' practices are family businesses.  They want to try to service their members' needs but at the same time they do not want to be carrying the can for the entire agricultural community within that.  As regards what improvements we would like to see, there are significant practical issues relating to the veterinarian being the only one to issue the product.  Such issues may arise in the spring if you arrive in the door of a large animal practice with two or three vets, and one of them is gone out doing a herd test and another is doing a Caesarean section.  They have responsible persons who have issued those products in the past.  We see no reason to change that.  We believe that was working well and there is absolutely no reason to change.  Geographical issues may arise if a co-op does not source a product going forward because there will be a huge issue with travel.  A farmer who lives beside the local co-op could be 30 km, 40 km or 50 km away from their local vet.  There are issues as regards location.  There are other issues regarding putting the sticker on the label.  Very often, the sticker that is put on covers the date or the withdrawal period.  This can be a huge issue.  I ask my colleague, Mr. Enright, to answer the Senator's question about the Border.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McCormack"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>The Border is certainly an issue for the Department and for the trade.  I am going to focus on something the Department has to give clarity on and deal with.  When we look at the fertiliser regulation Bill from a farmer's perspective, our concern is that we are almost at a stage where there is forensic checking of what farmers are doing on the nitrates side.  We have serious concerns about the direction that is being taken.  A farmer who makes a very minor mistake could be excluded from the derogation and suffer penalties under the nitrates directive.  We have made a number of very specific points in our submission.  Most significantly, we have asked why a farmer needs to apply to be part of the register.  All the talk about simplifying matters for farmers and giving them freedom to farm is the biggest joke of all time, to be quite honest.  It is getting more and more difficult as we move forward.  To give a simple example, why do I have to register to purchase fertiliser?  When changes were brought in regarding pesticides, I did not have to register for that.  I go into my co-op, give my herd number and get the pesticides required for my farm or whatever I need.  We have made some specific points on that.  Our big concern from the point of view of the register is around the sanctions to be placed on farmers who make minor errors.  It is very easy to make a minor error in relation to fertiliser usage.  If a farmer spreads an extra 10 kg of nitrogen in a year, as per the register, what are the sanctions going to be?  There is huge frustration about issues like that.  We heard earlier about the nature registration law.  There is huge frustration about the raft of regulations being introduced.  I will not go through the specifics of this matter because it is very detailed but if we are to make it as simple as possible for farmers, we have to address those issues.  As I see it, we are setting up a structure that is quite complex.  My real concern is that it will get more complex over time as we move forward.  We need to get clarity and keep it simple for farmers.  There should not be a need or a requirement to apply to be registered.  The Department has all the details of every farmer - his name, address, herd number, cattle details and land details.  Why in the name of God do we have to go and apply for this again?  We need to keep it simpler.  I will not go into the detail of the specific points we made in our submission at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Enright"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>As an organisation, the IFA is very much in favour of a targeted approach towards the reduction of use of antiparasitics in our farms.  It is in our long-term interests as farmers and as in the interests of society as a whole.  Certainly, we have played a leading role in that.  It is critical in all this debate that this is to the forefront.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that there are some key issues, and they have been touched on by Mr. Enright and Mr. McCormack.  The reality is that this proposal will have a severe impact on competition within the system.  Effectively, we are going to be at the behest of one supplier.  Regardless of the goodwill or otherwise of those suppliers, inevitably they have a monopoly and farmers will ultimately be the ones to lose out.  We will also lose huge economic activity in the broader range of the sector in Ireland.  There has been a growing tendency for corporates to take over veterinary practices around this country.  In many cases, the prices are built on the goodwill of farmers.  In effect, we now have a situation where outside bodies are looking at changing regulations and inflating valuations to be seen to benefit groups that are outside the agri-sector, for all we know.  This is a huge concern in terms of the competition for these products for farmers in the future.<\/p> <p>  The two-tier supply system on the island of Ireland is an absolutely critical issue and cannot be overlooked.  As somebody who has been the victim of fake and incorrect labelling on imported products, I believe this is an area of huge concern.  It undermines the national effort not only to have a targeted and one-island approach to food production in Ireland and to medicine usage reduction across our State, but also to ensure we can stand over the quality of all our products.  It is our clear view that prescription by qualified persons can be facilitated in the existing regulations.  This would align both jurisdictions, in effect, and allow us to move forward with the one-island approach.  That is absolutely crucial.<\/p> <p>  Outside of those issues, there are other issues within the Bill that are particularly significant for us.  In terms of the national database in particular, farmers have real concerns that individual farmer data will be accessed and stored in a format that is currently not available.  At this point in time,  the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine cannot use the data to flag herds for inspection but will they be able to hold this position in the future?  We will be in a situation where farmers are being held accountable for the faults and failings of those who are prescribing.  The reality in Ireland today is that farmers cannot access antibiotics unless they are prescribed to them by a third party who is suitably qualified and recognised by the Department.  In this situation we have to ensure individual farmers' data are not going to be used against them.<\/p><p>In addition, we will have the development of a huge database under the national veterinary prescription system that could be sought for use by outside bodies for the surveillance of agriculture and our farms.  The control and management of this database is a whole new area about which we are extremely concerned.  In particular, when we look at the monopolies that exist outside our farm gates for the purchase of our products, it is very concerning for us.<\/p><p> Another issue with the Bill that is particularly pertinent is the whole enforcement issue.  It is not appropriate that the legislation would provide a right of entry onto farmlands or farmers' premises without notification or warrant.  It is certainly not something we envisage should be allowed as we move forward.  The reality is that farms are also family homes.  This approach cannot be accepted and must be deleted from the Bill for best use.<\/p><p> The other issue that is particularly important is that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has responsibility to ensure compliance of prescribers and suppliers.  It must ensure this Bill does not turn things on their head and lead to a situation whereby farmers are the ones taking the blame and responsibility for future inaccurate behaviour by the prescribers.  We are very concerned about that for the future.<\/p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. Potterton, to discuss the fertiliser issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.J.

An exact definition of the terms &quot;fertiliser product&quot; and &quot;fertiliser manufacturing&quot; should be included in the Bill.  The IFA does not consider it fair and reasonable to treat farmers as fertiliser importers if they buy or purchase fertiliser in Northern Ireland.  We would like clarification as to whether, if farmers purchase fertilisers in Northern Ireland, they will be classified as fertiliser economic operators and professional end users at the same time.  There must be flexibility for fertiliser economic operators, as they are referred to in the Bill, to use the fertiliser database to sell and transfer into the Republic of Ireland.  There are several references in the scheme of the Bill to fines and sanctions in the event of fertiliser economic operators failing to meet their obligations.  If they so fail, our view is that farmers must not be held accountable.<br\/><br\/>The requirement for the submission of fertiliser product details and quantities owned or held on a premises, either at regular intervals or even in real time, has the potential to become very onerous and overly demanding for farmers.  The IFA has concerns about farmers who may not be technologically literate or good with IT.  Many farmers already employ agents and consultants to fill out applications for payments and schemes on <i>agfood.ie<\/i>and this will likely extend to the fertiliser database as well.  It will increase administrative costs with little or no direct economic return for farmers.  The statistical returns into the database should be kept to a minimum and should take place within the closed spreading period and away from any major farm payment scheme deadlines.  Further clarifications are needed on what additional details may be required at a future time for submission to the database by professional fertiliser users.<br\/><br\/>Moving to the processing of information, it is clearly stated that the use of information compiled in the database is to inform policy and control programmes and reduce inorganic fertiliser use.  The IFA is concerned that 2023 will be used as a baseline or reference year to inform this decision-making.  The unprecedented increase in fertiliser prices and widespread predictions of more restricted use and availability in 2023 must be taken into account by the Minister and his officials.<br\/><br\/>There must be clarification regarding the anonymised data that could be submitted to third parties from the database.<br\/><br\/>My final point relates to the serving of notifications and notice periods.  Should an inspection of a premises be required in respect of fertiliser, sufficient notice must be provided by officials and entry must be strictly by arrangement only.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Max Potterton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Paul Daly for his questions.

Regarding the scope of the Bill and its provisions on veterinary medicines, the number one issue we see concerns the implications around the data that are created, who has access to them and for what purposes.  There is reference in the scheme of the Bill to access to the database being given to \"such other persons specified by the Minister\".  As we are aware from the conversation we have had since 5.30 p.m., there is a concern this may include various interest groups with non-relevant knowledge of the sector.  The information and data contained within the database could be used against farmers in respect of what they have been doing with veterinary prescriptions and veterinary medicines.<\/p> <p>  There is an omission in the scheme of the Bill.  It mentions sharing data with the likes of Bord Bia for the purposes of inspections relating to that body's quality assurance schemes.  However, no consideration is given as to what the implications or consequences might be for failure to comply.  Is it Bord Bia that will enforce those requirements or will they be enforced through the regulation itself?  There are similar concerns regarding the effort to move the sector forward in terms of improving the overall health of our herd, which Macra na Feirme has supported for many years and continues to support in the context of this Bill, in order to reduce our dependence on, and usage of, certain medicines.  However, there is no mention within the scheme of sharing relevant information with our national health bodies, whether that be the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, which is developing genetic testing to improve the genetics of the herd, which is a measurable trait genetically verified within our economic breeding index, EBI, and also within the indexes of beef, or the Animal Health Ireland programme, which is charged with reducing the incidence and occurrence of disease within animals.  There is an omission in terms of requirements for sharing these types of data.<\/p> <p>  The second point raised was around market competition.  There is concern about the burden that is being placed on veterinary practitioners.  A lot of practices around the country are quite small, particularly in rural areas.  Many of our members have noted that veterinary practitioners in some areas now have limited staff who work only certain hours.  We all recognise, however, that farming operates on a 24-hour basis.  The increased burden that is going to come on those practices in regard to labelling, premises-keeping and record-keeping will be a significant additional time requirement.  The overall context to keep in mind when we speak about vets and the supply of large-animal vets into the sector is that there are about 75 vets trained in Ireland annually in the one veterinary medical school we have in the country.  We must bear in mind the age profile of the vets we currently have.  The number who are leaving the sector due to retirement or because they are entering into small-animal practices for various reasons is in the region of 250 to 300.  At the moment, we are exporting people and then importing back the education they have received abroad for four to five years.  There is significant work to do in that regard, similar to the generation renewal point we have made many time in respect of farms.  There is a significant issue that must be addressed in terms of providing places for veterinary practitioners in more than one veterinary college in the country.<\/p> <p>  The issue of parasite control was raised and the question of the duration of prescriptions for parasites and also for antibiotics.  There is ambiguity as to what should happen in the case of an outbreak of a disease such as cryptosporidiosis, for example, in a dairy or beef herd in springtime.  When there is such an outbreak, as we know, all the animals within the group must be treated, whether or not they are showing symptoms, because the likelihood is they are all going to be infected.<\/p><p>What would be the application of this proposed Bill regarding the outbreak of a disease like that in a group of animals where the likelihood is that they would all become infected over time?  That is the example relating to cryptosporidiosis.<\/p><p> In terms of the general scheme, it is noted that everybody taking part in 2023 must voluntarily register.  A number of users of fertilisers are not herd owners, herd keepers or landowners.  They include parks and GAA facilities.  What is the proposition for dealing with those small-scale users?  We have exemptions for small-scale users of pesticides and herbicides.  What is the proposal here in terms of the proposed Bill?<\/p><p> In terms of the fertiliser Bill being used as a baseline to monitor sales and potentially reduce fertiliser usage over time, we are in a period of high input prices and high fertiliser prices.  This year is an example.  I hear many stakeholders and many people working in the sector championing this year as being a year in which fertiliser sales will reduce.  We obviously support the reliance on that but looking at PastureBase Ireland figures, the average tonnage and across hectares on farms on PastureBase is down between 1.5 tonnes and 1.7 tonnes, which, depending on the farm in which you are operating, is a 12% to 18% reduction of annual tonnage grown.  If you are at optimisation of that, that is a 12% to 18% reduction of your livestock on that farm.  <\/p><p> In terms of enforcement and creating baselines, it is important to recognise where we have been historically in the context of the baseline established under existing Acts with regard to environmental assessments.  Other environmental targets are set on the baseline of 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Paul Daly for his questions.  I will start at the Border.  I live only five minutes from the Border, so I know a lot about that end of things.  It is just as unrealistic to think that we can have one law on one side of the Border where they can trade with freedom in whatever warehouse, store or merchant's they choose with no problems, while there are restrictions on the other side of the Border a few miles up the road and it can only be done through vets.  This is discrimination against the trade.  Take a responsible person such a pharmacist.  These people have put in years in training and education to get this far.  People put time and money towards this and suddenly it takes a note to destroy their livelihood.  This happened with special needs assistants.  I do not think there were too many pupils in the school the next day and there was a bit of standstill in the country.  We are being treated as the quiet people and it will have to be pushed on us.  Farmers are going to suffer as a result of this.  The Border is a major issue.  We have a problem with cross-Border trading.  The biggest issues here is the availability, competition and price, the number of people it will take out of the areas.  Communities are dying because people have to travel miles.  As Mr. McCormack mentioned, a vet is unavailable when you get there.  You might have a bit of help the day you want to do something.  That is where the problem lies.  Licensed merchants, pharmacists and relevant people in the business are vital parts of it for us as farmers and they must be retained.  Otherwise we will end up with animal welfare problems and they will not come from overdosing; rather, they will come from under-dosing.<\/p> <p>  The studies we brought to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, were based on a small number of farms.  If it wants to do something practical or relevant and maybe go forward with this, for example, dung sampling, that can be done to get a feel for what is happening nationally and not just on a couple of farms.  We know how relevant this is and that it is not an issue in many cases.  This is a significant thing to go forward.<\/p> <p>  This proposal has been in front of us for the past number of years.  We have met the Department on different occasions.  We get so far and then it stops.  It is pushed back.  Within the past month or two before the new reset date, we will be called again to a meeting.  This is not working.  Stakeholders are not being treated properly.  It is time for the Department to make the decision to continue as we are under what is proposed, go forward and retain the ability of licensed merchants and pharmacists to prescribe and dispense drugs and dosing remedies to us because that is the only we can move forward with this.  That has always been the ICSA position on this.  We are talking about rural Ireland and a lot of small farmers.  It is alright for the big farmers and possibly the multiples but when you are talking about 20 or 30 farms to make up the numbers, we must consider that.  We are going to look at areas being locked out.  This is of no benefit to any of us so we must move forward on that end of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>We have concerns about the database in terms of veterinary medicines.  The general scheme lists a range of different bodies that may have access to it, including Bord Bia.  Not every farmer is a member of a quality assurance scheme.  The Data Protection Commissioner should be asked for a view about whether it is appropriate that there can be such access to this database.  We are creating a fertiliser register as well.  Equally, we must be careful that care is taken and that there is no access to this information for anybody who should not have it.<\/p> <p>  Under Part 3 of the general scheme, which concerns enforcement, quite draconian powers are given to Department officials to enter premises and so on.  We have a major concern about that because the sad fact is that there have been horror stories in the past with family homes being entered.  We must be very careful that enforcement is proportionate to the risk.<\/p> <p>  The key point is that we want competition.  The Department has been trying to say that veterinary practices can issue prescriptions and other outlets can supply or dispense but we still do not have a real working model regarding how that would work in practice.  That is the issue.  Reference is made to the human medicines scenario.  I do not think it is exactly comparable.  Ivermectin is a key example.  Because there is such competition, that product has become relatively inexpensive.  We know that many years ago, Irish farmers were paying a multiple of what farmers in other jurisdictions were paying for this.  Competition has been key in bringing the prices down.  However, there is not just competition between the retail outlets, vets, licensed merchants and co-operatives.  There is competition between suppliers of the product.  We would be concerned that this could be decimated.  If you go to a veterinary practice, a cheap ivermectin from one company is available.  If you go to a co-operative, a couple of other companies are supplying another type of ivermectin product, so we have competition not just between the retailers but also between the suppliers.<\/p><p>If we disrupt that model, we potentially take a lot of those other suppliers out of the market because the veterinary practice only deals with one particular pharma company.

As we have outlined, the whole area of the cross-Border two-phase implementation of this process undermines, as we see it, the ability of the country to proceed with an all-island approach to reduction of antiparasitic and antibiotic usage and undermines the whole food island concept.  It will be crucial, through the combination of the Northern Ireland protocol, that we operate in one system to ensure we do not have a Border.  Let us be honest about it: there will not be a Border.  Deputy Carthy has plenty of cousins in the North of Ireland, the same as every person along the Border, who will have the opportunity to purchase products at a different rate.  It will totally undermine the position of the farmer in this country.  It cannot be allowed to proceed without uniformity across the State.<\/p> <p>  The national veterinary prescription system, NVPS, is a critical piece of national legislation that we need to implement to comply with animal health law in Europe.  We need that recording capacity to protect us as farmers and highlight the fact that Ireland has low antibiotic usage on farms and monitors and records reduction in our anti-emetic use going forward.  At the moment we are exposed without that because we do not have clear trade patterns to identify opportunities to promote our country as a low-usage antibiotic system.  The weakness we have is that we are eight weeks from its supposed relaunch and have not been presented with the updated system that was shelved for six months to allow further clarification of the system and allow it to work on farms.<\/p> <p>  The key issue for us is that the farmer should have the right to take a prescription and fill it where he wishes and to ensure that, where there are multiple prescriptions, the supplier of any of those pieces of medicine can only have visibility of that prescription, not of all his prescription, because that weakens his position in the supply chain.  If, for the sake of argument, I want to buy my antiemetics from my local co-op, naturally I have to buy my antibiotics from my vet and want to get my vaccinations from another outlet, I have to be in a position to separate those out and trade as I normally have done, while retaining the advantage of recording those.  This will be a critical piece of infrastructure for us but it has to operate in a manner which retains competition in the system and protects the right of the farmer to choose his supplier.  <\/p> <p>  Another issue in terms of that data which has been highlighted on numerous occasions is that as farmers we are becoming very aware that we are the source of valuable data.  Our food is essentially feeding many parts of the world.  The control and management of that to respect the rights and production of the farmer is crucial to ensure we can control that in future.  <\/p> <p>  On the vacuum in terms of legal opinion which the Deputy has indicated may or may not be there, we are running to a cliff edge.  To be fair to the suppliers in the market, other than the vets at this stage, they are running into a situation where they have to ask whether they stock or not.  It is completely unfair for those businesses to be operating in those circumstances.  We believe that a trained, qualified person, as indicated by the HPRA report, requires a multifaceted approach and multi-supplier level to deal with the issue going forward.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.J.

The timing of his information or ripple-effect information is similar to ours.  The cross-Border is an issue.  If you turn right going out the gate and arrive into freedom to trade or turn left into complex issues, that would have to be addressed.  In the past, brucellosis was a hugely challenging issue in this country and it took an all-island approach.  From a BVD-eradication perspective, it will be something similar.  As Mr. Maher alluded to, our product is sold around the globe in significant proportions and we need to be in a position to stand over what we have and do.<\/p><p>The Deputy mentioned the trained persons.  In response to Senator Paul Daly's question, I said it is imperative that the trained responsible operators and veterinary practitioners are in a position to dispense drugs.  For example, at the busy time of the year, if there is a Caesarian, a herd test and two veterinaries out on call, it may not be feasible for the farmer to come back in four or five hours.  As we move forward, therefore, that is imperative.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to the availability of fertiliser.  Industry sources indicated to us with some confidence that it will be available up to and including the spreading of first-round silage.  In 2022, we saw panic and inflation set in and we saw where the profits went.  There was a threefold profit increase along the supply chain, which was hugely frustrating given that farmers were paying at an all-time high.  That is the last thing we want as we head into 2023.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked a question about 2023 becoming a reference year.  The indications to me, as someone who is involved in the Food Vision 2030 dairy group and the beef and lamb group, is that all the talk is about using 2018 at a national level.  I suspect there will not be a reference year for individuals but that it will be linked to the available area of land and stocking density as we move forward.  I fear that, yet again, we will see an imposition on farmers of the requirement for a fertiliser plan, which would cost them significant sums irrespective of their scale.  I issue that word of caution to Deputy Fitzmaurice to be vigilant for that.  I do not see 2023 being the reference year.  I see 2018 being the year in overall use.  It will depend on terms and conditions after that and farming intensity and level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McCormack","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Deputy Fitzmaurice asked if we want a fertiliser register.  We had discussions with the committee some weeks ago on the new nitrates action programme and the nitrates derogation.  There are legal limits on the amount of nitrogen we can use on our farms.  A fertiliser register is just another piece of red tape and bureaucracy for farmers and another hurdle I will have to jump as a farmer.  It is a significant concern for farmers from the point of view of penalties, sanctions, etc., and another headache.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, we have legal requirements.  The vast majority of farmers are meeting those requirements but, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Department have said it is a necessary requirement.  It is a bit like the nature restoration law.  It is another issue and another cost and headache for farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Enright"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the questions, many of which have been covered.  I will not restate some of the points that have been made.  On the cross-Border question, this is a major issue in regard to the operating of the market on both sides of the Border to undermine the system of trade that operates on the island.  It will be a significant issue, not only for farmers and those operating in the Border counties.  It will also have wider implications for costs and trade within the island.  It is mentioned in the Bill that fertiliser is recorded at the point of dispatch but there is nothing to say, in terms of measuring that, when it comes across the Border into a farmer's yard.<\/p> <p>  In terms of enforcement, a farmer may be using the market tools at his or her disposal to get the product at the cheapest price possible.  At the point of inspection halfway through the year or in a spot inspection later on in the year, the farmer, who has access to the market on a cross-Border basis, may not have registration documentation for some of the fertiliser used.  Where would that leave the farmer in the context of meeting the requirements of the inspection and also the enforcement?  With the stricter rules under the nitrates derogation, that also raises the question as to whether farmers who may be involved would essentially lose their derogation given how strict this is.<\/p> <p>  On medicines, we have received opinions and information similar to the Deputy received in relation to the legal opinion the Department has obtained.  We are unsure, obviously, what is contained in that but we recognise that the brakes have definitely been put on the development implication and the procedure that was highlighted to us earlier in the summer as to the steps that would be conducted before 1 January.  At this stage, a database must be established that is capable of registering this information.  Similarly, suppliers in the market must, as has been highlighted, have product on the shelf for farmers as well.<\/p> <p>  We are aware of the development of the app the Deputy spoke about.  We are aware of similar apps that have evolved and been implemented in other markets across the EU and have worked effectively.  There is, however, a role for the Department in terms of certification and validation of any and every form of app that would be used with regard to prescriptions, etc.  We are unsure as to the timeframe in which something like that may become effective or deliver for farmers.  We would welcome any opportunity for that to be developed if it makes the administrative burden on farmers any easier.<\/p> <p>  On the availability of fertiliser for next year, what we have heard is similar to what Mr. McCormack described.  We have significant concerns about the availability of phosphorus, P, and potassium, K, fertiliser.  The breakdown in terms of the fertiliser make-up could have on-farm implications as well for farmers who are operating within derogation but also outside of derogation, given that some straights may not be available.  Obviously, farmers using more compound fertilisers will reach their ceilings much quicker than they would if they were using straight fertilisers.  That must be taken into consideration in the context of the derogation as well.<\/p> <p>  The progress we should be trying to make on antimicrobial resistance, etc., will depend on the capability of our analysis to keep up with the demand farmers may have for identification, whether of antimicrobials or any disease risk that might come on farm.  We will need significant laboratory analysis to identify the issues.  We have seen a lack of investment and the attitude of the Department has been to significantly under-resource that sector in terms of forage and laboratory analysis.  We have been looking for increased funding for forage and laboratory analysis for farmers to drive demand for six or seven years, during which there has not been any increased support from the Department.  That support will be needed if farmers are required to test for worm or egg burdens for parasites for anthelmics.  Investment will be needed to support the roll-out of any such measures as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I will start on the issue of fertiliser and then address availability.  We are hearing that fertiliser will be available and there are stocks due to underselling this year with the way the pricing was.  It is affordability we should be looking at for some farmers, especially in the beef and the suckler end.  That is a big issue.<\/p> <p>  The amount spread has already slowed production in the past year.  Recording it is a mystery exercise, as far as we are concerned.  We need to be reducing bureaucracy and paperwork rather than creating them.<\/p> <p>  As far as medicine is concerned, we have no more information than the other speakers and members, which is disappointing.  We should have been meeting on a more regular basis to be updated on these issues but we were not given the opportunity.  It is just presumed a decision will be made and we will be told this is it and be expected to row in.  That will not happen and has not happened.  The ICSA and all farmers stand firm in that belief.<\/p> <p>  We must look at this in another way.  If the right decisions had been made some years ago and derogation had to be applied for, we would not be in this position.  That is the problem with us.  Northern Ireland, which is only across the road from me, has a derogation and farmers there can work away.  There has been a failure by the Department to seek a derogation.  We saw it with harvesting the bogs.  Nobody is taking responsibility for that and nobody else is being penalised on those grounds but it is coming back to penalise farmers.<\/p><p>We need to look at that one.  We want the Department to come forward.  It is down to a small number holding it back at this stage.  It cannot hold everyone to ransom.

In respect of the fertiliser regulation, we have had the interactions previously.  While I cannot speak for everyone, the view of this committee is that while the principle of the regulation is good, it is unworkable because of the Border.  The witnesses have outlined the challenges that that will present, as Mr. Farrell will know well, in the Border region where in many instances a farmer's closest merchant may be on the opposite side of the Border.  That applies equally to people on both sides.  There are potential implications for a farmer who does not know the detail of the regulation and happens to buy a trailer-load of fertiliser in one place without realising that that places an obligation on them.  I believe that is unworkable.  We will convey that message.  Do the witnesses have other concerns with the regulation outside that?<\/p> <p>  Without going into all the difficulties, we have had much discussion on the implications for the licensed merchant sector and the co-ops in respect of the veterinary medical aspect of the legislation.

Up to now the responsible person and not just the vets themselves had the opportunity to dispense.

Our members are extremely concerned because they do not want to buy more antiparasitics.  As I said at the start, the crucial factor for us is to be able to access them at the right time, in the right amount, at the right price.  That is the key issue.  If three suppliers are removed from the network leaving only one, ultimately our farmers are aware that they will be at the bottom of the food chain and totally exposed.  That is a key concern that cannot be ignored.  There is absolute evidence that this will certainly place us in a weaker position in the purchase of antibiotics.<\/p> <p>  As outlined previously, only a limited number of suppliers operate in the country.  Ultimately, we are concentrating the power in a smaller number of bodies supplying a smaller number of suppliers back to us.  Ultimately, farmers will be the losers because we will have to pay for it.  While the Department's efforts to have a broader approach to dealing with this might be well meaning, changing the address of where one buys the antiemetic does nothing for the reduction and more accurate use of these antiemetics and antiparasitics.  As we have continually stressed, modern technology and science is moving quickly.  Multiple companies are now supplying quick-test faecal egg worm-counter machines that can provide results in ten to 15 minutes for suitably qualified persons to read them.<\/p> <p>  We appreciate that all bodies will need to step up to the plate.

Things will need to be done differently because we now have greater controls on us and we will need to be seen to be doing the right thing.  That is absolutely in farmers' interests.

Given the potential for the Department to have access to all this information, it could be used to flag herds for inspection, which would be a major concern.  Data could also be requested by, for example, milk processors or meat processors.  It could be used to categorise herds and, ultimately, devalue the products that farmers are supplying.

Other stakeholders who appeared before the committee said it could be a loss of earnings for them.  In many cases, the other stakeholders are either co-ops or pharmacies.  Not near as much is going through the pharmacy as was the case.  Given the age profile of farmers with more over 75 than under 35, some of them would be calling to the pharmacy anyway.<\/p><p>There is a convenience element to it.  That is just one point.<\/p><p> I pointed out earlier in response to Senator Paul Daly that the majority of farmers are shareholders in co-ops.  They run accounts in them.  Vets, in many cases, are family-run operations.  It is very hard for them to provide the level of credit that may be required if someone is putting in a shed of cattle, dosing them and feeding them to finish.  There is a better chance of getting that credit from the co-op.  That also creates competition.  One of the witnesses behind me alluded to this, and maybe it was meant with no offence.  He said that from now on this will deliver and we will have to do what we should be doing.  It is my belief that since 2012, and the introduction of the dairy audits and the beef audits before that year, we have had great traceability from an animal medicines perspective.  When the audit in its entirety is put together, and fertiliser usage and so on is put in place, we have a unique selling point, which is used by Ornua and Bord Bia.  That must be built upon but it should be done in a practical way that is not going to eliminate or reduce the result for the farmer.<\/p><p> Regarding the audits, it was said that the information would be available to Bord Bia.  If an audit and inspection is done of my farm every 18 months, that is my information and it should require my permission to use those data going forward.  That is critical.<\/p><p> On fertiliser, our herd numbers are linked to the animal identification and movement, AIM, system and the single farm payment.  That should be the level of bureaucracy required to purchase fertiliser, rather than this notion of having to register as a purchaser and a user and all that.  All that should be required is the herd number, which is linked to the stock and the area farmed.  It should be made straightforward to reduce the complexity.

The number one issue that has come back from our members is market competition, as Mr. Maher touched on.  The number of suppliers within the market may become diminished as a result of this.  Mr. McCormack touched on the local merchant, which is convenient, as well as the ability to avail of credit.  There are certain times of year when there is a strong demand for supports for animal health measures on farms, which do not necessarily coincide with times of year when cash flow is strong.  The availability of additional credit through a merchant is something a lot of farmers welcome.<\/p> <p>  The other aspect that has been raised is data sharing.  The ownership of those data and the freedom the Minister has to administer the database and share it with whoever he or she sees fit to share it with is a major obstacle for our members moving forward, given the interested parties that may require or request access to the data.  Some of that has been touched on as well.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is access to antibiotics in a timely manner.  Farmers will know that access to intervention in case of disease is one of the most important things in determining the outcome of the disease.  Timely access to medication is important.  We understand that prescription medicines and antibiotics have a five-day period in which the prescription falls due.  Let us take, for example, a cow that comes in with mastitis on a Sunday morning and the farmer is without a prescription.  I am not sure how many vets would thank the few hundred farmers, or even a few thousand, who would be ringing them every Sunday morning looking for a prescription for mastitis tubes.  There must be some workaround to facilitate that within the Bill.  A point was made before about the timeframe within which this is going to be implemented.

The terminology used by the Data Protection Commissioner, Ms Helen Dixon, and the role she might play, is something that is new to the debate, without a shadow of a doubt.  That is something this committee will probably go back and look at on some level.  There are data here.  The Data Protection Commissioner has exceptional powers, is well able and does exceptional work.  We should ask her view on the Bill.

Competition is an important part of what this is about.  We need to make sure we have competition not alone at the primary level but also at wholesale level, so farmers can have the opportunity to purchase appropriate products.<\/p> <p>  The timelines are also a huge issue, not just for the farming community but also for the advising community that is involved here.

It is up to this committee how we will move that forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#V00500","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I am very concerned about this fertiliser register.  Many farmers in my area are seriously concerned because they need fertiliser to maintain the level of stocking they have today.  Without it, there will be a reduction in their herds.  It again looks like we are going backwards.  We will be in the same situation we were in during the early 1970s, when everyone knew how many cows the grass in different areas could sustain.  One person's grass might be enough for seven cows while another person with a great farm could provide for 17.  We are going backwards.  Farmers did what An Chomhairle Oili&uacute;na Talmha&iacute;ochta, ACOT, and other farming agencies told them to in the 1970s and increased their stocking rates.  That is what they are trying to live with now.  Many of them would not be in existence now if it was not for fertiliser.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on the fertiliser register.  Where was discussion held on it?  Were farming organisations or farmers told why this was going ahead?  It is clear that it is not for the fun of it.  There will be an account of what fertiliser farmers get and what use they are going to make of it.  It looks like it is for the purpose of getting herd numbers down and stopping whatever.  We all know that you can sometimes put out fertiliser only for it not to work.  It may snow or freeze or something else might happen.  You may use a lot more fertiliser in one year than in another.  I am very concerned about this aspect.  I have asked many farmers in my area what this will mean to them and how much fertiliser they will be able to buy.  No farmer knows because they have not been told.  It is not fair on farmers that there has not been some discussion about it.  I cannot understand how this can be introduced in January when nobody knows what they can buy, or if they can get any at all.  We were listening to the farming organisations all along.  The organisations are saying that we will get it up to the middle of the year, and I hope we will, but it is clear that this register is being formulated to block us in some way.  It is not for the fun of it that it is being brought in but to nail us.  <\/p> <p>  I am very concerned about that because farmers did what they were told all along.  They made their farms more productive and increased the size of their herds.  In 2012 or 2014 the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and told us to produce more milk.  It was the new white gold.  Now, the Government is doing its level best every day to curtail, stop and nail us in every way it can.  What is the need for this register?  Who agreed to it?  Do the witnesses believe it is fair on the farmers in light of the things I have said?  You could use way more fertiliser in a given month of one year than you did the previous year.  I heard the witnesses saying that 2018 might be used as the base year.  We do not know that.  The Government will use whatever year suits its story the best.  I am very concerned about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#W00100","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I will be very brief because the witnesses have had a long day.

When this comes in, there may be an opportunity to streamline the data.  I know there are reservations about sharing data with the Department, Bord Bia and other agencies but, ultimately, we all have to embrace technology at some stage.  Has anybody from the private sector approached the witnesses' organisations with online portals or propositions to safeguard everybody, including the farmer, the small retailer and the large retailer?  Off the top of my head, there might be a system whereby a farmer was able to go to a central veterinary point online, get his prescription back via his local vet and then select where we wanted to buy the medication.

With regard to data control and protection, as farmers, it is critically important for us that the NVPS be controlled and monitored centrally because, once we include and involve outside parties, it becomes more difficult to control and manage the data.<\/p> <p>  The issue of sanctions was raised and it is worth making one more point to the committee on it.  There are references to sanctions throughout this Bill.  They must be appropriate and reasonable.  If a prescriber fails in his duty, the farmer cannot be held responsible.  The current regulations on veterinary medicines incorrectly sanction farmers if somebody else fails in his or her duty.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure supplier compliance.  It is a small point but the Bill needs to clarify that.  <\/p> <p>  Farmers are ultimately the end users of the products covered by this Bill and, as a result, they are the ones most impacted by it.  The legislative obligations this Bill establishes will be crucial to farmers.  As I have said from the very start, we are absolutely in favour of a reduction in the use of antiparasitics and of their proper use but the supply chains must not put farmers at a competitive disadvantage in comparison with the current position.  It is critical for us, as farmers, that the Bill is framed in a way that addresses the issues in a positive and proactive way and delivers on the objectives we have targeted, which are the appropriate use of medicines and ensuring we do not end up with a two-phase operation in this country whereby there is one set of regulations operating North of the Border and another set operating South of the Border.  That ultimately looks like the situation the Department is leading us towards if it does not change course.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the fertiliser sales database, the IFA strongly believes the following key principles should be adhered to: the provisions in the Bill must seek to minimise any additional extra costs and administration being placed on professional fertiliser end users; the Bill must not disincentivise the purchase or spreading of fertilisers at farm level by professional end users; the protection of data and information gathered by the database is of critical importance; and individual farm data on fertiliser usage should be treated with the strictest confidence.  That equally applies to the medicines register.  We have already gone into that in great detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#W00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.J.

Farmers are normally referred to as the primary producer when discussing things but the term \"end user\" is used here.  The document specifies that there is potential for a fine of &euro;100,000 or for an invasion of one's home.  That is extreme, to put it mildly.  When Pat McCormack, or anybody else, goes to his local co-op or anywhere else to purchase fertiliser and gives his herd number, the person on the other side should be able to key in that information and find out how much stock he is still allowed to purchase rather than him finding out in six months' time when the fertiliser is all spread that he has spread one 50 kg bag too many of 27-2.5-5 or whatever formulation he is using and that he is now in breach of the various regulations.  There are companies out there that provide apps in respect of animal health and medicine remedies usage.  Perhaps they will come on board but the ICMSA would like to see the obligation on somebody other than the end user, specifically the retail outlets, retailers and providers of fertiliser.<\/p><p>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae raised huge concerns and rightly so.  He went back as far as the 1970s.  We can come up to 1983 and the introduction of the milk quota and then the abolition of the milk quota in 2015.  In that intervening period, we saw a substantial reduction in the number of dairy farmers.  That was because margins eroded for the primary producer.  The challenge then was to scale up to remain viable.  The challenge now is regulations and the potential for those regulations to make us unviable.<\/p><p> There have been challenging years in the past and I have no doubt there will be challenging years in the future as regards grass growth.  The Deputy is right; sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.  We need a level of tolerance.  Rather than entering a fodder crisis and putting our hands up in the air in the months of July or August, there should be a tolerance where we can do something about it at home on this island nation, which is on the periphery of Europe.<\/p><p> In summation, we need common sense.  As an organisation, the ICMSA was obviously involved in some of the discussions but the Department seems adamant that the European Commission insists on this as a tool to move forward.  Whether it is fertiliser or medicines, however, they need to be available.  The responsibility cannot be borne solely by the sole trader, in the vast majority of cases, or the family farm unit.  There is enough stress out there on farms without having the bureaucracy of keeping this register or, indeed, the availability of medicines on a timely basis.  We need to see common sense prevail and very often, that is sadly lacking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022101900002#W00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McCormack","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Flaherty for their comments.  I will make some final comments to sum up the main aspects of what we have been discussing from Macra na Feirme's side of things.  The main issues are around ensuring market competition remains in place and is enhanced, which is crucial, and making sure farmers get access to the market.  We must make sure a system is in place that protects farmers, as the end users, from prosecution should other actors within the sector have failings.  There should also be ease of use for farmers to ensure there is no additional red tape or bureaucracy, which affects both older and younger farmers in terms of the burdens of, for instance, data recording or time constraints.  Increased investment and support for laboratory analysis is needed to enhance the ability of services to analyse faecal egg sampling and other laboratory analysis that will support the implementation of the measures.  Also important is the protection of data to secure assurances for farmers that their data are being used and shared with the appropriate bodies.<\/p> <p>  I will highlight the main core objectives as set out in the EU's own overarching document, which are harmonising the internal market for veterinary products, reducing the administrative burden, enhancing the availability of veterinary medicine products, stimulating innovation of new and existing medicines and strengthening the EU's response to fighting antimicrobial resistance.

The biggest issues here were raised by Deputies Flaherty and Danny Healy-Rae.  I thank them for their questions and comments.  I will begin with Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, who spoke about going back to the 1970s and the number of cow buyers or whatever on a farm.<\/p> <p>  If we look at this over the last few months, and even last night, we attended another meeting on sucklers, we are talking about reduction through organic farming.  Money is put into it through maybe environmental schemes and asking where the cutbacks are.  This is all coming from Europe and different angles.  Is this another part of it?  A greater reduction in livestock is being put on farmers.  We are the enemy every time the television goes on in every direction.  As we said earlier, I do not think this levy and hard press should be put on fertiliser.  It is over-burdening.  As was said, every year is different with supplies at times.  This year was a different year with a drought.  Next year could be a better growing year.  We hear so many different things.  We cannot be limited like that.  We need to have access to the product at all times.  This is where we must have that.  Putting a quota on supply is really creating a reduction in certain events where people cannot feed the animals, which causes welfare issues.  Much more has to be looked at in this Bill.  It could be deferred a bit until it is better thought out or as someone said earlier, tweaked on where it is going.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch again on the other issues of accommodation and differences in medicines and stuff.  That is our biggest worry.  There is talk about taking the licensed merchants and pharmacists out of it.  The Government is talking about reducing by maybe half or two thirds the number of people in the system who are supplying products to the farming community.  We will be running with a shortfall.  Accessing that is where our problem as farmers will be big time.  We have seen this in energy with power stations being closed.  Now, we are short on power and the Government cannot open them again.  Are we going to look at that?  We have these licensed merchants sitting in closed-up buildings when we are short on supply and we cannot get to them.  We cannot be looking at this happening again.  We want to see this continue as it is until it is better put together and the Department becomes clear on it.  It has to be pushed back down the road until we get clearance on it.

I was appointed to my position as a UN special rapporteur by the United Nations Human Rights Council in May 2020.  In doing so, the council provided me with a mandate to promote the implementation of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, which was agreed by consensus at the UN General Assembly in 1998, and to study trends, developments and recommendations for the protection of human rights defenders - those who work peacefully, and often at great risk, for the rights of others in accordance with the declaration.<\/p> <p>  At the start of my time as a special rapporteur, I set out a list of priority areas for work as the holder of this mandate.  Included in them was the intersection between business activity and the work of human rights defenders.   This decision was informed by consultations I had held with human rights defenders and advocates following my appointment, as well as by insights from my previous work in civil society and in my role as adjunct professor at the Centre for Social Innovation within the business school at TCD.<\/p> <p>  Since those early days, the relevance of business activity to my mandate has been confirmed in hundreds of conversations I have had with human rights defenders.  Again and again, these defenders have shared details of the impact businesses can, and do, have on the environment within which they seek to carry out their activities.<\/p><p>There are some cases where the impact can be seen to be positive and a handful of progressive companies, primarily EU-based, are leading the way.  Adidas, for example, has been leveraging its influence in response to risks for human rights defenders, HRDs, since 2014, and a small group of pioneering companies have made declarations of zero-tolerance for any act of retaliation against human rights defenders within their value chains.  We know 30 large companies have introduced policies which include recognition of human rights defenders and the work they do.  However, the vast majority of cases shared with me, as well as those documented by others, demonstrate an overwhelmingly negative impact of business practice and activity on human rights defenders.  To provide some statistics, between 2012 and 2022, the NGO, Global Witness, documented the killing of 1,540 defenders who were working to protect rights connected to land and the environment.  A total of 680 of these have been linked to business activity, and we can be sure this is an undercount.  In 2021 alone, the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre documented the killing of 76 defenders and, in the same year, 88 death threats against defenders working in the context of business were documented.  <\/p><p> One of those killed was indigenous human rights defender Jose Isaac Chavez, who was murdered in Mexico in April last year.  He had been a prominent opponent of open-pit mining in the region, putting him at odds with powerful local actors in an area marked by gang violence.  The mine in question is owned by two companies based in Luxembourg, and there has been local reporting on disappearances and murders of defenders opposed to the corporate-run mine for years.  While the fatal attacks are concentrated in a number of high-risk sectors, particularly extractive industries and agribusiness, these are only the tip of the iceberg.  Alongside its documentation of killings, the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre also maintains a database of attacks on human rights defenders with a link to corporate activity.  Their database currently contains information on over 4,000 attacks, with 10% of these linked to EU-headquartered companies and their supply chains.  <\/p><p> All of this is continuing, or indeed escalating, more than ten years on from the agreement of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights which businesses can voluntarily chose to follow.  It is clear that the use of soft-law instruments and voluntary initiatives to foster business respect for human rights has not been effective.  To take the situation in Ireland as an example, in recent benchmarking carried out by the Centre for Social Innovation at Trinity College Dublin, the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles by 60 top Irish companies was assessed based on publicly available information.  Half of the companies scored less than 20% and just over one third were shown to have taken no action at all to embed respect for human rights into their operations.  There is limitation in the current voluntary framework and this has concrete results for human rights defenders.  <\/p><p> There is a question as to why this has been allowed to go on for so long.  It is clear that people stand to benefit from the silencing of human rights defenders, including those here in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU.  As time is short, I will talk about the EU's initiative on human rights and environmental due diligence, which has created an opportunity for its members to begin to address this.  The creation of binding obligations for business to identify and assess human rights and environmental risks, and to take steps to address and mitigate them, could be transformative.  Coming from the world's largest single market, it could begin a sea change.  However, in order to live up to the expectations it has generated, the initiative must keep protection of human rights and the environment at its centre.  As I laid out in my position paper which responded to the proposal published by the Commission, acknowledging the important role of human rights defenders within the due diligence process is part of the way this can be ensured.  In my paper, I outline three means by which the Commission's proposal can be built on to do this.  This is the core issue.  These means can be summarized as follows.  First, obliging companies to take risks for human rights defenders into account when carrying out their due diligence; second, mandating engagement with human rights defenders as key stakeholders in the due diligence process; and finally, mitigating risks of retaliation against defenders who raise concerns about the environmental and human rights impact of company activities.  As a proud supporter of human rights defenders all around the world, I am calling on the Government to prioritise this issue.

I provide input as a practitioner and in my capacity as Europe, Middle East and Africa director at Article One.  I work with corporations globally to advance respect for human rights throughout their operations and supply chains.  I teach business and human rights at the School of Law at Trinity College Dublin, and am a non-executive director of a State-owned company.  As a member of the Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights, I support the contribution of my colleagues today.<\/p> <p>  For context, there have been important changes in what is expected of business regarding impacts on human rights and environment.  A decade ago, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights set down the expectation that business would respect human rights and \"do no harm\".  Some companies voluntarily adopted these principles and are considered leaders in practice today.  However, most did not.  In practice, positive change was slow and ultimately occurred at low levels.  Now, key trends have altered this landscape.  First, interest has come from consumers, employees, and shareholders into better business practices.  Countries have adopted single issue laws, for example, the UK Modern Slavery Act.  Second, the scope and pace of regulation has accelerated.  European countries such as Norway, Switzerland, and Germany in 2021, passed broader so-called supply chain due diligence laws.  These laws aim to prevent harm occurring in the first place.  Broadly, they require certain companies to identify, assess, and address their negative impacts on human rights across their operations and global supply chains, and to be accountable for this process.  The German law, which came into force on 1 January 2021, requires certain companies to report publicly on the effectiveness of their due diligence, for example to prohibit child labour.  I work with companies which are evolving their business model and practices.  Responsible business conduct is an adjustment.  Companies recognise that it is the right thing to do, and no business wants the operational, reputational or legal risk of being linked to human rights abuses and damage to the environment.  In short, engaged businesses recognise it is their business to engage.  <\/p> <p>  In March, the EU Commission published the proposed Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive.  As its officials stated, \"with these rules we want to stand up for human rights and the green transition\".  The hope or expectation is that this EU initiative will in time lead to a global standard of business practice.  National laws and the proposed directive mark a paradigm shift from voluntary principles to hard law.  They go beyond reporting out and set down corporate due diligence as a robust process.  The EU framework itself needs to be content-ambitious and aim for a level playing field.  It requires large EU and non-EU companies, and later companies in identified \"high impact sectors\", to take appropriate measures to prevent, mitigate and remediate adverse impacts.  These measures range from inadequate workplace health and safety and exploitation of workers, to biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation.  They include accountability mechanisms, and oversight by directors of EU companies; both of which are important to deliver remedy for those affected and to underpin success.<\/p> <p>  It is key that the thrust of the proposed directive should not be watered down.  It will evolve and could be strengthened in multiple ways.  During the course of my work, I see both positive impacts of business and also terrible abuses affecting people and communities.  Companies here in Ireland and across the world are moving to align with new human rights and environmental due diligence laws.  They are supportive and seeking guidance.  Across the EU, citizens and stakeholders expect products and services to be delivered with responsible business conduct.  These laws and the proposed directive are needed along with valuable markers to advance and deliver that.  <\/p> <p>  I am pleased to assist with further detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022101900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rachel Widdis"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present this morning.  Tr&oacute;caire is the chair of the ICBHR, which is a broad civil society coalition that brings together organisations working with human rights defenders, development organisations, environmental organisations and trade unions.  Through the everyday work we do our organisations witness at first-hand the impact of corporate harms on the communities we work with.  These harms include human rights violations such as child labour, land grabs, attacks on human rights defenders and violence against women.  We also witnesses significant environmental harms, such as deforestation, oil spills and unchecked carbon emissions.  Those who stand up to defend their communities against corporate exploitation are increasingly under threat, as Ms Lawlor outlined.  The uncomfortable truth is also that many European countries are linked to these types of harms.  In fact, a number of businesses based in Ireland have been linked to human rights violations through their global value chains and our coalition has documented some of these in our recent report entitled, Make it Your Business.<\/p> <p>  This is a global issue.  Through my work I have met many brave men and women affected by corporate harms in communities in Guatemala, Myanmar, Honduras, Palestine and other countries.  These have included communities who have had their land confiscated, forests cut down, water polluted and who have even lost family and community members.  Those people were murdered for daring to stand up and defend their communities against corporate interests.  To meaningfully address these violations, we need stronger legislative frameworks that can prevent such harms from happening and provide access to justice for victims when violations happen.  As such, our coalition is encouraged to see the EU propose the corporate sustainability due diligence directive.  Our coalition strongly welcomes this new directive and we particularly welcome the inclusion of civil liability within the draft.  However, there are significant weaknesses and some serious flaws in the draft text that risk it being ineffective.<\/p> <p>  First, the scope of the directive applies to far too few businesses.  Under these new rules, 99% of businesses will be excluded.  We estimate fewer than 700 Irish companies will be covered.  Second, we are concerned companies will only be required to assess their value chains where they have established business relationships and, therefore, the full extent of value chains will not be covered.  Often, and primarily in many cases, it is in informal work we see most rights abuses.  Third, victims and rights holders are not the primary focus of the draft directive.  It is weak on meaningful engagement with communities, unions and the protection of human rights defenders.  The draft also fails to address the gender dimensions of corporate harm and is weak in its gender response.<\/p> <p>  There is an urgency to this matter.  As this directive is being negotiated in not just the coming months but in the coming weeks at the Council, we recommend the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment leads on outlining a clear policy position of the Government on the corporate sustainability due diligence directive and seeks to raise the ambition of the directive and address the weaknesses I have outlined and the Government outlines a clear timeframe with steps for the preparatory work, development and ultimate transposition and implementation of the directive in Irish law, and we respectfully suggest this committee support these recommendations and conduct further hearings with experts and carry out full pre-legislative reviews of the draft directive.  As I mentioned, there is an urgency to this matter.  This morning we learned that under the Czech Presidency of the EU Competitiveness Council, proposals may be made available to ambassadors as early as 26 or 28 October.  Fundamentally, if we fail to adequately address the exploitation, violence and pollution we are currently seeing in the value chains of our everyday products, such as our clothes, phones and food, then we will have missed a historic opportunity and will have failed in our responsibility to respect, promote and protect human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022101900002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Caoimhe de Barra"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Widdis and Ms de Barra.

I thank our guests not just for attending but generally for the work they do.  It is great to have an opportunity to have this discussion and shine a bit of a light on it.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by the following line in Dr. Widdis' submission: \"we presume no business wants the operational, reputational or legal risk of being linked to abuses of human rights and damage to environment\".  It would be great if we could but the sad fact is they are willing to expose themselves to that risk.  If some businesses are making an assessment of human rights versus profit, or however they work it out on the balance sheet, they are clearly taking that risk now.  It would be great to be in a position to presume they do not want the damage.  It is possible they do not want the publicity but they are certainly prepared to run the gauntlet of that being a possibility and that is something we need to hone in on a little.  I confess I have not done significant research into it but from the small bit I did in the aftermath of the building collapse at Rana Plaza, it seemed there were wheels within wheels and a web of suppliers and small suppliers.  It is not all one big corporate entity because if that were the case we could just name the top 50 companies in the world and say, \"There is the list, lads, do your business right.\"  That would be the end of it.  However, clearly tens of thousands of smaller operations are possibly all part of this chain and that is my concern.<\/p> <p>  In her submission Ms Lawlor references a company that was \"ultimately owned\" by a parent company, if we want to call it that, in Luxembourg.  Is it possible for us to come up with a way to capture the web?  It is easy to identify the big brand, such as the one with the swoosh, or whatever.  However it is about the smaller companies that are all part of this chain.  Is it going to be possible for us to identify them?  Can we cast our net wide enough?  If we cannot then, maybe we are not going far.  I do not want to be defeatist about it.  I am looking for a wee bit of hope from the witnesses that if we get the words right, get the political will and we get this directive done properly we could be leaders on this and we could bring in that web.

The risks are everywhere.  Business is engaging, or at least the businesses I work with are engaging in this.  They have vast numbers of suppliers.

If we do this, it will be the start of a really good initiative that will save the lives of human rights defenders.  I have no doubt about that.  It will require a bit of research.

To make this directive impactful and effective on the ground it needs to cover the value chain.  We are hopeful that Ireland will be keen to do that.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about how businesses communicate and how they put up their suppliers.  With Rana Plaza, it was not known who was buying the products until the fire scene was visited and the collars and what they were sown on to were inspected.  Businesses were not willing to put their names forward to that disaster.  It was the same with KiK fire in Pakistan.  We need to make sure we are mapping the full value chain and that this includes informal settings where most of us recognise that women will be working.  That includes home-based work.

However, the implementation needs to be proportionate to the size, scale, scope control and scope of influence of those companies and their supply chains.  We differentiate between a large company that has a high degree of control and a smaller company that has a lower degree of control.

The thresholds are already extremely high.  The thresholds currently in place would mean that 99% of European companies would not be affected.

The protections that one would normally expect to be there for people in different types of employment are not there.  We are concerned that naming only established building relationships could drive companies that are operating without a strong ethics dimension towards more work on an informal basis and away from the compliance requirement of having to report and do due diligence because they have formal supply relationships.

There was a sense that the world was watching because, as Dr. Widdis pointed out, there are no global laws on this matter at the moment.  The directive will be the first law under which it will be mandatory to undertake due diligence.  The world is watching and Europe is leading.  We are also involved in UN treaty work, where negotiations are happening next week.

However, it contains a provision called \"contractual cascading\" whereby the lead company can get contractual assurances from its direct suppliers that they will cascade compliance with its code of conduct down the value chain.  When we speak about large companies, we are automatically speaking about two issues.  One is the proposed directive's element of contractual cascading, which is an unusual element.  The lead company would still retain responsibility for verifying compliance, but that could be done by third-party initiatives.  Ms Tunney mentioned the KiK case.  Some jurisdictions have a chequered history in terms of how this process works.  Indeed, 260 people perished in that factory fire.  Companies and their value chains will be included in the directive to the extent that it has to move down the value chain with contractual cascading.<\/p> <p>  There is also an element of burden sharing.  Where larger companies will be able to tell smaller ones to give them contractual assurances, the costs will fall on those smaller companies.  They will be included by default, as it were, in the directive's blast radius.  This is something that we need to consider in practical terms.<\/p> <p>  Ms Tunney spoke about governmental and EU negotiations, but business is also considering this matter.  We need to think about what business in Ireland and globally thinks about this as well and include its perspectives.  Business is moving on this in a positive sense.

As Dr. Widdis just mentioned, there is so much out there about how to do this.  When we are talking about value chains, there are so many frameworks from the OECD and the UN about how to do this.  Even in the recital of the directive, recognising that human rights abuses in this context affect women disproportionately would be important.  When we talk about stakeholder engagement, we are talking about enabling women to engage in a safe space because some women will not be able to engage in front in men and also recognising the different roles women play within society and gender equality within that society.  There is significant work to be done on strengthening the gender dimension.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the thresholds and the previous question around scope, at the moment, the latter is very high so a certain amount of turnover and workers is needed.  We would say that this should be either-or so it is cumulative.

Again, we have heard that there are some indications that in a watered down text, the concept of directors' responsibility could be removed.  What we would all recognise is that where the board of directors and senior management take responsibility, company behaviour changes radically and profoundly.  We have all seen in the past that where voluntary initiatives fail, it is because directors and senior managers take no notice of them because they are not obliged to in any way observe, measure and report on them.  We think that maintaining directors' responsibility in the text is extremely important.  We believe this is something Ireland could and should stand over.  It is worrisome that there is the potential for this to be removed because it is probably the fastest way to achieve a change in corporate responsibility.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question around gender and gender responsiveness, this is very important because women are disproportionately affected by abuses within supply chains.  Women are disproportionately affected by inequality under legislation and in social norms and practices in all environments but particularly where the egregious human rights violations are most likely to happen.  In the case of women human rights defenders, as Ms Lawlor said, companies should be required to protect human rights defenders who speak out about corporate violations.  We have to distinguish between what are the risks for female and male human rights defenders.  The types of attacks on women human rights defenders will be different in some respects from those directed against men.  They will be threatened, harassed and abused on the basis of their gender.  They will be accused of being prostitutes, bad mothers and failures in their society.  Women cannot simply be protected by being removed from their family homes and communities because they have responsibilities within their families so the protections for female human rights defenders will often be different from protections for male human rights defenders.  At the moment, there is no recognition that women workers in the supply chain are disproportionately affected by abuses and disproportionately not protected.  The rights of women in terms of the right to own land, the right to a contract in their place of work and the right to protection under labour legislation are often entirely different from the rights afforded to men.  We definitely need to see that recognised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022101900002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Caoimhe de Barra"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I think 100 companies and investors have signed a document supporting this proposed directive, which they want to be as strong as possible.

From listening to what the witnesses have said, however, there is a real danger that it will get watered down.  Having been in the European Parliament, I have no doubt that an army of lobbyists is currently working on behalf of large sections of big business to water it down and ensure it effectively remains an exercise in corporate washing and greenwashing.  It is concerning that the Irish Government has not taken a public position on the various matters under discussion at Council level.  The lack of progress in terms of Irish legislation is also concerning.<\/p> <p>  An excellent report by the ICBHR, Make It Your Business, Ireland!\", speaks about the role of corporations in human rights and some of the abuses that take place.  People might be a bit shocked about the role of Irish corporations in this.  People can have the idea that Chinese or US corporations are the ones doing bad things around the world.

If legislation was in place that required companies to fulfil mandatory due diligence legislation, that counter pressure, which stops companies doing the right thing, would not have an effect and there would be an equal and level playing field for all companies.<\/p> <p>  Without going into details about a specific company or industry, prevention of harms is key.  If due diligence is done on the supply chain in the extractive industry environment and the harms have occurred and will continue to occur are recognised in spite of the efforts of the company concerned to improve, future harms can be prevented and the Government can choose to disinvest in companies where there are evident harms that are not being prevented sufficiently.

Cases are being taken, particularly in the Supreme Court in the UK, against parent companies for their link to the activities of their subsidiaries in far-flung countries.  Civil liability is one of the accountability mechanisms in the proposed directive.

As a country with a strong identity in humanitarian aid and human rights, however, do we also need to be looking at the potential consequences of this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022101900002#H00600","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Flaherty very much.  One point I would like to make is that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Irish Aid are heavily engaged in contexts where human rights violations occur.  They engage diplomatically through the European Parliament and local civil society in the context of addressing the multiple causes of violations of human rights.  This is not a body of work that we would see in any way in isolation from the rest of the Government's approach to the promotion, protection and defence of human rights internationally.<\/p> <p>  The point Deputy Flaherty is making is that this is certainly not a panacea.  We would agree.  However, from our work in Central America, for example, where there is a combination of governance, politics and criminality, effectively, what they have is an enabling environment for corporate violations of human rights.  The Department of Foreign Affairs, through agencies such as Tr&oacute;caire and by means of its own engagement bilaterally with, for example, counterpart ministries for foreign affairs, engages on this holistically.<\/p> <p>  What we are seeing and hearing today is that we need to see a cohesive response from the Government towards human rights violations within the corporate sector, and that the Government should equally represent the values of the Irish people in this dialogue around the corporate due diligence directive as much as it does, for example, through its work on the UN Security Council on similar issues and violations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022101900002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Caoimhe de Barra"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I will come in to say that unions are very heavily involved in developing and advocating for this directive.

As other colleagues stated, this committee will not be found wanting in terms of trying to assist them as best we can to make sure that Ireland is in the vanguard when it comes to what is being proposed at European level.<\/p> <p>  This is very difficult subject in many ways.  We are largely talking about extended supply chains that go into Latin America and Africa, as has been mentioned.  There is a big political difficulty in many of those countries in that the human rights we are trying to endorse are often not endorsed by those governments.  That is an issue in terms of how this European directive can have teeth in trying to improve the lives of people in those countries.<\/p><p> The witnesses have mentioned a number of key areas they would like to see this legislation scope out.  One was the provision of criminal liability and civil liability.  I think the witnesses are talking about companies that either use extended supply chains or have subsidiaries.  I think that it will be very difficult, from a legal perspective, to try to enforce that.  It is a matter of the degree to which people who are dislocated by either governance or geography are found culpable in some way for what is going on in a far-removed country.  I would like to understand how the witnesses feel the European directive will affect that.<\/p><p> It is very important that the witnesses have highlighted managing the risks of retaliation against, in particular, those who are in human rights and involved in those endeavours, and protecting sources.  It is absolutely vital that we can, at a European level, try to offer some protection, but what would that look like?  Are we going to bring people involved in mining or deforestation from South America into a witness protection programme?  I can see the ethos of what we are trying to do.  It appears to me that the best way to try to marshal this is through corporate reputation.  One of the big phone manufacturers was highlighted.  We saw what happened when cameras were brought into China to see what was happening in manufacturing.  We saw in Pakistan girls of four, five and six sewing sequins onto textiles and how that had an effect.  I would like to see something more in respect of what we are discussing as to how we can use the power of social media and of global communications to really help people on the ground.  Ms Lawlor spoke about the killing in South America of people involved in deforestation.  We have to find a way of connecting that activity with what we consume, what we buy and what we market.<\/p><p> The witnesses may wish to take those couple of points.  How do we make this legislation reach out into the conscious mind of social media marketing?  That, to me, is where it can have the greatest effect in respect of consumer buying.  If consumer buying behaviour is changed, we will absolutely impact some of these activities on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022101900002#H01100","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I absolutely agree that it will be difficult but all human rights work is difficult because it is never accepted by governments or companies that they should protect the most marginalised in society.  That is a starting point.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy about corporate reputation.  From the work I have done with companies over the past two years - and I have written to many companies that have been engaged in abuses against communities and, in particular, human rights defenders because that is my mandate - it is clear to me that the only thing they care about is their reputations because that affects their share prices.  It is the same with governments.  Governments will go to any extent to stop you doing a negative press release about something they are doing.  It is just the way of the world.  Every government wants to protect its reputation and its political and strategic interests.  From that point of view, I completely agree with Deputy Shanahan.<\/p> <p>  Getting back to something that occurred to me in response to, I think, Deputy Flaherty, when we in the school of business in Trinity College do the benchmarking of the 50 biggest companies in Ireland on only their published information, and half of them score under 20%, we find that a lot of it is that they just do not know.  They need to be educated; not all of them.  Obviously, very few of them are engaged in human rights violations of one kind or another, either directly or indirectly, but the point is that education is needed.  If we look at what is coming, apart from what I have said about the Escaz&uacute; Agreement and the Aarhus Convention, we find that the Inter-American Development Bank has included a section on reprisals.  The International Finance Corporation, part of the World Bank Group, also has a section on retaliation and threats.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has also issued a statement on retaliation.  Then there are the companies.  Deputy Stanton mentioned the 100 companies.  There are a lot of big companies and a lot of small companies engaged in this issue.  Big ones like Unilever, for example, are very engaged.<\/p> <p>  What I am saying is that I absolutely agree with the Deputy but we have to take this step.  Nothing will happen until we start taking the right steps in the right direction, using all the tools at our disposal, including social media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022101900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Lawlor"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.  One of the things I would like to see is some kind of framework within this whereby companies would try to investigate their own supply chains, even where they are buying from a third party.  If it means that companies must have a policy stating that they have put people on the ground in South America or Africa, have seen what is going on and are moderating, looking at and engaging with that, that, to me, is the only meaningful thing.  Beyond that, it is a matter of advocacy around trying to get at those people on the ground and trying to get the message out, as Ms Lawlor says.  Corporate reputation and money are the only two things that really matter here at the end of the day to try to effect behavioural change.  They are the fastest way to get it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022101900002#J00300","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>To come back to the Deputy's point about retaliation, there is a well-established framework around the protection of whistleblowers and human rights activists who are at risk for speaking up.

Numerous guidance documents have been published directing business and investors how to take steps to ensure that retaliation does not happen.  All of that work and knowledge is already out there.  It comes back to the point about education and raising awareness.  The European Union has been working on the issue of the protection of human rights defenders for 20 years.

They have been taken primarily in common law jurisdictions and were being taken primarily in the UK.  The UK Supreme Court has issued incredible judgments in this space.  That said, the UK is, as we know, no longer with us.  Ireland is the common law English-speaking natural jurisdiction.  There are a number of issues with taking those cases in Ireland, including third party funding and class actions.  The directive itself has an issue around the burden of proof, which falls to member states and could fall, as it does or did, on the people who are affected.  It is an incredible lift for those people.  There are issues of information, funding, lack of access to class actions, but the cases have been brought.  They have taken decades but they have been brought successfully, which I think is another thing people may not be aware of.  Ireland would be a natural jurisdiction, as I have written, for the criminal liability failure to prevent human rights abuses.  I have also written on that.

Nevertheless, when the T&aacute;naiste appeared before the committee last week, we got very few answers.  A number of us, from several parties, not just Sinn F&eacute;in, raised questions but I did not feel as though we got answers.  Why do our guests think that is?  As they pointed out, we are not at an early stage.  A third compromise draft is being developed, yet Ministers seem prepared to say as little as possible in regard to this.  Is something preventing them from speaking about this?  I have to say, I think they are dragging their feet.

Within supply chains, the principle is that you look at the entire supply chain and all industries and all sectors, but you do it in a proportionate manner, and if we have time, perhaps we could discuss what exactly that would look like.  The principle is one of proportionality and maintaining that overall principle for all supply chains and all companies in a proportionate manner, as is set out in the UN guiding principles.  That is fundamental.<\/p> <p>  There is a degree of reassurance that needs to happen regarding what it would mean to include SMEs in this.  For example, a European Commission study recently found that the additional recurrent company-level costs of carrying out due diligence, as a percentage of SMEs&rsquo; revenues, would amount to less than 0.14%.  In some ways, it is to take the fear and tension around the potential impact of this out of SMEs, put it on the table and discuss it in this forum, and enable the Government to take that leadership role, which so clearly belongs to the Government in this realm.  That is the key.<\/p> <p>  To return to the point on directors' responsibility in response to Deputy Shanahan's point regarding consumers, if we make consumers responsible for driving change, we are negating all the responsibilities of states and companies.

This will be a groundbreaking directive both for trade unionists throughout the world and those exposing environmental degradation if it is enacted in the spirit in which it was originally intended.  As our guests detailed, there has been a significant and worrying degree of watering down the proposal, and the lack of engagement by the Government has been worrying as well, although I will take what Deputy Flaherty said about that hopefully going to change.<\/p> <p>  The focus of this meeting has been on the case for a mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence framework, but I want to ask about how that due diligence framework would complement the need to put in place an outright ban on certain practices.  I am looking, in particular, at what is happening with regard to cotton products from the Xinjiang province in China.  The US has moved ahead on that and the EU appears to be still thinking about it, if I am up to date on that.  There is a role for outright bans.  Our guests talked about the supply chain legislation that is in place.  They might speak to how they see the framework that will be in the directive being complemented by outright bans.  My concern is that once this directive has been enacted, a view may be taken whereby people will say we no longer need to instigate outright bans on certain practices such as forced labour because the framework will be in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022101900002#K01300","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Yes, the corporate sustainability due diligence directive is part of a suite of directives and regulations the EU is putting forward, and only three weeks ago, it published its proposal on banning forced labour products, particularly looking at Uyghur communities.  This directive will deal with behavioural change and with companies preventing human rights abuses and fixing them where they happen, but there is also a need for a ban on the import of products from certain regions.  Ms Lawlor can probably talk to this in more detail.  The US has drafted quite effective laws.  Again, the EU framework at the moment does not seem to be as impactful in the sense it is based on a customs duty.  It is not necessarily banning all products and it does not look as good as the US one at the moment.<\/p><p>There is a political reason for that as well, which we have to recognise.  This directive is about changing behaviour.  The conflict minerals, forced labour and deforestation regulations all sit under the green new deal the EU has adopted.  Basically, it is about changing behaviour and stopping the products.  They are complementary and they work to each other.  There is also the proposal for the corporate sustainability reporting directive, which almost a twin of this instrument, which focuses on how work and due diligence are reported.  They are taken as a suite of actions and engagement, but the directive on changing behaviour is key.  That is why we want it to have a bigger scope.  The scope of the corporate sustainability reporting directive is wider than the scope of this instrument.  We keep talking about level playing fields and making it easier for business, but at EU level we are creating directives that have different thresholds for companies.  We want to simplify it for companies.  We should seek to introduce a standard threshold, whether that is by looking the UN guiding principles or concentrating on the reporting directive.

Mr. Regan and I are grateful for the opportunity to provide our views on the budgetary tax package, temporary versus permanent measures and social protection income thresholds.<br\/><br\/>Budget 2023 was framed as a cost-of-living budget.  Thanks to a strong economic performance, evident in the labour market and Exchequer returns, the Government was in a position to allocate significant resources, without running a budget deficit, to alleviate some of the cost-of-living pressures experienced by households and businesses.  In August, year-on-year inflation in Ireland and the euro area stood at 9% and 9.1%, respectively.  The ESRI has forecast an inflation rate of 6.8% in 2023.  However, the effects of inflation vary by household type.  In Ireland, low income, rural and elderly households have experienced higher inflation as more of their consumption relates to food and fuel.  The households experiencing a higher rate of inflation are also those who are more likely to be dependent on fixed incomes such as social welfare or pensions and less likely to benefit from wage increases, forecast to be 3.5% and 4.5% this year and next year, respectively.<br\/><br\/>Budget 2023 included measures directed at maintaining household standards of living.  On the taxation side, the standard rate cut-off band was increased by more than forecast inflation, while tax credits were increased by less than forecast inflation.  Unlike income tax credits and bands, most of the corresponding thresholds for PRSI and USC were held fixed in nominal terms, amounting to an effective PRSI and USC increase for many taxpayers.  Although most excise duties were frozen in cash terms, tobacco products tax was increased and the VAT on newspapers and miscellaneous health items was reduced to zero.  There was also a well-flagged increase to the carbon tax which was offset on petrol and diesel by the elimination of the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, levy and the extension of temporary cuts in non-carbon motor fuel duties.<br\/><br\/>A number of taxation-related interventions in the housing market were designed to increase the affordability and availability of housing.  A new &euro;500 income tax credit for renters was announced, as well as a vacant home levy.  Another extension to the help-to-buy scheme was announced, despite concerns that it is poorly targeted towards its stated aims and likely to fuel house price growth.  In addition, the potential for the 10% levy - now a 5% levy - on concrete products to be passed on to future residents of newly built properties may further impact housing affordability.<br\/><br\/>On the welfare side, budget 2023 saw permanent increases to most social welfare payments.  Apart from the &euro;40 increase to the working family payment income threshold, these were all below forecast inflation and follow real cuts to these payments in budget 2022.  In line with previous budgets, increases to social welfare payments were announced as a flat euro-per-week amount which, given the different base rates of social welfare payments, means a different proportionate increase for pensioners, those of working age, young jobseekers and other cohorts reliant on social welfare.  We estimate that the substantial package of temporary measures announced for 2022 and 2023 will make up for the real cut to permanent social welfare rates.  These temporary measures include targeted payments and universal measures.<br\/><br\/>Changes to the national childcare scheme, NCS, which subsidises registered childcare, were announced.  The universal subsidy, which currently pays &euro;0.50 per hour for children under 15, will be increased to &euro;1.40 per hour.  However, as the thresholds for the income-assessed component of the NCS have been fixed in nominal terms since budget 2019, some households will lose their entitlement to this more generous subsidy due to wage growth.  <br\/><br\/>In our post-budget analysis, the ESRI compared the direct and indirect tax and welfare measures - permanent and temporary - announced in budget 2023 with a price-adjusted set of policies for 2022.  The overall effect of budget 2023 compared with price-adjusted 2022 polices is that, on average, households are slightly better off.  There are small average gains in all income deciles.  This does not equate to an increase in real income, which will depend on how wages, employment and other factors evolve in 2023, but, rather, shows that the contribution of policy changes to real income changes is expected to be positive.  These gains are driven entirely by one-off measures and, despite average gains across the income distribution, detailed analysis showed that some households who are more likely to be reliant on social welfare, such as pensioners and lone parents, are likely to experience average income losses.<br\/><br\/>Disregarding one-off measures entirely and comparing the effect of permanent 2023 policy measures to inflation-proofed policies for 2020 gives an indication of the more medium-term challenges facing households and policy-makers.  Compared with indexing tax and welfare policies in line with inflation since 2020, budget 2023 leaves households worse off on average.  The permanent budgetary changes benefit higher-income households most, which leads to steeper losses for lower-income households compared with higher-income households.<br\/><br\/>Budget 2023 introduced a range of permanent and one-off cost-of-living measures.  While these will, on average, insulate households relative to a price-adjusted benchmark, the one-off nature of many of the measures means an erosion of the real purchasing power of structural rates of payments within the social welfare system.  There may be a need for further once-off cost-of-living measures in winter 2023 if price rises, particularly energy-related ones, persist next year.  Targeted measures will reduce the risk of adding additional demand-side inflationary pressures to the economy.<br\/><br\/>Through successive budgets, rates of welfare payments have been incremented by fixed amounts.  This translates to <i>ad hoc<\/i>proportionate increases for different cohorts in receipt of welfare.  If this pattern of increase continues, it will erode the relativities implicit in the social welfare system and weaken the link between rates of payment and income adequacy.<\/p><p>Once the need for one-off measures to insulate households from inflationary pressures has passed, policymakers may wish to consider benchmarking social welfare payments to reinstate this link between payments and income adequacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karina Doorley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Social Justice Ireland is very grateful for the invitation to address the select committee and to present our views.  The Government&rsquo;s budget for 2023 will widen the gap between rich and poor by &euro;199 next year.  This calculation does not include any salary increases to be received by those with a job.  Despite the welcome temporary measures to address the cost-of-living and energy crisis, in the long run, this budget will be seen as regressive and unfair.  While one-off measures are welcome, when they are gone, they are gone.  What we are left with is a skewed distribution of resources that favours those on higher incomes.<\/p> <p>  The rich-poor barometer introduced in our analysis of budget 2023 measures the gap between those on &euro;100,000 and those depending on core social welfare payments.  This gap is currently &euro;979 per week.  It seems to us that policy should be focused on reducing this gap.  Instead, the Government chose to widen it and prioritised the better-off over the long term.  Ministers also made a single-income couple on &euro;50,000 a year a further &euro;192 better off than a couple on social welfare.  The &euro;12 increase in core social welfare rates lags behind anticipated inflation in the cost of necessities in the coming year.  A &euro;20 boost was the minimum required to set Government on the path to benchmark rates to 27.5% of average weekly earnings over a two-year period, the target set and delivered by Government way back in 2007.<\/p> <p>  Social Justice Ireland does not accept aspects of the budget that widen income gaps, fail to respect Ireland&rsquo;s most vulnerable people and leave Ireland&rsquo;s poorest worse off when budget 2023&rsquo;s one-off measures are discontinued.  We call on Government to revisit its decisions in these areas and to make the necessary adjustments in the forthcoming social welfare Bill to ensure the most vulnerable are prioritised.  In particular, we urge Government to increase core social welfare rates by an additional &euro;8 a week to bring them up to &euro;20, which was the minimum required.  Anything less is simply abandoning the poor.<\/p> <p>  We believe one-off payments are not the answer.  Government&rsquo;s focus on one-off payments cannot conceal the fact that those on the lowest incomes, that is, those on social welfare and low pay, will fall further down the income ladder once the one-off elements of the budget have been worked through.  By their nature, one-off supports cannot tackle the embedded low-income culture that has prevented our Republic from eliminating poverty.<\/p> <p>  An additional double week payment to those on social welfare is welcome but is simply a one-off event.  It fails to benchmark social welfare rates to ensure they provide a minimally adequate standard of living.  It also fails to compensate for the rise in the cost of living, particularly in recent months.  In reality, social welfare recipients will be worse off next year than they are now.  We very much recognise that poverty is never about income alone, but it is always about income.  The Government is continuing to betray the social contract that, at critical times in the past, generated solidarity and social cohesion in this Republic.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the Government&rsquo;s focus on one-off payments assumes that all will be well for low-paid workers and welfare-dependent households next year.  This is a huge gamble that is likely to backfire on the least well off among us.  It is gambling with the standard of living of Ireland&rsquo;s poorest and most vulnerable people and is totally unacceptable as a strategy.  We should consider how this will ramp up anxiety levels in low-income households considering sending a young person to college next year, embarking on a course of private medical care or moving to a larger apartment.  For them, after this budget, there remains a fraught present and a bleak future unless Government begins to systematically combat income poverty.<\/p> <p>  Government policy is expecting the impossible of poor people.  This development and what Government has done in this budget is particularly worrying in light of the impact of the pandemic and then the cost-of-living crisis on the weakest among us.  A total of 595,000 people in Ireland are living in poverty, of which around 164,000 are children.  In 2023 the core rate for jobseeker's benefit for a single adult will be &euro;220 per week.  That is &euro;220 a week to provide for accommodation costs, heat, light, food, clothing, personal care, entertainment, education, transport, a television licence, communications, refuse collection, household goods, health, insurance and bank charges.  In an ideal world, it is also expected to allow recipients to save for contingencies.  That is an impossible challenge for people on such a low income and yet Government decided not to increase the core payments by &euro;20, not to move to benchmark this welfare payment at the required level and not even to protect its true value compared with last year.  Instead, it decided to increase the income going to a person with an income of &euro;100,000 by more than &euro;900 a year.  This is the wrong priority.<\/p> <p>  Every household is experiencing rising prices caused by inflation but not every household is in crisis.  It is well-documented that low-income homes suffer most.  I refer to people on low hourly wages or fixed incomes such as welfare entitlements.  Supporting these households requires ongoing targeted measures rather than one-off payments.<\/p> <p>  There are also failures with regard to taxation policy.  Some &euro;1.26 billion was allocated to tax initiatives in this budget.  We regret that 67% of the resources devoted to income tax changes were allocated to benefit higher-rate taxpayers.  These are permanent changes, unlike a major part of the resources allocated to poorer people, which are temporary.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the &euro;2.6 million to support delivery of the circular economy strategy.  However, Government missed the opportunity to invest in and secure our energy infrastructure, progress the implementation of the climate action plan and ensure a just transition to a green economy.<\/p> <p>  On housing, the capital allocation, which has increased to &euro;40 million from what was already committed, means funding is insufficient to meet the current target.  An increase of &euro;1.4 billion would be required to increase the target of 9,000 social homes to the 14,000 required to address the social housing crisis.  To meet the demand for social housing, 14,000 are required while 9,000 have been planned for and it looks like even that target will not be achieved.  The additional money is certainly nowhere near what is required to meet the basic requirement of building a housing system that ensures everyone had appropriate accommodation.<\/p> <p>  I have a question, which is more for the committee and other Members than for the Government, although it is also for the Government.  Why does Government continue to hide numbers in the budget documentation?  The Government documentation produced on budget day this year contains less essential information than was available in pre-digital days, 20 years ago.  We can speak with authority on this because we did budget analysis every year for close to 20 years before the digital world arrived.  For example, the key table setting out the impact of all budget changes has been completely removed, which is quite interesting from our perspective.  Why?  Furthermore, the numbers supplied for the health budget - it is not the only one but we will take it as an example - will simply not deliver the existing level of service together with the new initiatives announced by the Minister for Health.  It is impossible to deliver both yet the budget numbers presented suggest it is.  We are simply saying that it is not and that there is something wrong with the numbers.<\/p> <p>  Irish people are very worried about the rising cost of living.  As a consequence, they are spending less.  This means the economy will slow down in the months ahead.  It is widely accepted that low-income households spend heavily within the local economy, supporting indigenous businesses and jobs.  Meanwhile, financial top-ups for the rich tend to be spent abroad and on luxury imports.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s decisions in budget 2023 will see the rich-poor gap grow and the real value of core social welfare rates fall.  This is a disgraceful outcome.  Cabinet Ministers had huge resources available but chose to use them in a way that exposes their lack of a credible anti-poverty strategy.  There is no such strategy in the Government's approach.  Gambling with the lives of Ireland&rsquo;s poorest and most vulnerable is totally unacceptable.  The Government should reverse its decision on core social welfare rates and increase these by &euro;20 a week in the forthcoming social welfare Bill.  Anything less would mean that budget 2023 confirms that the Government has abandoned those most in need of support.<\/p><p> As a republic smarting under Russia&rsquo;s use of energy as a weapon of war, our leaders must move to unite the people in the face of continuing and magnifying hardship.  By not prioritising the poor, this budget has sent the wrong message to the governed, at the worst possible time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear.

To give the committee an idea of the issues I wish to cover, it is not necessarily only about the budget, it is also about how we are choosing to conduct fiscal policy for our small open economy in this particularly uncertain time.  To start with the headline, budget 2023 focused almost exclusively on the current problems.  That is completely understandable but it leaves us in a quandary because many of the problems we have to solve are longer-term structural ones.  I will get on to that.<\/p> <p>  A key issue that has not come out that much in public conversation is what the forecasts of the Department of Finance in the budget documents are telling us.  I will address that momentarily.  It is clear that we now expect inflation to be with us until at least 2025.  We understand, from previous contributions, that this will hurt economic activity.  Growth is expected to slow to 1% or 1.2% next year.  The economy as a whole is expected to grow and give rise to a surplus in the State's finances, but we will also see a range of regressions through the period.<\/p> <p>  An important point in the broadest context is just how big the State is relative to previous years.  The first chart on my slides depicts general Government expenditure in billions of euro.  We will spend &euro;111 billion this year.  That is approximately the same amount as when the banks were bailed out in 2009.  It is approximately &euro;30 billion a year more than it was at the onset of the 2007 crisis.  That is an important point.  We are growing the economy each year but not necessarily having the most in-depth conversation about what that growth means.  Like most economists, I tend to look at modified domestic demand - how much people are going to spend in the real economy on goods and services.  As members can see on the slide, that demand will be down next year.  The forecasts, shown in grey, are modified down relative to the summer economic statement of only a few months ago.  The market and market participants, particularly CEOs of major banks and other commentators, are suggesting that it will be lower again next year.  That creates a sense of uncertainty with respect to the conduct of economic policy at the same time as we are seeing gushing corporation tax revenues coming in from the buoyant multinational sector.<\/p> <p>  As Dr. Healy stated, while the change across different household types from 2021 to 2023 leaves everyone better off in nominal terms, they will be worse off in real terms.  Members can see from my slides that a couple on a fixed income of &euro;49,000 with one earner will be 3.4% better off but, when one corrects for inflation, they will 11% worse off from the 2021-23 period.  Members can see that a person on the minimum wage is slightly worse off again.  All of these combinations mean that it will be very difficult through 2023 to have an economy that is growing in statistical terms but will not feel like it is growing.  Members can see that it is growing over time but that it will create a problem going forward because growth is not experienced quantitatively; it is experienced qualitatively.  People feel like things are just getting slightly worse, and that can have a corrosive effect on many things.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that budget 2023 forecasts show that we are moving to a larger State.  There is very little public debate on how we are going to pay for this.  The excellent report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, of which I am sure members have copies, is essentially a phone-book-size menu of policies that we can use to think carefully about the State.  If one looks at the forecasts of the Department of Finance which are shown on the screen, income tax as a share of the national wage bill is rising quite substantially in the next couple of years, while total tax as a share of modified national income is also rising.  Although in political terms the report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare has, if one likes, been discarded, the forecast of the Department of Finance indicates that this will have to be dealt with in some sense.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that as we move into the future, the size of the State will have to grow.  We have an older population and a climate and biodiversity challenge, and migration is also a major issue.  This is the major point of my remarks.  Budget 2023 did not advance or change the structural questions that we have in this country.  We did not see a big change with respect to offshore wind, for example, which is the largest single opportunity Ireland has to exploit natural resources and generate growth for ourselves for another 50 years.  We did not see large changes to climate change or biodiversity.  We saw nothing to really think about how our inward and outward migration challenges will be met.  Of course, we are rapidly running out of time in which to solve this problem of the ageing issue.  Every year that we delay, the problem gets worse.<\/p> <p>  In my previous appearances before the committee, I have urged, cajoled, harassed and harangued members to consider programme- or performance-level budgeting.  This is vital.  The State is growing.  We are asking taxpayers to pay more.  As we are doing so, we should find ways to reassure them that their money is being well spent in order that social trust is restored and is as high as possible in the services for which everyone pays.  Programme budgeting is well worth doing.  It is a type of budget classification.  Simply put, one will spend money on health - one will simply allocate it to a particular programme and then should be able, at a certain point, to understand whether or not the programme is doing well on the basis of key performance indicators, KPIs.  This should be considered.   The OECD has an excellent report on which I am sure it would be happy to brief the committee if invited to so do.<\/p> <p>  Multi-annual spending ceilings are very important and a welcome addition.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has made the previously that they are a welcome addition to the set of fiscal armature of the State.  They were slightly breached this year, but for good reasons.<\/p> <p>  Reviews of the fiscal rules are coming.  It would be very good if the committee were in a position to understand how those rules might affect behaviour, particularly of the two Ministries with responsibility for finance going forward.  A suggested action for the committee is that some kind of pilot programme of programme-level budgeting should be considered and sourced. <\/p> <p>  The key question is how to rebalance the contributions of multinationals and the domestic sector to economic growth.  This is the big problem because it feels like ti is not a problem.  There is loads of money coming in from corporation taxes, which is great and is essentially funding all the activities of the State going forward.<\/p><p>However, it represents both upside and downside risks to the State.  Overall contributions by tax head from the multinational sector are around 83% over time.  I have provided a table which breaks it down by sector.  The table comes straight from the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  The chart shows that the contribution to gross value added per sector.  Simply put, multinationals do almost all the growing for our economy in the post-austerity era.<\/p><p> My final point is from research that I have just completed.  I have generated a map of the Irish economy, made up of little dots that are sectors.  Healthcare is up the top.  I have coloured them by the percentage of the multinational employment.  The lighter green dots illustrate where there are lots of multinational employment and the darker green where there is very little.  The chart is based on about 2.2 million data points.  The chart shows that multinational activity is concentrated on a bunch of sectors.  There is very little chance of people moving between them and very little knowledge transfer between multinational sectors and the rest of the economy.  This will become more of a problem as we move to become more of a knowledge economy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Stephen Kinsella","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Kinsella and will open up the meeting on the usual rota.

I have to check sometimes.  I welcome the guests and contributors to the debate.  I will comment on a couple of things.  I am reminded of Harold Wilson's Government in the early 1960s when a problem arose.  Every company that was losing money, it was decided to nationalise it.  They ended up nationalising a bunch of losers and they had to denationalise them at a later stage.  That comes about when the state gets involved in running everyone's domestic business and we are in danger of doing that now.  It is a very bad thing to do.  It has contributed to inflation.  When something is put in place, the public expects it to work on the basis that it is primarily to help them.<\/p> <p>  Many across Europe have their eyes on the taxation of multinationals and it is not necessarily for our good.  As far as we are concerned, I strongly believe that we do need to be less dependent on them.  That does not mean that we should encourage them out of the country.  That means that we should use the taxation that accrues from them to ensure that we have something saved for the future or that we find other ways of doing it.  I do not see their existence as a problem at all.  It is only when we become dependent entirely on the taxation levels coming from there.  We have to get around to putting something aside.  I have heard politicians in this House and people outside saying over the last year that there should be nothing for the rainy day fund and that it is a waste of money; that it is raining now and let us spend it now.  That is what happened before the economic crash.  That is precisely what happened.  Everyone said \"we have the money now; let's spend it\".  There is certain expenditure that needs to take place with infrastructure and so on, capital expenditure, but in the event of our getting to the situation where we are funding the domestic economy in terms of the weekly shopping bills etc., that is not going to work.  It has never worked anywhere.  We can complain about it any way we like.<\/p> <p>  I am tired of the continuous barrage of criticism of the state of the country and the budget.  There is very little recognition of where we came from.  Where we came from, not many years ago was an bord snip.  Is there anyone around who remembers an bord snip or an bord snip nua, when Colm McCarthy set about identifying the serious cuts that needed to be enacted as a matter of urgency?  That is only a little over ten years ago.  When that came, it was severe.  The options were simple.  We could take those cuts in general for a certain length of time or accept them permanently for a longer time.  Those were the two options available to us.  We have forgotten about that and we need to think of it very carefully again.  We need to use the resources available now to us to protect ourselves in the event of a weakness and a real rainy day coming over the horizon.  And it could.  Remember that Covid came since then.  After the economic crash we had Covid and all the attendant difficulties that have come with the energy crisis, the war in Ukraine and so on.  There are many things now that we need to be careful about.  We need to provide for their impact in one way or another and we need to use the multinational corporations to do it.  They are very welcome here and long may they stay.  I have been at meetings in Brussels and elsewhere across Europe where they could barely conceal the need to encourage them elsewhere.  There are many personalities that I could name - I do not want to but I have done so before many times - who are interested in ensuring that they do not remain here.  Let us be serious.  I have two or so  of them in my constituency.  Let us recognise the importance of having them here in providing employment, tax revenue and exports, as well as market demands generating local demand and so on.  These are hugely important.  <\/p> <p>  It reminds me of the 1980s, which seems very distant now, when, on a parliamentary visit to Stuttgart, we visited Mercedes which then employed 22,000 people.  We had nothing in this country at the time.  I remember asking if we could market Ireland abroad and to give us the information and we would use it.  There was nothing.  It was done on different basis, which was regional and so on.  Anyway, there were 22,000 people working there at that time.  The company was upgrading and rationalising and there were people who were supposed to be let go.  Automation had come about and so on.  What they did was they retrained the people they were going to lose and used robots and every other means of re-employing them and doubling their output.  I am saying this simply because of this continuous harangue about how bad things are.  I know how bad things are and I have been dealing with people all that time.

It was one of the most serious issues for us.  The first time we negotiated a national agreement was in 1996 or 1997.  Of all the social partners in that particular process, our organisation, not the pillar but just our organisation was the only one of all of them that considered housing to be an issue that was coming down the line.  To the extent that I remember, Bertie Ahern who was not yet in office but was heading in that direction, sent his <i>chef de cabinet<\/i>to give them some kind of briefing on the reason we were maintaining this position.  Anyway, we did not do what we needed to do at that time and as a result, we are where we are today.<\/p><p> There are many things I could say but it is important to recognise that it is not a question of either-or.  We must protect the country's future.  We must provide for the infrastructure.  For example, a dozen years ago our organisation produced a briefing on infrastructure.  I remember having an almost two-hours long discussion with the Secretary General at the Department of Finance at the time and pointing out to him that we had the lowest level of infrastructure investment in all of the European Union but that was not what worried me.  What worried me was that if we doubled our level of investment, we would still have the lowest level of infrastructure investment in all of the European Union.  The point I am making is that on one side, we have argued consistently for infrastructural investment and we will continue to do so.  However it is not a question of doing that and doing things for the future or looking after the poorest and most vulnerable.  We can do both-and.  The choices that were made left the poorest and most vulnerable, the people on core welfare rates and those on low pay in a situation where they would be worse off in 2023 than they had been in 2022.  That is a disgrace, given the levels of new expenditure that were spent in the budget.  It can be rectified.  We are very clear about what needs to be done.  We have said that.  It should start by raising the core welfare rate by &euro;20 a week instead of &euro;12 a week.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#F01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I would like to elaborate slightly for the Deputy.  When we think about macroeconomic risks, the way we think about it is that everything is connected.  One is not bashing the multinational sector except to say that if conditions change and it is more acceptable and more profitable for them to leave, they will.  I was in Limerick in 2009 when Dell left and 4,000 jobs were gone.  If that were to happen again on a larger scale we would see a vast budget deficit, comparable to the economic crisis of 2007-2008.  Right now, when times are good and the economy is going well, things are growing, as we would expect, we must build up our indigenous capacity.  The Deputy gave Mercedes as an example.  Mercedes is a perfect example of something in that it is a company that spent a century developing, subsidising, building and creating a manufacturing capability in Germany.  There are many other examples like it.  We do not have as many examples here.  We know that the 21st century is going to be characterised by ideas and people being able to take ideas and make them real in the economy.  They can do that in Silicon Valley or in Limerick.  In both cases, people just need a laptop and an idea.  They tend to take that knowledge from the places where they learn it and most of those places are in the multinational sector.  That is where the high levels of productivity are.  The research shows it is effectively like a gated community.  When workers go in there they tend not to go back out to the domestic economy, which means that if they leave, that knowledge and those skills are gone.  I agree that we need to spend money and think carefully about how to nurture our own indigenous economies but I would not shy away from recognising the risk, and to be fair the Department of Finance does recognise the risk, that a vast shortfall in corporation tax revenue could cause us, were things to go badly for them.  If you were running a business and most of your revenue came from three or four customers, you would recognise that the fortunes of those three or four customers were of direct benefit and direct importance to your own fortunes.<\/p> <p>  It is not ridiculous to say that the health of the chief executive of a major multinational is a key macroeconomic risk for Ireland because it could genuinely affect us.  Therefore we need to spread that risk out a little bit.  We have a good chance, with the upcoming enterprise policy, to do precisely that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Stephen Kinsella"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I wish to make a quick comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#G00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":328,"content":"<p>It will have to be brief because you are at the end of your time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#G00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Even by my standards it will be brief.

The second thing I would strongly advise is a review of the intellectual property laws around knowledge transfer.  I would connect that to large grants for indigenous companies to set up their own technologies that could actually use these new pathways.  I think about it like this.  Imagine we struck oil off the coast of Galway.  We could one of two things.  We could either contract out and effectively rent out the seafloor to a private company, have it extract the oil and then take a percentage of that or we could try to build our own oil rig.  If you think about it, it sounds ridiculous.  Except, the first oil rig would be crappy, the second one would be better, the third better again and the fourth might be just as good the international ones.  That is how every economy has developed over the past 50 years.  A book that I cite very often is <i>How Asia Works<\/i>.  It describes how South Korea, Taiwan and other countries realised that they did not want just to be multinational export hubs.  They wanted to develop their own industrial capacity.  That is why you have South Korean phones with Taiwanese chips in your pocket right now, and not Irish ones.<\/p><p>The third point is to be utterly ruthless with firms subsidised by the State that do not perform well with respect to export.  If they are not able to export and compete on the global market, let them die.  Do not try to pick winners but certainly call losers.  Deputy Durkan mentioned that we do not want the State getting too involved, but we want it to support innovative companies to a greater extent than it currently does.<\/p><p> We have a very large wind resource.  It is the second best in the world and can generate 75 GW of power if the forecasts are to be believed.  That is incredible and ten times what we think we might use into the future.  We will be able to force these companies to give us a bit of their IP.  In so doing, we will learn to be much better at this as a country.  It sounds fanciful but the history of countries which have developed show us this is the path towards becoming a major industrial power.  I do not mean heavy industry; we can be a light industrial power.  We lost a huge opportunity last year with the Intel fab around Galway.  It would have revolutionised our country.  I do not want to see us miss opportunities like that again because we do not have the fundamental principles there.

Professor Kinsella has noted different weaknesses in our current industrial strategy.  We have weak linkages and spillover between the foreign direct investment, FDI, sector and indigenous businesses.  Would this be different if we had a State-owned enterprise working as a strategic partner?  For example, with the wind energy industry, a State company that was heavily investing, doing large amounts of research and development, experimenting with different technologies, etc.  This would not be to build a national champion but a strategic partner to boost the industry and support it through subcontracting.<\/p> <p>  Professor Kinsella mentioned the success of South Korea in electronics and that.

You want some stable State agency to manage that but that agency should also do the co-ordination and planning to make sure that, for example, fisheries and fishermen's rights were being managed, that there was democratic accountability and that it was not simply a transfer of resources directly to the private sector, most importantly the foreign-owned private sector.  Those are key strategic views I espouse and something with that co-ordination capacity would be vital.<\/p> <p>  I cannot overstress how extraordinary the opportunity is here.

We are talking about renewable energy but that can apply to other aspects of the different crises we are dealing with.<\/p> <p>  Professor Kinsella mentioned the importance of performance budgeting.  I am interested in spending that occurs through public procurement.  Annually, we spend a huge amount of money on this - &euro;20 billion, according to one source - but there is a serious lack of data on it.  The Office of Government Procurement's tendering and spend analysis only comes out every few years.  The European Commission discusses using public procurement for strategic industrial policy purposes and we even have things like green public procurement but I am not sure how we can use it for a strategic purpose when the right data analysis is not there.

That is why I suggested a pilot.  I would start up a new programme or initiative.  It does not necessarily matter which Department it is in.  I would build in the automatic reporting requirements that would be part of any programme-level budgeting.  If, for example, the State is purchasing large amounts of PPE and it is being distributed around the country, where is it being used?  To where is it being returned?  Where is there overuse?  Where is there underuse?  Where is obvious value for money to be found?  There is vast variation around the country depending on individual practices that can be standardised and improved, but only if there is a feedback mechanism through the procurement process.  This could be done intelligently.  The best place in the world where it is done is Australia.  It does programme-level budgeting extremely well, as does New Zealand, which has a similar system.  It finds a way to report back on not just how much is spend but what was done with the spending.  This is the key step.  If you have that, you are able to say \"This was a good programme\", \"That was a bad programme\" or \"We're going to look at that and see how we can improve\".  Until that is done, you are just throwing money at something and hoping it works.  That probably made sense in the 1980s and 1990s when it was much more difficult to capture this data but now that everything is basically in the cloud, it makes more sense to have reporting.<\/p> <p>  The State will get larger.  It is very simple.  The three issues of climate change, ageing and migration alone will force the State to get larger.  We will be taking more taxpayer money in one way or another, through wealth taxes, income taxes, corporation taxes and so forth.  Taxpayers have to be assured that their money is being well spent.  Programme-based budgeting can give that assurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Stephen Kinsella"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses.  Their contributions have been fascinating.  I am not sure what my questions are because I have to absorb so much of what has been said.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting what the ESRI and Social Justice Ireland said, that when you take out the one-off measures it is a regressive budget.  I agree.  That is an important point for us to make.<\/p> <p>  My questions revolve around the latter discussion concerning the way forward.  What do we do with the windfall revenues we have?  Then there is the issue of moving away from reliance on FDI.  The two are connected: we have all these windfall revenues and they are largely from corporate tax receipts, which may disappear at some point.  There is a dilemma.  We need to invest in long-term things, as Professor Kinsella suggests.  We have to invest in housing; that is self-evident.  We have not got enough housing.  We have to invest in public transport; that is pretty self-evident.  We have to invest in renewable energy, as well as in retrofitting homes and making them more energy efficient, insulation and all that kind of stuff.<\/p> <p>  I would argue something that is not talked about enough and that is potentially revenue-generating is the need to invest in a sustainable model of forestry.  That is also related to biodiversity.  Something that is absolutely not talked about enough is that we should invest a hell of a lot more in arts.  If we are talking something at which we could and do excel at a world level, the arts are always forgotten.<\/p><p>I am thinking about how the world is dominated these days by film streaming, gaming and all sorts of creative industries, which are becoming ever more important, yet we put pathetic amounts of money into th arts, even though we are generally held to excel in areas like literature, theatre, music and so on.  We have very low levels of investment there.  Those are just a few thoughts.  I forgot to mention the health service.  In a lot of these areas, in order to do the things that we need to do, we have real shortages in skilled people to do the work.  Many of those things require engineers, architects, construction workers and so on.  Skill shortages are appearing all over the place.  Increasingly, there are signs that young people who are qualifying in these areas are now leaving the country.  We are in a sort of vicious circle.  We need the people who come out of college and qualify as apprentices to do the long-term work to strategically reorientate the economy, but those people are leaving because we have not done those things.  I wonder if the witnesses have any thoughts on those dilemmas.  We are in a bit of a catch-22 situation.  <\/p><p> Certainly, it is not the only thing.  Housing and the cost of accommodation are probably the biggest issues that will be cited by people working in the health service who are thinking of leaving or have actually left.  At least in some cases, we have to increase current expenditure to keep them here, or in education itself.  I think we should get rid of all financial barriers to education because it makes sense for us that people get qualified.  Why are we charging people fees and making it difficult for them to be graduates and postgraduates by charging them excessive amounts of money, or even not paying them to study?  We need them.  For example, I meet regularly with psychologists.  Many young people studying psychology now go to the Netherlands because students do not pay fees there, accommodation is cheap and students are basically financially looked after when they are studying.  In Scotland, they pay people who are training as nurses &pound;10,000 a year to do it.  Here, we make them work for free on placements.  I would be interested in hearing the thoughts of the witnesses on that vicious circle and catch-22 dilemma on the need to have a long-term strategic focus, to reconfigure the economy and reduce our dependence on a potentially precarious FDI sector, but also the need to do things now to hold the young people here, the human resource that we have and that is necessary to do all those things.<\/p><p> My last question is on the nationalisation issue.  Is what Professor Kinsella is saying an argument for a sort of State-driven industrial policy?  I used the example of film.  We put a lot of money into the film industry.  We have been looking at the tax credit.  However, we do not have any major companies of scale in film production in this country.  Should we be doing that to build up an industry?  Should the State sponsor certain strategic industries in a big way rather than just hoping the market is going to do it for us?  Those are my questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#H00600","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy's many comments, I think a lot of them are interrelated.  He mentioned the need to invest in infrastructure.  We would very much be behind that.  While we have these windfall taxes, we need a long-term investment plan for them so that what we do invest in is going to sustain us into the future.  Certainly, housing would be top of the list.  We are hearing stories of teachers and healthcare professionals who are leaving city centres because they just cannot afford it anymore.  Whether they are moving down the country or out of the country altogether, we cannot afford that kind of brain drain, essentially.  We rank 41st out of 63 countries in the IMD world competitiveness ranking.  That feeds into what Professor Kinsella was talking about in terms of how we protect the relationship with multinationals, while also moving towards our goals in relation to the upcoming white paper on enterprise that focuses on building up the capacity of our indigenous enterprises.  We certainly need to do all of that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the health services, in both capital and current expenditure, as Dr. Healy mentioned earlier, there is a complete lack of transparency when it comes to the budget.  The IFAC estimates that we need &euro;900 million just to stand still in terms of our existing levels of service, ELS.  When we talk about increases in the health budget of &euro;1.2 billion, that is really not the increase it appears to be when the majority of that is adjusted to safeguard the existing levels of service.  <\/p> <p>  In relation to the artists, certainly there were some moves made in the pilot on basic income.  We have plenty to say on that, as I am sure the Deputy is aware.  While it is very welcome for those 2,000 artists that it will support, unfortunately, we are closing down artistic spaces.  Again, it goes back to the infrastructure issue.  We are building hotels and closing down theatres, nightclubs and all of those cultural spaces that we desperately need.  In terms of what we need, we need to move away from those regressive measures, we need to build in our infrastructure and we need to plan properly into the future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Bennett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned the corporate tax receipts.

However, as the Deputy has rightly said, we have lots of challenges coming up that are long-term in nature.  The answer to some of this is going to be to spend more money in order to build more houses, reorientate our economy or whatever it is.  We cannot rely on corporation tax receipts for that.

I would add childcare to the list of things we need to spend money on.  The Deputy mentioned that we should be reducing barriers to access to education.

If it is left too late, they simply will not go to university even if the barriers are not there.

It was actually the private sector firms that were put in place and allowed to grow a little bit, but also forced to compete internationally, that really got the thing working.  It was that balance of State control in a certain sense, but also allowing these companies to fail where they obviously did not meet the test of export markets.  There are loads of examples of other countries, for example, the Philippines, where they tried this and did not allow failing companies to fail.<\/p><p>What happened was simply the creation of domestic oligarchs.  We want to avoid that, especially for something as large as the wind industry.  It is so big and there is so much money involved that if we design the system incorrectly, it will create huge pots of money that will generate disproportionate amounts of economic power, and the Deputies will be lobbied by those concerned in the future.  What we create could be privatised later if that is the prevailing mood, but the key is the generation of domestic capacity.  This does not threaten the multinationals in any way.  It implies we are going to do this ourselves and put up with the inefficiency and increased cost in the short term to have greater efficiency and societal learning in the long run.  Thus, we would become the place where you would go if you had to know about wind power.  This is exactly true of Denmark today.  It started building up its capacity 40 years ago and is now the place to go if someone wants to build the stuff up.  The easiest thing to do, or the thing to do at the lowest level of entry, would be to sort out the offshore planning, buy the turbines from Danish companies and have Danish companies install and run them and pay us a fee.  That would be fine but no Irish companies would learn much about how it is done and, therefore, we would always be the client.  Ireland is like an intellectual property warehouse.  We mined the intangible capital for the rest of the world.  It would be much more satisfying and conducive to national economic progress if we were able to generate the intellectual property ourselves, have the ideas ourselves and make it work.  The balance of public and private is needed to make that a big success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Stephen Kinsella","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>On that last point, is Professor Kinsella concerned that most of the offshore wind energy generation being planned will be in the hands of private companies and that there is potential for us to be the prey of speculators who have no real commitment to the welfare or long-term interests of the State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#K00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>That is a possibility if the contracting is got wrong.

I was a bit late for the match.  This discussion is interesting, as Deputy Boyd Barrett alluded to, and many issues are being talked about that we should be talking about for longer and more effectively.<\/p> <p>  Based on what Professor Kinsella is talking about, we may be letting the green-energy revolution pass us by in the sense that if we do not pick up the pace now and take control of our potential, we will end up looking at turbines off the west coast of Galway producing energy but being serviced by others in Europe, saying it is a beautiful site or whatever.  This will happen unless we become a little more brave in what we are doing and expedite the planning process and our intent to take charge as a nation, whether we use private investors or otherwise.  That is an important point we need to discuss.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to losing the potential of a chip manufacturing unit in Oranmore, County Galway.  In a way, that should be a wake-up call indicating we have the potential to do something to create a huge industry on the west coast.  The site is still there.  Potentially, other customers will go there but the reason it was not picked by Intel should be examined.  We should decide to correct the deficiency so we get things right rather than waiting for somebody else to go to the site and ask the same questions.<\/p> <p>  There were many references to Dell this evening.  Digital, which was in Galway, was a major employer.  When it decided to leave, we thought it was the death knell of Galway, but what happened was that many of the people who worked and trained there became business leaders and created factories that are now employing thousands in Galway and the regions.  We undervalue the potential of our population.  We think we have to have somebody with an American accent coming in to tell us how to do things rather than doing things ourselves.  I would like Professor Kinsella's thoughts on that.<\/p> <p>  Let me return to the budget, where we are going with it, windfall tax and foreign direct investors.  There are a number of factors we have to be concerned about.  I agree with Dr. Healy that the budget does not meet the cost of living on an ongoing basis, which it should meet.  One-off payments can be dangerous in that we may have to make a hell of a lot more of them over the next 12 months to see ourselves through a cost-of-living-crisis whose end we cannot now see.  When a one-off payment is made, people expect it every year.  How do we cope with people's expectations?  Maybe the witnesses would like to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  Can they explain how they decided between rich and poor in respect of living standards?  I will leave it at that.  I might have a few more questions later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#K00800","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>On the idea that the budget does not go far enough, which it does not, the committee made recommendations on benchmarking shortly before the  budget was announced.  We would be very much in favour of setting the benchmark at the equivalent of the 2007 benchmark, which would currently be 27.5% of weekly earnings.  We believe it should be phased in.  Our pre-budget proposal was &euro;20, and it continues to be after the budget, as a move in the direction required.  It should come to an increase of &euro;34 on &euro;208.  We are continuing to call on the Government to revisit the decision made in budget 2023 and make up the difference, that is, add another &euro;8 to bring the figure to the &euro;20 that we and others have called for.  What we are dealing with is genuine income inadequacy.  This is not something that is going to go away with short-term measures or universal measures in terms of those who not targeted with the energy credit.  We need to address the poverty issue, and that is an income-adequacy issue.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the rich&ndash;poor barometer, the rich are those who are earning &euro;100,000 per year, compared with those in social welfare.  There is also a middle poor, who comprise those on &euro;40,000 per year, compared with those on social welfare.<\/p><p>Thus the rich-poor weekly gap is a difference of &euro;979 per week.  That has increased since last year.  The middle-poor gap is &euro;572 and has been the same since 2018.

It was an understandable one in some ways due to the massive uncertainty around how inflation is going to progress next year, where energy prices are going to go, and so on.  The trouble with one-off payments is they create an awful amount of uncertainty for people who are reliant on them.  The Christmas bonus is a good example of this.  It has historically been paid every year - for the last number of years anyway - but it is not announced until the budget after the year it relates to.  In October an announcement is made for that Christmas that it either will be paid or a half-rate will be paid, or whatever it is.  It seems to introduce a degree of uncertainty that is unnecessary for people who are dependent on social welfare.  If we get to a stage where the one-off measures are becoming more common or being used as a prop for low-income households where their core rates of payment are not being indexed in line with inflation, then that is going to create more and more uncertainty and it seems a little unfair.  In a situation like the one we are in at the moment where there is so much uncertainty about what is going to happen next year, the one-off payments are maybe a good solution while we figure out where inflation is going to stabilise at.  It is unlikely it will roll back but on the off-chance, maybe the rate at which social welfare needs to increase to meet that - to be indexed in line with inflation whether it is wage inflation or price inflation - would be determined next year.  It is important consideration is given to that next year and we are not continually relying on these one-off payments, which introduce this degree of uncertainty that seems unnecessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karina Doorley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Canney for the question.  The case of Digital in Galway is one of the most studied case studies in all of Europe in the area of industrial development.  Everything from the age of the people involved in setting up the companies, to their particular skill sets and everything else, is well studied.  I can provide the committee with an excellent paper by Dr. Majella Giblin of TCD.  It looks at just what happened in the Digital case.  The success has not been replicated across the country.  Everyone expected, for example, that when Dell left Limerick that another Digital-type scenario would take place but it did not, and there are loads of examples like that across Europe.<\/p> <p>  On the Oranmore site and the Intel decision, I think the company is setting up in Magdeburg now rather than Berlin.  We are used to the Government announcing 200 jobs or 300 jobs and that kind of thing but in a certain sense we finished the year minus 10,000 jobs because of that one decision.  That was not just a chip fab but a fab for fabs.  It would have put us in a geopolitical sense on the same level as Taiwan in the sense of having semiconductors and everything else.  I am not fully aware of why Intel decided not to come, though energy was a big deal.  Having that kind of long-term strategic capability and showing companies like Intel we can do this and generate our own domestic capacity would be well worth doing.<\/p> <p>  I have a final point on coping with expectations.  We have forgotten the art of fiscal forward guidance.  When he was Minister for Finance Michael Noonan did an interview with Miriam O'Callaghan.  This was during the austerity crisis and literally hours after budget 2013.  He said if conditions improved he would slacken the restraints of austerity.  At the time, everybody was aghast that he could be saying such a thing but he was well ahead of the economists in understanding fiscal forward guidance because it changed people's behaviour.  That is very important and we need to get back to a much more coherent fiscal forward guidance if we are to get ourselves out of this.

I think of the disability sector where the Indecon report said the additional living costs for people with disabilities were between &euro;7,900 and something like &euro;12,000 per person, based on 2019 prices.

I apologise as earlier I had to step out to go into the Chamber.  It was to talk about the banks, funnily enough, and what they are doing to us at present.<\/p> <p>  The presentations made were sound and helpful.  I appreciate listening to experienced people like Professor Kinsella and Dr. Healy and getting their outlook not just on this budget but also past ones and looking forward to future ones.  I am taking in what they are saying very closely.<\/p> <p>  Certain things that happen are a catalyst for making us worry about the decision-makers.  We are having such difficulty in the housing market at this time.  This includes the provision of social housing and the young couples who are managing to go about building their own homes but are then faced with a concrete levy followed by a U-turn on that levy.  In the D&aacute;il the other day, I tried explaining to the Taoiseach the harm done to the construction industry and to people's confidence.  I am thinking of the young couples who were going about, or in the middle of, building their homes and then heard the Government thought it was a good idea to put up the price of concrete products by 10%, and we all know that would have finished up being a lot more.  Then very quickly after that the Government began rolling back on that and saying it was going to make exceptions for first-time buyers or builders.  There was all this flip-flopping and total indecisiveness.  That is what is going on in the housing sector for example.  It is why we have such a serious situation.  Everybody knows I have tremendous regard for Deputy Durkan.  I listened closely to what he said about telling Dr. Healy 20 years ago or whatever that housing was going to be a massive problem in the future, and it is.<\/p><p>It is probably a bigger problem than he could have envisaged 20 years ago.  However, my biggest concern is that we seem to be getting nowhere.  With all due respect, if Sinn F&eacute;in were in power tomorrow morning I do not believe it would be fixed.  The way that the housing issue is being tackled is completely and absolutely wrong.<\/p><p> I say this because I want people to realise that when I am talking about it, I have considerable practical experience.  As I always do, I want to declare an interest in housing.  It is not that I got any silver spoon in my mouth or anything.  I did a house when I was 19 years of age.  It was the height of struggling, working at it day and night.  Some friends and I worked with lamps to get that going and I have grown the business since.  That has given me an experience of what is involved in the provision of housing.  Some politicians seem to think that those who are involved in the provision of private housing are some sort of evil people and are doing something wrong.<\/p><p> First, they are paying 56% of their income in tax, which is a great thing for the State.  If they collect &euro;1,000 euro, they have &euro;440 to run the property, pay the insurance, keep the roof right, pay the bills and pay the bank.  People seem to forget about that.  I believe that is an important role when responsible people are at it, but there is an exodus out of it at the moment.  Every friend of mine who had property is getting out because they are being demonised every day by all politicians.  I am not picking on any one group.<\/p><p> If Sinn F&eacute;in says something, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party want to say it louder because they think that must be the right thing to say.  Nobody seems to have an individual thought process and people do not seem to be able to make up their own minds about what is right or what is wrong.  When Irish politicians get up in the morning, they wet their finger to see which way the wind is blowing and that is the way they will walk to work that day because they think they may as well go with the flow.  People need to stand up for something.  People who do not stand up for something, will fall for everything.  We had politicians in the past who knew about building homes.  They knew that local authorities needed to be adequately resourced to build accommodation that could initially be rented to local authority tenants and then sold on to them, which secured that family with a home.<\/p><p> Something that is not being done at all now is a building called a single rural cottage.  Nobody is building them.  Local authorities are not building single rural cottages now.  They were a great thing.  The family provided a site on land, possibly farmland, that was owned by the family and that became their home for generations.  We seem to have forgotten all about that.<\/p><p> I do not want to hog this issue but I have great concern over the future.  In my clinics I might meet a mother having trouble with her housing.  If she has a boy or a girl of 14 or 15 with her, the first thing I think is about the housing needs of that new adult in two or three years' time and that the girl could be a new mom in three or four years' time.  We are not taking care of the parents.  How will we be able to take care of the children when they become parents?  It is a major concern.  I worry enormously when I see politicians who do not seem to have a clue what they are talking about making out that they are the bee's knees when it comes to housing.<\/p><p> I always follow what Dr. Healy says.  I listen very closely to him and I respect everything he has stood for over the years.  Do not get me wrong, there are times when I have disagreed with him on certain aspects.  However, that is good because we cannot agree on everything all the time.  Plenty of other Deputies wish to contribute.

We really need to start moving beyond concrete and moving towards new technologies.  A construction technology centre was launched in July for the purpose of research and innovation on how we build.  That is one aspect of what needs to be done.  We had recommended the introduction of living labs like those in high-net-worth countries such as Saudi Arabia.  It is about getting the experts in a room to thrash out what needs to be done and to make the right models so that we can choose appropriately and procure appropriately.  In that vein, we also need to look at our procurement processes so that we are driving down costs.  Rather than it being a disparate group of builders and developers, we need to create a procurement mechanism where we take the advantage of buying in bulk where that can be done.  Certain measures can indeed be taken.<\/p> <p>  Earlier Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned the introduction of apprenticeships and qualifications.  We advocate for that in the construction sector.  We need onsite learning along with in-class learning whether that is remote or in-person to build on the knowledge of those new technologies that are desperately needed.

There are things that can be done that do not rely on concrete or on single builds which could make a difference in ramping up capacity.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also spoke about a landlord exodus.

There are very few accidental landlords.  At the time of the introduction of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears back in 2011, I advocated that the definition of property within that code should include genuine accidental landlords - people who had bought properties but could no longer afford to live in them, could not sell them because they were in negative equity and were moving back in with parents or renting a room somewhere.  They are accidental landlords.  There are very few of them left in the market now because of the way house prices have gone.  We need to be very clear about what we call accidental landlords.  People who bought a property for a pension or bought a property as a second home, holiday home or for the future use of a child and then rented it out are not accidental landlords.  They bought that property as an investment to be a landlord and the appropriate supports are supports for them to run a business in the same way as any other enterprise would be supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Bennett"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I apologise.

Maybe it is being unable to write off all expenses and so on.  Obviously renting a property is not as profitable as it was expected to be or used to be.  A lot of the demonisation of landlords, as described by Deputy Healy-Rae, stems from the financial crisis where people who had multiple properties for rent were seen to be part of the problem.  The Chairman hit the nail on the head when she said that it may politically untenable to support landlords now.  When tenants are having such difficulty in affording their rents and first-time buyers are having so much trouble finding a property then it does not seem like a logical step to support landlords.

I hate the word &quot;landlord&quot; and believe that it should not exist because there are people who own a property and rent it out in the best way that they can.<\/p><p>I would like to hear what Professor Kinsella has to say about the private rental market.  I ask because if we are going to ensure that in the future there will be a private market then no matter who is in power part of the solution, and not the problem, will be the private side of property ownership.  I would love to see the day when every young couple and person who is starting out could own their own property.  If that could be the case then it would be brilliant but I do not see how that can happen in the real world when one sees the cost of materials and the cost of sites, which make ownership unfeasible.  If politicians continue in the way that they have and hunt people out of private ownership, putting it up to people that they should not be doing that, then owners will sell on but it will not be to somebody else who will rent out the property and that is why the amount of available property is so small.  Any day of the week one can see on <i>daft.ie<\/i>that the amount of properties available to rent is ever decreasing and that is why the housing market is a nightmare.  At my constituency clinics one continually encounters people saying that they are eligible for HAP, are only starting out and in year one, two, three, four or five of what could be a ten or 12-year waiting list for a local authority house or property, if they were to get it, and they ask what they can do in the meantime.  They tell me that they need a private house or apartment and ask where can they get one as it does not exist.<\/p><p>Another thing that has happened is that an awful lot of landlords will not accept HAP.  That situation creates an awful problem because it reduces supply even more.  Where can we go now?  Are we going to finish up with no privately owned properties being available?  If one cannot get a local authority house or apartment when one needs it then there will be nothing else available.  Such a scenario will be an awful situation.  What will the political people who jump up and down and demonise the property owners say then?  One would not want to rely on the politicians who are jumping up and down to create one house for anybody because they never built one or have never done anything except talk an awful lot.  They talk a lot but they would not be practically able to do one thing of any use for anybody.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#N00400","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I could not possibly comment on how qualified the Members of the Oireachtas are to build housing but I can answer the previous question about providing help for property owners.  One can accomplish a lot with very targeted supports.  For example, we know that in lots of rented accommodation the insulation standards are much lower.  If there was a very targeted insulation programme for property owners, and particularly one targeted at landlords, then the State could spend money upgrading properties that would be much more energy efficient, better for tenants and better for the property owners who rent out their properties.  What I have descried is a landlord support that is politically totally uncontentious.  Nobody will kick off about if one simply designs a policy that upgrades a property that will really help tenants, or if one extends a property or one is happy to take on students.  I am the head of a department in the University of Limerick and literally every day I talk with students who cannot find places to live.  We are halfway through the term and there are still students who cannot find a place to live so this subject is at the top of my mind all of the time.<\/p> <p>  There are things like large-scale student accommodation.  Right now if one talked to property developers they will say that it does not pay them to build these things.  It does not pay the universities to build these things.  There is nothing beyond the width of a sensible well-educated society to come up with a solution where we can house thousands of students near universities, stop them commuting from all over the place, improve their quality of life and take away the pressure that they would impose on the rest of the rental market.  The University of Limerick has the largest amount of student accommodation in the country.  We have got 16% whereas most universities are as low as 10%.  Even if my university increased accommodation to 25% then, first, the economics of it currently do not stack up and, second, the lead times are simply too long to help this generation of students.<\/p> <p>  To answer the original question, there are targeted supports that I would like to see as they would upgrade properties and thus help tenants.  In so doing the supports would also help the property owners who rent out their properties.  It is just a matter of designing and framing the policy in the right way.  I do not mean in a sale-like way but designed to help both sides at the same time.  It is not necessarily a tax break, which is the simplest and easiest thing to do.  It is more like if one does this and provide some societal good then there is a benefit to the property owner, to his or her property, to  long-term equity values and so forth.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Stephen Kinsella"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>If Members wish to ask a second round of questions then please indicate while I ask my own questions.<\/p> <p>  I completely agree with Social Justice Ireland.  All of the witnesses have raised issues around the nature of one-off payments for some groups versus permanent changes for other cohorts.  I also agree with the call for an increase of &euro;8.  An issue exists within this prism whereby the financial climate is incredibly volatile, some of the money that we are using to finance current payments comes from a volatile source in the form of corporation tax, and we must also roll into our considerations the idea of not adding to inflation.  It is in that context, and as somebody who supports the position of Social Justice Ireland, how can we mediate that?  What is the right level of one-off versus permanent?

We have dealt with some very important issues for a budget in the first two hours of this meeting but these issues are also important.<\/p> <p>  The financial climate is volatile.<\/p><p>The sources of income, particularly in corporation tax, are volatile.  As we have discussed, corporation tax revenue could fall dramatically.  We do not want to be inflationary.<br\/><br\/>Let us take the last piece first.  People who are in receipt of core welfare rates or on low pay or the minimum wage are not spending their money on luxuries.  Their income is only of a level that barely allows them to survive.  It does not even provide a decent standard of living or a minimally adequate standard of living.  Many people do not have an income per hour equivalent to the living wage.  We have a situation where people are on the margin.  Their money stays locally.  There is not any great danger that our proposal would cause inflation through more expenditure on luxury goods, imports or whatever the issue may be.<br\/><br\/>With regard to volatility, at the end of the day, we are left with choices to be made on a budget.  We have the idea of an overall contribution that goes to everybody in society - universal grants in various areas.  These payments could have been targeted, although maybe not the first time around because they were made in a hurry.  However, there was plenty of time afterwards to work out how that money could be awarded in such a way that there would not be an overall net increase.  At least part of the money that went to wealthy people who did not need it could have gone to poorer people who were basically having to make choices between food and heat.  That has been documented endlessly.<br\/><br\/>On top of that, we must face something else.  It was very well summarised by the Parliamentary Budget Office's, PBO, analysis of the budget.  It is a very good analysis.  Social Justice Ireland had made a similar point regarding the &euro;12 increase but I will cite the PBO in this case because it is probably better to quote another entity, particularly when it is one that is close to the committee and gives it a lot of information.  The analysis stated:<\/p><blockquote>\t  \tThis &euro;12 increase represents a 5.8% increase in 2023 [so, yes, there was an increase] and combined with the &euro;5 increase last year, will result in an 8.4% increase since 2021.  However, accounting for inflation, in real terms the rate will fall 1.2% in 2023 and will have fallen 6.7% since 2021 in terms of their purchasing power.  To keep pace with inflation over 2022 and 2023, the rate would need to be &euro;235.89.  <\/blockquote><p>That is almost &euro;236.00, which is &euro;16 less than the &euro;220 people will get.  We are asking for only half of that &euro;16 figure or &euro;8.  I do not know how to communicate this to people who have the power to make the difference, all of whom are on six-figure salaries.  It is very difficult to explain to people what it means to live on &euro;220 a week, how desperate people are who are in that space and how wrong it is to tease them by giving them a very welcome double week here and a double week there or whatever.  People will not say &quot;No&quot; to that but that is not the way to deal humanely with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>People need security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#O00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":376,"content":"<p>They need security and to be able to plan.

As with any statistical estimate, there will be some underlying variance in the forecast, but it is very clear that overall prices will not go down.  As Professor Kinsella mentioned in his presentation, the consumer price index, CPI, is forecast to increase by around 7% next year, steadying then to around 1.2%.  We are sort of in a new equilibrium where prices are fundamentally higher.  Drawing back to the Chairman's question as to what is the optimal percentage of the budget spend on one-off payments versus structural increases and the parameters in that regard, more emphasis should certainly have been put on increasing the structural parameters in the social welfare system and less weight given to once-off measures.  Whereas once-off measures are quite timely, as the Chairman mentioned, they are by definition less targeted.  However, even though they are less targeted, they will, given their lump sum nature, give a larger percentage boost to low-income households by design rather than anything else.  Then, drawing in the indexation point, it is fair to say that this year and, likely, next year, if indexation does not occur, there will be very high levels of inflation that may be priced into market incomes but are not priced into people who are reliant on fixed incomes, people who might have had a change of circumstances or people who are temporarily unemployed.

That makes a contribution to dealing with the bills.  More than most, I think we could claim that for years we have not just been arguing that the Government should spend X, Y or Z in any year.  In our budget choices document we published earlier in the year we also specify how the money can be raised.

I will put it not only to the ESRI but also, in a moment, to Professor Kinsella.  As Dr. Healy said, the PBO did incredible work this year looking at the budget.<\/p><p>It gave us our own briefing.  Something it did, perhaps to put it in context for members who might not be economists, was to talk about the Estimates for public services in 2023 and the average spend.  It set out an expenditure ceiling of &euro;90,415 million for 2023.  That equates to &euro;172,000 per minute that we are spending.  They are mind-boggling numbers for someone like me.  It goes down to the second too but I will not start to call those numbers.  It was excellent work from the PBO and really useful. <\/p><p> The fiscal rules are suspended, interest rates are going up and we have added to the base, albeit perhaps not as much as all of us want.  Nevertheless, particularly during Covid, we added to our core healthcare spending.  Of the &euro;172,000 we will spend per minute in 2023, &euro;141,000 will be core spending and &euro;22,000 will be capital expenditure.  Is there a concern, even if we have not had it in the past few years, about our debt servicing costs?  What does that look like in terms of the fiscal rules?  Are those conversations we have sort of parked in recent years ones  we must start having again, now the climate of interest rates is changing?  I will start with the ESRI but I assume that Professor Kinsella will want to come in on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#P02200","speaker":"1559","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I will make some brief remarks on that, as I am at the edge of my expertise here.  The rise in interest rates makes the conversation about our national debt more important.  We will be paying more on our national debt.  It makes decisions on whether to borrow much more important because we have considerations about the amount of interest we will have to pay.  The point on the amount we are spending returns to Professor Kinsella's point on the size of the State.  It is growing and there is no escaping that.  If we want to have the state we want to live in where there is a certain universality to healthcare, childcare and all those things we think are important, then we will have to embrace it and raise money from somewhere to be able to service all of that spending.  I am sure Professor Kinsella will have more to say on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karina Doorley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Sometimes it is helpful to be teaching international macroeconomics on a day like today.  The students are doing a debt dynamics analysis for their introductory macroeconomics class right now.  If any of them are watching this, they will get the answer to the test, which I suppose is some kind of reward for diligence.  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has been extremely sensible in previous years when interest rates were very low by refinancing the austerity level borrowing at lower and lower rates.  As a percentage of our total revenue every year, it is actually much lower.  It is like a household's disposable income and its mortgage.  The interest rate of the mortgage does not necessarily matter.  What matters is how much you have to pay in your mortgage every single month relative to disposable income.  Ireland's disposable income is really high and the amount that we have to pay is relatively low.  As that will be true for the next five or six years, we have a lot of runway as interest rates creep up.  The problem is at the end of that five, six or even seven years, when we have to refinance that debt, as if interest rates are much higher then we will hit a fiscal cliff or it will be much more expensive to borrow to refinance the debt that we have already refinanced just to kick the can further down the road.  That is on one side.  We have a nice runway; we should be fine.<\/p> <p>  On the other side, there is a difference between the rate of inflation or the amount that you are spending on your debt and the growth rate of the economy.  There is a very long-standing relationship which is what the students are actually estimating tonight for their assignments.  It shows the amount of interest that you are spending compensated for inflation, I, minus the rate of growth, G.  If that is positive, you are in trouble but if it is negative, you are grand.  That I minus G relationship has been very favourable for us over recent times.  We have been growing really strongly since 2014 even through the Covid era, when the Irish economy performed really strongly.  On our debt sustainability, I would not have too many concerns today.  Even next year, with all the headwinds in the economy it will probably balance out somewhere between 0% and 1%.  I would not be that worried about it.  It is five or six years from now that you would start to get worried but we have time to get the house in order.  As Dr. Doorley says, we have to start having this conversation about how we pay for this bigger state.  The pillars of our state are high-income taxpayers.  People in the top 20% of the income distribution pay a disproportionate amount of all taxes relative to the Nordic countries, say, where as you go down the income deciles, those deciles pay a lot more as a proportion of their income.  You also find much greater wealth and property taxes etc.  It pays for a larger state, which has far fewer debt sustainability concerns.  It returns to the question that Deputy Boyd Barrett asked.  What is the chicken and egg in this regard?  If you invest in productive capability in order that the manufacturing sector in one area such as wind of something else comes up, then that remits tax revenues that can be used to pay for other things.  That is the beauty of structural economic change.  It creates new things, which remits new revenues, which allows the state to grow and allows services to develop.  It is how you get out of the catch-22; in a certain sense, growth is the solution. <\/p> <p>  To return, to the original question of whether the debt sustainability is a problem, it is not something that I would be worried about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Stephen Kinsella"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I am glad we are not worried about it today but of course the committee is meant to be looking at medium term budgets which is three to five-years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#Q00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":413,"content":"<p>Indeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022101900002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Stephen Kinsella"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":414,"content":"<p>We proposed an idea about how to deal with the longer-term danger.

The one year that does not, credibility goes out the window.<\/p> <p>  Much of this stuff has been studied in the monetary policy literature to a much greater extent than fiscal policy.  In fact, one of the world's great experts on central bank communication is Professor Michael McMahon of Oxford.  He is also deputy chair of IFAC.  If he is in, I recommend that the Chairperson listen to him before she listens to me.  However, I have read Professor McMahon's papers.  The basic synopsis is that one needs to be able to show how one's theory of the world is changing as new data comes in.  For example, if it turns out that corporation tax revenues fall for whatever reason and the chief executive of a major technology company has a heart attack or something, one needs to be able to show that one's guidance has changed and here is how it has changed.  That kind of policy communication is important, particularly for households.<\/p> <p>  I have been a professional economist for more than 20 years and I talk to lots of people all over the country about the economy and what it means to them.  I made a statement earlier on that people do not experience the economy as GDP, percentage changes in consumer price index, CPI, baskets or whatever.  It is only a qualitative feeling that things are getting slightly worse.  The way to communicate these kinds of changes and what one will do to alleviate them is also to speak qualitatively.  That is where previous Ministers for Finance - I mentioned former Deputy, Michael Noonan, because he was pretty good at this - got it right.

It might not be the average citizen who is changing his or her behaviour, but it certainly would be, for example, industry group.  It would be lobbies.  It would be certain sectors of the economy that pay particular attention to the pronouncements of Government.  One can certainly have their attention on a much greater level.  The more clearly one can communicate to them, the better.  The perfect example that is going wrong is the concrete block levy.  It is not only bad economics; it is a bad policy.  It was badly communicated.  It is kind of a case study or at least it will be when I update my slides.  It is an interesting way to think.

I previously said to this committee that neither I nor the Government would be found wanting when it comes to trying to addressing the question of sustainable funding.  In working with this committee to make progress, we really believe sustainably funding higher education has a profound impact for our economy, society and the citizens we all serve.  Therefore, I am pleased to be with here today to discuss our progress in implementing Funding the Future, our policy response to underfunding in the sector.  Indeed, earlier today we had an implementation group meeting where we had a chance to meet with all of the stakeholders.  This is an implementation group which I co-chair with Professor Anne Looney and Professor Tom Collins.<\/p><p>However, it would be remiss of me not to note the work of this committee in its report on sustainable funding.  I thank the committee for sending it to me.  As I outlined in my written response, a great many of its recommendations very happily dovetail with our priorities in Funding the Future,<i><\/i>particularly the focus on staffing ratios and on quality and how those two important strands inter-relate in higher education.<\/p><p>The committee will recall that Funding the Future<i><\/i>went beyond being a direct response to the European Commission's Directorate-General reform review because it also tried to settle the question of the funding model and the funding gap.  It provided a clear and detailed economic assessment as to the funding options presented in the Cassells report.  As was requested by this committee in 2019, the Government ruled out the possibility introducing student loans in the system.  The Government committed to a multi-funded model of additional Exchequer investment and employer contributions through the National Training Fund.<\/p><p>In this year's budgetary process - this was an important development, and I hope a welcome one - we also committed to publishing an annual paper in advance of the budget on the cost of living and the cost of education in Ireland.  That enables Government, the Opposition, stakeholders and this committee to scrutinise the various options available to reduce the cost of education for students and their families.  The first of these assessments was published by my Department in August and it informed our decision-making in the Estimates process.  I am sure we will have a chance to get into the detail of Funding the Future as we work through the questions.  I will take my comments on as read, other than to say we are providing significant additional funding this year that will see a significant increase in staffing in the sector, which is important; a reduction in the staff-student ratio; and an opportunity to build capacity in the technological universities in regard to that.  There will also be funding that will enable joint programmes to be co-designed across further educational training and higher education.  This is a really key aim.<\/p><p>In terms of student accommodation, I want to be very clear on it.  I have been pretty upfront about this and I do not think the current student accommodation strategy is fit for purpose.  Much has changed in the world since it has been in place and we need to develop another one.  The last thing we need to do is to start writing that now.  The first thing we need to do is to look at the universities that have planning permission and to get building.  That is what my Department is working on.  It is finalising a proposal, which I intend to take to Government in the next few weeks, that will try to see Exchequer funding for the first time put into helping make student accommodation projects on publicly- or university-owned land with planning permission viable.  As we get into 2023, we will look at replacing the existing student accommodation strategy and we look at the technological universities and others and their capacity to develop accommodation.<\/p><p>I want to touch on the issue of PhD students.  We had a discussion on it during oral parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il last night.  I committed on that occasion to carrying out a national review of PhD student supports, PhD stipends and how we look after our PhD students in this country.  We have a lot of work to do.  I have been very clear that this needs to be an external review and I would like to share the terms of reference with the committee.  The scope of the review will include current PhD candidates' supports.  This includes: financial supports, such as stipends, SUSI and others; the adequacy, consistency and equity of current arrangements across research funders and higher education institutions, including equity and welfare considerations; the status of PhD candidates and this debate around the student versus the employee, including a review of international comparisons and models; the impact on the funding of research programmes of any adjustments to current rates of support; graduate outcomes for PhD graduates, including return on investment and benefits to the learner; future-proofing supports; and visa requirements and duration for non-EU students, mindful that this is a matter for the Department of Justice and will require collaboration with that Department.  In the coming days, I will announce the external chairs of that group.<\/p><p>These are requirements and duration for non-EU students, mindful that this is a matter for the Department of Justice and will require collaboration with that Department.  I will announce the external chairs of that group in the coming days but I wanted to share that with the committee.  It is my aim for it to conclude its work in early 2023.  <\/p><p> On the issue of North-South cross-Border enrolment, I would like to thank the committee for its thoughtful contribution to the question of North-South enrolment in tertiary education in this report, and specifically its series of recommendations.  The Chair will be aware that I have provided under a separate cover a detailed written response to that report and it is a very timely contribution to the question of North-South student mobility.  I am convinced not just of the need to facilitate mobility, but also to ensure that firm foundations of collaboration between further and higher education institutions are protected and enhanced.  There are common challenges facing education systems, North and South, and it is in the interests of all of us on the island of Ireland to ensure that every young person and every person on the island has access to the best possible educational opportunity.  This is vital not only to our shared economic prosperity but to underpinning peace on the island.  I also expect in the coming days to be able to make a significant announcement on the development of all-island research centres which I know is something this committee supports and has an interest in.<\/p><p> The final issue the committee asked me to touch on briefly and I am sure we will then engage on it, is with regard to the withdrawal of accreditation for the applied social care course at the Dublin Business School, DBS.  I fully respect CORU's role as an independent regulator.  That is right and proper.  I also fully support the regulation of the profession.  It is a good step forward in terms of standards.  There must be appropriate mechanisms to ensure fitness to practise and the protection of the most vulnerable in society, so regulation is being introduced and the system is currently undergoing the transition to accreditation.<\/p><p> The social care workers register is due to open on 30 November 2023.  This would begin a two-year transition period for existing practitioners to apply to register with CORU.  On 30 November 2025, the title \"social care worker\" is due to become a legally protected title in Ireland.  My officials are engaging with all relevant parties and will continue to do so.  I have been very clear regarding the need for refunds from DBS to students and a recognition of the difficulties they have encountered.  I also believe we need to look at how we ensure students can continue their studies and how they can transfer where possible to the Technological University, TU, Dublin.  I want to thank TU Dublin for a very active engagement with Quality and Qualifications Ireland and DBS and for all their efforts to work out a solution for DBS students.  I am happy to share more information in the questions.

I will go straight for it so in terms of North-South enrolment and the Minister's comments on it.  I welcome some of the Minister's comments but am a bit concerned that he talks about what has already been done.  I acknowledge the good collaboration between some of the institutes, and the research hubs and the development in that regard.  There is still greater potential there.  It is the student mobility part that we have to take very seriously.  I am disappointed and maybe we can have further discussions on why I think we need targets.  It is a bit like increasing female representation in politics if we do not have targets.  I feel we are a quarter of a century after the Good Friday Agreement and it concerns me that we still have such a low number of students going from North to South and South to North.  There is a much wider issue here than education in terms of embedding peace and reconciliation, and increasing the understanding that we need across the island.  I see the way those who are at third level from North and South engage and it does not matter what their constitutional aspirations are.  The engagement that is there and that then spreads out in third level institutes is really positive and something we need to do.  I ask that we look to see what more can be done there with the shared island unit.<\/p> <p>  I would particularly like to highlight the recommendation around adjusting grades from A-levels into leaving certificate points because that is probably the single biggest barrier to students from the North coming South.  It has become more acute in recent years as we have had grade inflation in this State.  It is something we need to look at further.  We will have a number of witnesses before the committee to discuss this further so I ask the Minister to keep an open mind on it and see what ways we can work together specifically to get rid of some of these barriers.  I know from talking to students and parents from the North that it is easier for someone from the North to go to Oxford or Cambridge than to go to the University of Galway, Dublin City University or one of those.   We have to hear that and try to unblock those things so I hope we will have further discussions on it.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome the setting up of the review group.  Deputy Harris said in May this year that the funding gap would be closed over the next three budgets.  Is that still the Minister's intention?  <\/p> <p>  Regarding student accommodation, I want to ask about the links to affordability and how the Minister will ensure it.  If third level institutions were to borrow all of the money they would have to charge roughly more than &euro;12,000 per year to cover the cost of student accommodation as it is at present.  That is not affordable accommodation as I know the Minister will understand.  <\/p> <p>  We talked last night about the PhD researchers and we need to look at the apprenticeship model to see what we can learn from that and how we can put that into place.<\/p> <p>  It is very important that each of the CORU students have a place and have a pathway.  There needs to be lessons learned for the future from what has happened to them.  I want to see each and every one of those students have a pathway and obviously be reimbursed.  We have a responsibility, albeit that their education was being provided by a private institute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#B00700","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Conway-Walsh.  I wish to assure her that my position on North-South is not just to list all we are doing and all that we have done.  I genuinely share her view and am more convinced by the day from my engagement North-South, and from my visit to Queen's University Belfast where I gave a guest lecture over the summer months outlining my vision for an all-Island approach to higher education.  It makes sense.  I agree with the Deputy that regardless of one's political persuasion, the community one comes from in the North, on an island as geographically small as the island of Ireland it makes sense to work together just like we are in healthcare.  As I said in my opening statement I also believe it makes sense beyond education.  It makes sense in terms of embedding peace, in terms of getting to know each other and having a better understanding.  There have been a couple of developments.  The Higher Education Authority Act 2022, as I am delighted to now call it because the HEA Bill is now the HEA Act if anyone is wondering, is now the law of the land.  We will move to commence that.  We engaged on Committee and Report Stages on this legislation.  It is a very clear function now for the HEA in terms of the promotion of cross-Border collaboration on higher education.  It is now a function of the Higher Education Authority, very clearly and explicitly in that law.<\/p> <p>  Second, we are currently carrying out research to try to move beyond the anecdote in terms of student mobility and why people come or do not come North-South or South-North.  I do not mean this in any way regarding Deputy Conway-Walsh's comments because she could legitimately throw it at me too.  We are doing this research through the HEA to try to get under the bonnet as to what is going on in student mobility.  We have the common travel area but why is student mobility somewhat stuck North-South and indeed east-west?  We hope to publish that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#B00800","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":446,"content":"<p>We have outlined that in the report.

I will not take too much time on this but there are a number of real actions that we are taking to try to accelerate all-island collaboration in both further and higher education.  In 2023, will see the development of the first all-island apprenticeship, likely in the area of construction.  Construction workers move around the island and it makes sense for the apprenticeship model.  Also in 2023 there should be an all-island approach to medical education.  We are almost there and have a bit of work to do.  There has been a lot of really good work by my colleagues on that issue.  We will likely see this month, if not next month, significant announcements on all-island research centres.  We will talk about that.  As soon as tomorrow I will be updated by officials on the work our Government is doing to advance our commitments on the New Decade, New Approach deal as regards Magee College.  I know this is an important interest for this committee and I will keep it closely informed.<\/p> <p>  On the &euro;307 million, it is my intention to close this gap as quickly as possible.  I want to see this gap closed ideally in the lifetime of this Government.  That is where the three budgets comment came from.<\/p><p>It is true, as we have discussed before, that ensuring people had food, light, heat and so on had to take priority in the measures we took in what became a cost-of-living budget.  However, we managed to receive significant investment and I am pleased with how it has landed with the implementation group for Funding the Future.  I will send the committee a note rather than taking up its time on this.  There will be an additional &euro;17.8 million for the universities and specialist colleges to strengthen capacity and resources, including effective staffing and reducing the staff-student ratio.  The technological universities will also receive &euro;17.8 million to strengthen their structural capacity in staffing and posts.  Increased funding of &euro;2.4 million will be allocated to medicine places and I am particularly excited about the &euro;2 million to develop, co-design and co-deliver programmes between further education and training, FET, and higher education, HE.  These are the additional Funding the Future measures and this is what the additional money will do.  I will send the committee a detailed note on that.<\/p><p> The question on accommodation and affordability is valid.  It is also the focus of our work.  We cannot hand out taxpayers' money and be mute on the issue of affordability.  I cannot get to where we are going immediately because I need Cabinet approval but I intend to go before the Cabinet committee on housing this month.  We will make proposals on how we believe we can help to get a number of projects that have full planning permission unstuck.  That is step one.  We have set up a specific unit in the Department dedicated to student accommodation.  There are a number of ways to slice and perhaps address the issue of affordability.  I will be happy to come back to this committee for its views and input once those proposals are available.<\/p><p> Regarding the PhD issue, the Deputy referred to the apprenticeship model last night in the D&aacute;il and again in the committee today.  I spoke about whether a PhD student should be treated as a student or an employee.  Different countries do different things.  What is the best model?  The scope of the review is broad enough to cover all of that.  It is clear this will not only be about the appropriate level of stipend.  That is important and it needs to be higher, but we also need to consider what other issues need to be addressed such as terms, conditions and pathways.<\/p><p> In the interests of time, I can send the Deputy and committee a note on DBS.  The work on this matter is ongoing.  The committee will be aware that a total of 85 learners were impacted by DBS.  It is a private college but I do not say that to wash our hands of the issue.  We want to help.  Of the 85 learners, 15 graduated in 2022 and 2021, 37 were part-time learners and 31 were full-time learners.  The 15 graduates have the option - and I am not trying to speak for them because I take the point that everyone is an individual - to avail of grant parenting provisions to become eligible for the register.  The existing students who have not yet graduated need to see how they can continue their studies.   Both TU Dublin and the Open Training College, OTC, are likely options but conversations are ongoing and we will continue to keep the committee updated about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#B01000","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the team from the brand-new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  It is fantastic that we have this Department that is driving change and legislation, including the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022 which is ground-breaking legislation.  It will drive funding in the third level sector.<\/p> <p>  It is great to see the detailed update the Minister gave to the committee.  The &euro;1,000 reduction in the registration fee provided for in the budget is extremely welcome.  Parents and students have been given a deadline of the end of November to engage with their colleges and share their account details.  I will also highlight that the SUSI application deadline is 3 November 2022 for any students who need to apply for that.  The Minister is considering a review of that scheme as well.  Hopefully the double payment will be made in December.<\/p> <p>  I was at a great event in Ballinasloe on Tuesday.  The brand-new Technological University of the Shannon, TUS, in Athlone is establishing learning gates.  I was not sure what a learning gate was.  It is where students can come together and have a space to learn.  Ballinasloe Area Community Development has a meeting room that students can access.  They can access courses online and study in an environment where other students can also meet.  The technological university will open 11 learning gates in the next few weeks and is even considering opening one in Dublin.  It is phenomenal that we are seeing this outreach.  I want to see campuses and centres of excellence in our regions, especially in Roscommon and east Galway, because that drives regional investment in our areas.  It also drives excellence in academia because it engages and shows there is a focus.  We need to see investment in the regions as well as in city centre locations and to work with different agencies in local areas to promote that.  I am interested in the Minister's thoughts about regional development and how TUS has been able to do that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding PhDs, it is fantastic to see the review.  Having worked in Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, I am aware of the challenges relating to supporting PhD and master's degree students.  The Minister indicated the review will examine the status of PhD students, the stipends - of course &euro;500 has been allocated in the budget - and international comparisons.  Will the Minister provide a timeline?  Is there a country that the Minister thinks manages PhDs best and is the one to look at?  I am looking at the quality we have.  Ireland ranks highly in expertise in many sectors and research areas through its principal investigators.  Those principal investigators drive the funding that comes through SFI and the Irish Research Council, IRC, and then brings the PhD teams to Ireland to deliver and develop excellence here.<\/p> <p>  The Minister highlighted student accommodation as being one of the Department's key priorities, with a dedicated unit.  I was delighted to hear about a 674-bedroom development when the Minister was visiting the brand-new University of Galway.  Will he provide a timeline for that?<\/p> <p>  It is wonderful to hear about Funding the Future.  The Minister stated the implementation team had been recruited.  Will he update the committee on any outcomes from that?<\/p> <p>  I am happy to see the co-design between FET and HE.  In relation to education and training boards, ETBs, I have a few questions about how the Department funds SOLAS which delivers FET and ETBs, but the Department of Education funds the administration and running of those organisations.  Does the Minister have any comments on that?  It can sometimes be a challenge in how we develop the staffing and capacity to deliver these courses, which the Minister stated is crucial, especially on the FET and HE side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#C00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":450,"content":"<p>The Senator covered a lot of ground so I hope she will bear with me.  I thank her for working with me on the Higher Education Authority Bill.  I enjoyed and appreciated her input.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased we have managed to reduce the student contribution fee by &euro;1,000 on a one-off basis.  I am equally, if not more, proud that we have come up with a proper structure to look at the issue of registration fees and grants in the round from next year.  Senator Malcolm Byrne and I debated this point at different times but I think we have landed in a good place, because we have said everybody will receive &euro;1,000.  That is a cost-of-living measure and like many cost-of-living measures, it is universal and will be paid before the end of the year.  Some 94,000 students will benefit.  From next year, we have made a permanent reduction of &euro;500 and linked it to the SUSI system.  We have introduced an income threshold of &euro;100,000 and a reduction of &euro;500.  That gives me and any future Ministers or Governments the ability to look at the registration fee as part of the overall grant system in future budgets.  That is a good way of doing it as we will not be having separate conversations about SUSI and the registration fee.  We are looking at the system and structure of the cost of education.<\/p> <p>  One of the good ideas to come out of the Funding the Future paper was a recommendation by one of my officials that we publish an annual cost-of-higher-education paper in advance of the budget.  It has been done by the Department of Social Protection for many years.  Papers on tax and welfare are published.  We had not exactly been forgotten, but we were not up in lights in advance of the budget.  This means that every year the Oireachtas, media, stakeholders and everyone else will get to see, debate and consider what could be done to help to reduce the cost of education, how much it would cost and the best choices available.  That can only be good.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased that SUSI will issue double payments on 16 December 2022.  That will come at a welcome time for many families and crucially the SUSI grants will rise by between 10% and 14% from January 2023.   Last year and in most previous years, when SUSI grants rose, students had to wait until the following college year.  They will rise from January 2023, which is important considering the pressure people are feeling.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in hearing more about the learning gates and perhaps going to see some of them.  It is a good idea.  The technological universities at their core are about regional development.  They are about bringing access to education into the regions.  They are about moving beyond the outdated concept that all roads from an educational point of view must lead to a big city.  We have had a lot of success in recent years in setting up technological universities.  I thank the committee for its work on this.<\/p> <p>  Capital investment is badly needed in the facilities. We will have an announcement at the end of this month or the beginning of next month on significant capital funding for technological universities.  Many have applied.<\/p><p>That will come shortly.  On research, we are making sure there are research-intensive institutions, looking forward to the ring-fenced funding for the TUs that will come through the European Regional Development Fund.  I think it is a fund of approximately &euro;80 million.  The third is a meaty piece of work.  There is a lot of work going on in my Department and with the OECD on academic contracts.  Again, this is not about foisting something on people; it is about engaging and offering the contract so these TUs can reach their full potential.  Now that they are set up, they are the three big things that are important.<\/p><p> On the PhD review, the timeline is that it will kick off in November and conclude in early 2023.  We need to talk to them first, but I will announce the external chair or chairs of that by the end of the week, I hope, or certainly in the next week or so.<\/p><p> On the 674 beds in Galway, I had a chance to view the site when in Galway with the Senator for the renaming of the University of Galway.  My understanding is that construction is due to be completed in January.  There is then the fit-out process and all of that, so they will be on stream for the next academic year.  The membership of the implementation group is quite broad but it contains the heads of SOLAS, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, Irish Universities Association, IUA, the president of the Students' Union, the general secretary of ICTU, representatives from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the head of Aontas, representatives from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Department of Education, my own Department, IBEC and me and the two co-chairs, Professors Tom Collins and Anne Looney.  I think I have covered all the questions.  I would also like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to Patricia King on her retirement from ICTU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#C00300","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#D00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I join with the previous speaker in congratulating the Minister on the Department and its success.  Some of us were unconvinced as to the necessity of a new Department but it has proven its worth.  It is now a feature and a fixture and deserves to be.  The Minister made a success of it and that needs to be acknowledged.  We share many aspirations about free education, particularly in the area of literacy, which he has done great work on and I congratulate him on that.<\/p> <p>  On the cross-Border piece, I want to focus on one issue today, if I might, which feeds into the cross-Border discussion.  On teacher training, to put it delicately, there is an issue regarding the cohort of teachers we are training and the qualifications that necessitate their access to teacher training courses.  Barriers to teacher training are placed in front of young people from certain backgrounds. They might be from disadvantaged or Traveller backgrounds or they could be from the North or overseas.  Some of those barriers relate to the Irish language.  This is a difficult one to verbalise because many people feel very strongly about the Irish language, as I do myself; I have a degree in Irish.  I try to pronounce my name to people with great difficulty in every election.  The serious point is that the requirement of the standard of Irish to enter training colleges needs to be challenged.  What we need in teacher training is a diverse population of teachers in our primary schools that reflects the children they are teaching.  It is still a very white, middle-class teaching profession.  It does not reflect a new Ireland or any new Ireland we want to promote.  The Irish language could also be seen as a barrier, particularly in terms of the North.  Would it not work better, considering the new Ireland we hope to engage with, to have people from more disadvantaged backgrounds, who may not have had higher level Irish as an option in their second level school?  They certainly might not have had the chance to go to the Gaeltacht three summers in a row for financial reasons.  Would it not be better to focus on their ability to learn and teach Irish when they are in training college, rather than as a requirement to get into training college?<\/p> <p>  It is still such a powerful profession.  If someone comes from a minority, be it ethnic or any other kind of minority, particularly disadvantaged children, and if he or she has somebody from his or her community as a learning and educational leader in the classroom, it is incredibly powerful.  While it is not the only barrier, perhaps the Irish language requirement could be tweaked a little, not in any way to reduce the quality of Irish language teaching in the classroom, but to do it in a way that teachers are empowered to teach Irish better when they are in training college, rather than having that funnel exclude some people who may not have had the opportunity to learn Irish at second level.  They could be students from the North or a disadvantaged background or abroad.  How powerful would it be to have somebody who came here as an asylum seeker working as a primary school teacher?  The one reason they probably cannot is the requirement to have Irish entering teacher training college.  It is an issue I have tried to pursue for a long time.  At one point, we had a number of students from DEIS second level schools in my constituency learning Irish and getting grinds in Marino Institute of Education.  That was a solution.  Some managed to achieve the required Irish language level and they became teachers.  We were proud of that, but it is not a long-term fix.  I wanted to bounce that off the Minister, to use this platform to raise it and see if he has any sense of how we could move on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#D00400","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I should acknowledge, because it is the truth, that the Deputy was the first Oireachtas Member who spoke to me about the issue of adult literacy.  We have been doing a lot of work on it as a Department, trying to advance some of the issues we discussed.  We now have a national programme office set up to deliver the new adult literacy for life, ALL, strategy, as well call it.  Probably more importantly, flowing from that, we are actively putting in place regional literary co-ordinators.  Key to the progress of this strategy is that it is not a document that resides in Dublin or the Department or an office, but that we empower communities to see what they need to do in their area to roll out literacy initiatives.  For some, that might be through their local sports club or other local organisations.  However, I acknowledge that there is significant work going on.<\/p> <p>  Before straying, the issue of teacher education still resides in the Department of Education and the initial teacher education unit.  I can certainly refer these views to them and seek a view and engagement from them.  Having acknowledged that it is within their area of responsibility - this is a personal view - but in general, as we try to reform the education system, we should be more concerned about the standards somebody has obtained upon exit of university, as opposed to on entry.  That is not a bad philosophy to approaching this.  We have seen good practice in the likes of Dublin City University, DCU, which the Deputy will be familiar with given his geographic location.  We have seen good examples from DCU where they go out into communities, particularly into socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, to identify potential teachers among young people through local community groups and sports clubs and try to mentor, identify and encourage them to take the plunge.<\/p> <p>  My Department has the programme for access to higher education, PATH, bursaries, which are access to education bursaries.  There are specific bursaries now in place for members of the Traveller community who wish to access teacher education.  That is a slightly wider point I am making than specifically around the Irish language issue.  I will certainly feed those views back.  In general, and I saw it in my time at the Department of Health, diversity in professions is a good thing.  If our professions are not diverse, it stores up a lot of issues, including the lack of role models and identified people for all communities.  Professor Anne Looney, who is probably well known to the Deputy, is co-chairing our implementation group.  She leads the teacher education initiative in DCU.

The Minister will appreciate that my job over the next five and a half minutes is not to spend my time praising him but to focus on a couple of the key outstanding issues.<\/p><p>I will put one question directly, before coming to others.  The Minister made a commitment that the sum identified in Funding our Future - &euro;307 million, which is the funding shortfall for the higher education sector - would be addressed over three budgets.  While I appreciate his point, I think that the &euro;40 million in the budget this year only went part of the way and represented a disappointing movement on the &euro;307 million shortfall.  There are two budgets left, however, assuming the Minister remains in the Department.  That means we are going to have to look at an additional &euro;130 million, or more, in each of budgets 2024 and 2025.  How confident is the Minister that the balance of the sum that has been identified - the shortfall - will be delivered?  How committed is he in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#D01100","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I am very committed.

I have had great support from the Taoiseach on this.  I want to genuinely acknowledge that, but it will require a collective effort from the whole Government.  There are a couple of reasons to be hopeful.  One, we need to grapple with the National Training Fund surplus.  I am not suggesting that it is easy; it is not.  If it was easy it would have been done already, but it still needs to be done.  For anyone watching these proceedings, the National Training Fund is an account that employers across the country pay into.  It has a very large surplus, which will amount to over &euro;1 billion shortly.  It is on track to go to over &euro;2 billion in the coming years.  That was always being paid into to provide additionality in terms of skills and training.  That is one helpful suggestion I make to broader government-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#E00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":462,"content":"<p>That is not going to make the full &euro;130 million next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#E00300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Given that it has over &euro;1 billion sitting in it and soon it will have &euro;2 billion, I believe it could if there was a political will and a bit of ingenuity.  I am not saying it should, though.  I believe it is a pot that needs to be considered.<\/p> <p>  I would like to mention a second issue that did not get enough of a hearing, although it got a fair hearing today at the implementation group from the sector, which I appreciate.  We all talk about the &euro;307 million, including me.  We are all committed to filling that hole.  We did something else in the budget, however.  If we had not done it, the hole would have grown.  There &euro;307 million in money owed to the sector.  I acknowledge the work of my colleague the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, on this.  We got agreement for the first time to fund every new additional student entering college from September at the new higher Funding our Future rate.  Every new additional student who goes into college from September will be funded 25% more in terms of funding to the university than students currently.  As that washes through the system, for want of a better phrase, it means we become sustainable from this moment on.  I said very clearly to the IUA and others that if we had not done that - if we had announced a larger sum for the core funding but not done that - we would have created another problem.<\/p> <p>  The third thing is that this is year one of implementation; it truthfully is.  It is the first budget we have received for Funding our Future.  Of course, we would all have liked it to be higher but we had to balance it with the cost-of-living pressures for students and their families and the significant investment we put into that.  It will require time to build up our own capacity as a sector in terms of delivery.  There are some key things, as we said at the implementation group today.  We will need to prove that the &euro;40 million makes a real and tangible difference, particularly in terms of staffing ratios, and does not - I am not suggesting this will happen - disappear or go into block grants.  I think it could make a difference of at least half a point in the staff-student ratio this year.  That is a tangible thing.  When we go back to the Estimates discussions next year, we will be able to look at what we did with the &euro;40 million and imagine what we can do into the future.  I will work very closely with the Senator on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#E00400","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

As the Minister knows, there is a significant cost to higher education institutions to be able to provide such accommodation in a way that will be affordable to students.  The only way that is going to be done at present in most cases is where there are supports made available from the State for the provision of student accommodation.  I know the Minister has indicated support for this.  Will we be able to see that for 2023?  Can we see that in a way which ensures that at the start of the 2023-24 academic year, we may be able to see a level of State investment to support on-campus student accommodation?  Critically, it must be affordable for students to rent thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#E00700","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I am not just an individual Minister who is saying he would like to do something about student accommodation and asking whether somebody should do something about it.  Thankfully, it is more than that.  At a Cabinet committee on housing in July, I think, the Taoiseach and I strongly put forward the view that there was a need for an intervention and the Taoiseach provided his imprimatur for this to happen.  Since then, we have been working on developing proposals for how we can unlock or unstick, in the first instance, universities that have planning permission today.  This is not a critical comment on them; far from it.  It has not been viable for them to build.  We will be returning to the Cabinet committee on housing this month and then, ultimately, to the Cabinet to try to press \"Go\".  I imagine it may be done project by project.  Affordability will be an element.  We cannot have a situation where the State is paying money and is agnostic on the issue of affordability.  I will not read out the entire list of those with whom we are working closely.  I can share the list with the committee.  There are five traditional universities today with planning permissions to build.  If you look at the totality of that, you are talking about a significant number of beds that could be built.  Will all these beds be built for 2023?  Of course they will not.  That is not what the Senator is asking.  If we are to move beyond the annual September crisis around student accommodation, at some point somebody has to take the bull by the horns and try a new model; that is what we are going to do.<\/p> <p>  The second piece will have to involve the technological universities.  The Senator will be familiar with the position in the south east.  With the exception of the former Waterford Institute of Technology, they have never built a student accommodation bed.  I am not being critical of them because they had not been allowed to do so under the borrowing framework.  We have now clarified under the borrowing framework that they can.  When we met the chairs of the governing authorities, our message to them was to get ready and begin to prepare their plans.  That will be coupled with the new student accommodation strategy.

The third thing that is crucial to a research strategy, in order to ensure we do not get bogged down in the organisations that run it, is the purpose of research, how we are going to drive it and whether there will be an emphasis on blue sky research.

It is a question of how we treat PhD students, how we attract people to the country and how we retain people.  It is an issue about their well-being and welfare and about national competitiveness.  I think the Senator and I agree on that.  He has raised this issue of PhD students quite a lot with me.  This short, sharp review has broad terms of reference but is focused at the same time.  It involves external people.  It will report back early in 2023 and will give us a roadmap to get to a much better place.<\/p> <p>  We will bring forward legislation in 2023 around what the structures will look like.  As the Senator implied, it is not about getting bogged down in structures - as the title suggests, it is about the impact that those structures will make.  We must be clear that it is about supporting all forms of research, and not just enterprise-related research.  That is something I think the Senator and I share a view on.  I am happy to update the committee on where we are at in the implementation of the strategy.  A number of new groups have started meeting.  We are working closely with the vice-presidents of research across the universities.

It is very worthwhile that the Minister is available to the committee to give us constant updates because it is a new Ministry.  As Senator Malcolm Byrne said, there must be some recognition of our Government partners having pushed for this Ministry in particular.  It has shown its worth, as has the Minister.  Given the limited time, I want to focus on one area the Minister has come here to speak to us about and that is PhD candidates.  We are doing another piece of work at the moment around mental health supports within primary and secondary schools.  One of the things the stakeholder groups have raised with us as an issue is recruitment of those who support.<\/p><p>We already know through child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, that it is an issue but we have a backlog in this country when it comes to psychological supports in education.  I know the Minister is aware of this and that the working group is also working on it, but there are three types of PhD students going through psychological research programmes and two of those are funded through the HSE.  More recently the students on the counselling programme are also funded since this budget, but the last are the educational psychology PhD candidates.  It is very hard to explain or understand why that is, particularly as they all come to their courses from the same route.  These candidates do 300 hours of work placement, often with CAMHS and some of it with disability services so they are hugely valuable for us, even while they are doing that training.  Looking at the clinical psychology PhD candidates for instance, they are being paid a full-time salary for their work as a PhD candidate.  Only 18 of these educational psychology PhD students are due to graduate in the next year, or possibly in 2024.  Can the Minister explain what the difficulty is in ensuring that kind of equality between all of those candidates given that when they come out, they have the exact same qualifications?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#E01200","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her comments and for all the work she does in engaging with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on a whole range of issues related to the work of the Department, in Galway but also nationally.  There are a couple of things here.  The points made by the Senator highlight the need to overhaul the system we have in place in terms of PhD supports.  We have been looking at this very intensively particularly in recent weeks but also in recent months.  The situation is that my Department pays stipends through our agencies such as the Irish Research Council, the IRC, and Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, which are at an equivalent level of &euro;18,500 each.  Some PhD courses do not have a stipend.  Some are paid directly by their institution such as those in the Higher Education Institutions, HEI, but that level is decided by the HEI from their block grant generally.  Then some PhD students are paid through private sources or private funding received by their university.  In relation to the specific issue raised by the Senator, for the health programmes, the HSE and the Department of Health fund to recruit.  The Department of Education is not within my remit but I believe it is considering this for educational psychologists.  I said this in the D&aacute;il last night but the broader point I want to make is that as part of the review, we need to look at the fact that we do not actually have a minimum recommended stipend in Ireland.  There are so many different types and there cannot be a minimum.  I will pose the question as opposed to pre-empting the outcome of the review.  Should there not be a floor for the level of stipend supports for all PhD students in Ireland?  At the moment there is not.  I looked at this in the context of the budget, even those funding schemes within my remit that I can provide financial assistance to, or at least easily provide financial assistance to, are not 100% clear either.  The PhD review we are announcing this evening will be an opportunity to tease through those issues but on the specific point the Senator makes in relation to that relatively small number of students, the responsibility lies with the Department of Education.  My understanding is that it is considering a model similar to that used by the Department of Health.  I will ask officials in the Department of Education as a result of this exchange to interact with the Senator directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#F00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":474,"content":"<p>While I appreciate responsibility lies with the Department of Education, the problem for the Minister's Department is that people are taking a different route because they are funded and at the end of the day, they become qualified psychologists.  From our point of view, as a society this means we do not have enough educational psychologists.  It is important to say it cannot be just left with the Department of Education to sort out because this is a specific issue which is funnelling people in a direction and that has to be recognised as a State policy in relation to third level education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022101900002#F00300","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I do not disagree with that at all.  I am certainly not suggesting it would be and that is why I referenced the body of work that my Department tends to do with this external review about PhD support students, the consistency of those supports and how they are applied.  I accept that 100%.  The Senator touched on another issue on which I will not go into too much detail in case I frustrate the Chair, but it is the issue around workforce planning.  I will be blunt with this committee and say I am really concerned about this.  There have been examples of good practice particularly in recent months.  I am really proud of the work my Department, the Department of Health, the HSE and others have done in relation to medicine places.  I can sit here this evening and tell the committee there is a funded multiannual plan to increase medicine places over the next number of years.  Some 60 extra places went in this September.  The deans of the medical schools did great work and I thank them, and the HSE also.  All of that is great but I cannot say that exists in many other areas of the public service and that frustrates and worries me.  As a Minister for some time, I know that funding initiatives can be announced but if there are not people to roll-out these in terms of the delivery on the ground, it will not make progress with waiting times and lists.  I am very passionate about the need to accelerate the engagement with other Government Departments.  They need to see this relatively new Department as a resource and properly interlock with it on workforce planning.  How many speech and language therapists do we need in Ireland and how many occupational therapists and nurses?  It is not only how many we need but how we actually get there together.  I am not being critical.  I have seen exchanges on health committees where people get tetchy when these issues are raised.  This is not criticism of any other Department but we are all public servants here and we need to step up to the plate.  We need to properly plan the workforce.  I do not intend to become pen pals in terms of correspondence between my Department and others in relation to this issue.  It is too serious.  We now have settled the question of medicine and I want to praise the Department of Health for its work on that but we need to now do it in relation to health, social care and disability professions.  I know the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, is up for this; as is the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  If I continue in this role, a key priority of mine in 2023 will be the whole issue of workforce planning.

It is palpable.  It is difficult and challenging and we really want to look at practical ways of helping.  That is why we have taken immediate measures between now and the end of the year with &euro;143.5 million of direct financial assistance going to students and their families be that the double Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, payment just before Christmas; the increase in the student grants that will kick in from January; the refund of &euro;1,000 additional funding for the student assistance fund, which can perhaps be viewed as a hardship fund; extra supports for postgraduate students and an additional increase in the PhD stipend.  These are practical measures we wanted to take now to help people and in recognition of the fact that when you look at housing and student accommodation, there are two parts to it.  There is affordability and supply and in relation to affordability some of the measures taken in the budget will genuinely assist.  For the information of the committee, figures as of today show there are approximately 2,065 rooms, what used to be called digs, available for rent across the country.<\/p><p>These are advertised on student portals and the like.  When I meet students and talk about this I understand it does not work for everybody but it is working for thousands of students.  It does work sometimes for people who have a spare room in terms of the cost of living impact.  We have made a number of changes around social welfare rules to make it easier for people to keep the living alone and the fuel allowances and the pension and rent out the spare room.  While people say there is nothing available on Daft.ie or Myhome.ie I encourage any student or parent to look at the various digs options available.  It is certainly better than some of very difficult scenarios that I sometimes hear of.  That is not me saying that is the long-term solution or an optimum policy.  It is not.  It is getting on with building.  I want to be very clear and I have said this directly to the Technological Universities and will be saying it when I am with the Chairman and Senator Byrne when I am in the south-east on Monday, so let me say it again here.  We are ready to talk and want to talk and are open for business in terms of the Technological Universities and the borrowing framework.  They know this, in fairness, and they are working hard on this.  We will work with them to accelerate and develop any plans they have to deliver student accommodation.  It will be really important for the success of the TUs, Technological Universities, because they are about serving their region but also about attracting people into the region to study and to do that you need accommodation.

We are extremely grateful for the work they are doing with us and for allowing us to take learning from some of the schemes they have put in place more broadly in society.  We are interacting with the Cabinet Committee on Housing and we will be back to that committee this month as well on that.  On the issue of affordability I have acknowledged the measures we are taking in the budget to put money back in people's pockets.  The reason we are doing it is because we know people are experiencing rising costs.  I know the Chair did not ask me but I should say, because the Chair and Senator Byrne regularly talk to me on this, the South-East Technological University moving ahead with securing the new site for the Wexford campus is a massive priority for us.

I do not mean this in a flippant way but we are not in the business of buying sites and using taxpayers' money for sites for them to sit idle.  We are in the business of purchasing sites and expanding footprints because we buy into the argument and into the compelling vision that there needs to be a modern fit-for-purpose campus in Wexford.  I was really impressed when I visited the campus in Wexford with the Chairman and Senator Byrne and with what is going on there.  I was not impressed with the facilities that people have to work and learn in.  I met some very inspiring students there particularly around the whole area of lifelong learning, people who told me very bluntly and very clearly that they would not have been in higher education were it not for being able to go to the Wexford campus.  We now just need to provide them with a fit-for-purpose campus.<\/p> <p>  The Chair is also right to indicate it is always good to be truthful in this.  The site was secured and then we get on to the planning etc.  These are processes that take time but these will be processes that we will work with the Technological University to progress as a priority.

I had a very good conversation there with the president, a very impressive individual, about her and her management team's vision for the future of the Marino Institute of Education.  I launched their strategic plan that day.  There is a really important conversation about Marino and where it fits and I say that in a positive way, about where it wants to fit in our higher education landscape and the HEA Act 2022 also gives us opportunities to accelerate those discussions.  We have discussed this in relation to a number of institutions.  I do need to be honest and of course I will meet with Marino and the president and will engage with her on this and other issues.  However for clarity, and it is always important to be clear on these things, the reduction of &euro;1,000 is linked to the payment of a &euro;3,000 registration fee.  There are lots of different students in lots of different scenarios across the country.  The way I think of it in my head and the way I explain it to the public is if you are levied the &euro;3,000 fee you are automatically entitled to the &euro;1,000 reduction.  If you are not, you are not.  That is not to be in any way dismissive but it is just to be truthful.  That is where we started in terms of reducing the cost of education.  We do intend to do more. We are engaging directly with Marino on this and we are assessing the situation.  My understanding is that Marino sets its own rate for non-approved courses so there is an engagement going on with Marino but it is the free fees initiative, the &euro;3,000 fee, that the &euro;1,000 reduction applies to.  Any other fee that is not from the free fees initiative does not currently quality for the reduction.

There is at least two higher education institutions that I am aware of and I am sure Deputy Conway-Walsh is aware of that are currently looking at engaging with the HEA on preparing for en expression of interest for target programmes including veterinary.

I have also heard from a number of colleagues in the House and from vets themselves that there is a particular shortage of vets for larger animals in rural areas.  We are engaging on this.

Despite being an Irish national, my focus is very much Brussels based and on EU climate and energy legislation.  Thus, I will focus more on the European side today.  I will talk about the cause of the current crisis, the impacts we have seen so far, the potential solutions which have been proposed at EU level and how we see things going forward.<\/p> <p>  The first matter I will discuss is the cause of the current energy crisis.  It is pretty simple in that it is a gas shortage crisis.  The root cause of the crisis is a shortage of gas in the system.  This is having major contagion effects on electricity prices given that gas is often the price-setting technology for many hours of electricity.  I am oversimplifying, but the electricity price is often just the gas price, multiplied by two and with the CO2 price added on top.  This means that when gas prices become extremely high, as we have seen, we get very high electricity prices.   To put it into context, gas prices are usually approximately &euro;15 to &euro;20 per megawatt hour at the Dutch title transfer facility, TTF.  What we have seen is an explosion in prices.  Prices reached more than &euro;300 per megawatt hour in August and are now at &euro;150 per megawatt hour which is ten times higher than they usually are.  This is not a result of market dynamics but market manipulation and geopolitics. <\/p> <p>  Other factors have contributed somewhat.<\/p><p>We had a very hot summer, which means hydro reserves are low.  It also makes it harder to transport coal.  We have also seen low winds.  Concerning nuclear outputs in France, 32 of 57 nuclear plants are not operating at full capacity.  That has posed a challenge, but essentially it is a gas shortage issue.  We get 40% of our gas from Russia; that is about 155 to 170 bcm.  At the moment we are only getting 9% from Russia.  Replacing that gas is a major challenge.  That is the cause; I will now talk about the consequences.<\/p><p> The consequences have been quite major since this began.  Wholesale energy prices have increased by 532% at EU level and retail prices have increased by 84%; there has been quite a dramatic increase.  I will break down retail and wholesale.  If we look at households, as I said, there has been an increase of about 84%.  It is important to understand that for households, much of the electricity is purchased ahead in forward markets.  Households are not fully exposed to the cost increase.  While customers are already feeling the pinch, they have not been fully exposed.  Some 80% of it is hedged and 20% is fully exposed.  The price increases are only on the 20% that has not been hedged.  We need to be conscious of that - it will come around in a couple of years.  To contrast with Spain, it has a much higher exposure with less hedged electricity, meaning that their customers are feeling the pinch straight away at a higher level than in countries like Ireland.<\/p><p> The impact on industry has been quite dramatic.  At European level, steel, chemicals and non-ferrous metals have been very much affected.  I used to work in the non-ferrous metals sector in aluminium production for about six years - 50% of that industry has shut down since this crisis began.  To restart an aluminium smelter costs between &euro;200 million and &euro;400 million.  When you close one, it is quite a big deal.  Generally, it does not re-open.  The reason for that is the price increase.  If you are an aluminium smelter in Spain who was paying &euro;30 per megawatt hour two years ago and now you are paying over &euro;300, then you are losing almost &euro;2 million a week.  That puts things into context.  Electricity is 40% of costs for these industries.<\/p><p> I will now discuss what we have done at EU level.  Two main things have been done: we have the REPowerEU strategy and a series of emergency interventions.  The REPowerEU strategy was published in June as a reaction to the Russian invasion in February.  It has three main pillars, the first of which is to reduce demand.  We are going to try to reduce gas demand by 15% and electricity demand by 10%.  This is quite a challenge.  To put it into context, during Covid-19, when everything shut down, we only managed to reduce electricity demand by 8% to 9%; 10% is a major reduction.  For consumers, behavioural campaigns are the best way to go.  We need to raise awareness among consumers.  For industries, we need to have incentives to reduce their production.  <\/p><p> The second element is the need for a big increase in renewables.  That is the smart way to go.  The Commission said that we need 732 GW of wind or solar by 2030; these are ginormous numbers.  To achieve that, we need two things.  We need increased permitting and to sort out the bottlenecks in the supply chains.  I am not an expert on the Irish market, but I think both of these also apply to Ireland.  The final thing is diversifying supplies.  We are building more LNG capacity terminals, but these things take time.  We have gotten a lot of LNG from the US since the crisis began, but we will not have enough for this or next winter.  The other thing we have done is come up with a series of emergency mechanisms, the first of which is transferring money from companies to vulnerable consumers.  We need to protect the most vulnerable; that is important.  We also put a cap on the price that can be charged of &euro;180 per MWh.  Our concern is that it is not EU-wide.  One rule is needed for the entire EU.  Different patchworks among member states is not good.  There is also a solidarity tax from the oil and gas sector, which basically says that 33% of their profits should be taxed and redistributed.<\/p><p> On the outlook, I must be honest and say that this is a big crisis and one we expect to last not just for this winter but also next winter.  Gas reserves are full at 91% at European level, but these reserves were filled with Russian gas.  Next winter, we will not have that option.  We expect two tough winters with high prices.  In the medium term, the outlook is much better.  If we can have a big buildout of renewables like the Commission is pushing for, that will make a massive difference.

I am speaking from a very wet, windy and blustery County Cork.  I will give a short summary of my opening statement.  Ireland is one of the most fossil fuel-reliant countries in Europe with fossil fuels meeting just over 86% of our energy supply in 2021, 77% of which was imported.  We are currently spending over &euro;1 million every hour on importing fossil fuels like oil and gas into the State.  The cost of this massive reliance on imported fossil fuels is now reflected in the prices we pay to heat our homes, fuel our cars and power our appliances.  While Ireland&rsquo;s energy and climate policy is strongly influenced by that of Europe, our delivery of fuels like oil and gas is also impacted very much by what happens in the UK.  Ireland&rsquo;s geographical position on the periphery of Europe with no direct physical infrastructure connecting to other EU member states means that while we look to the EU for policy, we must also look to the UK for partnership in energy-related matters, especially in relation to natural gas.<\/p> <p>  Natural gas is an important fuel in Ireland.  It heats over 700,000 homes and businesses and generates over half of our electricity.  Over the next decade, the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan to reduce the pollution from greenhouse gases means we will use less gas on aggregate - about 40% less - in 2030, but there will be individual days when we will use more, especially when heating and power demand are high and generation from renewables like wind and solar is low.  To understand gas security, it is important to distinguish between a physical interruption, where an importing pipeline is cut off, and a price risk, where gas is available but becomes expensive.  Given our reliance on gas for energy, a physical disruption in supply from the UK into Ireland for any long period of time would be catastrophic, whereas a price disruption, which we are experiencing right now, results in extremely high prices of gas, rather than a physical interruption.  While Ireland is not physically connected via pipelines to Russia, we are connected via prices and we see the consequences of Russian actions in our heating and electricity bills, which are passed through on European and global markets.  The challenge of building gas infrastructure with the objective of enhancing energy security while at the same time reducing gas consumption with the objective of meeting climate targets is a new paradigm for policymakers in Ireland and across other EU member states.<\/p> <p>  Our analysis in University College Cork undertaken on behalf of the Electricity Association of Ireland shows that renewables such as wind and solar are by far the best way for Ireland to reduce its emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.  They do this because they reduce the use of fossil fuels in power stations, but importantly, they do not replace the need for conventional power stations, which will remain for the next ten to 15 years especially during times of calm weather over north-west Europe.  Decisions on building infrastructure to increase national energy security are complex because they involve value judgments of an uncertain future where large investment decisions must be made with imperfect information.  What is clear is that all options to increase energy security in Ireland must be considered and evaluated, but it is not clear which are most appropriate and which options can be future-proofed to align with decarbonisation goals.  All options for gas diversification and storage take time to deliver - two to three years at least.  In the short term energy conservation in Ireland and across Europe is key to enhancing energy security in Ireland.  A 10% reduction in national energy consumption delivers the same supply benefit as building 4,500 MW of wind, which would be like doubling today's wind capacity in the Republic of Ireland.  While there are certainly external dimensions and risks to energy security such as the war in Ukraine, there are also internal challenges that must be acknowledged, chiefly the lack of agility in planning, permitting, and delivery of energy projects in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  While Ireland is not physically connected via pipelines to Russia, we are connected via prices and we see the consequences of Russian actions in our heating and electricity bills which are passed through on European and global markets.

I acknowledge the large financial package and measures the Government has put in place to protect families and firms to help them manage this current energy crisis, but we have yet to deliver on a plan to mitigate against it.  We must take ownership and responsibility for our energy production in Ireland while being mindful of our European obligations and we must progress our continued co-operation with our good neighbours in the UK.  Ireland should play to its strengths as a country with large renewable potential.  We must also address weaknesses in planning and acknowledge that it will take decades to deploy these renewable resources.  We must prepare for an energy transition which is taking place against a backdrop of a volatile and uncertain future in Europe.  We must be mindful not to let long-term optimism on the real potential of offshore wind and fuels like hydrogen blind us to the short-term vulnerabilities of our energy supply.  Actions must be taken on national security options such as gas storage and demand conservation in parallel with a massive buildout of renewables and implementation of energy-efficiency measures.<\/p><p>Action must be taken on national security options such as gas storage and demand conservation in parallel with a massive build-out of renewables and implementation of energy-efficiency measures.

I have heard it said that perhaps the CRU needs more powers - excuse the pun - especially in the area of reduction of demand, which is what the European Union is endeavouring to achieve with the regulation.  Does the CRU need more powers to deal with this unprecedented crisis?<\/p> <p>  My third question, on the development of offshore wind energy, is also for Dr. Deane.  How is Ireland doing in that regard?  It appears it is not doing particularly well at the moment.  Is Dr. Deane satisfied that plans are in place to ramp up the production of offshore wind energy?  I will also ask a related question about the European regulation of gas storage capacity.  Dr. Deane dealt with it in his opening statement.  Will he expand on the Irish position on gas storage capacity and what we need to do about it?<\/p> <p>  The message that both Dr. Deane and Mr. O'Donoghue have delivered is sobering in that this crisis will last this and next winter.  We can take some consolation from the fact that the outlook is a little better in the medium term.<\/p> <p>  Those are my initial questions.  If either of the witnesses wants to answer all the questions, that is also fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#C00300","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I will respond to the first question as it was directed to me.  The question was what this means for the European Green Deal.  Will it be a step back?  The opposite is the case.  Electrification and decarbonisation will be accelerated but in the immediate short term coal usage will increase this winter.  As regards power reduction, there has been a slight increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity sector, which is not good but the general trajectory is positive.  We expect electricity generation will be decarbonised by 2040.  We are going in the right direction although coal usage will increase slightly this winter for security of supply reasons.<\/p> <p>  At European level, the ambition has increased since the Green Deal was agreed in June 2021.  In June 2022, the REPowerEU strategy was issued and that is more ambitious.  We have increased renewables targets to between 40% and 45%.  We have also increased the target for the number of heat pumps and aim to have 20 million tonnes of hydrogen fuel in Europe by 2030.  In reaction to this crisis, we observe more energy independence and increased ambition on tackling climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cillian O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>Deputy Haughey asked whether the CRU needs more power.  I do not believe so.  We need to be more agile.  This is not a criticism focused only on the CRU, but rather across all institutions working on energy provision in Ireland, whether they work on planning, processing or permitting.  We need to display a level of agility.  When I reflect on the last crisis, the Covid-19 crisis, and the remarkable job we all did in responding to that, in particular the Government, I note the level of agility and urgency was unprecedented.  We took actions that were commensurate with the urgency of the crisis.  We are not seeing that agility at the moment.  The energy system is a little different as there is much more inertia in the system and permitting challenges are real.<\/p> <p>  The CRU does not need more power.  Typically, if the CRU demands reductions in the electricity or gas sectors, it yields power through prices.  It sends price signals to consumers and, as Mr. O'Donoghue said, we know those price signals work.  We must acknowledge the pain in those price signals if we want people to reduce consumption.  Whether it is industry, commercial use or residential sectors, some level of burden sharing and pain will be involved.  The CRU has mechanisms at its disposal to exert influence through pricing.<\/p> <p>  Ireland used to be a leader in offshore wind.  In the early 2000s, Ireland built one of the first offshore wind farms in the world, the Arklow bank.  We were once a leader in this area and unfortunately we are now at the back of the pack.  We have not built any offshore wind farms since.  There is an expectation in the industry that the next offshore wind farm will not be delivered until after 2025 and many believe it will be 2027 or 2028.  That is disappointing when one considers the timeline, the resource we have in Ireland, the crisis, our reliance on fossil fuels and how much we are spending on them every single hour.  I mentioned that &euro;1 million is leaving the State and going to companies around the world, while we have a rich resource on our doorstep and on our shores that we are not quick enough to exploit.<\/p> <p>  The potential for performance in offshore wind energy is real and the magnitude is massive.  It is not just about producing energy but also about providing meaningful jobs, reducing our emissions, increasing our resilience and robustness as a society and becoming more responsible for our energy production.  The energy production in Ireland for the past few decades has essentially been outsourced to other countries such as the United Kingdom, Norway and the United States.  Those are the countries that produce most of the energy we use in Ireland.  We need to take economic and environmental responsibility for our energy production and the great assets we have are our wind, both on and offshore, and even solar power.  Our agricultural and farming communities also have huge potential to generate energy and as households we all have huge potential to save energy.  In short, our offshore wind story is disappointing.  We were once a leader but we are now at the back of the pack and that is disappointing when one considers the resources available here.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is relatively unique in comparison with other EU member states in not having any gas storage capacity.  We used to have the Kinsale Head gas field which had the ability to store a limited amount of gas but it was important.  Gas storage would be fundamentally important if there was a physical interruption of gas supply from the UK to Ireland.  We get a little gas from the Corrib gas field, which meets about 25% of our annual gas needs.  Unfortunately, that is dwindling and we will become more reliant on the UK for the transit of gas into this country.  Most of the gas comes in via two undersea pipelines.  If anything happened to those pipelines, it would be catastrophic, especially over a long period.  Gas storage would help to mitigate that risk.  The Government has launched a consultation process energy security to consider the gas storage option and options for liquid natural gas, LNG.  We need to consider and evaluate those options to understand which of them is best suited to Ireland's needs but also to our long-term decarbonisation goals.<\/p><p>Once we decide which one it is, we need to act with agility.  As Mr. O'Donoghue said, this crisis will not go away over the next couple of years.  It will endure.  We will have a hard winter next winter and Ireland will continue to have that exposure to fossil fuels.  The crisis we are seeing at the moment is an energy crisis, but at its core it is a fossil fuel crisis.  As Ireland is one of the most fossil fuel-reliant countries in the world, we need to do everything to reduce our reliance to that exposure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Deane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agaibh.

I am quite shocked to hear this morning that we may expect this to last for another year.  The public will be very disappointed to hear that this crisis is going to last that length of time and possibly even longer.  I have a number of questions.  My first question is for Mr. O'Donoghue.  Many European countries such as France rely on nuclear power as their main source of energy.  Could Mr. O'Donoghue give a brief overview of the role that he sees nuclear power playing in Europe's energy policy, both in the medium and long terms?  Does he think more countries are likely to become reliant on nuclear power due to the war in Ukraine?<\/p> <p>  The cost of gas is increasing, largely due to the war in Ukraine.  In addition to being one of the biggest exporters of gas, Russia is also one of the world's biggest exporters of uranium.  Uranium prices are likely to go up in the same way that gas has.  I would like Mr. O'Donoghue's view on that.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is investing heavily in wind energy.  Our Government, under the Green Party, is hoping that wind can become our main source of energy.  Could Mr. O'Donoghue comment on this energy policy?  I visited Derrybrien wind farm last week with a number of my Independent colleagues, including Senator McDowell.  Could Mr. O'Donoghue discuss his views on the decommissioning of Derrybrien wind farm, which is responsible for approximately 1% of Ireland's wind energy, during this energy crisis?  There are 70 turbines there.  They would provide energy for up to around 50,000 homes at this time.  At a time when our Minister for energy is telling us all to have five-minute showers, it makes a mockery of the proposed green energy future to have 70 turbines in Derrybrien not turning.

Does he think there is a future and a place for a small fission nuclear reactor in Ireland?  I know the Energy Regulation Act 1999 would need to be amended.  As legislators, we have to look at the challenges that must be overcome if we are to adapt to nuclear power.  Maybe that is something Dr. Deane could speak to as well.  What are the challenges we would face as politicians?  How practical does Dr. Deane think it is for Ireland to rely on wind as its main source of renewable energy?  Would it be more or less practical, in his view, to build nuclear power stations or import nuclear power from abroad?  We are already importing some from the UK and from France at this moment in time.  I would also like Dr. Deane's views on the Derrybrien wind farm situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#D00300","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":518,"content":"<p>A number of questions have been asked.

I was quite open and honest when I said that I see this crisis lasting.  I think we need to be clear.  We must communicate to citizens that it is something which will probably last at least 18 months.<\/p> <p>   The Senator asked about nuclear power and the outlook in Europe.  Nuclear is a very sensitive issue across Europe.  It is very different among member states.  In the past year, we have seen something of a renaissance in terms of the pro-nuclear countries.  Before the election in France, Mr. Macron said that he wants a big build-out of new nuclear plants.  Sweden has recently said the same thing.  A new nuclear plant in Finland was finally inaugurated and opened last month.  I expect there to be an uptake in demand for nuclear, depending on the member state.  We need to be conscious that large-scale nuclear new builds are quite expensive at the moment.  At Hinkley Point C, the strike price was &pound;92.50 per megawatt hour.  I think that was in 2011, although I might have the dates a bit wrong.  It was about ten years ago.  With inflation, that goes to over &pound;100.  That is quite expensive.  The issue we see is that new-build nuclear is quite expensive.  When it comes to base load sources of decarbonised power, you basically have nuclear or hydro power, and hydro power is based on geographical endowments.  Hydro has to be located close to certain geographical endowments.  Wind and solar with battery is another option but, again, that is an intermittent supply which needs to be balanced out.  We expect nuclear to increase in the role.  It is important to understand that electricity demand in general is going to increase dramatically.  We expect an increase in demand by 2050 - it will probably double - which means that even if the share of nuclear in the energy mix stays the same, the quantity of nuclear that we will produce will increase.  <\/p> <p>  I will speak on small modular reactors, SMRs.  This is a new technology but it has some potential.  I am oversimplifying here but the idea is that it is a bit like an iPhone.  By mass-producing this product - the nuclear SMR - you make it much cheaper.  I was recently at the international electricity summits which were attended by representatives from USA, Japan, Canada and Australia.  There was a big focus on SMRs and the potential we see there.  We have to see how it develops but I think it has a lot of potential.  That is something which is the subject of a lot of interest in the industry.<\/p> <p>  The uranium market is relatively diversified.  The biggest producer is now Kazakhstan, which has overtaken Russia.  The market is largely diversified.  The only issue is for countries that are reliant on Russia.  Certain plants in eastern Europe are reliant on Russian fuel and on what are called cakes, or nuclear rods, from Russia.  It is hard to transition to non-Russian sources, particularly in countries like Slovakia and in the case of one of the reactors in the Czech Republic.  There is about three years of supply there, but being able to switch to non-Russian sources is a bit of a challenge.  They have three years to find a solution but it is a challenge.  For new builds, however, there are many uranium sources.  That is not an issue.<\/p> <p>  I am not an expert on the offshore wind situation in Ireland but I would say that offshore wind tends to make a lot of sense.  In Ireland there is a target of 7 GW of offshore wind.  It makes sense to support that strategy.  Many member states cannot go for offshore wind projects.  The two big obstacles are permitting and supply chains.  We need to speed up permitting.  At EU level, we are trying to pass legislation which will basically come with go-to areas for nuclear builds.  This will ensure that projects can only be slowed down for a maximum of two years.  We are in a strange situation because projects take seven to ten years to get planning permission and less than two years to build.  That is not correct.  We need to find a solution there.  The second thing is supply chains.  A lot of the big companies that supply wind components are not doing very well and some are losing money.  I refer to companies like Siemens and Vestas.  We need to find solutions so that we have the components because they are getting very expensive.  That is also linked to raw materials.  The prices of the raw materials we use for windmills - steel and copper, etc. - have gone up.  Although we should definitely go for offshore wind, we need to find solutions to those two challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cillian O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Donoghue have a view on the Derrybrien wind farm or is he familiar with it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#D00600","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I am not familiar with it so I should not comment.

Respectfully, I cannot answer questions on the Derrybrien project because unfortunately I do not know enough about it.  I know very little about it, so I apologise.<\/p> <p>  I would respond to the Senator's questions about nuclear power by saying that I am a supporter of any decarbonisation option.  It is not so much that I am a fan of nuclear power, but that I do not like what the science of climate change is telling us.  It is very serious.  In a country like Ireland that is so reliant on fossil fuels, we need to keep our minds open to all options to help us to reduce that reliance, no matter how socially or politically unpopular they may be.  Nuclear is one of those options.  We need to manage our expectations around nuclear.  Traditional nuclear plants like Hinkley Point in the UK, or the large nuclear plants they have in France, would not be suitable for Ireland in terms of its size.  As Mr. O'Donoghue mentioned, there would also be issues in terms of the build-out time.  It would take way too long.  The SMR type of nuclear technology that has been discussed may or may not be suitable for Ireland, but again we need to manage our expectations around that.  These reactors are conceptual at the moment.  They are not commercially available.<\/p><p>Looking at the different peer-reviewed and scientific literature they may not be available until 2030 or 2035.  That is at least one or two decades away.  That is too far for the current energy crisis.  We should keep our minds open, and an eye on that technology, but it is very far away and again we should not let the long-term optimism of that technology blind us to the vulnerabilities we have in the short term.  We should keep our minds open on that technology, but the technology needs to be proved commercially viable and, more important, to be socially safe before we start looking at it in Ireland.  Wind energy is our greatest strength.  We do not have massive fossil fuel reserves in Ireland.  We do not have large hydro resources as they have in Scandinavia.  We do not have a huge nuclear tradition as they have in France.  What we have in Ireland is lots of weather.  We have lots of wind and reasonable amounts of sunshine.  We have a huge offshore resource.  It is our greatest strength in Ireland, so it makes a lot of sense to tap into that strength.<\/p><p> In terms of our overall energy supply, wind will do a lot of the heavy lifting in future.  It will get us most of the way there in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, but it will not get us all of the way there.  We need to acknowledge that there will be days, often ten days or even a number of weeks, when wind speeds will be low.  We will have dark periods, whether it be night-time or winter time when we will need to look at some form of strategic or seasonable storage of energy or electricity in Ireland.  There are a number of options such as decarbonised gases like hydrogen, but again I caution that this is a decade or two away.  At the moment we are still 86% reliant on fossil fuels in Ireland.  We need to have a massive build out of renewables before we get to any kind of serious thinking around the strategic need for energy or electricity storage in Ireland.  Our studies in UCC have demonstrated when we simulated lots of different futures on the energy and power system in Ireland that wind can do a lot of the heavy lifting.  However, it is going to need something else to step into the breach when it is just not windy and the weather is not there, particularly across north-west Europe.  I hope those have answered the Senator's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Deane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Donoghue and Dr. Deane for their presentations.  I agree with Deputy Haughey that what they have told us is frightening.  I do not think most of us in the Oireachtas are aware of the scale of what has been outlined.  Mr. O'Donoghue is taking more of a high level European view and, therefore, I want to ask about the REpowerEU plan that was announced to deal with the war in Ukraine and imports of Russian gas.  If we are looking to reduce our demand by 15% but we import 40%, how are we planning to deal with that?  It does not look like the numbers add up.  Are we relying heavily on renewables increasing in the short term?  Are we relying heavily on demand reduction, given it is difficult to calculate how much we can achieve?  I think he said 5% was challenging but doable, which seems like a small amount even at that rate.  Can he elaborate on hedging and how he sees that playing out in the next 12 to 18 months?  I was aware that a lot of the energy was bought in advance, but I think it is still misunderstood as to how that will impact on consumer prices in the next year to 18 months.<\/p> <p>  I would like ask Dr. Deane about the Irish situation.  According to the figures he outlined, it is quite embarrassing that we still rely on fossil fuels to the level of 86%.  It is even worse and almost negligent that we are still importing those volumes of fossil fuels at the cost of &euro;1 million every hour.  It is disgraceful we are still at that point.  With regard to the Corrib gas field, which I acknowledge is on the decline, is there any other potential there?  What is the short-term solution for gas storage?  What can be done in the next 12 months to try to address that issue?  I was also struck by what was said about there being no mitigation plan against the energy crisis.

There were two questions for me.  The first was about the replacement of Russian gas supply and demand, and the second was about hedging.  The Senator's analysis is correct in terms of supply and demand.  Traditionally, we received 40% of our gas from Russia, which was 155 to 170 bcm.  We are now getting 9%.  Approximately 150 bcm needs to be replaced.  It is quite tricky to reduce demand.  With gas we will try 15% and with electricity we will try 10%, but that still will not bring down the curve enough.  We are hoping that a milder winter will mitigate the situation, but we are trying to get more gas in via LNG.  In particular we have the idea of using floating terminals, also known as FSRUs, which are used in certain member states.  For example, there is a joint project between Estonia and Lithuania to at least get minimum gas in for this winter.  It takes a year or longer to build a LNG terminal, but that is something we will try and build out.  However, the Senator's analysis is correct and that is what I am flagging for this winter.  The supply and demand curves just do not match.  The demand is inelastic and hard to reduce.  It is also hard to get new supply on board.  That is the challenge.  We hope that France, which traditionally exported 10 GW of electricity but is now importing 10 GW, will quickly get back up nuclear plants that are currently down.  There is a big push in France to do that.  We hope that the weather is suitable as well.<\/p> <p>  Hedging is a normal strategy in the electricity sector.  We see from the current crisis that it creates winners and losers.  I will speak both to the consumer perspective and then the electricity producer perspective and will use the example of the aluminium sector in which I worked for six years.  If consumers are hedged and, therefore, have bought electricity for the next 15 years at a set price of &euro;30 per MWh, they are not affected by the high prices now.  They are only paying &euro;30 instead of &euro;500, which is the price to which some hours have gone.  They are making a lot of profit as they are hedged.  From the other side of the coin, if a company is a supplier and has to sell this electricity for &euro;30 per MWh, even if buying it at a much higher price from Russia, then it is losing money and some companies are going bust.  That is how hedging works.  They buy out in the time ahead and it creates winners and losers.  I will give one example from Germany.  A large German company had a long-term contract for Russian gas.  It has to sell its electricity at a certain price to its customers.  The Russian gas, which was at a set price, was cut off.  It then had to buy from the market at an extremely high price, but has to sell to its customer at the agreed price, which is hedged.  It made a huge loss, because it is buying gas from the spot market at an extremely high price but is locked in to sell to its customer at a low price.  The state had to intervene to find solutions to alleviate that problem.  That is how hedging works, and I hope I have explained it well enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cillian O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for those questions.  With regard to our reliance on fossil fuel, I agree it is incredibly disappointing and there is a low awareness of that right among the public.  We tell the world we are green and clean, but we are not.  We are one of the most fossil fuel reliant countries in Europe.  The main source of fossil fuel in Ireland is oil, and after that it is natural gas.  As I said, we are now spending an incredible &euro;1 million every hour importing those fuels.  I am reflecting while looking out the window here in west Cork, and when considering the wind and waves and the natural resources we have in this country, it is a terrible indictment.  We could even include farms.  I am looking out at some small farms.  Our small farmers and rural communities have the ability to produce our own renewable gas, particularly farmers who are looking for an exit strategy from farming sectors that are not financially productive.  We could produce approximately 15% of our natural gas needs from our land by 2030, if we put a good focus on it.  Not only would that meet some of our future natural gas needs, it would also help those rural communities and farmers who are struggling.  It would give them different options to use their land for something more financially viable.  It is disappointing and a terrible indictment.  We came out of the previous energy crisis in the 1970s and 1980s and we were approximately 90% reliant on fossil fuels.<\/p><p> Today we are about 86% reliant on fossil fuels.  What has changed since then is that now we have the technologies.  We know we can produce huge amounts of electricity from onshore and offshore wind farms and from solar farms.  We know we can save huge amounts of energy from our homes and from our transportation system.  It is not that we do not know what to do.  We know what we have to do and we have the technologies.  That is important.  <\/p><p> To address the question of the idea of a plan, we have put in place some very generous financial measures and means for families that are struggling at the moment.  That is necessary, particularly to ensure that those on the lowest incomes get the highest level of financial protection.  That is a short-term plan and we need to think more in the long term.  We have a number of policy instruments and policy packages that tend to be operational.  We have a national development plan and a climate action plan.  We have different plans around healthcare and transport but what is really needed is an integrated plan to make the most of our energy resources.  Norway for example, has done an incredible job in harnessing the potential of its offshore resources which are oil and gas.  For Ireland it would be onshore and offshore wind.  We must look at how Norway uses that resource, not just to earn money for companies but to improve society.  People are put at the centre of that resource potential.  The resource is used to develop the education and healthcare systems.  This is important because we do not just need an energy plan in Ireland, we need a plan for our wider society.  Energy does not just stop at the end of a cable or at the end of a pipeline.  It comes into our communities; it affects our physical and mental health and affects us in many more ways.  We are seeing those impacts at the moment through high prices right across society.  I would call for a wider masterplan in how we use our natural resources and how we harness that potential.  This is not just to make us energy independent and to move away from fossil fuels, although that is fundamentally important, but also how we can use it to enable other societal developments which are important for us in the same way that Norway has done around its healthcare, education systems and infrastructure.  Looking to other countries for ideas on how we develop those resources is fundamentally important.  It is not just about energy.  It is about people and communities and it is about having a coherent plan that allows everybody to come on board as we move away from fossil fuels.<\/p><p> On the Corrib gas field, today, this field meets about 25% of our annual gas demand but it is dwindling.  We will become more and more reliant on the physical infrastructure we use to import natural gas from the UK into Ireland.  As I have mentioned, the Government has a consultation process on energy security at the moment.  This process looks at a number of options, such as floating offshore energy which would be State owned and strategic gas storage, either onshore or offshore.  Demand-side measures are also being looked at but we need to temper our expectations.  A lot of those measures will take three to four years or longer to achieve in terms of implementation, permits and delivery.<\/p><p> In the short term, the most powerful thing we can all do is conserve energy.  I appreciate this is often politically and socially unpopular.  Encouraging people and giving them information on how they can save energy at home, in the office, in schools and universities is fundamentally important.  Unfortunately, some of these ideas get ridiculed within the media but it is no laughing matter for a lot of families out there.  Yes, taking shorter showers is an idea that is often socially unpalatable but electric showers are one of the appliances that use most electricity in an Irish home.  They use between &euro;400 to &euro;500 worth of electricity per year for a typical Irish house.  Empowering consumers, families and communities on options to reduce our reliance on and our exposure to these prices is something that is necessary.  I appreciate the political difficulties of this but we are in a very serious situation here.  <\/p><p> As Mr. O'Donoghue and I have outlined, this crisis is not going to go away.  The measures we need to put in place will take time but time is not on our side.  We need to act now.  One of the most pragmatic things that can be done, and I acknowledge that it will not be politically popular, is to give people information on how to reduce their energy use.  That increases our resilience in terms of security of supply and it reduces people's energy bills for electricity, transport and heating.  That is fundamentally important.  It should be our goal in the short term until we find a line of sight out of this current energy crisis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Deane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I thank our contributors.  I missed some of the presentations at the beginning.  From what I have heard, I am not sure if that is good or bad.  I have heard enough in the meantime to have loads of questions and if they have already been asked, please ignore them.  I will address the first question to Mr. O'Donoghue.  At the meeting on 25 October the energy ministers will look at a number of measures.  These include a new pricing benchmark to limit prices, joint procurement of energy reserves and the EU supporting energy supplies in Ukraine and Moldova.  I would like Mr. O'Donoghue to elaborate on each of those points, especially on some kind of new pricing benchmark to limit prices.  In regard to joint procurement of energy reserves, are we bidding against one another as it is.  What is the current situation?  There is also talk of a one-off, windfall tax which Mr. O'Donoghue might be able to elaborate on.  My other question is around the European Green Deal.  He spoke about increased ambition on heat pumps and hydrogen usage.  Perhaps that could be elaborated on and the practical steps that could be taken might be outlined.<\/p> <p>  This is for both of the witnesses.  In the area of farming energy; bio-digesters, small turbines and solar panels, what is the Green Deal saying and doing to promote these?  Dr. Deane said that the challenge for Ireland's energy security is the present not the future.  That is the kind of thing that strikes fear into the hearts of everyone.  Dr. Deane is talking about this winter and the next.  We have already looked at some immediate short-term measures; perhaps the witnesses would like to elaborate on any of those.<\/p> <p>  I want to go back to the issue of saving energy.  Dr. Deane mentioned earlier that it was unpopular but I actually think that it is not as unpopular as he may think.  From my conversations with people I find that they are interested in how they can save energy.  The crucial aspect is how that information is presented.  If it is presented by Ministers as a means of getting the Government off the hook for policy failure or inaction or whatever word one wants to use, then people are not interested.  It needs to be presented as a solution for families and businesses.  I was in with my hairdresser on Monday and he was speaking about the fact that he is now checking on the immersion.  He is asking how many people are booked in.  He is checking the amount of energy he is using.  He is going around switching off the lights like everyone else, but he is specifically looking at his business, as many households are at the moment, to see how they can save energy because people cannot afford their energy bills.  How the message is delivered is crucial.  I think we delivered it in the most inappropriate way to begin with.  It is really hard to go back from that but that is the responsibility of all of us.  <\/p> <p>  My second question refers to the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities.  Deputy Haughey already asked whether this body needs more power and the answer was \"No\" but what about the issue of standing charges?  The CRU cannot deal with this issue.  It is an absolute rip-off.  We need to look at legislation so that the CRU certainly has a role to play there.  I would like to get the witnesses' comments on this.<\/p> <p>  Reference was also made to there being no gas storage facility in Ireland and that if there was an interruption in supply from the UK that it could be catastrophic.  We know that anything can happen.  It is not likely, but we know that it is possible.  As far as gas storage options are concerned, what are those options that can be brought on board as soon as possible?<\/p><p>What is the shortest amount of time before we have meaningful gas storage options that would contribute?  Do the witnesses have any comments on the LNG terminal at Shannon?  I will understand if they do not.  I was concerned when Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue spoke about the winter ahead.  He said that they are hoping for a mild winter and that France can ramp up its production of electricity.  That strikes fear into me because it seems as if we are in a position where there is very little we can do in the short term.  Will the witnesses share their thoughts on very short-term measures other than saving energy?  As I said, that is crucial and we need to revamp the message we are giving people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#F00200","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Harkin.  I think there are three questions; the first is about the emergency mechanism discussions on 25 October, the second is about the windfall tax and the third is about hydrogen and heat pumps.<br\/><br\/>Three things will be discussed on 25 October.  Gas price caps would have made more sense if we had done them earlier in the process.  It is quite technical - the price of gas is linked to the title transfer facility, TTF, which is the hub.  It is a fluctuating price.  Before ten years ago, gas was linked to oil via oil indexation.  Now, it is linked to the TTF hub, which means that when the price at the TTF, which was &euro;15 to &euro;20 traditionally, goes to &euro;300 or &euro;150, the revenues of exporters such as Russia and Norway and, to some extent, Algeria increase dramatically.  Russia has made a huge amount of money since the war began, as a result of this pricing mechanism.  If the price of pipeline gas had been capped early in the process, much of the revenue which accrued to the Russian state could have been reduced.  It would have also helped to reduce electricity prices.  I am referring to pipeline gas.  LNG is different.  Like oil, it is a global market, so the exporter can say no.  With pipeline gas, there was some consumer market power to ask for a lower price.  It would still have been higher than usual, but there was some scope.  Gas price caps make sense if they are well designed and do not undermine security of supply.  This is something that should perhaps have been considered earlier in the process.<br\/><br\/>Another issue is joint procurement.  In the interest of European solidarity, it is good to have some joint procurement processes.  Traditionally, the European Commission or any European entity is not designed to buy gas.  It is a bit like the position with Covid-19 vaccines - we are not set up for that.  Usually, it is done by companies.  In the interest of solidarity, we need some mechanism to be put in place.  That is being set up now.  I cannot comment on the rush for gas between member states;  I am a member of a European association so I must be sensitive in what I say.  We need to show solidarity.  There are concerns in internal energy markets that some potential go-it-alone strategies by member states could undermine this solidarity.  It will be a test this winter.  It is very important that we stay together.  That applies not just to the purchase of gas but to exports of electricity also.  In the internal electricity market, IEM, electricity flows where it is best to flow.  It is important that it stays open.  If some member states say they are not going to export electricity because they want to give it to their citizens locally, that is not good.  It should be avoided.  It is not something that just relates to Ireland, it relates to all member states.  Some member states are saying that they want to prioritise their own citizens this winter if there is not enough electricity.<br\/><br\/>The final question was about the new pricing benchmark.  The reference in Europe is the TTF, which is the title transfer in the Netherlands.  People are noting that the prices for LNG are much lower in the Asian market compared to Europe.  They are asking why we are not investigating the use of an alternative benchmark to the TTF, such as the Asian benchmark, and adding a premium on top to get the supply to Europe.  That would entail using the east Asian benchmark, hypothetically, and adding 10% to outbid east Asia.  If a shipment is coming from Qatar and it can go to either east Asia or Europe and it will get 10% more in Europe, that might work for LNG.  It is starting now but will take a few months to set up.  It might make sense.  There was a lot of manipulation between the TTF and Russia, which got a lot of revenue from that.<br\/><br\/>The second issue asked about was the idea of a windfall tax.  We cannot do a tax at the European level.  As the Deputy will know, tax is the competence of member states and is important for Ireland.  As a member state, we have certain taxation arrangements which the EU cannot touch because it is not an EU competence.  We came up with an inframarginal revenue cap of &euro;180 per <font color=\"#202124\">MWh<\/font>.  A tax cannot be retroactive.  There needs to be some visibility of where we are going.  The inframarginal tax was a kind of compromise but it is not the ideal solution.  There probably needs to be some redistribution.  There is a solidarity contribution from the oil and gas sector.  It is important to understand that the oil and gas sector are the ones making the real profits, rather than the electricity sector, which is very different.  That is represented in the company share prices.  If you look at the share prices for oil and gas majors, they have really gone up since the beginning of the crisis.  That is not the case in the electricity sector.  It is important to distinguish between electricity and oil and gas.<br\/><br\/>The other issue was about REPowerEU and hydrogen and heat pumps.  On hydrogen, we have an objective of 20 million tonnes by 2030.  It is very ambitious.  It is a very nascent industry.  We are trying to get 10 million tonnes from Europe and 10 million tonnes imported, particularly from north Africa.  That is the objective; we will have to see how that goes.  We need to get these projects up and running as soon as possible.  We all know that heat pumps make a lot of sense.  Many of the obstacles are at the local and household level.  I do not think as a member of a European association that I am best placed to comment, as the obstacles are more of a local issue.  As Dr. Deane said with regard to savings this winter, it is important that politicians communicate to consumers that anything they can do to reduce their consumption is much appreciated.  Campaigns on behavioural change will help a lot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cillian O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman and Deputy Harkin.  To pick up on Mr. O'Donoghue's point, the Deputy is spot on.  How we deliver the message and who delivers the message are fundamentally important.  When you step back and think about it, it is about showing people how to reduce their energy consumption, rather than telling them.  That nuance is fundamentally important.  I agree with the Deputy that there is an appetite out there.  It is frustrating, disappointing and a little sad when I see many people in my own community spending a lot of time plugging out things like phone chargers and televisions, which is not very impactful.  For example, if you were to leave the television screen the committee is using to see me on standby for a full year, it would probably use between &euro;5 and &euro;10 worth of electricity, which is not impactful.  Things like tumble dryers, washing machines and home heating are significant areas that can allow us to reduce our energy use, bearing in mind that many of those things are not suitable for the elderly or vulnerable.  They are primarily suited to families who are fit, able and healthy.  This is also part of the messaging in carving out the families that this information should go to and how it can be delivered.  It is fundamentally important.  UCC's analysis showed that just five appliances in our homes use about half of our electricity.  Those are typically things that heat something up or cool something down.  That should be the national focus for families to keep on top of.  We also need to keep an eye on our driving and home heating.  The home heating point should be prefaced by the fact that it is only suitable for families who are fit, healthy and able.  The vulnerable and elderly probably cannot save much more, as they are already struggling and incredibly lean in their overall energy use, which also needs to be considered.<\/p><p>I cannot answer about the standing charges set by the CRU because I unfortunately do not know enough about it.  Whatever about more powers, institutions such as the CRU, EirGrid, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and local county councils dealing with environmental planning need more people and resources.  When we consider the pipeline of energy projects that are waiting to be delivered and the workforce that has to process them, the two are at odds.  Powers are one thing.  People, or human resources, and increasingly  climate and energy literacy are fundamentally important across the public institutions to ensure the applications for permits can be processed at an appropriate speed for the crisis we are in.  The issue is not so much about railroading through planning decisions quickly - that cannot happen - but about making good decisions fast and a lot of people are needed for that.  In respect of gas-storage options, the previously mentioned consultation on energy security the Government is engaging in at the moment looks at a number of options including State-owned floating LNG and strategic gas storage.  The report states that floating offshore LNG storage is the option that would be the quickest to implement.  It would fully mitigate against a 30-day physical interruption of gas supply from the UK.  However, expectations on that need to be managed.<\/p><p> Floating LNG is a hot resource at the moment.  As Mr. O'Donoghue will attest, many other European countries including Germany, the Netherlands and Lithuania are looking at options for floating LNG facilities.  Many people are looking at this to increase their gas security diversity, but only there are only about 37 of these floating facilities in the world.  Ireland would have to challenge hard to get access.  Knowing the options is one thing, but how feasible or realisable that option is during the current energy crisis is difficult to understand.  We need to evaluate all the options from floating LNG storage, to offshore exploration, to onshore gas storage, while being mindful that these options are probably deliverable within a window of three or more years.  In the medium term the most fundamental action we can take is to encourage and inform people to take ownership of their energy consumption and help them to understand how to reduce it as much as possible.  We still need to be mindful that will not shield us from the energy crisis but it will blunt the edge of the blade a little.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Deane","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666134000,"counter":534,"content":"<p>Deputy Joe McHugh resumed the Chair<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I agree about people needing information, but who delivers the message is crucial.

Considering our dependency on fossil fuels is at 86% and 75% of that is imported, will either of the witnesses indicate, at the time Ireland was permitted to use industrially harvested peat, what percentage of our energy was derived from our peat power stations?  Energy security for Ireland, as both speakers have been at pains to say, cannot be dealt with in isolation.  It is part of the energy security of Europe and while Ireland is wholly dependent on external factors, we have a major opportunity at this time to harness wind energy.<\/p> <p>  It is disappointing to hear that in the space of 20 years, we have gone from being a leader to being a laggard.  Some of that is down to NIMBYism, some is down to bad policy decisions and a lack of foresight, but given the energy crisis we are now in, what can be done to accelerate the generation of wind energy, especially offshore wind energy?  Mr. O'Donoghue stated that planning and permitting takes seven to ten years while construction only takes two years.  Surely we can do something at a European level to streamline the permitting and planning process in order to speed it up.<\/p> <p>  It was mentioned that as a country that is dependent on agriculture, 15% of our natural gas usage could be provided with what I presume is anaerobic digestion.  Correct me if I am wrong.  Solar power was not mentioned much today.  Perhaps the witnesses could explain what could be done to incentivise farmers to invest in anaerobic digestion and solar energy.  Mr. O'Donoghue stated the reserves are okay this year at 91%, but most of that is Russian gas and he is concerned about how we will maintain our reserves for 2023-2024.  Does he have any suggestions about how to address that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#H00500","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I will let Dr. Deane speak first and I will respond afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cillian O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Troy for his questions.  I do not have the figure for peat but I estimate it is likely to be in the low single digits.  Electricity accounts for about 20% of the energy we use in Ireland.  We often confuse energy and electricity.  If we look around our homes, offices and the room we are in at the moment we see that electricity is commonly used to power appliances.  However, outside our homes we see trucks, heating systems and large industry use oil and gas for heating and transport and these are the dominant vectors of energy.  Electricity accounts for about 20% and I estimate peat probably accounted for single digits as a percentage of our overall electricity production.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy was speaking I was reflecting on the remarkable transition that utilities such as Bord na M&oacute;na have delivered in the midlands in transitioning away from peat and bringing on new energy sources such as onshore wind, anaerobic digestion and planning for hydrogen and different combustion fuels.  It is a cause of great hope as it demonstrates what can be done when people put their minds to it, there is a strong political focus, society has trust in those utilities and there is a strong social focus.  We should look to the transition in the midlands to give us optimism.  I acknowledge it has not always been easy.  People have encountered many difficulties and much hardship but the transition by Bord na M&oacute;na in the midlands from a solely brown producer of electricity to trying to be one of the largest green producers of electricity and energy, is a good example for Ireland and the rest of Europe about what can be done when we put our minds to it.<\/p> <p>  I will also bring in the agricultural dimension.  We have huge potential to grow energy, especially from anaerobic digestion as the Deputy mentioned.  We are brilliant at this in Ireland.  We grow silage.  We have large quantities of slurry.  When silage and slurry are put into a metal tank, a renewable gas is produced and that is what we need at the moment.  What farming families and communities need are options to diversify away from elements of farming that are unprofitable.  What is fundamentally important to realising anaerobic digestion is not the technology.  Countries such as Germany and Austria have thousands of digesters.<\/p><p>It is not technology; it is a strong stable policy.  If we are asking farming families and co-operatives to come on a journey with us to produce energy, the thing they would need most and crave most is a secure, stable and long-term policy.  That would mean that if they are to make this investment from using their land to produce food to using their land to produce fuel in different ways, they would need some element of financial cover because it is a large investment but also something that is necessary.  It is something that is not suitable for all elements of farming but it is something that should be explored and gives farming families options and allows us to be responsible for a lot more of our natural gas production in Ireland.<\/p><p> Coming back to the point I made in my opening statement, while we need to move away from fossil fuels in Ireland, they are not going to go away overnight.  Moving away from fossil fuels is a two to three decade transition.  We will need fossil fuels in 2020, 2030 and 2035 and producing those from indigenous sources in a responsible and sustainable way is something that is very important.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's final point about solar, we do not often think about Ireland as a very sunny place.  With the recent advances in solar technology, particularly the reductions in cost, coupled with the increases in electricity and energy prices we are seeing at the moment means, solar makes a lot of environmental, social and economic sense in Ireland.  We recently did a study for the Irish Solar Energy Association where we looked at the potential for residential solar production in Ireland.  We counted the household roofs that could be used in a meaningful way to produce their own electricity and we found that about half of the homes in Ireland are very suitable for solar panels.  For example, if a family in Dublin put six or seven solar panels on their roof, they would reduce their electricity bill by about &euro;400 this year.  They would get a payback on their investment of about seven to ten years but what is really nice about solar energy is that they reduce their energy bill this year by about &euro;400 but they also reduce it for the next 24 years to 25 years because that is the period these panels last.  When we think about the one-off financial measures we are giving to families at the moment, they are practical but giving families the opportunities and possibilities to produce their own electricity is something that will endure and, hopefully, outlast and outlive this energy crisis.  Looking at supporting solar panels for residential development, for farmers and for business is a really good idea.  We do that to a certain degree at the moment through generous grants from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  From a sourcer's perspective, having a closer look at 100% grant funding for families who are in receipt of a fuel allowance is something that would be very impactful and meaningful not only for those families who produce their own electricity for their homes but also for the wider benefits in terms of jobs and employment in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Deane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I will respond to Deputy Troy's three questions on wind, solar and farming biogas.  On wind, Denmark is a good country to use as an example.  It went very much pro-wind over a decade ago.  I do not know the numbers off the top of my head but I think more than 50% of its generation is wind.  It is a good country to take inspiration from.  I repeat that the obstacles are permitting and supply chains.  On permitting, at EU level we have come with a new proposal to speed up permitting processes.  That is now going through the European Parliament in what is called co-decision.  The idea is that when this is approved, one can hold up a project for a maximum of two years.  There is the principle of an overriding public interest, which means that in designated go-to accelerated areas, the project can only be held up for two years.  We think it would help a lot and we ask for Ireland's support for that as it goes through co-decision.<\/p> <p>  Solar makes a lot of sense.  The REPowerEU strategy came with a solar power strategy.  We should put solar on rooftops wherever we can and wherever it makes sense we should do it.  Again, there are some supply chain issues with silicone from China and so on but we think we should put solar wherever it makes sense.  Some Irish MEPs, particularly Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP, who is based in Brussels, is also pushing solar and we work with his office on that and fully support it.<\/p> <p>  On farming an renewable gas, the REPowerEU strategy thinks we can have 35 billion cubic metres of renewable gases by 2030.  There is potential there.  More broadly speaking, and in the long term, at Eurelectric we see big potential for a win-win between energy production and farming going forward.  There is a lot of farming land and if we can find a way, a sweet spot, for it to be a win-win for both farmers and energy producers, it will have a lot of potential.  In the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, review, we should integrate the energy dimension for farming and see what can be done there to have energy as a source of income or a win-win for farming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cillian O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Donoghue and Dr. Deane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#J00300","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I agree with much of what has been said.  Not only were the interventions comprehensive, they were absolutely sobering in terms of where we are at.  Some of might have had a general notion that this will be bad for a considerable period of time but sometimes how bad it is going to be just needs to be laid out.  If we are talking about where we are at, and the plans we have had in this State, there was a missed opportunity with Corrib in that we did not have an element of State involvement.  The Scandinavian model of taking some money back, which you could plough back in and be a major player in all sorts of renewables is something we really have to go with.<\/p> <p>  I am always worried about nuclear.  I get that nuclear is with us in terms of France and Germany and how much of it is used.  I would ask a question about the dangers, and that is accepting we are not necessarily dealing with the Chernobyl-type technology.  I would like to think there are more checks and balances.  However, we had Fukushima and all that needs to go wrong is for everything to go wrong all at once.  We live in a world where that happens more often.  We have always had worries and particular difficulties as regards Sellafield.  I would throw that question out for an answer.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses have said wind energy is where it is at and that we need to get our house in order.  A significant amount of work has been done lately on that.  There is the wider issue of planning.  The Attorney General is carrying out a review and there may be legislative changes.  There is a need for resourcing.  If there are various points in the planning process, there is not much point in having them unless they are resourced, so people are not held up for a considerable amount of time, whether for small or big projects.<\/p> <p>  I would add my voice to what Deputy Harkin said as regards the Commission for Energy Regulation, CRU, in that we have to change the rules to ensure the State can buy backup generators, which unfortunately we will not have this year.  We have a particular issue even if we had an endless supply of fuel at this point in time.

We all know the pros and cons.  That is the decision for policymakers on the basis of engagement with society to make a decision on whether to go for nuclear or not.<\/p> <p>  Basically, it needs to be broken down. There are four sources of decarbonised electricity &ndash; nuclear, hydro, wind and solar.  There are some other smaller sources, but those are the four main ones.  I understand that, from an Irish perspective, the potential of hydro is quite limited.  If nuclear is ruled out, that leaves wind and solar.  If Ireland goes all out on wind, it will have to have a balancing storage strategy.  It has to be safe.  If Ireland goes all out on wind, how does it balance the intermittency?  In that context, a good discussion is needed.  Is it hydrogen, batteries, hydropower or gas?  This is a discussion that needs to take place in Ireland.  If Ireland rules out nuclear and goes all in on wind power, how will it balance the grid?  That is an important discussion.  I do not know how the discussion in this regard is progressing in Ireland, but it is important that members are aware of that.<\/p> <p>  Electricity markets generally work quite well.  What we need going forward is perhaps an evolution rather than a revolution.  The issue is the gas market, which is being manipulated.  I do not think we should go for the electricity market when the problem is in the gas market.  That is the root cause of the problem.  There are a few things in the electricity market that will help going forward.  We think consumers should be more active, meaning more prosumers, more demand response and more role for the consumer to be active.  We think also long-term contracts, which are kind of linked to hedging, will mitigate the risk from short-term price spikes.  Those are some changes we can integrate.  There would be a review.  Next year, the reform will take place.  I would just flag, once again, that the electricity market works well.  It is the gas market that is the problem and the contagion effect of the gas market on electricity is what is driving up prices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cillian O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy on the nuclear safety issue.

It should not become a distraction from the things that we need to do.  If a decision is to be made on nuclear, it will likely be in the next decade, if the technology becomes available.  We have to acknowledge that it is still yet to move from conceptual to the commercial.  It is long way to go yet.  In 15 years&rsquo; time, we will all be much older and much wiser, and perhaps the technology will have progressed.

One can look at the model that the UK took in terms of oil and gas exploration, or one can look at the Norwegian model.  The Norwegian model, or the Scandinavian model, is interesting because the Norwegian Government took an active, rather than passive, role in partnership.  When a country takes on the role of being an active partner in these projects, it must help to de-risk the projects to some degree.  When a country de-risks projects, it can then demand royalties.

There are no silver bullets; it is all hard work.  It is all difficult and it all takes planning.  There are no game-changers.  All of this stuff is difficult.  Again, I will come back to my opening statement.  When a state, such as Ireland, is almost 90% reliant on fossil fuels, we have some big challenges ahead.  However, there are certainly some big opportunities for anaerobic digestion in Ireland.  As I said, by 2030, it could meet about 20% of our natural gas needs. That would be about 6 TWh.  That is actually currently within the climate action plan - to achieve that goal it is about 5.6 TWh, which is significant.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is right that it needs policy support.  The cost of producing a unit of renewable gas from farmyard slurry and farmyard grass is about somewhere between &euro;70 and &euro;100 per MWh.  As Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue mentioned, when we look at natural gas prices on global markets, at the moment they are probably trading this morning at about &euro;120 per MWh.  At present, renewable gas is competitive with fossil fuels.  Of course fossil fuel prices will not remain high forever, but over the short-term foreseeable future, it will remain competitive.<\/p> <p>  There needs to be a strong recognition of the sustainability requirements.  It is fundamentally important when producing any type of fuel from farmland, be it meat or renewable gas, that it done in a sustainable way and it fits within the renewable energy directives at European law and also respects biodiversity, bird life and wildlife habitats within the current Irish legislation.<\/p><p>We have much of the legislation in place so in many ways it is just about enforcing it and making sure that any projects that go ahead for anaerobic digestion respect it.<br\/><br\/>On the Senator's question on where Ireland is in relation to other European member states, we have one of the largest potentials on a <i>per capita<\/i>or on a per land area basis but we have one of the lowest realisations of that capacity at the moment.  If we look at that value of 6 terawatt hours, or about 20% of our natural gas in 2030, that is roughly 2% to 4% of the agricultural grasslands that we would need in Ireland.  We are not talking about a vast mono-culture where vast swathes of farming are turned over into anaerobic digestion.  It would be small.  My personal rather than professional view is that it would be more suited to the co-operative-type organisations that we have in many parts of Ireland.  They have a lot of social and community strength and trust.  They also have capital.  These types of investments would not be suitable for individual farmers.  They would be more suitable for groups of farmers, with maybe ten or 12 farmers coming together, pooling their slurry and grass silage to produce renewable gas.  It would have to be a mixture of slurry and grass, or maybe a little more grass, but it is typically a 50:50 mix.  There is too much liquid content in slurry and it would not be strong enough on its own to produce enough natural gas.  Of course, with grass, we need to be careful how it is grown, avoiding as much chemical fertiliser as possible.  There is much very good research done in institutions, such as Teagasc and Devenish Farms, looking at different swards that can be used that would allow the production of more grass by using less chemical fertilisers.  The initial findings of those studies are quite positive.  Not only can they produce more grass, but they also tend to be healthier in terms of the health of the soils and allowing more biodiversity within those swards of grass.  However, I would caution that this is an area where the technology and the knowledge exist but the policy is simply not there to encourage farmers to make that leap of faith.  What would really be a foundation is a strong, stable policy that offers farmers or co-operatives a good and dignified return on their investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Deane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":553,"content":"<p>M question for Mr. O'Donoghue is in relation to the UK and Norwegian markets.

Norway is part of the internal energy market.  It is part of the EEA.  Norway is fully integrated with our structure, although it is not an EU member state.  The UK is not.  This is an important difference.  We have a very close working relationship with Norway.  The country is our second biggest supplier of gas and we are discussing with it bilaterally the reduction of gas prices.  Norway is also a very important battery for European electricity.  The country has a huge amount of hydropower which acts as a battery or as a reserve.  In southern Norway, electricity prices are very high at present.  Normally, what would be done is that some of that hydropower would be released to alleviate the price increases in the south of the country.  However, the Norwegians are not releasing this hydropower because they are using it as a storage for this coming winter.  Norway is playing a very important role in European electricity security.  There were some internal discussions in Norway with some parties saying that the country should not be exporting to the UK and Europe and that they should have electricity at lower cost.  However, the general consensus among politicians was that the country was fully part of the market and had an important role to play in electricity security.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the UK, co-operation is now much better.  We have offshore sea co-operation where the UK was excluded for a short time but now it is back in and co-operation is very good.  It is very important regarding energy that we treat the UK as a full member of the Internal Market even though it is not.  On the supply risk from the UK to Ireland, I have to be careful what I say here.  That is a political judgment.  By and large, Northern Ireland and Ireland are one single energy market so I cannot see any incentive from the UK side to cut off or reduce supplies to Ireland.  However, I am not an expert on that situation and someone else would be a better judge, but from my understanding, it should be pretty secure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cillian O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I will address Deputy Haughey's question on data centres.  There are pros and cons to data centres in terms of their impact on energy and on climate.  We are quite fortunate in Ireland that we have a lot of very ambitious data centre owners, some of the large corporates, for example.  They have very good net-zero targets for 2030.  These are actually more ambitious that our national targets.  It is important to have those people in this country because it creates a policy pull.  They are investing a lot in renewables and different smart technologies.  That is important.  We must also acknowledge the financial contribution that those companies make to the Exchequer and also in terms of digitalisation.  I did not have to come to Dublin today because I can use Teams.  Data centres and the modern digital economy play a fundamental role in enabling a lot of the really positive stuff.<\/p> <p>  On the cons, any increase in electricity demand is mainly coming from data centres.  This makes Ireland a little bit unusual in comparison to other European member states.  About 14% of all the electricity consumed last year was by data centres.  This year we added on the equivalent of about 200,000 homes worth of electricity usage onto the power grid from data centres alone.<\/p> <p>  We are going through a number of crises within the energy and electricity sectors in Ireland.  We have a physical crisis within the power sector and we have a price crisis.  The price crisis is very clearly, as Mr. O'Donoghue mentioned, caused by natural gas and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  However, the physical crisis that we have here is our own doing.  It is our own failure to deliver new gas-fired generation.  To help out the power system when the wind is not strong and the sun is not shining, we need to have conventional generation.  That is where we have dropped the ball in Ireland.  The consequence of increasing demand at a time when the ability to produce energy is reducing is not a good strategy.  My view is that there needs to be a pause for reflection until we figure out and resolve the physical crisis that we have in Ireland.<\/p><p>Once we do that and build the conventional generation that allows us to restore the Irish power system to its needed reliability, adequacy and robustness, the conversation needs to pivot not on how many data centres we have but on the type we encourage and welcome.  Some of the large corporates have ambitious strategies for what they call the 24-7 use of renewable energy, which entails using green power every hour.  Companies that can deliver on that would have a much lower impact on emissions and a benign impact on the power system in Ireland.  To deliver on it, the data centre companies would need not only to invest in renewables, which many of them are doing, but also invest significantly in flexibility on their own side and in energy storage.  If we can carve out a pathway whereby we can attract the data centres into our economy and society and prove the concept can work, the centres will have a benign impact on our emissions and energy system.  To remain relevant in a world in which we all need to reduce emissions, we need to reduce fossil fuel reliance.  Data centres that cannot demonstrate an ability to operate right across the year with as much renewable energy as possible are just not compatible with our national goals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Deane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":558,"content":"<p>Dr. Deane has engaged in a fair bit of commentary, accepting that our supply chain through Britain makes us slightly different from other parts of the European Union.

There is a 7 GW target for 2030, so the permitting process needs to be speeded up in that regard.  Second, it is important to have a clear storage strategy.  If we are going all out or heavy on wind, we must determine the balancer.  Is it natural gas, hydrogen or batteries?

We have that now.  We are now going through a similar energy crisis, which has exposed our reliance on fossil fuels, but now we are not hostage to confusion.  We know we have technologies to get out of this.  It will take time.  I reiterate Mr. O'Donoghue's point that while we know what we have to do and why, we have to determine the how and the what quicker.

We have spoken a lot today about electricity for our appliances, gas for our electricity and gas for our homes, but just under 1 million homes in Ireland use oil or kerosine to heat their homes.  That is a high level of reliance.  Ireland has one of the highest levels of reliance on oil-fired heating per person in the EU.  Anything we can do to reduce that is fundamentally important, not only environmentally because oil is polluting, but also socially.  We are all exposed when it comes to gas prices but we see the volatility in kerosene prices and home-heating prices and, therefore, any technology we can use on the supply side, be it geothermal technology, air-to-earth heat pumps or sustainable biomass, is fundamentally important, but we also need to consider the fabric of our built infrastructure.

Smart meters make sense, where people have technologies on their phones so that they know they should not use energy between certain hours.  It is linked to digitalisation.  The more data we have on energy usage and the more proactive the consumer is, the better it will be in terms of reducing electricity usage in peak hours.  That is definitely an important way to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cillian O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":566,"content":"<p>In regard to nuclear, we should look at all options to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.  We must also be realistic and temper that with reality.  The likelihood of SMRs moving from the conceptual space to the commercial space is probably ten to 15 years away.  As I mentioned we are spending &euro;1 million every single hour on importing fossil fuels into Ireland.  We need to temper our expectations around the future availability of technologies with the reality that they will take time to deliver.  Yes we should look at all options.  However, they should not be a distraction from what we need in the present.  The next 15 months and the next decade are going to be crucial and we cannot continue our reliance on fossil fuels.  We will need backup.  As I mentioned renewables reduce the use of fossil fuels and power plants but they do not replace the need.  In the next eight to ten years that backup is probably going to have to come predominantly from natural gas.  That is why the security of supply of Ireland's natural gas, the storage of natural gas and understanding our accessibility and reliability of our natural gas system are fundamentally important.  We are not going to move away from fossil fuel overnight.  We will transition slowly away from it.  During that transition period we are going to need insurance policies such as gas storage.  We will need to think carefully about our natural gas.  In the long term vision, looking along the same timelines as SMRs, we are getting into the realm of different decarbonised gases such as hydrogen maybe coming on board.  That is probably a conversation for the next decade rather than being useful for this decade.  However, we are going to need backup.  That is clear.<\/p> <p>  In regard to data centres I am not familiar with the 70% number mentioned by Senator Keogan.  I know some of the numbers from EirGrid show a very strong increase of data centre demand growth into the future.  I reiterate that the conversation needs to change from how many data centres we have in Ireland, to what type.  Data centres that can demonstrate they can use renewables and store renewables to meet their energy needs will have a very positive impact on the energy system in Ireland for having a benign impact on climate emissions.  For that we need to look for leadership with the data centre industry.  We know at a conceptual level how energy can be stored and how flexibility can be moved around but commercially these things are very expensive.  To remain relevant in a society and in the economy of the country that is demanding that everything should be greener and cleaner we probably need the data industry owners to step up to leadership on that issue and deliver some of those very flexible, what we call 24-7 or green power every hour operations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022101900002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Deane"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":567,"content":"<p>At this point in time they are not doing that.

Are there issues around supply of materials or technology?  You see the odd one.  What is the feasibility of that either for individuals or for communities?

I just got that installed and I have not mastered the technology yet but there seems to be some concern, and the witnesses may or may not be able to comment on this, that they are not delivering for consumers in the way they should.  In some cases it can actually cost people more.  I am sorry I do not have more detail on that.  If the witnesses do not have more detail I understand that they cannot answer the question.  I have been hearing about that in the media.  Finally on the issue of data centres where Dr. Deane talks about the type of data centre, I hear what he is saying but is he including the idea that they would produce their own renewable electricity?  Is that an important part of it?

We see big benefits there.  They have apps, they react to when prices are low and when prices are high.  We had a recent meeting with the CEO of Eesti Energia who is in charge of energy in Estonia.  He was giving advice to many EU member states on how they have done in Estonia.  It is a good model to follow.  Maybe there are some hiccups of which I am not aware but by and large smart meters and more information lead to better decisions from consumers which leads to less usage of energy at the wrong hours.

Allowing our communities to get involved in that process is something that can only be beneficial.

Yes, there are big challenges.  Fifteen years ago, we had a solar industry in Europe, particularly in Germany, but now we do not.  By and large, the jobs and the production have gone to China.  In terms of materials, silicone is a very important source for solar.  In general, most of that production is taking place elsewhere.  We are coming with a new raw materials strategy and this is called a critical raw materials strategy.  As we move from a fossil fuel intensive economy to a raw materials intensive economy, our dependence on certain critical raw materials, such as silicone, lithium, cobalt for electric vehicles, etc., is going to shift.  We need to be able to react to that.  I would also flag that much of the energy intensive industries that make these raw materials are suffering a lot under this crisis.  We need to find solutions so that they stay in Europe.  I do not think it is wise to become overly dependent on China for imports of these critical raw materials.  In the last six months, we have seen what an over-dependence on one supplier can do.  We thought we had an inter-dependent relationship with Russia.  It turns out that was not the case.  We have seen what happens when we become too reliant on one supplier.

I am joined by Ulster Bank&rsquo;s director of corporate affairs, Ms Elizabeth Arnett.<\/p> <p>  As the members know, our phased withdrawal is progressing and we have made sure to keep the committee informed at all stages.  We have committed to a phased, orderly withdrawal to minimise job losses and support all colleagues with training and development, with a preference to deal with strategic banking counterparties, where possible, who can provide customers with full banking services in the Irish market.  We commit to helping our customers move to a new provider as safely and as seamlessly as possible, with plenty of advance notice, and to keep branches open throughout our choose, move, close campaign to ensure customers have access to branch support during their six-month notice period, where possible.  There has been no bank-wide voluntary redundancy scheme in the first half of 2022, and it is highly unlikely that we will see large numbers of redundancy exits this year.  In addition, we have committed to dealing with our non-performing loans in the later stages of our withdrawal, to allow customers who are in difficulty as much time and support as possible to return to a performing position.  We are delivering on all of these commitments as our withdrawal progresses.<\/p> <p>  Today, I would like to outline the current position and the next steps for our current and deposit account customers, and we are happy to take questions on any aspect of our withdrawal in the discussion and will endeavour to answer them subject to the normal commercial considerations.  We announced our plans for the closure of our current and deposit account customers a year ago, in October 2021.  Six months later, in April 2022, we formally began writing to customers to ask them to choose a new provider, and move and close their current and deposit accounts on a phased, rolling basis, giving them six months&rsquo; notice to do so.  We have been communicating multiple times and in multiple ways with our customers throughout this six-month notice period, and there are a number of channels available to them to close accounts.  We have engaged in significant advertising and marketing campaigns, as have other important stakeholders such as financial service providers, the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  The campaigns have been constant, and one can hardly turn on the radio, open a newspaper or go online without hearing a message about moving to a new provider.  This might seem excessive sometimes but a programme of this scale that requires so many customers and stakeholders to act, requires this level of communications.  Based on our independent research, the communications have worked, and our customers are universally aware of what is happening and of what they need to do.<\/p> <p>  In addition to our customer communications and in recognition that many other stakeholders external to Ulster Bank would need to play a part in ensuring customers could safely choose, move and close, we commenced a proactive programme of engagement a year ago.  To date, we have held over 1,200 stakeholder engagements, from large-scale roadshow events to regular, one-to-one meetings.  Many committee members or colleagues in their constituency or parliamentary teams have attended some of these events.<\/p> <p>  Our objective is to ensure we employ all communication channels to ensure customers are aware of the action they need to take and the supports available to them.  I thank all stakeholders for their ongoing support.  While communications are a central part of our activity, it is second only to providing practical support and outreach to customers.  In this regard, we are very proud of our front-line teams and the lengths to which they have gone to support our customers, and I take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank them for that.<\/p> <p>  By way of example of the sorts of initiatives we are implementing to provide practical support to customers, we have changed our branch hours to allow more time to support customers move their accounts.  We have hosted teams from other financial institutions in our banking halls, so they are on site to open accounts for our customers.  We have a full range of supports for vulnerable customers, details of which we have shared with the committee.  We have carried out additional proactive contact to customers who might need more help, such as those in financial difficulty, older customers, heavy branch users and customers at the end of their six-month notice period.  We have made it easier for customers to close their account in-branch, on the telephone and digitally.<\/p> <p>  We are already seeing trends that show a significant reduction in reliance on branches for our customers, with in-branch transactions down by 49% and falling each week.  At the same time, other financial providers have made it easier for customers to open accounts and we have seen many initiatives in this regard.  I will not mention any specifically, but we can see from the enormous number of accounts that have been opened this year - on average 12,500 a week - that the supports put in place by other financial providers are working.  In some instances, accounts can be opened digitally in a matter of moments but, equally, for customers who do not want to open accounts digitally there is no significant delay for appointments, with the Central Bank reporting an eight-day waiting period for appointments.<\/p> <p>  We have also mirrored our process and approach for our business customers, providing them with six months&rsquo; notice to choose, move and close as well as multiple letters, prompts and calls.<\/p><p>Having a working current account is crucial for businesses to be able to pay their employees and suppliers, receive payments and carry out all their financial duties.  The switching or closing process can typically take longer for a business customer because requirements are often more complex, so I have been engaging proactively with these customers since they received their first letters, and in many cases before then, to ensure they have the support they need.  If a customer does not switch or close a business current account, it could have implications for the business in terms of paying employee wages, paying suppliers and receiving payments for its goods and services.  Ulster Bank is asking employers to communicate directly with employees who continue to have Ulster Bank accounts to remind them to change their details to avoid any disruptions to salary payments.<\/p><p> We believe we have taken all reasonable steps to support customers to choose, move and close and, to the best of our knowledge, other financial institutions have also taken appropriate steps to encourage customers to choose, move and close.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, we have significant outreach to customers, with a focus on those approaching the end of their notice period for current and deposit accounts.  In the past four weeks we have made, on average, approximately 10,000 calls a week, successfully contacting an average of 6,000 customers per week.  In these calls, our colleagues ask customers if they need support ahead of the end of their six-month notice period.  The majority of these customers are telling us that they have taken action or are in the process of doing so, and already have their move well in hand.  Most customers are telling us that they have opened a new account and need to complete the transfer of their transactions.  A small percentage tell us they will now take action, while a very small number of customers have asked us for more time due to personal circumstances.  We have now written to the vast majority of customers who need to close their account, which means almost every customer has begun the six-month notice period, with some more advanced than others.<\/p><p> Before I go into the detail of what has been happening, I wish to share one of the learnings from the past six months.  When we started this process, we believed the primary metric for success would be the number of accounts that have closed.  However, a far more important metric is the degree to which a customer is reliant on the account.  When a customer has an account with another bank and his or her salary and other payments are going into that account and the direct debits and so on have been moved to it, the customer is no longer reliant on his or her Ulster Bank account.  The customer might never come back to close the account with Ulster Bank, so in such instances we can close the account with no impact on the customer.  What is important is that the customer has safely moved to a new provider and is no longer reliant on Ulster Bank.  Understanding that reliance, through detailed analysis, has helped us to target more effective communication which, in turn, has driven customer behaviour.  For example, members may have heard our adverts targeting customers making nursing home payments or customers in receipt of social protection payments.  We have also highlighted salary payments because nothing says you need a bank account more than if your main source of income is banked there.<\/p><p> How have customers been responding?  Some customers have gone beyond their six-month notice period and some other customers still have more than five months&rsquo; notice left.  As such, looking at the headline numbers across the entire population will not tell one very much about customer behaviour and the customer response.  Of our personal current account customers who received their first formal notification in April and May, 71% have either closed or materially wound down the level of activity in their current account or left it inactive and dormant, and that percentage is increasing every day.  Since our submission last Friday, 80% of our first set of customers have either closed or are inactive on their accounts.  We have contacted most of the remainder of these customers as a final reminder and most of them are reporting that they have opened a new account elsewhere or are in the process of moving their payments to a new account.  Broadly, this trend is emerging in the other tranches of customers and we are not seeing anything in the numbers that at this stage would change that trend.  This is evidenced in a number of ways.  For example, 171,000 Ulster Bank accounts were in receipt of social protection payments at the start of the year.  This number has dropped by more than 80% to approximately 30,000.  Since we submitted our report, it has dropped to 28,000.<\/p><p> What happens now?  From the outset, we committed to an orderly and phased withdrawal of the bank from the Irish market.  This commitment is more important than ever as we commence the process of freezing and closing accounts.  Therefore, in line with our commitment, we will take a considered and careful approach to account closures.  We will continue to assess external, operational and other factors to ensure that the right number and type of accounts are progressing to the account freezing and closing stages.  As a reminder, our closure process has an additional step built in.  Customers have six months&rsquo; notice to choose, move and close.  On or after the six months, the account is frozen for 30 days and then moves to closure.  This is an important interim step and, for some customers, may be the trigger to ensure they are no longer reliant on Ulster Bank.  We will also take time to understand the account profile and what impact, if any, freezing the account will have on the customer.  That will determine the point at which an account moves forward into the closure process.  Ultimately, all accounts will move into the closure process, but in the initial round of closures we will take a very precautionary approach.<\/p><p> What does this mean for customers at the end of their notice period?  As some customers are past or close to passing their six-month notice period, a number of things will happen.  These will be dependent on the needs of the customer.  If a customer needs more support, which may or may not mean more time, we can provide that - the customer just needs to let us know.  If a customer is still reliant on the account after the six-month notice period is over, we will try to make contact with the customer again to ensure he or she has all the requirements needed to complete the move to a new bank and service provider.  We will not freeze or close the customer's accounts at this time but it is essential that the customer continues the process of moving to another service provider.  According to customer feedback and independent research, most of these customers have a bank account elsewhere and are in the process of moving, so we believe they are on the way to completing the process.<\/p><p>If we freeze an account on which a customer is still reliant, we can temporarily reverse the freezing of the account for a short time once the customer contacts us.  If a customer is no longer reliant on an account but it is still open, with no activity or a low level of activity, the customer can expect the account to be frozen and closed on or after the six-month notice period.  This precautionary, careful and controlled approach means that where a customer is reliant on the account, we can tailor the closure to the customer's individual requirements, and the overall closure of accounts is managed to maintain an orderly process for customers, the industry and other key stakeholders.  Right now, we have a temporary pause in the commencement of this activity to accommodate the additional social protection payments announced in the recent budget.  Even though more than 80% of customers in receipt of a social protection payment have taken action on their account, there are some who have not done so and they have the potential to be the most vulnerable.<\/p><p> We will start the process of freezing and closing accounts in a controlled and careful way on or after 11 November, beginning with customers who we believe are no longer reliant on their account.  We will take a planned break in freezing accounts for Christmas.  During this break, accounts that have already been frozen for a month will continue to close unless the customer contacts us, and we will continue our outreach to customers reliant on their account during that time.  We will recommence the programme of freezing and closing accounts in the new year, so it is important that customers realise that once their six-month notice period is over, their account will be in line to be closed, but there is help available if they need it.<\/p><p> It is important to remember that Ulster Bank is closing.  We need to provide certainty for our colleagues as to when they can expect to leave the bank so they can plan for their futures, and we need to be clear to customers that it is in their best interests to be with a new financial provider that can support their needs into the future.  We have endeavoured to ensure that all reasonable steps have been taken to support customers to choose, move and close.  We will continue to do so throughout this process.<\/p><p>I thank the members for listening and am happy to take their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane Howard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Howard.

I am grateful for the opportunity to address this committee.  I am accompanied today by my colleagues Dermot Kieran, chief financial and products officer of the bank, and Darragh Lennon, director of retail distribution.  We look forward to a constructive discussion regarding the closure and switching of current accounts and related issues as KBC exits the Irish market.<\/p> <p>  A number of key milestones in relation to the planned orderly exit of KBC have taken place since we last met with the committee.  The agreement relating to the sale of performing loan assets and deposits to the Bank of Ireland Group received approval from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on 24 May 2022, after which we ceased accepting new applications across all products.<\/p> <p>  We have also been informed that the Minister for Finance has instructed that the ministerial order confirming his approval of the transfer to Bank of Ireland be drafted.  Subject to the completion of the remaining procedural steps, the transfer is anticipated to take place in early 2023.<\/p> <p>  We have started communicating with our customers on the next steps associated with the transfer of products to Bank of Ireland.  As part of this communication, we have provided customers with a comprehensive product guide outlining clearly what is happening across all products and the actions required of customers in each case.  When we last attended this committee in May of this year, I expressed our determination to protect the interests of our customers and staff to the greatest extent possible as we conduct an orderly exit from the Irish market.  It has been and will remain a key priority for KBC Bank Ireland to support our customers at every turn and to communicate effectively with them, ensuring they have all the information they require, understand the actions they need to take, and have sufficient time to take those actions.<\/p> <p>  KBC current accounts are not part of the transaction with Bank of Ireland, which means that customers are required to move and close their current accounts.  Managing this process has been an important priority for our team and we have dedicated significant resources to ensure the process is as smooth as possible for our customers.  I am happy to report that, in partnership with our customers and supported by our dedicated staff, we are making good progress and account closures are tracking materially ahead of plan.  I would like to now provide members with an update on that progress.<\/p> <p>  As outlined previously when we attended here in May, we estimated, based on our data and analysis, that 52,000 of the 130,000 total number of KBC current account holders may need to open a new account or move to a new provider.  Today, our estimates show that the 52,000 figure is down 25% to 39,000.  I can also confirm that 55% of all current account customers have now received account closure notices, and these notices will continue to be issued into the first quarter of 2023.  Priority customers, including those in a vulnerable position, non-digitally enabled customers, and people over the age of 65 were prioritised from the outset to give them sufficient time to transfer their accounts and 95% of that group have received their notifications.  Of this prioritised group of 4,400 customers, only 700 remain with an active account today.<\/p> <p>  There has been a 110% increase in current accounts with a zero balance, with an overall reduction of 26% in current account balances since May.  The number of direct debits is reducing at a rate of 3,000 per week.  Another key indicator of activity is the level of social welfare payments being made into current accounts.  This has decreased by 32% from May to September, with just 8,500 accounts remaining in receipt of social welfare payments.<\/p> <p>  We can confirm that 10% of current accounts have been closed by customers since May, which is above our projections.  The first wave of account closures, which consists of inactive current accounts, will commence in December 2022.  The closure process will proceed from that point onwards in four-week cycles, continuing until August 2023.<\/p> <p>  As previously communicated, 90% of all customer service queries are handled through the contact centre and 97% of active KBC current account customers are digitally enabled.  KBC has increased by 65% the staff dedicated to serving customers in the contact centre and by 25% in our operations centre since the announcement of the agreement with Bank of Ireland, ensuring that strong service levels are maintained and the average call waiting time for talking to a colleague in the contact centre in KBC remains less than 30 seconds.<\/p> <p>  We know that a digital first approach to banking is preferred by our customers and this is supported by our recent research which found that 81% of KBC customers surveyed prefer to close their account digitally.  In November, KBC will be able to support customers to close their current accounts via the KBC app.  Our hubs, which are not traditional bank branches as they were primarily designed for sales and not for operations, are used by a small number of our customers for support and they will remain open to support with switching or closing until after customers have transferred to Bank of Ireland.  Based on our customer data, we expect that those current account holders who are more likely to want to visit a hub, will have already closed or switched their current accounts before the closure of any hubs.<\/p> <p>  We have a dedicated care team for customers who may need some extra help and support during this time.  Our care team has lots of experience supporting customers with different needs and continues to support vulnerable customers through the current account closure process.<\/p> <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to thank KBC Bank Ireland staff who continue to go the extra mile in servicing the needs of our customers in what is a challenging period for them also.  A successful engagement process with the employee council, which represents staff interests, culminated in that body securing a redundancy package that compares very favourably in the sector and we continue the principle of consulting and communicating on an ongoing basis with staff directly. <\/p> <p>  On the subject of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, or TUPE regulations, and the transfer of staff to Bank of Ireland, I can confirm that the TUPE consultation with Bank of Ireland concluded in July and that all eligible staff have been communicated with directly regarding the transfer of their role and how their employment terms and conditions have been protected.  It is still too early to state the number of employees who will transfer to Bank of Ireland, as they are entitled to waive their TUPE rights up to the point of migration in 2023. <\/p> <p>  In conclusion, I believe we are making good progress on the subject of current account closures and account switching where we continue to place the interests of customers at the centre of the process, providing every support we can in doing so.<\/p><p>As stated, we are also heavily focused on the well-being of our staff and we will continue to engage with them to ensure that their best interests are protected as we continue the orderly wind-down of the bank.  My colleagues and I are happy to take any questions the committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Jansen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":594,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#E00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I was wondering if we all should go home, given that the CEOs have told us they are ahead of target and everything is going so well.

An active current account could have 70 or more transactions in a month.  If we think of all the times people use their current accounts to tap for a coffee, pay a mortgage or whatever, an active current account on which they are fully reliant will have a high number of transactions.  If a person's number of transactions is between one and five, it is not unreasonable to assume, primarily because customers as well as independent research are telling us, it is very unlikely to be that person&rsquo;s main bank account.  What defines reliance here, for example, would be where a person has a bank account elsewhere.  That person would be less reliant on Ulster Bank.  If a person has payments, salaries or a Department of Social Protection payment going into that account, that person is more reliant.  Let us face it, unless there is something going in, it is very hard to make payments out.  If payments are not going into that account and into another one, again reliance is even less.  If the balance is extremely low, a person will not pay the ESB or electricity bill out of that.  Again, the reliance is even less in that case.  However, we accept there is a qualified judgment on our part in relation to those numbers of transactions, which is why we have the additional step of being able to reverse the freeze within 15 minutes if the customer states they are still reliant.  However, at that point we have the conversation with the customers as to how much support and time they need and whether we can get them an appointment in the other banks.  We invite them into our branch where we have Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB in the banking hall and ask whether we can get it done for them.  That is a very important step to get attention for customers who, bear in mind, have had six months&rsquo; notice and any number of contacts.  Rather than jump straight to closing the account completely, irrespective of the numbers, we have introduced this step.<\/p> <p>  We have done two things for customers who are reliant on their account and have two sources of data on that.  We have been talking to those customers and they are telling us they are banked elsewhere.  We have also researched separately to verify that fact.  We know that 80% of the customers who are heavily banked have a bank account elsewhere.  We know 96% of them know their account will be closed and 91% are telling us they will take action within the next four weeks.  What we have seen over the past two weeks in terms of the changes on the numbers of accounts that are opened and closed, that are not reliant, that have no balance, or that are heavily reliant actually bears that out.  We want to avoid a situation where we are closing accounts where customers are reliant on them.  However, we have told customers that if they leave the account, we will close it for them.  We have said that we would do that and we need to finish that process for customers.  However, the objective is to make sure there is no reliance on the account.  If there is reliance, we can reverse that very quickly and engage with the customer.  We need to keep the momentum going in terms the overall journeys for customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Arnett"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":654,"content":"<p>Of the 5,400 who have some level of activity on the account, as things stand, if nothing changes between now and two weeks from Friday, how many of those accounts will be closed or suspended?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#F01100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I think those numbers will change again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Arnett"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":656,"content":"<p>We all hope so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#F01300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>They changed over the weekend and they will change again.

We have reviewed approximately 400 cases of very vulnerable customers and power of attorney is an issue that often arises.  Where we can and where we are very confident that there is not a customer safety issue or a question of financial vulnerability, we can work with - it would be wrong to use the word \"bypass\" - the customer and his or her family, and the other bank, to ensure we are moving the money into a single name account, into the other bank, without having to go through the costly process of attaining power of attorney.  Equally, we have found customers where power of attorney would have been granted in the UK.  We will obviously not make the customer go through that process here.  We are taking a pragmatic approach but customer safety is at the heart of it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked more broadly about other supports for customers who might have difficulties.  One of the issues we came across related to residents in nursing homes.  There are approximately 600 nursing homes, private and public, in Ireland, and we have given them the direct contact details of somebody in our local branch or our local area manager, who will work with any patient of a nursing home who needs additional support.  A local person can go into a nursing home and resolve the issues.  We have a customer support line, which is open seven days a week and which has received approximately 8,000 calls.  We have had contact with approximately 70,000 vulnerable customers.  We have done a large outreach to the stakeholders, including Safeguarding Ireland, etc., that represent vulnerable customers.  They have been helpful in giving us a practical compass as to how to respond to customers without putting obstacles in the way, while also maintaining the absolute integrity of the financial safety and security of the individuals in question.

We are four months into a 14-month process and the number of customers we see as needing another account or needing to undertake significant switching activity has reduced by approximately 25% in those first four months.  We are seeing good traction every week, as Mr. Jansen mentioned in his opening statement, around the moving of direct debits.  That number is dropping by approximately 3,000 per week and we now have approximately 135,000 direct debits attaching to any of our current accounts.

I will ask the following of both institutions.  Engagement with utility companies and third parties in the whole area of direct debit switching is something that has come up quite a bit.  While people may have switched their accounts, they are having difficulty switching over their direct debits with various utility companies, which I will not name.  What engagement have the banks had with the utility companies and other entities over direct debits?  How can we speed up the process?

We are very conscious of the fact that our withdrawal put a lot of emphasis and pressure on other stakeholders, other banks and the direct debit originators because a customer cannot fully complete the journey without the support of those stakeholders.  We started a very early process of engagement across the industry.  We were all involved in that.  We brought in what we considered the top 20 direct debit originators, including the large utility companies, the telephone service providers and the insurance providers, to inform them of our plans and the number of accounts coming through.  We have, by and large, seen a very positive response from those service providers, making it much easier for customers to change their details online or over the phone, and just having the information to hand for customers.  In the past four weeks, BPFI hosted a session with direct debit originators to attempt to check how things are going.  Direct debit originators that started early are further ahead in their engagement, it would be fair to say.  Those are more in the energy provider space.  I think those companies are more tuned in.  Perhaps that is unfair because it would imply that others are not, but those companies engaged with us on these issues from a very early stage of the process.<\/p><p>We have seen a huge decrease in the number of direct debit transactions across the board, not just in the early tranches.  We have seen the levels come down.  We have not come across any situation where it is prohibitively difficult for customers to make the changes.  If customers do have issues, we raise them directly through our engagement with the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, which is engaging with the direct debit originators.  There is nothing I can point to that could be described as a blocker in terms of the issues and concerns.<\/p><p> Initially there was a concern that if everybody used the switcher process, it might be a challenge for direct debit originators, but we are finding that most customers are driving the process themselves, with about 10% using the switcher process and using it effectively.  One of the concerns we have is that customers who do not close their accounts may not fully conclude their direct debit processes.  They might assume we are going to close the account but the direct debit will not get taken from the account.  There could be unintended consequences if an account is left open, so we are watching those sorts of things to make sure that does not happen.<\/p><p> In terms of payments in, the big one according to our engagements is the Department of Social Protection.  As I said earlier, we are about 85% of the way there, but as we move on in that process, we are going to see more and more vulnerable customers who have not made the change and we are going to work very closely with the Department to resolve that with them.  We have exchanged data and the Department is contacting customers directly whose notice period is coming to an end.  The contact from us and from the Department is proving to be very effective.  Over the weekend, for example, another 2,000 accounts moved on.  It is a work in progress and the broader external communications campaign supports all of that.  In the later tranches, we are seeing customers starting to make changes earlier in the journey.  We just need to stay on it and be there to support customers as much as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022101900002#G02800","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Arnett","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I would like to add a point or two on that.

I will not run through them again but what we have seen is that when direct debit originators proactively communicate with their customers, that is very effective.  When they approach their customers, point out they are paying a direct debit from a KBC or Ulster Bank account and ask them to take action, that is very effective.  We have seen that with the Department of Social Protection in particular, which has conducted a really strong campaign with customers.  We have seen our social welfare payments dropping by 35% in the first four months of our programme, which is very positive, and 90% of what we have left are child benefit payments.  That is a positive as well in that the likelihood of vulnerability is lessening as we get through those.  Some of the bigger utilities have done great work in terms of contacting their customers directly and asking them to close their accounts.  When they do that, it definitely has a massive and positive impact.  We are encouraging that through the BPFI groups, which meet every two weeks, and through our own engagements.

We are trying to share our plans with them so that they understand when these letters are going to reach customers and when the closures are going to hit next year.

Third, we all heard about the time we were encouraged to seek alternative services, which we essentially had to do ourselves.  Nobody from any of the banks said we have decided to transfer your account, if it necessary and if it is acceptable, to bank X, Y or Z.  In that case it could have been done with the press of a button and no more waiting, queuing, asking questions, bills for outstanding issues and so on and so forth.

I welcome the opportunity to present the Bill to the committee.  I am assistant secretary in the Department of Health.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Caitriona Mason and Ms Bronwyn Conway, from the bioethics unit in the Department.  I would like to outline the rationale behind the introduction of the Bill, before briefly addressing some of its main provisions.  As members will be aware, the purpose of this Bill is to ensure safe access to termination of pregnancy services.<\/p> <p>  Since 2019, when the termination of pregnancy service commenced within participating maternity units and general practices across Ireland, there have been periodic reports of demonstrations and anti-abortion group gatherings outside facilities providing termination of pregnancy services.  We are mindful of the distress, anxiety and damage to the health and well-being of those subjected to such protests, which risk, in some instances, deterring women from accessing the medical care they need.  This is particularly true considering such demonstrations often disproportionately affect the most marginalised and vulnerable sections of our society.  In light of these incidents and cognisant of their impact on service users and providers, the Minister for Health is committed to delivering on the programme for Government, which promises to \"establish exclusion zones around medical facilities\".  In furtherance of this objective, the aim of this general scheme and its underlying policy is to protect the right of a woman to access a healthcare service safely, with privacy and dignity, and without facing unsolicited attempts to influence her decision.  It will also protect service providers and their staff in the course of their duties and responsibilities.  <\/p> <p>  We can all agree that it is in the public interest to ensure that healthcare services, including termination of pregnancy services, can be accessed safely and privately by those who need them, and this is what this general scheme proposes to deliver.  Primarily, this is achieved through the creation of safe access zones.  The proposals aim to establish a 100 m safe access zone around all healthcare facilities that can provide termination of pregnancy services, not just those that currently do, including, for example, all hospitals and GP practices.  This is to ensure that the legislation will not highlight the specific service sites where termination of pregnancy services are currently provided and will allow them to continue in relative anonymity.  Within those zones, conduct which is intended to, or may reasonably have the effect of, influencing the decision of a person in relation to availing of, or providing, services related to termination of pregnancy will be prohibited.  Head 4 sets out a comprehensive, though non-exhaustive, list of such behaviours.  The goal here is to ensure that conduct aimed at impeding access or influencing the decisions of service users or providers within these zones is addressed to the greatest extent possible to allow the legislation to deliver on its objectives.  In addition to these provisions, further protection is afforded by head 6.  This head aims to prevent, repeated behaviours amounting to intimidation or harassment, including campaigns aimed towards healthcare providers, irrespective of where they are committed.  The purpose here is to mitigate against the impact, that could arise from such conduct, on a service provider&rsquo;s choice to offer termination of pregnancy services.  It is also to ensure that the potential provision of termination of pregnancy services is maximised to the greatest extent, and to avoid disproportionate impacts on access to and provision of services geographically.  <\/p> <p>  However, in advancing these proposals, it is recognised that protecting the rights of service users and service providers must be balanced against protecting the rights of those engaged in legitimate protest.  In balancing the various rights involved, the general scheme restricts specified conduct, but also aims to limit the scope of such restrictions to that which is strictly necessary.<\/p><p>To this end, head 5 sets out specific exemptions that may apply in the context of prohibited conduct within safe access zones and the corresponding offences.  In doing so, this head also further acknowledges and promotes, on a proportionate basis, the balancing of various human and constitutional rights.  Critically, this head further makes clear that the Bill will not impede, impact on, prohibit or criminalise anything done by healthcare and other staff of the healthcare provider in the normal functions of the healthcare service.<\/p><p> The proposed legislation preserves the right to protest against abortion and speak out in favour or against it, apart from in the limited areas to be covered by safe access zones.  Additionally, to ensure an appropriate balance between countervailing rights, the Department has engaged with the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Data Protection Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties seeking any observations they may have on the proposals.<\/p><p> In regard to enforcement, it is essential An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be provided with relevant powers to manage and respond appropriately to offences under this general scheme, and these are mainly set out in head 7.  Overall, in keeping with the principle of proportionality, the general scheme provides for a graduated approach to enforcement to ensure that any restriction on rights is minimised.<\/p><p> Finally, head 8 sets out the penalties arising from offences under the scheme, which have been provided for on an escalating basis, where harsher penalties may apply at the discretion of the court for repeat offences.<\/p><p> The development of a dedicated, stand-alone safe access zones legislation will comprehensively address, and mitigate insofar as possible, the potential for a person's access to a termination of pregnancy to be impacted or influenced at the point of access.  It will provide additional assurance to healthcare providers that they will be afforded protections should their services become the target of specified conduct that could interfere with their service provision and staff.  In putting these protections in place, the legislation will deliver on a programme for Government commitment.  The Minister is anxious to see the Bill drafted as quickly as possible in order that it can be introduced to the Oireachtas, and the Department will continue to work closely with the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in drafting the final Bill, recognising all the complexities involved.<\/p><p> I thank committee members for their patience and attention.

I welcome our guests and thank them for their contribution to the legislation.  I am in two minds as to its effectiveness.  We have to go back to the original provisions of the legislation, the constitutional provisions and the legislation as published.  It was intended to address the issue whereby a service was available to women who wished to seek that service, at their discretion, under the assumption they could do so without appearing to be the target of anybody who feels they may be breaking the law.<\/p> <p>  I am not a supporter of abortion for abortion's sake and I do not think most people are, but what is at issue is whether women can access whatever services may require, or men either, for that matter, in all the public hospitals that are listed as providing the service, without being identified.  I foresee a problem in that the legislation, in trying to help, may find itself to be counterproductive.  By virtue of the exclusion zones, the identification of all such hospitals, centres, GPs and so on is going to be obvious to the protestor, and that is going to cause unnecessary pressure.  I do not know how effective the exclusion zones will be, how they will be managed and whether they will be respected.  In the US, they have not been successful; there have been constant pressures and attacks by groups of different mindsets.  As a result, women have been frightened by what has been put before them in the sense of protests, and that is understandable.  I accept what this legislation is trying to do, but I am not sure it will do what was intended.<\/p> <p>  I am not certain it is a good idea to identify areas where given services, such as terminations, are available because that merely does a favour for those who want to protest, and protesting may not be the only thing they want to do.  It could have serious consequences for the people the legislation is trying to protect.  My views on the subject are well known.  I am not certain, again judging by the experience in the US, which I have studied, that it is a good idea to identify the locations.  It is difficult to protect the people who need to use such services for whatever reason.  I am concerned we will find it is not possible to protect people, in which case the legislation will be seen to be weak and the protestors will achieve victory, for how long I do not know.  Whatever about the ready identification of hospitals and health centres where services under the legislation are available, I do not know how the enforcement of the 100 m ban can be applied, especially throughout the country and at different times.  Instead, I would emphasise the need to ensure that services, as envisaged under the legislation and supported by the referendum, are readily available to those who have a need to avail of them as and when required.<\/p> <p>  Various reasons have been put forward as to why there should be changes.  Some of the changes proposed might be for the better and others might not.  I was a member of the original committee that examined the issue and I voted for the changes, simply to improve and protect the services available to those who might need to avail of them and to remove any stigma or identification of their situation in order that they could confidentially avail of the services as and when they required.<\/p> <p>  I will vote for the legislation.  I am merely pointing out what I see as potential difficulties and I would like a response to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#B00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":810,"content":"<p>Many of the considerations the Deputy raised are very live in our work on the legislation.

I wanted to make that point.<\/p> <p>  I move to the HSE submission.  I have a number of points to make because the context is important here and some people will ask why we need this legislation.  The HSE submission makes the reasons very clear because it refers to weekly, and sometimes monthly, anti-abortion protests outside maternity hospitals, mainly in Dublin, and also outside GP surgeries.  It refers to the display of religious imagery and messages, graphic images of foetuses and, in some instances, physical and verbal aggression.  No woman or person should be subject to any type of intimidation or physical or verbal aggression from anybody when entering a healthcare premises.  The fact that this is happening on a weekly or monthly basis is unacceptable.  The HSE submission also states some GPs are willing to provide the service but are concerned about potentially attracting protests.  Again, that is a reason we need this legislation.  It also refers to the potential for significant psychological impact on women.  I think we can all agree that if women are subject to harassment and intimidation, it will have a psychological impact on them.  The submission sets out very clearly why we need this legislation, as do the submissions from other organisations.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions on heads 4 and 6.  Head 4 refers to \"prohibited conduct\".  It seems to be the lesser of the charges.  Persons convicted - it is a summary conviction - of an offence under what would be prohibited conduct in head 4 are liable to a class E fine for a first offence, a class D fine for a second offence and a class C fine for a third offence.  What is \"prohibited conduct\" in the context of this head?  Will the witnesses summarise that for the committee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#C01500","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":824,"content":"<p>As for the Garda involvement and input, I am not sure what submissions have come as a result of your call-out but I assure the committee we have worked very closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, counterparts in the Department of Justice and the Director of Public Prosecutions in developing the legislation.

I will start by stating I fully support this legislation and certainly most members of the committee will do all they can to ensure its speedy passage when published.  There is no doubt that the current frequency of protests outside healthcare facilities is extremely disturbing and upsetting for people availing of services.  It is worth repeating that everyone in this country has a right to access all legal health services free from intimidation and harassment and that has to be the starting point.  The other aspect of this of course is that these protests have a very chilling effect on the provision of services, both in terms of GP and hospital services.  We have to remind ourselves that we still are at a very early stage in terms of the provision of abortion services on a countrywide basis in that currently, only 413 GPs have a contract for the provision of terminations.  We are still at a point where only 11 of the 19 maternity hospitals provide termination services.  There is a very long way to go and there is no doubt, particularly in rural areas, that the threat of protest does not encourage people - GPs or hospitals - to provide services.  That is why this legislation is absolutely necessary and we need to have it in place very quickly.<\/p> <p>  I will raise a number of issues with Mr. O'Connor about the heads of the legislation.  First is an issue that came up in feedback the organisation Together for Safety came across, namely, the need to ensure that industrial action is protected at hospitals and at GP surgeries.  To what extent has this been provided for and how does the Department intend to ensure this legislation does not cut across the right to industrial action, which is obviously a very basic right? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#D02000","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  She has summarised the reason for the legislation superbly well and we also are highly conscious, with the service being in its infancy, of the chilling effect.  The actual protests cause harm and distress but we think fear of protests is constraining the roll-out.<\/p><p>We are conscious of the incompleteness of the roll-out of services but encouraged by the trajectories.  Eleven of the 19 maternity hospitals are currently providing this service and we think there will be two or three more within a year or so.  Likewise, the 413 GPs mentioned are only one eighth of the total number of GPs in the country.  Again, the review by Marie O'Shea will look at geographical dispersion but, without breaching confidentiality, just to reassure us and see what we can do to support the services.<\/p><p> On industrial action, the Department took a view that protests by staff and the trade union or other related industrial action is not within the scope of prohibited conduct under the proposed legislation.  We feel that it is unlikely that such activities would fall within the scope of head 4(2) as such activity is not intended or could not reasonably have the effect of influencing a person's decision to access termination of pregnancy, to interfere with a person's access or the provision of a termination of pregnancy service.

I thank the Department's staff for working so hard on this legislation, progressing it and engaging with the Seanad Bill that came through.  It is worthwhile saying at this stage that this is incredibly complex legislation and the Department must strike the right balance.  As much as I want this legislation to be enacted urgently, and we must seek to have this done by Christmas, I am very aware that we must be quite delicate with the legislation and make sure that we do this work correctly.<\/p> <p>  I want to discuss the reality of enforcement and, funnily enough, I want to talk about the word \"curtilage\".  Any architect in the State will know the word well as it is very well set out in our conservation legislation.  I have a concern around how we might treat the grounds and decide where 100 m begins, and how the service provider engages on the issue.  Many of our older health service buildings are on land that looks almost institutional so they have gates and a carpark.  So if we set this at the entrance then 100 m will still allow people to be directly outside a hospital, for example.  That is the nature of our estates and healthcare buildings in this country.  It might be worth looking at the definition of curtilage in other legislation but certainly it is meaningful in terms of planning and other issues.<\/p><p>I would like to talk a little bit about that.<\/p><p> I would also like the witnesses to talk about the responsibility of the healthcare provider in deciding where the 100 m is, even with the curtilage or the front door.  Are healthcare providers or GPs expected to draw a line on the ground, as when we were queueing for a shot during Covid, or will the Garda take on that role?  Within that, I also have a concern around some of the requirements if service providers continue to see people outside.  I am wary of anything that relies on a service provider to report because, ultimately, the service provider staff might have their own opinions about these issues.  A lot of responsibility would be put on the service provider.  Perhaps we could start with all of these issues around the implementation part of this.<\/p><p> I am glad that the HSE is talking with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At the beginning, groups like Together for Safety have been engaged in this conversation.  There has been a statement from the Garda that we do not need this legislation and I am interested to see whether maybe it cannot be enforced, which is an issue.  I wonder where that change happened.  I am asking all of the questions at once and hopefully the witnesses can answer them.<\/p><p> I also want to know about inclusive language within the text.  I would like to see a recognition of pregnant people rather than just women.  This affects families and people of every group.<\/p><p> The Department has outlined this a little bit but I would like to know about the definition of \"intimidation, harassment and aggression\".  There is a gender issue here.  I believe it came up in conversations with the Garda regarding what people define for themselves as intimidation.  Often it is not engagement in any way.  One does not have to reach out to somebody or offer them a leaflet to intimidate them.  One can intimidate another person just by being a presence.  I would like quite a broad interpretation of that.  Under head 6, is there engagement about persistent harassment on social media for service providers, many of whom are on social media?  I am sorry that I have thrown some tough questions at the officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#E02000","speaker":"1559","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.

Thank you for letting me in, Chairman.  I want to pick up on the last point first.  In January, it will be four years since the legislation to allow women to procure abortion in Ireland was enacted.  Straight away, when it was passed in 2019, there were pickets and protests outside GP surgeries and doctors' clinics.<\/p><p>The legislation was passed in the spirit of many promises that were given, some of which are still being enacted such as the provision of free contraception and looking at free sex education in schools so that as a whole package, the need for intervention in crisis pregnancy will be undermined but crisis pregnancy will also be able to be dealt with.<\/p><p> Four years is a long time to have something that was shadowed in the legislation, that is, the provision of safe access zones, not even being close to being passed yet.  This has been said by many Deputies and Senators but the question of urgency cannot be overemphasised.  This will not be passed before January 2023.  I am quite sure of that from hearing what the witnesses have said, which means that four years on, we do not have safe access zones.  That is very worrying.  To repeat what has been said, this has a chill effect on the provision of services.  We have seen this particularly in parts of the west and north-west of Ireland.  We hear accounts of GPs pulling out of delivering the service or being on the list of those willing to deliver because of threats of intimidation and fear.  There was an account of a GP in the west of Ireland whose home was actually threatened.  This GP lived near work and was providing the services.  Threats were made all the time to this person and their family when going to and coming from school and carrying out normal day-to-day things like shopping.  It is really important that a strong signal is sent out that there is an urgency about the legislation.  There is a proposal of some kind of public awareness campaign about the legislation.  Perhaps Mr. O'Connor could talk a little bit about that.  I would emphasise that issue of urgency and trying to get a time from the Department as to when we will see this through.<\/p><p> There is the question of the right of confidentiality for women who will be seen by protestors going in and out.  Many of them would be in abusive relationships, for example, so they need to keep their own affairs private.  This is all the time under threat when we do not have these safe access zones.  The question of this providing a chill effect to the provision of services is not just something that happens in Ireland.  The World Health Organization recognises this and has done research on it.  I want to really emphasise that.<\/p><p> One thing I want to ask, which others have also asked about, is the question of industrial relations activity.  Mr. O'Connor can go back over the argument again that it is not perceived to be under that particular heading where industrial relations activity is prohibited.  Sometimes, however, industrial relations activity is unofficial and would, therefore, be perceived by an employer as being illegal.  We need to be careful about this.  It would still be industrial relations activity albeit unofficial and seen as illegal, which may then fall foul of this legislation.   Therefore, we should go back to having the specific clause that excludes any kind of strike or protest activity by cleaners, doctors, nurses or health workers of any sort inside an abortion care setting.  We will be proposing that and we will try to amend the legislation accordingly.  I would love to see it coming from the Department, however.<\/p><p> I am kind of baffled as to why the Department did not go along with the Bill that was going through the Seanad.  We would have had this much earlier had we co-operated with the Bill going through the Seanad and looked at maybe amending, changing or adding to it rather than taking this length of time.<\/p><p> I am concerned, as are others, about the definition of \"curtilage\" and whether a car park or playground nearby or whatever is included in the definition.  I am also concerned about how protests will be controlled.  It is true that protests of this nature do not have to be in your face or all over people shouting and roaring at them.  It can be carrying an abusive or disgraceful symbol or whatever, as frequently happened outside the gates of the D&aacute;il during the course of the debate around the eighth amendment.  We need to get much more clarity on what we are talking about here.  I have one or two more questions but I will come back to Dr. O'Connor on those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#G03000","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":913,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy very much.  I can assure the committee of the urgency with which the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnolly, regards this.  He has prioritised it in the autumn schedule.  The Deputy is right; it was something initially intended and envisaged to be encompassed within the 2018 legislation.  It ran into complexity and there was an imperative to progress that Bill with a view to establishing the services.  The chill effect is something about which we are deeply conscious.  It is a delicate time in the roll-out of new services, in a sense, and the Deputy referred to issues about the geographical distribution of services.  The particular chill effect that can occur in maybe a rural setting is something about which we are very conscious.  It is part of the intention of the Bill to create a safe environment in which services can be delivered.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is so right about people's privacy and dignity.  It can be a very difficult and vulnerable time in people's lives when they need to access medical services.  It is so vitally important for their dignity that their privacy and safety is protected in accessing those services.<\/p> <p>  We are so immersed in the drafting that we have not thought yet about a public awareness campaign but it is actually a very important thing that we will do.  We will engage now with colleagues who can help us in that regard.  We have some excellent colleagues in the women's health division in our press and communications section so we will take that on board.  I thank the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  On confidentiality, one of the excellent policy decisions made by the D&aacute;il in 2018 was the incorporation of these services as part of an integrated set of primary care, GP and hospital services.  We do not have the American-style abortion clinic, as such, as a real focal point.  The purpose of any visit by any private individual to a health facility cannot be known.  There is confidentiality.  As the Deputy said, however, absolutely, we do not want people accessing those legally provided health services feeling any discomfort or distress arising from protests in the vicinity of the services.<\/p> <p>  Our policy intent is clear on industrial relations activity.  We absolutely do not seek to undermine industrial relations activity.  I take the Deputy's point that it is not always official and can be spontaneous and unofficial.  We will absolutely work to ensure that all types of industrial relations activity by any workers are not encompassed or undermined in any part of the country.  We are looking at whether that might be a specific clause or exemption, which might be necessary, or else the prohibited behaviours within the zone will be refined to a place where they can clearly not be presumed to encompass industrial activity.  I hear that the Deputy's advice is to get specific on an exemption in relation to it, however.<\/p> <p>  We can absolutely see such similarity with the Private Members' Bill in many ways.  We are deeply grateful to Senator Gavan and all the Senators and Deputies who contributed to that.  Members will see it is evident that our current scheme builds on their work in the area in many respects.  However, it is acknowledged that legislating the area is complex and challenging from the perspective of balancing competing constitutional rights.  All the work we are doing now is work that is always necessary with any legislative vehicle.  That Private Members' Bill helped us greatly and we have built on it in the work we are doing now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Muiris O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":914,"content":"<p>To conclude, I am glad that has been acknowledged but I am concerned about the repeated expression of the words \"complex\" and \"difficult\" in the discussion of and approach to this legislation.  We are not reinventing the wheel.  Many countries have safe access zones.<\/p><p>The World Health Organization, WHO, has done research on this subject.  It is not like we are taking something brand new and we must be terribly careful about it because it is so complex.  It is not that complex.  Once we get the co-operation of all the players involved, especially An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it should not be a complex matter.  We already have, for example, laws like the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, where garda&iacute; can go up to people and tell them to stop what they are doing, not to stand somewhere and to move on.  If the people concerned do not do so, they can then be arrested under the auspices of that Act.  It cannot be so complex that it has taken us so long to do this.  I will finish with that comment, and by repeating, as others have done, that there is an urgency for this legislation to come through.  It sends out such a bad signal and it is having a chilling effect on what is already a fragile service, especially in parts of rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#H00300","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":916,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Muiris O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":917,"content":"<p>I welcome all the witnesses.

I was happy to hear the Department will take this on board.

It is important, therefore, that all stakeholders know what to expect if this legislation is to work effectively.  I am also aware that the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, has suggested a nationwide awareness programme to inform stakeholders.  I was happy to hear the Department is to take this suggestion on board.<\/p> <p>  As I said, many of the other questions I was going to ask have been posed already.

I agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith when she says that we should not overly complicate this and that there is existing legislation on public order offences that are quite similar.  However, at the same time, we should accept that it is complex.  There was a lot of discussion between the Department of Justice and the Attorney General.  How I would see it is that any legislation is obviously subject to legal challenge.  I think we can safely bet that there are organisations which will challenge this legislation in the courts.   For that purpose, I think it is really important that all the i's are dotted and all the t's are crossed, and that it is robust.  That is really important.  We do not want a situation where it is challenged in court and a judge decides that it is unconstitutional.  The more that we can be explicit and clear in terms of what the Bill does, and should do, the better.  Ensuring the balance of rights in it and that it is primarily motivated towards helping people and women is the right approach.  I accept that.<\/p> <p>  On the different submissions we have received, three issues have come up in over half of the submissions, which I think this committee should support.  The first one that has been raised is to recommend the clause to exclude from the ambit of the Bill anything done in the course of industrial action, within the meaning of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  While I acknowledge that Mr. O'Connor has dealt with that, it is something we should do.  The second is to place an obligation on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to maintain a record of warnings, and the language used in the Bill should be \"shall\" and not \"may\".  That is important from an enforcement perspective.  When we see the submission from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we will see what it says but I think that is really important.  I have some experience of this in local areas where there has been antisocial behaviour in communities.  It can be quite difficult for local authorities to prosecute in such cases.  The only way they have been able to do it is through proper recordkeeping, whereby a process is put in place where complaints are made and then registered.  Where there are records of persistent complaints, the judge can look at the overall picture, as opposed to one individual case.  That is important, and we should look at the same sort of process there.  That is a second recommendation that is consistent across many of the submissions we have received.  The third concerns inclusive language, which I think we would all agree on.  Mr. O'Connor has outlined practical issues in relation to it but I think we need to come back to it.  If those three areas could be accommodated within the Bill, it would go a long way towards helping us in our work.<\/p> <p>  I want to come back to the issue of enforcement and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If I were to make a recommendation, and I will, in terms of how we proceed in our work, I think we need to hear directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I think we should hold a hearing and invite representatives of the Garda in.  We will have a private session later, in which we will discuss our next steps.  For me, that seems to be the most logical approach because at the end of the day, there is broad consensus, as far as I can see, from all of the submissions in relation to the purpose of the Bill and its intent.  I outlined some of the recommendations that have been made to strengthen it.  The one area where we need to get it right is in enforcement, for all the reasons I outlined earlier as well.  I think it is important that we hear directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and not simply receive a submission.  <\/p> <p>  Looking at head 7, and the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, just so that people are clear on exactly what is being proposed, it states \"A person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a direction under subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence.\"  It goes on to state \"A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may arrest without warrant a person whom the member has reasonable cause for believing is committing or has committed an offence under the Act.\"  It also states that if it is felt that a person who is approached by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in contravention of the Act, if it becomes an Act, that person will be obliged to state his or her name and address.  If the person does not, that is an offence.  It seems to me to be quite clear what the powers are.  It then depends on whether An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na believes it can actually enforce the powers, which, from the Department's communications, seems to be the case.  However, I believe it is important for us to talk it through.<\/p> <p>  There are issues in relation to the confiscation of electronic devices and other equipment or material.  There are many explicit areas here where it makes clear what an offence is, which I am pleased about.  However, the more explicit we can be, and the less subjective, the better.  I have a concern about us trying to broaden out some of the terms, such as \"harassment\".  I get why people would advocate for it but my concern is that if we are too broad, it would be problematic if there was a legal challenge.  I am deeply conscious of that.  We know that there are people who do not want this Bill to progress.  They have their right to do that and are entitled to their own opinions; I am not taking that away from them.  However, as someone who wants the Bill to pass, I want it to be legally sound.<\/p> <p>  That was not really a question as such, it was more to make the point that this has been a useful session.  I believe we can help and support the Department in progressing this legislation as quickly as possible.  However, I do not think we can do our work and conclude pre-legislative scrutiny until we hear directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is my sense of it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022101900002#K00400","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":949,"content":"<p>That will be a decision that is made after the meeting.

It is recognised that protecting the rights of service users must be balanced against protecting the rights of those engaged in legitimate protest.  Article 46(1) of the Constitution protects legitimate protest, as does Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights on freedom of expression, and Article 11 on freedom of assembly and association.

I thank the Chairperson and members of the committee for the invitation to present here today.  I am the director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, which is the professional association for post-primary school leaders in Ireland and provides a united voice for principals and deputy principals on issues of common concern across all three post-primary sectors.<\/p> <p>  Circular 0053\/2019 put in place new procedures for granting exemptions from the study of Irish, thereby placing the responsibility for granting exemptions on principals.  Circular 0055\/2022 reinforced the 2019 decision that principals make the decision and put in place an appeals mechanism for parents.  I will speak from a practical perspective to identify how these changes have impacted on current practices and on principals, as well as to outline some of the challenges facing schools as they endeavour to navigate the Irish exemptions procedures.  I must stress at the outset that each school leader puts the best interests of the student at the centre of every decision that is made.<\/p> <p>  Traditionally, many students arrived at post-primary school with an Irish exemption certificate, the application process for which was completed in primary school.  In the small number of cases where that did not happen in primary school, the post-primary school processed the paperwork to apply for the exemption from the study of Irish.  This was generally done by the special education needs co-ordinator or guidance counsellor in the school and overseen by the principal, who signed off on the application on the basis of the information provided.  The application would then have been forwarded to Department of Education for a decision to be made.<\/p> <p>  In recent times, since 2019, students have been arriving at post-primary school without the completed paperwork regarding their Irish exemption and may, or may not, have participated in the study of Irish in their primary school.  What tends to happen now in such cases is that the request for an exemption from the study of Irish is made to the post-primary school principal when the student arrives in first year or when he or she approaches the preparations for the State exams.  This is, of course, in line with the requirements of the circular, but it has resulted in a significant increase in applications to principals by parents seeking an exemption from the study of Irish for their child.<\/p> <p>  Before 2019, principals did not directly undertake the work regarding exemptions from the study of Irish but were kept informed by the staff in their school, and they had oversight of the process and the information.  The current procedures have created a huge administrative workload for principals that cannot be delegated to other staff under the terms of the circular.  This requires a significant investment of time by principals in order to process applications and any subsequent appeals that are made.<\/p> <p>  Since 2019, the significant increase in the number of applications by parents for exemptions from the study of Irish has had a significant negative impact on the administrative workload of principals.  While the criteria outlined in the circular for an exemption are clear and require evidence, many principals are reporting that some parents are very insistent, even if the evidence is insufficient to receive an exemption from the study of Irish for their child.  This discussion, explanation and negotiation with the parent requires considerable time and energy on the part of principals when, it could be argued, this time and energy could be better spent elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  Irish is a core subject, which is why it requires an official exemption process.  No similar process is required for modern foreign languages, MFLs, as they are not compulsory subjects.  Many students choose MFL subjects as they are a matriculation requirement for some third level courses.  Indeed, an MFL is a requirement, along with Irish, for the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP.  School leaders inform us that a number of students who are exempt from the study of Irish continue with the study of MFLs for varying reasons.<\/p> <p>  The status of Irish in our current system requires careful consideration to ensure the protection of the intended impact of this core subject.  When a student is exempted from the study of Irish, very often they will avail of learning support during the time the other students are studying Irish.  However, in an increasing number of cases, students and their parent may look to substitute another subject in place of Irish in line with the terms of the circular.  This causes a particular difficulty for schools as they do not receive the allocation of additional teachers to provide this option for students.  Therefore, schools are left trying to accommodate students from within existing allocation resources.  In addition, when schools schedule Irish classes concurrently on the timetable to group students who are exempt from the study of Irish together, in order to maximise efficiencies in teacher allocation, this can cause significant difficulties when trying to fit everything into the timetable.  It can often be disruptive to the scheduling of other subjects on the timetable.<\/p> <p>  This is just a flavour of the issues arising as schools endeavour to implement the procedures around Irish exemptions.  I thank committee members for listening.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to remain in the meeting as we are opening our national conference at 2 p.m. today in Galway at which my presence is required.<\/p><p>The deputy director, Paul Byrne, is very experienced and will be available and happy to answer any questions the committee may have.

The 2022 circular has added new clauses to that.  The Chair has asked how long such an application process will take.  When a parent makes a request for an Irish-language exemption, it must be put in writing.  The principal must then have a meeting with the parents, and must then meet with each of the teachers in the school, if the request is on the basis that the child has additional or persistent learning difficulties.  The principal must satisfy himself or herself that, first, all possible interventions to improve the child&rsquo;s learning have been put in place and have not been sufficient to bring the child&rsquo;s level of understanding, comprehension or literacy up to a point where they are able to continue with the study of Irish.<\/p> <p>  Irish-language exemptions are only granted in line with what is in the circular.  The difficulty is that it is easy to grant an exemption, but it is when it is not granted to parents that an issue arises.  I have been in that position in the past.  The big change happened in 2019 because before that, one was expected to get a psychological or educational report which was sent into the Department, along with other documentation, and the decision was then made there.  Now, the onus is on the principal to ensure that every effort has been made to keep the child, firstly, studying Irish and to give the child whatever support is needed.  If, then, it is in the best interests of the child - and that is where the decisions are made - then the principal communicates to the parents that the d&iacute;ol&uacute;ine is to be granted.  <\/p> <p>  If on the other hand, however, it is not granted, the principal has to inform the parents of that, and also inform them of the appeals process, which is now very firmly in place in the 2022 circular.  I hope that has answered the question or that I have answered the right question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022101900002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

I thank committee members for the invitation to join them today.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to put the necessary legal framework in place to complete the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, and choirs from RT&Eacute; to the National Concert Hall, NCH.  It will cement the role of the NSO within the NCH, formalising and enhancing the relationship that has been in place since the establishment of the concert hall in 1981.<\/p><p>Although largely technical in nature, the Bill marks an important step in the journey the orchestra, the concert hall, RT&Eacute;, my colleagues and I have been on for the past number of years.  It is divided into four parts with Part 1 dealing with general provisions, such as the Short Title and definitions of terms in the Bill.  Part 2 provides for the transfer of functions, staff, property and liabilities relating to the orchestra and choirs from RT&Eacute; to the National Concert Hall.  These provisions date from the transfer day, 24 January 2022.  It does so by amending the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015.  Part 3 provides for the integration of the orchestra and choirs into the everyday operation of the NCH by adding a new function for the maintenance and operation of an orchestra and choir to the functions of the concert hall.  It also provides for an increase in the membership of the board from eight to nine members.  The legislation requires this additional board member to have experience of and expertise in the development of orchestras.  The final Part replaces RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s previous function to manage orchestras and choirs with the function of managing a concert orchestra only.  I look forward to going through these in more detail.<\/p><p>The legislation builds on the commitment of everyone involved to build a stronger orchestra within a dedicated national cultural institution for music.  Critically, the Bill provides a new function for the concert hall dedicated to the development and maintenance of the orchestra.  It also places the orchestra at the centre of the concert hall&rsquo;s corporate governance arrangements by providing for a new board member with orchestral expertise and experience.<\/p><p>In some ways, the Bill represents the end of one journey &ndash; the transfer of the orchestra and choirs &ndash; but it is also the first step in a much more important journey as we now turn our minds to building and enhancing the symphony orchestra and concert hall to ensure they are fit for purpose in an evolving environment and are at the heart of music in Ireland for generations to come.  The challenge of the past few years has shown us the immeasurable value of music and live performance.  It has certainly cemented my view of the value of the orchestra and concert hall both at the heart of classical music in Ireland and as a place for people to come together and enjoy a shared musical experience.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an tUachtar&aacute;n ag Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann i m&iacute; I&uacute;il:<\/p> <blockquote> \tLig d&uacute;inn ceili&uacute;radh a dh&eacute;anamh ar cheol ... na h&Eacute;ireann i ngach cruth a thagann s&eacute;, agus lig d&uacute;inn athcheangail a dh&eacute;anamh leis an gceol, agus an t&aacute;bhacht at&aacute; ag baint le taispe&aacute;ntas beo agus muid ag ceili&uacute;radh &hellip; le ch&eacute;ile. <\/blockquote> <p>Music is just one part of the wider cultural offering of our national cultural institutions.  In that context, I have tabled three amendments, the purpose of which is to raise the limit of the State&rsquo;s indemnity for loans of artworks and cultural objects from outside the State, which is required for visiting exhibitions.  These amendments are critical to ensuring our pre-eminent cultural institutions, such as the National Gallery and Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, continue to be able to receive high-value, international loans and exhibitions.  The success of the recent Freud exhibition at IMMA shows the value the public place on having works of such international importance shown here, as well as raising our profile internationally to stand with other national galleries and institutions.  Under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, the aggregate amount on liability undertakings with respect to State indemnity is limited to &euro;190 million.  This figure is no longer fit for purpose as it does not account for the significant appreciation in the monetary value of artworks and other cultural artefacts, nor the increase in opportunities for significant arts and cultural exhibitions to visit Ireland since the establishment of the Act 25 years ago.  I, therefore, propose to increase this limit to &euro;1.6 billion.<\/p><p>With the provision of State indemnity, our cultural institutions can meet the essential requirements of prominent international institutions and private collectors, thus making Ireland a more attractive candidate for high profile exhibitions.  This will increase the cultural offering available to the public.<\/p><p>I thank members for their time, and I look forward to their consideration of the Bill and these three amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022101900002#A00300","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666134000,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666134000,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":1091,"content":"<p>The transfer was given effect in January.

As things currently stand, under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, the aggregate amount on liability undertakings with respect to State indemnity shall not exceed &euro;190 million or IR&pound;150 million.  This figure is no longer fit for purpose, as I said in my opening statement, as it does not account for the significant appreciation in the monetary value of artworks and other cultural artefacts, nor for the increase in opportunities for significant arts and cultural exhibitions to visit Ireland, since the establishment of the Act 25 years ago.<\/p><p>The indemnity ceiling was previously temporarily amended by means of statutory instrument.  SI 86\/2016 raised the limit to &euro;1.5 billion for five years, primarily to accommodate the five-year loan of the Freud collection to IMMA and the overlap of significant exhibitions at the National Gallery of Ireland.  However, that temporary increase expired on 31 October 2021 and the limit has since reverted to the original limit of &euro;190 million set out in 1997.  This constrained the planning of international exhibitions as the total value of indemnities on works from outside the State on loan to our institutions cannot exceed &euro;190 million.<\/p><p>Currently, the alternative for our cultural institutions is to arrange for commercial insurance, a significant additional overhead.  Such insurance can cost hundreds of thousands of euro per exhibition.  The provision of a general permanent increase in the statutory indemnity limit under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 is not merely a technical amendment but in accord with policy on risk management relating to the public finances.  The approval of the Government was required and was granted at its meeting on 28 June 2022.  I am, therefore, seeking to revise the ceiling to a limit of &euro;1.6 billion.  The increased figure has been calculated based on the increased values of artworks and artefacts, and the anticipated number of incoming international high value loans planned in the State over the next five years.<\/p><p>The increased limit would apply to works from outside the State on loan to the national cultural institutions, the Hugh Lane Gallery, the Hunt Museum and the Royal Irish Academy.

By way of introduction, I am a member of the executive council of the CTTC and regional manager of Citylink.<\/p><p>I am joined by my CTTC executive council colleague, Mr. Brendan Crowley of Wexford Bus, and Mr. Brian Lynch of Suirway in County Waterford.<\/p><p> The Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland is the country&rsquo;s largest representative body for commercial bus operators.  We are a proactive organisation focused on delivering the most efficient and sustainable transport connectivity in Ireland.  As a sector we support more than 11,000 jobs across every constituency and region in Ireland and our activities have sustained businesses that would otherwise have very limited employment opportunities.  However, in the face of rising costs owing to inflation, severe driver shortages and persistent issues with licensing and the recruitment of new, younger drivers, our sector is facing a number of unprecedented challenges.  Key to rectifying these issues is meaningful engagement between all transport stakeholders.  For this reason, we are grateful to the committee for the invitation to appear before it today.<\/p><p> Since March of this year, when inflation began to steadily rise before peaking at 9.1% in July, many transport providers have recorded increases in the cost of fuel, repairs, parts and general maintenance works.  An internal industry survey carried out earlier in the year found that nearly two thirds of commercial bus operators had reported increases in fuel costs of more than 50% in the previous months.  Fuel is a mission-critical expense for the industry and one for which we cannot seek a reduction in cost without direct intervention or the influence of external market factors.  This is particularly pertinent in the case of school transport where service provision must remain consistent even in the face of volatile and unpredictable fuel costs.<\/p><p> Inflationary pressures have not been confined to fuel.  Many CTTC members are paying higher insurance premiums while encountering rising costs for vehicle parts and paying increased interest on vehicle loans.  While no sector is immune to these challenges, the provision of transport is a low-margin activity at the best of times, so increased operational and fuel costs have been uniquely challenging.  Equally, we acknowledge the Government&rsquo;s decision in budget 2023 to extend the existing excise reductions on petrol and diesel until the end of February and to allocate crucial funding to strategic public transport projects.  It is vital, however, should fuel prices remain at their current levels or increase even further owing to inflation, that consideration be given to the need to include fuel variation clauses in all State contracts.  This is an issue for which our members have strongly advocated and we are keen to discuss further with committee members.<\/p><p> The current process for the issuing of licences to operate routes is best described as arduous owing to the considerable length of time between submission of the initial application and the eventual granting of the licence by the National Transport Authority, NTA.  This is a long drawn-out process that is sometimes initiated at short notice to meet evolving consumer demand.  It requires approval to be sought to use bus stops along a route, which may cover a number of local authority areas, meaning that approval must be sought from each.  This creates significant additional administrative work for commercial bus operators applying to service these routes.  It is with regret that I note that the current process fails to adequately serve the needs of the public.  By comparison, the same process in the UK is significantly less cumbersome and leads to enhanced service provision as and when required, often within a very short timeframe.<\/p><p> It is now the case that when minor adjustments are needed to cater for changing customer demand or to ensure efficient delivery of service, the resulting administrative delays in the implementation of such improvements act as an impediment to the modal shift away from private cars.  It is our understanding that the NTA has communicated that all services licensed by it must be fully operational by 7 November or risk being cancelled.  This requires commercial bus operators to begin the application process again.  We firmly believe that the existing process must be urgently reviewed and unnecessary and burdensome bureaucracy removed.<\/p><p> There has been much discussion of the war for talent in recent times.  An ongoing skills shortage combined with competition from other transport providers such as the logistics industry has resulted in a crisis in recruitment and retention of drivers, particularly younger drivers.  At present, commercial bus operators aim to employ only fully qualified drivers who meet the highest possible standards of competency and have obtained their full public service vehicle driving licence.  However, the industry faces considerable barriers to continued growth and sustained service provision in respect of the older age profile of our drivers.  This owes more to the excessive costs of licence qualification, which is now in the region of &euro;2,500.  This excessive financial burden is regrettably acting as a deterrent to those seeking employment in the commercial bus sector.<\/p><p> CTTC members are determined to safeguard continuity of service in the years ahead, while emphasising the need to ensure that all drivers strictly abide by the training requirements expected of them.  In this context, we are keen to work with transport stakeholders to explore the feasibility of introducing an innovative driver training programme in which new recruits could receive fully funded driver training in exchange for completing a set number of years&rsquo; service with a commercial bus company.  This would allow young drivers to acquire a public service vehicle, PSV, licence while learning from experienced colleagues and without incurring the significant financial cost normally associated with obtaining a licence.<\/p><p> The crisis in driver recruitment poses a threat to the viability of some services.  We are keen to mitigate this.  Earlier this year, despite the easing of Covid-19 public health restrictions and the resumption of international travel, a number of our members were still faced with the prospect of reducing their services owing to a lack of available drivers.  As a sector which facilitates more than 75 million passenger journeys annually, boosting regional economies and providing school transport to students across every constituency in the country, this issue must be addressed as a priority.  As an accompaniment to the measure I outlined, the CTTC believes that simplifying and streamlining the process for issuing work permits to non-EU drivers could open a pathway to employment for those who hold a category D equivalent licence, which pertains to heavy goods vehicle, HGV, and bus and coach drivers.  While there was considerable support for Government&rsquo;s decision to allow those holding a Ukrainian driving licence to exchange this for an Irish correspondent earlier this year, this was only the case for category B licenceholders, which covers passenger cars only.  The deployment of additional staff to the relevant divisions and the opening of a specific pathway for non-EU drivers who hold category D equivalent licences could prove a useful tool in easing driver shortages, while providing valuable employment opportunities for those who live and are seeking to work in Ireland.  Given the strategic service our members provide, it is imperative that there is a loosening of the applicable rules on eligibility in order to plug the acute skills need in our sector so that we can continue, with confidence, to ensure essential connectivity to passengers throughout the country.<\/p><p> I stress that as an industry, we are committed to adopting sustainable practices.  CTTC members possess some of the most environmentally compatible fleets currently available on the market.  We remain determined to build on this progress.  Now is the opportune time for the Government to begin working in a meaningful collaboration with the private bus and coach sector to ensure the target of 50% carbon emission reductions in transport by 2030 is achieved.  Commuters will flock to public transport if they feel the passenger experience surpasses that of using a private vehicle.  Fair fares act as a huge incentive in this regard.  Introducing park-and-ride facilities, enhancing our network of quality bus corridors and improving the overall efficiency of existing vehicles will help to lessen average journey times and ease traffic pressures, while significantly reducing carbon output.

It is quite a detailed application, as it should be.  However, the timeframes in terms of receiving a decision back from the transport authority can be quite considerable.  There is no guarantee of an offer or if an offer is made, it may not necessarily be for what was applied for.  As people who are commercial operators and being close to consumer demand, we seek particular insights in terms of travel demand.  We seek to serve those needs.  In many instances, a grant or an offer may not be received at all.  In fact, a rejection is often received.  It is on public record that over the years, the transport authority rejects as many applications as it grants.<\/p> <p>  In the event that an offer is received, from that point onwards, a very cumbersome and bureaucratic administrative process needs to be gone through.  As I mentioned in our presentation, bus stop approvals have to be sought and received from all local authority or private landowners the service will be servicing.  For example, if it is serving a university, approval must be received from the university but if is passing through the bounds of a number of different local authorities, approval needs to be received from all of these.  In addition, there is the requirement to pass on vehicle details, commercial vehicle roadworthiness tests, PSV licences and copies of insurance.  These are all matters which are within the public domain through the Road Safety Authority, RSA, in any case.  This would appear to be a doubling up.<\/p> <p>   If the service is actually launched, for various different reasons, be it travel demand or increased traffic congestion, then service times may need to be amended over time in order that a more reliable and consistent service is provided to the customers.  A timetable may need to be changed by as little as five minutes to provide a more reliable running time. An example scenario might be a later arrival because of increased congestion entering into an urban area.  In this case, the operator is required to go through the whole process again.  An application has to be made for an amendment.  It has to be decided upon and if it is offered, the operator has to follow through that whole process again.   New bus stop approvals have to be sought and up-to-date documents have to be provided again.<\/p> <p>  In comparison, in the UK if one wishes to run a commercial service, it is a case of registering it with the local authorities.  Once registered, there is a timeframe given to provide the service but approval to do so will be received.  Then the operator must simply put on the service within that four-week period.  If there are to be changes, the operator simply needs to notify the local authority and let the travelling public know within a two-week period in advance of the changes that are being made.  All of the other administration is done away with. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022101900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":1167,"content":"<p>It is much more streamlined compared to our own really cumbersome system that Mr. Conway has described.

There is no certainty in the system that will say the test will come in three weeks, four weeks or whatever.  Even when people complete the driving test, they then have to wait until a licence and driver certificate of professional competence, CPC, card are issued.  That could be many weeks more.

Deputy Carey has already covered the licensing issue.  There are good reasons for some aspects of licensing in order that it is not a free for all.  That is being reasonably well handled.  There are areas, from a rural perspective, where we would like to see a much quicker roll-out of some of the services.  I know that when the powers that be look at it, they have to do so in terms of funding as well.  Deputy Carey and I have been looking for a town service in Ennis for quite some time.  I am sure that the industry would be ready to do it if given the go-ahead and the wherewithal.  The biggest concern that I have is the lack of availability of drivers.  This is not unique to the bus companies either.<\/p><p>I hear it from haulage companies and the Irish Road Haulage Association.  While the witnesses have identified a model which, on the face of it looks like it could work, have they seen it done elsewhere?  Do other countries do it?  I am always concerned about solutions that involve binding somebody to a company for a period of time.  That is hard to enforce and there is little recourse, having trained somebody, if they decide to head off.  In terms of the health service, we have often talked about whether nurses and doctors should be required to remain here and I think the general wisdom is that is not entirely the best way to proceed.  Has Mr. Crowley seen anything elsewhere?  <\/p><p> I am conscious of Skillnet and of some of the apprenticeship organisations that do similar work to this in other sectors.  Is there anything that could be done in our institutes of technologies, ITs, which are now becoming technological universities?  Could links be created with some of the other bodies to ensure we have a system that would get people trained more quickly?  It is not necessarily always young people who become bus drivers.  It could be people coming to the end of a career in some other area.  They may not be able to do the manual labour they have done previously and therefore move to bus services.  <\/p><p> The State acted in the past when there was a shortage of people in the catering sector by establishing CERT, which started to develop skill sets in the hospitality sector.  That was really successful.  Is there a requirement to do something more?  Should the State take on a greater role in providing a training programme for drivers and upskilling or reskilling?  There seems to be plenty of availability and while it is a short-term measure to bring South African drivers here or convert the driving licences of Ukrainians, the vast bulk of Ukrainians who are here are women and children.  The Ukrainian men who are here either came because of ill health or they got out of the country before the barriers came down.  I do not know if that is necessarily the short-term solution either.  I am interested to hearing Mr. Crowley's views on having a State-run driver programme.  It worked well when there were no private operators.  When we had only CI&Eacute; and Bus &Eacute;ireann there was an apprenticeship programme in place and people worked their way through that.  Those companies are obviously not in a position to do that now because they are in a more competitive environment and bid for routes in the same way as the private companies do.  I ask Mr. Crowley to flesh that out a little more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022101900002#C01500","speaker":"1655","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":1181,"content":"<p>It would be fair to say that the semi-State companies, Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann or whoever, find themselves in the same position as us.

We have engaged with the education and training boards, ETBs.  There has always been a programme in place for HGV drivers and bus drivers, although it is not necessarily available all the time.  It is a demand-driven programme.  These programmes have been largely aimed at people who are unemployed or in long-term unemployment and are set out over 26 weeks.  The problem we had with them is that we have to question the shape of any programme that is run for circa 26 weeks and involves only 16 or 17 hours of driving.  I am not for one moment saying all of the other stuff is not important.  We have managed to reduce that to a ten-day pilot programme for existing employees in the industry with the education and training boards.  That is about upskilling people who are already in the organisation.  Most bus companies run lean operations so we do not have lots of people in our organisations who need that programme.

Senator Dooley specifically asked what other jurisdictions are doing.  Generally, we do not tend to benchmark ourselves much against the Continent where people drive on the opposite side of the road and there are various other differences.  The UK has always been a natural benchmark.  Many years ago, if I wanted to start driving a truck, I could qualify for a HGV licence as soon as I reached my 18th birthday but I could not get a bus or coach licence until I was 21.  This means we lose young people with a passion for driving to the haulage industry.  They may come back in later years and I will speak separately on that in a moment.  The UK had a scheme where younger drivers could qualify for a bus or coach licence at 18 years but the geographical territory they could cover was restricted to 50 miles.  The UK is now finding that this restriction is too constrained.  Even if we in this jurisdiction were to take that step in the first instance, the UK is already examining it because it is finding it too restrictive.<\/p> <p>  If we go to the opposite end of the scale, there are many older drivers who are still extremely fit and able and want to drive, work and contribute to society.  However, 70 years is the maximum age on school contracts.  No one aged a day over 70 can be put on what we describe as a Bus &Eacute;ireann contract because the company administers the Department of Education's school transport scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022101900002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Conway"},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":1187,"content":"<p>Perhaps the committee should look at that issue.  I know it is not the long-term solution but it would certainly help address the immediate problem if the age limit of 70 were extended to 72 or 73.  It is hard to be prescriptive about age but all it would take is somebody over 70 to have an accident through ill health or whatever and everybody would be up in arms.  The committee should certainly pursue that.  While it is not the long-term solution, it might help in the short term.<\/p> <p>  As with any walk of life, we probably have to look at the quality of the job too.  For some, it is a part-time role and they are prepared to hop in and hop out of it.  However, it also comes down to pay and this is not meant to be in any way negative towards the witnesses who are operating in the market.  If the market changed, they would change with it.  It is the same with many aspects of life, and Covid-19 has provided an insight into that.  When I talk to people who ran or attempted to run restaurants and pubs, they now accept that the model of employment in the hospitality sector just was not suitable.  It suited the consumer because people could have a relatively cheap meal, entertainment and hospitality but it hollowed out the industry because it did not build competency and people were not prepared to remain in it long term.  A factor of competition is that it can put downward pressure on wages and also put pressure on individuals.  Ultimately, one will hit a stumbling block where an industry is no longer attractive due to the changing circumstances in the economy.<\/p> <p>  In the construction sector there are sectoral agreements across certain disciplines under which workers have to reach a certain pay grade.

Perhaps not all of the blame lies with the NTA, but I cannot say for sure.  One of those schemes is a 20% cost-of-living measure that was introduced back in April when 20% was taken off the price of public transport.  That immediately applied to all State operators but commercial operators have been excluded from that scheme to date.  As a result, in more rural areas where a commercial operator is probably the only provider of a bus service in that area, the customers of that service are not benefiting from a cost-of-living measure because they are not getting the 20% fare reduction.

It is about pricing between Bus &Eacute;ireann and private operators on shared routes.<\/p> <p>  We did not compete with Bus &Eacute;ireann on routes in County Waterford.  We have an established network of town services that run from Waterford to villages such as Dunmore East and Portlaw.  Trading has been extremely difficult.  We are about to shut our company.  We will withdraw services from the end of October 2022.  It was necessary for various reasons, including that we essentially did not recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Rural operators have had a different experience as regards passenger footfall.  We are roughly at 50% of where we were in 2019.  I am aware that in Dublin and on Expressway routes footfall has come back up.  We were glad to get the commercial bus operator, CBO, scheme that assisted us to keep going up to the end of June, but we realised when that ended our business was in real trouble.  That has been coupled with increased fuel costs, as is common knowledge.  The Deputy is asking about the NTA.  I agree that we have always had a professional relationship with it.  We are a third generation family company started in 1899 by my great-uncle.  We know the business.  We have always been a good employer.  We have been professional and over many years we have had ups and downs with the NTA.<\/p><p>We have always tried to maintain a fully professional relationship with the authority.  It has not been easy at times.

We are a small company with ten buses and 15 employees.  We know all of our customers.  I was concerned that we were going to be in a situation where we were not going to be able to continue our services.  I found it hard to get that across the line and get that communication to come back.

The UK Nationality and Borders Act came in some months ago and it was all about limiting how people could come in at Dover.  The then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson was at the time trying to put a block on illegal immigration into the UK.  One of the upshots of that was a proposal that there would be form-filling and fee-paying to get over the Border to Northern Ireland, if you were not an Irish or British citizen.  I think this would be quite unworkable.  Up to 1998, very few people crossed over the Border on coach tours but since the Good Friday Agreement, they do.  Many people take off from the west of Ireland, come up to Dublin and on into Northern Ireland.  If you are carrying American passengers and if your driver is a Polish national, it will be very tricky.  Each one of them has to get off the bus, fill out cumbersome forms, and pay a fee to get over the Border.  Tourism Ireland, which is an all-Ireland body, says this is absolutely unworkable.  Will the witnesses speak to that issue here?

I was hoping to flush out one point.  How much of the business of the sector and the members represented by the CTTC is what we might call the licensed routes in various places, versus organisations being contracted by schools to bring people on school tours, to swimming lessons, rugby, soccer and Gaelic football matches?

I presume the issues there are mainly that companies are locked into arrangements in which, while the fuel costs have gone up massively, margins are tight and they are now delivering services that are at break-even point or even less.  Equally, the council's members face huge challenges with driver retention and recruitment.  I noticed reference was made to work permits more than to driving licences.

All that is going to happen is there will be a complete change in who uses what service.  Many jobs will be lost.  I do not believe people have thought this true.

I was appointed as head of strategic and transport planning in TII in 2019.  I have a degree in electronic engineering, a masters of science in applied maths and computing and I have worked in the transport sector since 2000.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Helen Hughes, director of professional services in TII since 2015.  Ms Hughes oversees several technical areas, including road safety, research and standards, environmental policy, and strategic and transport planning.  I have been invited to discuss a TII report published in March entitled \"Impact of National Road Speed Limit Reductions on Greenhouse Gas Emissions\".<\/p> <p>  In 2020, the Department of Transport requested analytical assistance to investigate measures to reduce carbon emissions associated with the national road network.  A range of speed limit reduction scenarios for national roads was assessed by TII on behalf of the Department.  A key measure under consideration was the reduction of speed limits on the motorway network.  Before explaining the analysis in more detail, I will provide an overview of the relationship between speed and carbon emissions in fossil fuel-powered vehicles in Ireland.  Generally, emissions are highest at low speeds while the optimum speed range for petrol and diesel vehicles for limiting greenhouse gas emissions is 60 km\/h to 70 km\/h, depending on vehicle type.  Emissions increase again above these speeds albeit more gradually.  The greenhouse gas emission characteristics of the entire national vehicle fleet are a key data set in TII&rsquo;s road emissions model.  A detailed representation of travel patterns and traffic conditions on the network is included in TII&rsquo;s national transport model, which is a multi-modal, primarily inter-urban model that includes data sets such as place of work, school or college - census of anonymised records, CSO POWSCAR, as well as other data sources.  Both the transport and emissions models were used in this assessment. <\/p> <p>  In addition to detailed information on trip origins and destinations, the transport model holds road network information including speed limits for all national and regional road links.  The model predicts the route drivers choose when faced with a choice of route options by estimating the generalised cost of competing route options.  Generalised cost accounts for journey time, fuel and toll costs along different routes.  The traffic prediction mechanism in the model is validated through comparison of the model predictions of traffic levels with actual records of traffic levels from 350 automatic traffic counters nationwide.<\/p><p>With a fully validated national model correctly predicting driver route choice, TII can test the impacts associated with network changes such as changes in speed limits.<\/p><p> TII's road emissions model integrates data on the current vehicle fleet with emission rates.  The fleet information is based on the Irish car stock model version 2.1 provided by the MaREI energy and climate research team in UCC.  The emission rates were sourced from the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs emissions factor toolkit, which in turn was based on European COPERT emission rates.  <\/p><p> TII analysis shows that the application of speed limit reductions to the motorway network alone would reduce the time advantage that motorways offer over alternative parallel single carriageway routes.  This would result in traffic diversion from the motorway on to alternative national primary and regional routes, which also have speed limits of 100 km\/h over large sections.  Some of these parallel single carriageway road networks were formerly interurban national roads, for example, the former N8 between Durrow and Cork is now the R639 regional road passing through the towns of Urlingford and Johnstown, while the former N6 between Kinnegad and Galway is now the R446 regional road passing through towns such as Moate and Kilbeggan.  With diversion, traffic would also be diverting back through bypassed towns and villages.<\/p><p> With the scenario involving a 10 km\/h speed limit reduction applied to motorways only, the analysis shows that there would be a national decrease of 0.62% in carbon emissions from transport.  This rises to 0.79% when a 10 km\/h reduction is applied to all national roads.  This is not an insignificant reduction.  However, diversion of traffic to routes where motorists drive through towns and villages with stop-start driving conditions will limit the carbon emission reductions.  Greater carbon emission reductions would be likely to be achieved when there is no traffic diversion.  This could be achieved through broader application of speed limit reductions across the entire road network, not just on national roads.<\/p><p> The Department also requested that TII carry out a high-level strategic analysis on the economic and safety impacts of any national road speed limit interventions.  TII used its national transport model to compute the journey time impacts of speed limit reductions.  Standard values of time were used along with the journey time information to give insight into the economic impact.  These are listed in appendix G of the report.  For safety impacts, TII applied a standardised injury collision rate to the rerouted traffic.  For the scenario where a 10 km\/h speed limit reduction was applied to motorways only, there was a forecasted annual increase in road fatalities of five persons.  With a 10 km\/h reduction applied to all national roads, there was no forecasted change.  With higher speed limit reductions applied to national roads only, the forecasted fatalities increased.<\/p><p> This negative safety impact is because of increased traffic diversion to less safe roads.  The alternative routes available to motorway drivers include single carriageway former national primary roads between the five cities.  They mostly have speed limits of 100 km\/h and have low traffic volumes which facilitates driving close to the speed limit.  There are accesses to many properties, there are at-grade junctions and the alternative routes pass through towns and villages.  As with emissions, a wider speed limit intervention beyond national roads is not likely to cause traffic diversion and consequent safety issues.<\/p><p> These scenarios tested and referred to in the report were the first set of possible speed limit interventions requested to be studied by the Department.   TII is working with the Department and the NTA to carry out further analysis on the impact of speed limits changes across the entire road network having regard to road safety, emissions and the implications for active travel.  This work is also in the context of a wider speed limit review being carried out as action 6 in the road safety strategy.<\/p><p> I refer to appendix A in the report, which shows that by far the greatest carbon emissions from any vehicle with an internal combustion engine occur when the vehicle is travelling at low speeds.  Concentrated, slow-moving traffic in congested urban areas results in higher amounts of emissions per vehicle kilometre travelled.  This is a particular issue for freight vehicles on busy national roads.  TII considers that the application of traffic management and modal shift measures in urban areas could yield significant reductions in emissions.  We will endeavour to answer any questions the committee may have.  If we cannot provide a comprehensive answer today, we will provide a response as soon as practicable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022101900002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666134000,"counter":1466,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brady for his presentation.  From what I am seeing, this is the TII report on the impact of national road speed limit reductions so it is all about the national road network.  I read the 29-page document as much as the opening statement.  TII was focusing purely on the national road network, namely, the motorways and national dual and single carriageways.  Much of the traffic we all encounter and generate does not involve national roads even though per miles travelled, it amounts to 45% of the total.  Many Deputies and Senators drive on national roads but a large part of the general population does not drive on national roads a lot of the time.  I am particularly struck by a reference to how a small car run on petrol generates enormous emissions at 5 km\/h relative to 30 km\/h, 50 km\/h or 70 km\/h.  Emissions increase again when speeds increase from 80 km\/h to 90 km\/h.  The point about the shift from 50 km\/h to 80 km\/h is, therefore, interesting.<\/p> <p>  My takeaway from this is that all this stuff about trying to slow people down on motorways is nonsense.  It is worth having a look at but the conclusion is that this will not do much for us, whereas a modal shift and not driving at very low speeds while stuck on congested roads will do much more for emissions.  I presume there is a fair number of idling buses and trucks outside shops - I see it myself - and vehicles outside schools with the engines running possibly because drivers do not want to use the battery.  Emissions could be saved in other ways.<\/p> <p>  I suppose Mr. Brady is saying that we should not worry too much about the motorway network because TII's model suggests that some people would come off the motorways and start driving on other roads.  Is the main reason for that just to save on tolls?  I do not understand why because if the motorway speed limit was reduced from 120 km\/h to 100 km\/h, I would probably still want to stay on the M8 rather than go back on the N8 through various towns where I would potentially encounter congestion that I will not encounter on the M8.  Perhaps if the saving was &euro;3 each way, some people might decide it was worth it.  When the tolls came in, I used to think when I saw trucks exiting the motorways that the journey would take 20 minutes longer and surely the cost to the driver in terms of time would be more expensive than the saving from not paying a toll for a truck.  I do not think I realised before now that the speed limit for trucks on a motorway is 90 km\/h.  Is that right?  I have often encountered trucks travelling as fast as I was, at 120 km\/h.  I did not realise there was a 90 km\/h limit.  <\/p> <p>  Could Mr. Brady confirm that my takeaway, which is that slowing people on motorways will increase road deaths and congestion in towns and take people off motorways that were built to get people from \"A\" to \"B\" quickly and safely, is correct?  It was not part of this report because TII was focused on national roads but there is considerable scope for people to do things better in urban areas.<\/p> <p>  When representatives of the Love 30 campaign appeared before the committee they argued against having speed limits above 30 km\/h in urban areas.  There may be valid reasons for that in terms of road safety and someone being involved in a collision at 30 km\/h rather than 50 km\/h but in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, that proposal would generate more greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas than people driving at 50 km\/h.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022101900002#O00200","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":1467,"content":"<p>We found that a reduction in speed limits on motorways and national roads causes a small reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

Those types of measures undermine the strategy of slowing and controlling speed.  As you head further westbound towards the Bishopstown Court roundabout, heading beyond the dog track towards Ballincollig, there is occasionally a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on that road operating a handheld camera and checking speeding from a motorbike on the side of the hard shoulder, which is very dangerous.  I have made the point at this committee.  It is shooting fish in a barrel on the motorway and on the N40 heading in both directions.  I could leave my house and by the time I get to Fermoy I could have encountered four checks - either a speed van or Garda - yet I can travel some of the national routes, which in my opinion as layperson are far more dangerous, with no effective speed controls.

It is true to say that when they are there, drivers will drive at the speed limit for the most part.  However, this report does not look at actual speeds that are being driven on our network and, therefore, if that is the input assumption, the output of the report is absolutely flawed.<\/p> <p>  I mention that because it says there will be a small reduction in carbon emissions if we reduce the speed limits.  We might look at the actual speed limits, however.  I referred to other studies, including an EU study, which show that a reduction of 17% or 18% in carbon emissions comes about from enforcement of speed limits coupled with a reduction of 10 km\/h on the motorway network.  Therefore, it seems to me there is a huge risk that coming out of this report, policymakers feel it makes no sense to reduce the speed limit.  It makes sense to reduce the speed limit, however, and put in rigorous enforcements such that people drive at the speed limit.  I make that point not to undermine the results.  The 1% or 2% reduction in emissions is still very important.  It seems to me, however, that we can get more if we get the reduction plus the enforcement.  I acknowledge that even if everybody drove at the speed limit today, that 1% or 2% is still important because we have to find those reductions across our whole transport system.  I would urge caution, however.  I am not saying TII is saying this.  TII carried out this report and had a specific remit.  It is really important that we acknowledge there are limitations to the report.  It should not be said coming out of this committee that speed limits have a very minor impact.  I was really disappointed by the headline from earlier in the year that stated there will be 35 extra fatalities.  I am not saying TII is responsible for that.  That assumes nothing else has been done throughout the network when, of course, we could have speed mitigation right throughout the network.  This is not directed at TII but that headline leverages the tragedies that so many people across this country have suffered on our roads to push against any change in our speed limits.  I am not putting that accusation at TII but more so at the media, which ran with that headline.

I thank TII for doing this really important work.<\/p> <p>  I have some quick questions and observations.  The report makes the case that by reducing speed limit limits on our national motorway network, we would run the risk of having at least 35 additional fatalities each year because, ultimately, we would drive people off that network and onto the secondary, regional and local road networks.  Are we to assume that in doing so and running the risk of those fatalities, that those people leaving the motorway network would, by definition, be breaking the speed limit on those other roads?  As the Chairman stated, if one was to reduce the speed limit on a national network, perhaps by bringing it down to 110 km\/h, one will  have to have a cascading reduction across the entire road network.  I travel quite a lot on the M6 from Dublin to Galway.  It does not make sense that somebody who decides, for example, to depart the M6, and who observes the speed limit on what was the old N6, would still make a time gain between Dublin and Galway.  It would not be physically possible.  Are we to assume that those additional fatalities that occur off the national motorway network happen, in the main, because people are breaking the speed limit on those more minor roads?  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022101900002#T03000","speaker":"1483"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666134000,"counter":1646,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.

Our guests have further work to do, and we ask that if they have the information on EV cars, they give it to us.  For an ordinary person looking in, the issue is fascinating.  In general, the public now wants to get on board with climate action but, obviously, it has to be practical and, for many people, sustainable.  Appendix A is very interesting.  It is the type of document the ordinary person will read, and that is how we are going to get to that space to make progress on climate action.  If our guests have done work on EVs, they might come back to us and we will return to the matter.  When do they anticipate the next report will be complete?
