I have been asked by the T&aacute;naiste to express his apologies for not being able to attend the committee today as he is abroad on Government business.<\/p><p>The committee secretariat has been provided with the briefing by the Department&rsquo;s officials who are with me today, Mr. Cathal O'Gorman and Ms Bernadette Hawkes, in relation to the various elements of the Supplementary Estimate, which hopefully has been of assistance to the members of the committee. With the permission of the Chairman, I will provide a little detail in relation to the main elements of the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p><p>I affirm that the Estimate being presented to the committee this afternoon is not seeking any additional Exchequer funding over and above the &euro;1.142 billion gross provision provided to our Department in the 2021 Further Revised Estimates approved by the D&aacute;il in June.  Rather, the Estimate is of a technical nature as it is seeking permission to redistribute some &euro;41.55 million in savings to support a number of particular priorities on the Department&rsquo;s Vote.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s 2021 Supplementary Estimate has the following distinct elements.  A &euro;33 million redistribution within the Enterprise Ireland A7 Subhead will establish an innovation equity fund.  This will allow for the establishment of a &euro;90 million investment fund, made up of a &euro;30 million keystone investment from our Department, matched by a &euro;30 million investment from the European Investment Fund, EIF, via the InvestEU programme, and a co-investment of &euro;30 million from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  The additional &euro;3 million investment from the Department will cover fees associated with the administration of the fund.  In addition, there is &euro;550,000 for the humanitarian flood relief scheme, subhead A15, to fund claims made as a result of flooding incidents and &euro;8 million will be used for subscriptions to international organisations, subhead B6, for the European Space Agency.<\/p><p>The innovation equity fund, which was announced by the Minister for Finance in budget 2021, is designed to provide seed venture capital to innovative Irish companies and will be an important step in maturing the Irish venture capital market.  The fund, totalling &euro;90 million, will be made up of a &euro;33 million contribution from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s Vote, of which &euro;3 million will cover the administrative costs of the fund.  The European Investment Fund will match this investment by providing a further &euro;30 million from the InvestEU programme, and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund will co-invest a further &euro;30 million.<\/p><p>The fund will be led by Enterprise Ireland, with the European Investment Fund acting as fund manager and will be structured as a fund-of-funds.  This means that the fund will invest in other specialist fund managers who will target specific objectives and sections of the market.  The first call of the fund will be launched in early 2022 and all investments are expected to be made within a three-year timeframe.  The investments are forecast to have a ten-year life.  Investments will be targeted and prioritised in areas that are experiencing difficulty in attracting investment including life sciences; healthcare and pharma; fintech; technology and digitalisation; green and environmental; and female-led enterprises.  They will try to target these companies at very early stage, with seed capital for start-ups also.<\/p><p>A fund of this size, backed by these experienced partners, is an important step in developing the investment ecosystem in Ireland.  It aims to attract new fund managers and new private investors to crowd-in further private equity investment.  There is strong demand for seed venture capital in Ireland.  The most recent call for applications to Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s seed and venture capital scheme in May 2021 amounted to a funds request of more than &euro;350 million.  With &euro;71 million available to allocate, Enterprise Ireland had to scale back allocations to even the strongest fund managers.  This will give the committee a view of the demand out there.<\/p><p>The humanitarian relief scheme programme, which is funded through subhead A15 on our Department&rsquo;s Vote, is intended to provide humanitarian support for small businesses, community, voluntary and sporting bodies who experience flood damage to their premises as a consequence of a severe weather event and who have been previously refused flood insurance.  The Department took over responsibility for this scheme from the Department of Defence.  The humanitarian relief scheme is not a statutory-based scheme.  The Department is currently exploring the possibility of establishing the scheme on a statutory basis.  In the interim, the scheme is administered on an emergency humanitarian basis.  This requires that <i>ad hoc<\/i>emergency schemes are established as and when required by severe weather events.<\/p><p><i>Ad hoc<\/i>emergency schemes are administered by the Irish Red Cross on behalf of the Department.  The role of the Irish Red Cross is to advertise, process applications and check criteria to be met via the local authorities and assessors and once verified, to distribute payments to eligible beneficiaries.  The<i>ad hoc <\/i>emergency schemes are designed to enable affected businesses to seek immediate assistance for costs of up to &euro;5,000 to remediate damages from the weather event in question.  This essentially allows for applications and payments to be processed as speedily as possible.  In the event that applicants have incurred significant damages above &euro;5,000, further support can be provided following detailed assessments by the Irish Red Cross Society, which can include a physical assessment of the damages suffered.<\/p><p>The total level of support available under an <i>ad hoc <\/i>scheme is capped at &euro;20,000.  The establishment of an <i>ad hoc<\/i>emergency scheme requires Government approval.  Four such <i>ad hoc<\/i>emergency relief schemes were approved by Government in the course of 2020.  Thankfully, we have had no need for any in 2021 so far.  While a number of claims under the 2020 schemes approved by Government were paid in that year, others were not paid out until 2021.  The reason for the delay in processing payments was due to Covid-19 related restrictions, whereby the Irish Red Cross assessors were unable to finalise on-site inspections until Covid restrictions were lifted.  This resulted in a number of invoices relating to 2020 flooding events not being submitted until April and May 2021 by the Irish Red Cross.  The &euro;550,000 being sought in the Supplementary Estimate today is required to meet the costs of claims submitted for payment during 2021.<\/p><p>I will turn now to the European Space Agency, ESA.  Ireland has been a member of ESA since 1975.  Irish membership is through an annual subscription that allows Irish companies and researchers to competitively bid for ESA tenders and contracts.  The value of the resulting contracts is commensurate with Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall ESA budget.  Over the past five years, close to &euro;80 million has been awarded in contracts.  The primary rationale for Ireland&rsquo;s continued investment in ESA is to support innovative companies and researchers to develop leading-edge technologies for commercial exploitation in the global space market; to develop valuable research and business linkages with other space organisations; to spin out high-reliability and high-performance space technologies into non-space markets; and to spin technologies into the space market.<\/p><p>The year 2020 was a very successful year for Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the European Space Agency as a total value of &euro;13.3 million in contracts were awarded to Irish-based industry and researchers by the ESA.<\/p><p>The year 2020 also saw record growth in the number of Irish companies engaging with ESA support programmes, with 13 new companies securing their first ESA contract.  This is the highest number of new-entrant Irish companies recorded in any given year to date.<\/p><p> In 2020, Irish companies demonstrated the practical value of their technologies by joining the fight against Covid-19.  Three Irish companies were selected by ESA to develop solutions using satellite systems.  The successful projects include a virtual command-and-control centre, which will streamline and support effective emergency response, a device that tracks the spread of Covid-19 using real-time satellite data, and a wearable technology that will support remote monitoring of patient health in the community.<\/p><p> The &euro;8 million in additional funding proposed today will be invested across six programmes in key technology areas such as earth observation, telecommunications and technology development.  Some of the programmes that will benefit from this additional funding include: the Copernicus space component which enables industry to develop technologies to implement the EU&rsquo;s Copernicus satellite missions; advanced research in telecommunications systems, ARTES, which enables industry to explore, through research and development activities, innovative concepts to produce leading-edge satcom products and services; business applications, BASS, which supports downstream applications of advanced satellite systems and including the next phase of Ireland&rsquo;s ESA business incubator; the Earth observation programme, EOP, which supports industrial activity using Earth observation technologies; the navigation innovation and support programme, NAVISP, a programme in navigation to foster innovation and competitiveness of European industry; and the general support technology programme, GSTP, which, together with ESA, participating states and industry, seeks to convert promising engineering concepts into a broad spectrum of useable products.<\/p><p> Space is an area of growing importance for Ireland.  The number of Irish-based companies engaged with the European Space Agency has grown by almost 60% in the last five years; from 55 companies in 2015 up to 87 in 2020.  The national space strategy for enterprise provides a roadmap for future investment in the space sector and our continued membership of ESA is an integral element of that strategy.  The additional funding being provided through the Supplementary Estimate will help further the objectives of the national space strategy.<\/p><p> As advised, this Supplementary Estimate is technical in its nature as it involves the redistribution of &euro;41.55 million in savings from within our Department&rsquo;s 2021 voted gross allocation of &euro;1.142 billion.  The Supplementary Estimates package being presented to the committee this afternoon represents approximately 3.6% of our total allocation.<\/p><p> The 2021 voted allocation included significant discrete additional moneys to enable the Department and our agencies to be able to continue to respond the challenges of Covid and Brexit.  Much of this additional funding was provided to support Enterprise Ireland's Covid-focused programmes.  In this regard Enterprise Ireland was provided with a total allocation of &euro;415.956 million for use on its enterprise development programmes this year.  This represented an almost threefold increase on its core allocation for these programmes.  The additional moneys provided to Enterprise Ireland was to ensure that it could continue to provide targeted supports in a timely manner to businesses as they continue to deal with the impacts of Covid and Brexit.<\/p><p> The supports include measures such as the small business assistance scheme for Covid, SBASC, and the sustaining enterprise fund.  The nature of these schemes is that there can be a time-lag between the approval of applications and the projects underlying such applications being completed and submitted for payment.  These time-lags resulted in payments under a number of Enterprise Ireland's schemes, such as the two mentioned, not being drawn as had been expected.  Essentially, therefore, the savings on the Enterprise Ireland allocation is the basis for the funding of the Supplementary Estimates package of &euro;41.549 million.<\/p><p> I hope the foregoing outlines the various elements of the Supplementary Estimate before the committee this afternoon and I look forward to answering any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021113000002#B00400","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>As all members are joining the meeting remotely, I asked them to raise their hand to indicate they wish to speak and more importantly to take it down when they finish speaking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021113000002#C00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I wish to ask about funding for ventilation.

Nonetheless, there is a general legal requirement on employers to provide sufficient fresh air, which obviously has increased importance in the context of the Covid pandemic.

It has taken a leading role in that work.  In 2021, 54 additional posts were sanctioned in the Health and Safety Authority as part of a phased recruitment process.  Of those 54 posts, 42 were inspector grade posts.  In 2020, the authority had 174 members of staff, of whom 105 were full-time inspectors.  In conjunction with the other public health systems, it has taken a leading role in trying to manage inspections across a range of workplaces, some of which the Deputy will be very familiar with.<\/p> <p>  While the Health and Safety Authority leads on them, its own inspectors do not carry out every inspection.  They are done in conjunction with all the others such as HSE staff, the public health team of the Department etc.  They carry out inspections on a list of areas whenever they make a call.  I am sure that includes the ventilation.  I do not have the detail of the focus of that work to hand.  I can request that from the HSA and I have no problem with sharing it with the Deputy.  Inspectors home in on a range of issues.  For example, part of the work during a farm inspection will take in farm safety as part of that inspection.  It depends on the sector being visited, but naturally ventilation would be part of that where appropriate.  Generally, adherence to the back-to-work protocol and all the safety measures put in place has been quite good.  The last time I checked, there was more than 90% compliance with the requirements.  I would be happy to get an update for the Deputy on this specific area he mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021113000002#C00600","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The budget 2022 expenditure report claimed that the HSA had greatly increased staff.

This seems like fairly technical stuff.  The Department has saved some money through the Vote for Enterprise Ireland, EI, and is redistributing it through different mechanisms.  I have just a few questions.  Regarding the humanitarian flood relief scheme and the funding of &euro;550,000 for it, am I right in saying that that money was not paid out but will be paid out - in other words, that decisions have been made that the money is to be paid to companies, businesses, sporting organisations and so on that were impacted by floods last year?  I think I am correct in saying that that is what the note stated.  The Minister of State might clarify that that is the case and that that money is already accounted for and needs to be paid.  Is that funding in addition to other such funding that has already been made available in this regard?<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the investment fund.  There is a lot going on there.  It is quite good and will crowd in a lot more funding from the private sector.  The Minister of State may not have the answer to this here and now, but it has been brought to my attention that some Irish companies, when they reach a certain scale, cannot go any further and are very often sold off at that stage.  Some of these companies will have received funding from the Department, that is, from EI and so on.  Has the Department done any research into how these companies can be maintained in Irish ownership and continue growing rather than being sold off?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the base component.  I know there are a range of Sentinel satellites and so on involved here.  Could he give us some examples as to how Ireland is benefiting from the leading-edge research and work going on in this regard?<\/p> <p>  Those are three questions under three levels of funding the Minister of State has brought forward.<\/p> <p>  Finally, regarding advanced research in telecommunications systems, is the Minister of State satisfied that our mobile phones are safe from hacking?  We are now reliant on a number of carriers out there.  There are three or four very large carriers.  I do not think any of them is based in Ireland.  How satisfied is the Minister of State that we - politicians, business people and so on - are safe from being hacked?  What work is the Department doing to ensure we can guarantee people who invest in Ireland that the telecoms platforms we use here are secure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021113000002#D00200","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I will try to answer those questions as best I can, working through them in reverse order.<\/p> <p>  I am afraid I am not the competent person to answer the Deputy's last question about the security of telecommunications because it is beyond my expertise and above my pay grade, but I will get him a note on the matter.  A lot of the work we invest in with our technological companies, including through ESA contracts, are in that sphere, but I cannot give the Deputy an answer to his question because it does not fall within the remit of our Department.  I will get him a note on the matter, no problem, because it is a relevant question to ask.  It is funny that none of the various investors we have met who are choosing to locate here or to expand their business operations here has ever asked that question.  It is certainly a relevant one.<\/p> <p>  As to how the country has benefited from the various contracts through the ESA, I will outline a few businesses for Deputy Stanton and I have no problem dropping him a note on them.  I will not outline the money we allocate to each company because that is commercially sensitive information, but I have no problem giving the Deputy information on the applications of some of the successful companies over the years.  If it is okay with you, Chair, I will go through some of them now.  I will take Cork first, seeing as Deputy Stanton is from County Cork.  There is PMD Solutions in Cork.  It has developed a patient monitoring system called Corona-RS.  It will be used by healthcare professionals, using satellite technology to monitor the health status of patients in the community who are suffering the effects of Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses.  That is a very useful intervention.  Another company also, as it turns out, based in Cork - it is just a coincidence that they are listed here - is Treemetrics.  It has secured funding to develop a new platform to enable the production of forest certification and carbon verification standards.  That will really help not just Ireland but the world to deal with the effects of climate change and to try to assert a baseline in that area.  Ubotica Technologies, in Dublin, got a contract to incorporate its artificial intelligence technology to enable the first ever hardware-accelerated artificial intelligence inference of data in an orbit satellite.  It is contributing to space, so, while it does not benefit Ireland directly, it has a role in that regard.  There is a spend of more than &euro;350 billion in space technology annually.  That is what the sector is worth and we want a share of that corporate spend.  I will give the Deputy another example.  A Galway company won three technology development activities and highly competitive ESA tenders relating to optical satellite communications.  Again, all the communications technology used in space ends up being useful to us in our technology development as well.  I am happy to send the Deputy my list rather going through all the details now.  It might have been included in the briefing - I am not sure - but I will certainly send it to him as well.  As it turns out, there are three more Cork companies listed, he will be delighted to know.  I can come back to this at the end of the committee meeting if he would like me to do so.  These companies are useful.<\/p> <p>  To respond to the question about the innovation fund and what we are trying to achieve with it, Deputy Stanton has correctly identified that as companies grow and expand and as some of them try to start, access to investment money, equity and capital to expand, as opposed to borrowings, is an issue.  This is not just an Irish issue.  It is something we have worked a lot on over recent years.  There are quite a few stakeholders with which Enterprise Ireland engages to try to match up companies for private investment as well as Enterprise Ireland using its own funds, but there are always gaps in the market.  As I said earlier, with the application for funding of &euro;350 million from Enterprise Ireland, it could accommodate only &euro;70 million of that, and there are different levels of intervention and different stages of companies' growth.  That fund tries to focus mainly on the seed capital and start-ups.  The Deputy mentioned other companies that want to expand and grow.  Through our SME task force, we want to encourage those companies that stay in Ireland to secure the investment here and to be able to locate in Ireland and to create jobs here.  It is an issue for Ireland and Europe that there are companies we lose.  Stripe is an example of a company that originally could not source the investment it needed in Ireland and relocated to the US to source investment.  We do not want to see that happen again.  That does not mean we have the funds to invest in every company, but we are trying to build up these funds.  Our Department's investment of &euro;33 million, matched with the European Investment Bank's &euro;30 million and the ISIF money, gives us a &euro;90 million fund, which will then draw down other funds and possibly help us to secure investment in companies of over &euro;160 million if it all multiplies correctly.  That is what we are trying to achieve.  We are trying to find solutions to exactly the situations to which Deputy Stanton referred.  This is for start-ups but we will work on other solutions as well.  We have other offerings but we want to expand these offerings.<\/p> <p>  The tax system is a major issue when it comes to attracting investment and funds.  There is a tax commission set up into which our Department will feed and which will look at all these issues of taxation that would encourage or discourage investment in companies and services.  That is something we will try to do.  We want to see as many companies as possible stay in Irish ownership but, more important, to keep the jobs in Ireland.  The Deputy has flagged this and we will continue to work on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021113000002#D00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>The other question I had was about the humanitarian flood relief scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021113000002#D00400","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>The money we are approving today was approved under the 2020 scheme and has been paid out this year.

To me, however, and having sat around that emergency co-ordination table during those events, I found it very useful to know that the Red Cross was available and at quick notice could set up a scheme and initially roll out money quite quickly.  With larger claims there is a bit more work involved by the Red Cross to do with site inspection and so on.  That is why there would be a time delay.  Generally, however, these funds are paid out quite quickly.  We like that because, generally, these businesses are under immense pressure there and then and most cases relate to flooding.

The Minister of State mentioned green and environmental schemes and one of the issues that is coming up frequently is remote working.  In some cases, people are not working from home but from digital hubs in provincial towns and so forth.  At the moment, it seems that all of the funding is geared towards the not-for-profit sector.  Has the Government or the Department looked at assisting in the establishment of larger hubs that might be used by large businesses so that rather than hundreds of people having to travel every day into centres near cities, they could stay in their own provincial towns and work there?  This would be beneficial for the environment as well as reducing the amount of time spent commuting and the stress associated with that.  A lot of good work has been done by other Departments with respect to some of these hubs but they are usually small scale, with relatively small numbers and set up by not-for-profit bodies.  Is it time to look beyond that and to grow such hubs further, bringing them to the next level as they have done in other countries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021113000002#E00200","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>The Deputy is right.  The development of hub infrastructure is key.  It almost a year since the T&aacute;naiste launched our remote working strategy, the objective of which is to ensure that remote working becomes a permanent feature for our workforce.  A key part of that is the option to work in a hub.  Remote working does not always mean working from home and not everyone would choose that option.  There is, however, a lot of interest in developing our hub space.  Part of the strategy involved conducting a mapping exercise to clearly identify where our hubs are and to match that with funding administered through Enterprise Ireland, our own internal provincial affairs department and through various community schemes.  That exercise is largely complete and shows that there is a network of around 400 hubs.  There is still capacity in many of them but we have identified some areas where there is a shortage of capacity.  We are working with the Community Enterprise Association Ireland to identify where the needs are so that we can respond with the development of new remote working, co-working spaces.  Enterprise Ireland is due to publish its three year strategy in the coming months which will outline its role in administering departmental finance for the development of digital hub spaces and remote working spaces.  I think that strategy will be published in January and it will identify the role of Enterprise Ireland in this area.  The Department, through Enterprise Ireland, will fund these spaces in conjunction with other funding streams.<\/p> <p>  Another key way in which we fund hub development is through the regional enterprise strategies.  Over the last roll-out of those plans in the last three years, nine regions invested in hub spaces all over the country.  They have been very successful.  Some of them are remote working spaces while others are development hubs in areas like food innovation, as well as business hubs.  In a lot of the draft strategies that are coming through now and which will be signed off and announced in spring 2022 emphasis is placed on the development of hub spaces.  It is important that we do that and that the money is secured to implement those schemes.  We will work with colleagues in other Departments to promote investment in hub space and working from home.  A key part of our Covid response was the provision of additional money to upgrade our existing hubs, many of which are managed by our Local Enterprise Offices, LEOs or in conjunction with LEOs or local economic development teams in our local authorities.  Such upgrades were also made possible by grant funding through Enterprise Ireland.  We have provided Enterprise Ireland with additional funds for 2022 to support its programme of development of remote working spaces and start-up spaces for SMEs.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021113000002#E00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I have some questions of my own.

As Deputy Stanton said, it is a very effective and useful scheme when it does work.  I have seen situations where businesses were flooded and the uncertainty around whether they will get grant assistance is very stressful for people so putting the scheme on a statutory basis would be important.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the work being done to put the scheme on a statutory footing.

It is felt that it is not always necessary to have a budget sitting there.  A budget head is kept open with &euro;1,000 in it and then we can quickly design a scheme to respond to a particular event when it happens.  That has been the thinking so far.  There have been negotiations involving my Department as well as the Departments of Defence and Public Expenditure and Reform and across the Government on the best way to deal with this in the future.

It is also the fundamental strategic issue for the motor industry.  There is a huge appetite across our industry to deliver on this project.  We have already seen massive investments in new vehicles at vehicle manufacturer level.  Local retailers are also investing heavily in premises, equipment and employee training in preparation for the rapid increase of electric vehicles, EVs, on Irish roads.  The industry can, and will deliver EVs in large numbers, but the extent of this delivery is not just in the hands of the industry and it needs the State&rsquo;s continued assistance to help build the conditions that will allow motorists confidently move to an EV at the earliest possible stage.  In addition, the continued roll-out of a national charging infrastructure is crucial, particularly in rural parts of Ireland where charging is not commercially viable.<\/p> <p>  The committee has identified the used EV market as being of critical importance and this is something we in Society of Motor Industry Ireland, SIMI agree with.  Motorists typically buy used cars chiefly down to affordability reasons.  However, the new and used car markets are inextricably linked.  Currently, we clearly do not have an adequate supply of EVs in the national fleet to create a viable used EV market.  This will change but the question is how quickly this can happen.  A strong used EV market will be key to reaching the ambitious targets in the climate action plan, and also provides the opportunity to replace the oldest highest emitting cars on the road.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland the used car market is typically created in two ways, by new cars being registered in Ireland becoming used car stock once the original owner has moved it on and by the used import market which can plug the gap when there is a shortage of used cars.  The used import dynamic, however, has changed.  Brexit and the resulting tax changes on UK imports, along with the shortage of used cars in the UK, means this market is not as attractive as it had been in recent years.<\/p><p>Over the coming years, EVs on Irish roads will overwhelmingly be those first registered new in Ireland and a vibrant used EV market will only evolve on the back of a strong Irish new car market. <\/p><p> The Irish new and used car markets have underperformed since 2008 due to a number of factors, including the recession, Brexit, the pandemic and high local taxation levels.  The benefits of supporting a stronger new car market can help us get much closer to the climate action targets, while at the same time replace the oldest high-emitting cars on Irish roads with electric vehicles or lower-emitting cars.  In this regard, we need the State to continue its investment in supporting electric vehicles.  The industry accepts that supports cannot last forever and appreciates that the State has been generous to date.  However, we have seen a gradual erosion in recent years of these supports and we believe it is too early in the EV project to start this withdrawal.  It is vital that the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant, vehicle registration tax, VRT, relief and other supports currently available are maintained out to 2025, at which time they can be reviewed.  By doing this, we can provide consumers with confidence in the EV project and create an active used EV market at the earliest possible stage, thus widening the potential constituency of EV buyers.  In addition, Ireland is also competing with other EU countries for the supply of new EVs, and to ensure it can optimise its share of this supply, incentives must remain. <\/p><p> In order to boost used EV availability, a particular focus should be made on the business fleet and company car sector.  The nature of this market means that the cars are typically released to the used car market when they are two to four years old.  Two key measures can encourage the business fleet: first, extend the current 0% benefit in kind, BIK, ceiling out to 2025, and second, the reinstatement of the SEAI company car grant for a period of time.  The extension of the home charging grant for second-hand buyers is also crucial.  In addition, with the Government commitment to electrifying its own fleets, a requirement that these EVs be traded every two years could also increase supply to the used car market. <\/p><p> In order to drive down emissions, we must eliminate the worst polluters from the national fleet.  In the past, targeted scrappage schemes have assisted in this regard and could be considered and limited to EVs.  It also has to be highlighted, however, that many of those driving older cars do not have the financial capacity to trade up to a new or used EV, with the likely cost of trying to change to an EV from an old petrol or diesel car being unachievable for many consumers.  Their EV journey will take significantly longer and in the meantime, they will be trapped and subject to increasing fuel prices, as well as increased carbon and potentially other taxes, from which they do not have the potential to escape.  These car owners, some of whom do not have other transport alternatives, will need to be supported.  The retention of some equity value in their current car will be important to allow them to trade up to a more fuel-efficient car, thus reducing their running costs and reducing their emissions.  <\/p><p> The industry and the State need to work together to help consumers make the transition to EVs a successful one.  Over the period ahead, we want to engage consistently and regularly.  We last presented to this committee four years ago and much has changed in the meantime.  SIMI will issue our own more detailed report on how to reduce transport emissions early in the new year and I will forward a copy to the Chairman and members.  SIMI would welcome the opportunity to meet this committee and other State agencies to discuss this research in detail. <\/p><p> The industry is committed to driving down emissions and will continue to provide solutions for motorists.  EVs are set to become commonplace on Irish roads.  SIMI members will sell and service hundreds of thousands of EVs by the end of the decade.  However, it will be the economic, business, taxation and retail environment that will determine how close we can get to the climate action plan targets. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cooke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cook for his opening statement.

I will be sharing some information on the ESB&rsquo;s ecars endeavours.  The ESB established ESB ecars in 2010, and the reason for that was because we noted that transportation is responsible for approximately 20% of all carbon emissions in Ireland.  We saw that electromobility could play a key role in helping to decarbonise our society.  We were also cognisant of the fact that as our industry decarbonised electricity generation, it would be a major win for wider society if we could use our progressively decarbonising electricity system to also decarbonise transport.  We believed that we could do this by seeding, developing and supporting the transition to electromobility and recognised the charging infrastructure and support services would be needed to be in place in order to give citizens confidence to purchase an electric vehicle.  I should say that there was not an onus on the ESB to provide the infrastructure.  Actually, in most other countries, electrical utilities do not do so.  However, it was a role we took on given our commercial semi-State status and our interest in supporting Ireland's low carbon targets.<br\/><br\/>We therefore established ESB ecars with three aims.  The first aim is to design and build a public charging infrastructure for EVs across Ireland, thereby reducing the range anxiety that was an issue for early EVs drivers where ranges were typically about 100 km.  We also wanted to support the adoption of EVs in Ireland for early adopters and subsequently to continue to stimulate the demand for electric vehicles nationally.  In recent years, the demand for EVs has increased dramatically.  In addition, the issue of range anxiety has somewhat been addressed by the latest generation of EVs that have significantly increased ranges.  Very often new cars now have range in excess of 350 km or 400 km. <br\/><br\/>Installing EV infrastructure is expensive.  While Ireland&rsquo;s EV fleet is growing significantly, given the major investments already made by ESB ecars in establishing our national charging network ahead of the expected increase in EV uptake, it will take some time before our ecars business recovers the money spent. <br\/><br\/>Since ecars was established, we have expanded the network to provide an ultra reliable and fully interoperable EV charging network of over 1,350 public charge points for our customers across the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Our EV chargers are widely available and are found across the country in on-street locations and fuel stations, motorway service stations, shopping centres and in retail parks, etc.  The network complements the home-based or work-based charging that most EV drivers use in their daily lives. <br\/><br\/>I will give the committee some information on the nature of the ecars network.  There are currently three types of chargers on the ESB public charging network.  The smallest charger we have is 22 kW, which is our standard charger.  They are the most widely available chargers on our network and they are geographically located such that an EV driver is always within 35 km of the nearest charger.  These alternating current, AC, chargers will fully charge an EV in one to six hours, depending on the size of the battery.  The next biggest charger is a 50 kW charger and there are approximately 150 of these fast chargers on our network.  These are direct current, DC, chargers and are substantially faster than the standard chargers.  For example, an 80% charge will typically take about 45 minutes.  Finally, we have high-powered chargers which are in excess of 150 kW and<b><\/b>these chargers are all located in hubs.  They are capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously and the units can give an EV driver who has a battery that is effectively empty about 100 km of range in six minutes. <br\/><br\/>ESB ecars is currently undertaking a &euro;20 million investment programme to further expand and enhance the charging network across Ireland.  ESB qualified for &euro;10 million in funding under the climate action fund and ESB is matching that funding with a further &euro;10 million.  This comprehensive investment programme is expanding and enhancing the public charging network across Ireland to help meet the expected growth of EVs in the coming years.<br\/><br\/>There are three different elements to the current investment programme.  The first element is the replacement of 264 legacy 22 kW chargers and this element of the programme is effectively complete.  The second element is the upgrade of 52 locations that provide the fast 50 kW chargers.  This element is about three quarters complete at this time and the remainder of it will be completed in the first quarter of next year.  We are also developing 56 charging high powered capacity hubs throughout Ireland which can charge multiple vehicles simultaneously.  This is a substantial component of the upgrade and will see 56 high power charging, HPC, hubs being constructed as we negotiate access to both motorway and national road sites.  Ten of the hubs are complete at present, with a further seven currently in construction with a completion date in January 2022.  We are on schedule to complete the remaining programme by the end of 2023.<br\/><br\/>Our assessment process for deciding the locations of new charger sites is heavily data based and is determined by a range of factors.  These factors include the current charge point usage, available space on site for expansion, proximity to user populations, traffic volumes nearby in passing, accessibility to the site, amenities on the site, available capacity on the electricity grid and, very importantly, landowner consent.<\/p><p>The results of these data-driven analytics studies help us to identify and locate the most suitable sites for our chargers.  The works we are undertaking at present will significantly modernise and strengthen the charging network by upgrading all charging points to cater for all EVs and in strategically important locations, adding next generation charging hubs to the network.  We are committed to ensuring that our public charging network is reliable and that EV drivers have confidence in it.  The reliability rate, or how many of our chargers are available for use at any one point in time across the network, was 84% before the investment programme commenced.  We are proud to report that this figure has now risen to an average of 98% in 2021.  All new charge sites developed under the climate action fund will adhere, where feasible, to a universal access model where all new parking bays and chargers will be fully accessible.  In designing these new charge sites, design guidance was taken from the Irish Wheelchair Association&rsquo;s best practice access guidelines and the building regulations of 2010.  For legacy sites where improvement works are being undertaken we will , where feasible, seek to improve accessibility to these chargers. <\/p><p> ESB e-cars firmly believes that the transition to zero carbon transport will require a whole-of-system approach.  We need to see much more active travel including walking and cycling and the increased use of public transport.  However, there will likely be a strong residual desire for private car ownership given the particular demographics of Ireland.  Where this is the case, there are huge advantages in terms of both air quality and emissions from those cars being electrically powered.  In addition to private transport, significant volumes of both light and heavy freight will continue and will need to decarbonise.  Electricity will play an ever-increasing role here as battery performance improves and larger vehicles can be electrified.  Therefore, in time, more charging infrastructure will be required in supporting Ireland to reach its required EV uptake.  <\/p><p> The first round of climate action funding has been instrumental in delivering additional charging locations, improved reliability, faster charging times for drivers and a substantial reduction in carbon emissions.  The number of charging sessions on our system has tripled since the beginning of 2021 and is now typically reaching 70,000 sessions per month. <\/p><p> In summary, ESB has made a significant commitment over the past decade to support and encourage the transition to zero carbon transport and EVs on a universal basis, irrespective of the make of car.  With some funding from both the European Union and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, in the early years, we have spent more than &euro;80 million on installing and operating the infrastructure to date.  This includes designing and building our national charging infrastructure which, as I have outlined, is now in the process of being comprehensively rejuvenated and expanded with the assistance of climate action funding of &euro;10 million.  We are also developing back-office oversight procedures and supports, one of which is the provision of a 24-7, year-round contact centre and support service for all drivers.  We also provide digital EV user platforms, such as our website and our app, which allow all drivers to locate their nearest charge point and identify if it is available in real time, to start and stop a charging session and to top up their account balances.  We are also engaged in the provision of maintenance processes and personnel.  ESB ecars is wholly committed to the long-term electrification of transport in Ireland.  We will continue to collaborate with stakeholders, the motoring community and EV drivers to provide charging infrastructure that enables the acceleration of our collective transition to cleaner, zero carbon transport.  <\/p><p> My colleague, Mr. John Byrne, who is the manager of ESB ecars, and I will be happy to address any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marguerite Sayers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Thank you very much for that very comprehensive statement.

My name is Damien &Oacute; Tuama.  I am the national cycling co-ordinator with Cyclist.ie, the Irish cycling advocacy network and with An Taisce, the National Trust for Ireland.  Cyclist.ie is part of the European Cyclists Federation, which advocates at a European level.<br\/><br\/>The discourse around e-mobility and electric vehicles in Ireland has been largely, if not exclusively, been dominated by e-cars.  What we hear much less about is the role of e-bikes, e-trikes and e-cycling in decarbonising transport.  This mirrors what has been happening internationally.  At COP26 in Glasgow a few weeks ago, there was a near-exclusive focus on electric cars and a total absence of debate on electric bicycles.  However, in the end the following text was included in the declaration signed by the Irish Government:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe recognise that alongside the shift to zero emission vehicles, a sustainable future for road transport will require wider system transformation, including support for active travel, public and shared transport, as well as addressing the full value chain impacts from vehicle production, use and disposal. <\/blockquote> <p>In thinking about mobility in Ireland, it is important to note that the highest proportion of trips nationally are between 1 km and 3 km, according to the most recent National Transport Authority, NTA, household travel survey.  In that context, I want to talk about how e-bikes can broaden the use of active travel.  E-bikes or electric assist bikes work by assisting the cyclist through a compact, onboard electric motor that enables them to cover longer distances than they would otherwise cycle.  This is particularly useful in countries where there are high-quality cycle routes like cycle superhighways.  E-bikes also make life much easier in hillier towns and cities.  Anyone who has cycled in Cork city, Kinsale, Enniskerry, Drogheda or other towns in Ireland will know that they make getting around much easier.  They have huge potential for parents bringing young children around.  In Copenhagen, there are approximately 40,000 cargo bikes, which are a much better use of finite city space than parents using cars, particularly bigger models of car.  In terms of cycle logistics in town and city centres, recent research by the European Commission shows that 25% of all goods and 50% of all light deliveries in urban settings could be serviced by cargo bikes.  There is enormous potential in this area and we are beginning to see the use of such vehicles by DHL in Dublin and other cities.  For the mobility impaired, electric assist cycles open up and even transform their independent mobility opportunities.  It can be difficult for some people to walk but easier for them to cycle, especially with electric assist.<br\/><br\/>E-bikes are not just about decarbonising transport.  They are very much at the heart of decongesting Irish towns, cities and villages, making them more economically vibrant.  They improve the liveability of towns because more space is opened up for businesses and public space.  Crucially, they improve public health through being active travel vehicles.  The user only gets the kick from the electric power when he or she pedals.  E-bikes use minimal resources compared to electric cars, which are certainly not zero carbon.  We need to think about and acknowledge the mining of the raw materials and rare earth elements in geopolitically turbulent parts of the world and the energy used in the manufacturing and disposal of electric cars.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of policy interventions which will assist in the transition we are seeking, the most important is the development of safe cycle routes in urban and rural areas.  This means dedicated cycle infrastructure and lower, safer speed limits.  As we do not expect people to cycle for 20 km or 30 km, for longer trips combining public transport with cycling or e-cycling has the greatest potential to help us to decarbonise transport in Ireland.  This raises questions around high quality, high capacity, safe and secure bicycle parking at every single public transport stop in the country.  We will also need e-charging points for e-bikes at all public buildings, in new apartment blocks and so on.<br\/><br\/>The SEAI currently issues grants for e-cars but we would like to see subsidies for e-bikes on a par with e-cars to support this transition.  There is a particularly interesting scheme in France under which old cars are scrapped and a grant is provided for the purchase of an e-bike, an e-cargo bike or public transport tickets.  There is great potential for such a scheme in Ireland.<\/p><p>In conclusion, worldwide, the transport sector is responsible for 24% of direct CO2 emissions from fuel combustion.  The vast majority of this is coming from cars, and these numbers are not decreasing.  We simply cannot afford to wait decades for fossil fuel cars and trucks to be fully replaced by EVs.  In any case, that solution that will not help solve other problems, such as traffic congestion and sedentary lifestyles.  I will finish with a quote from Frans Timmermanns, the executive Vice-President of the European Commission with special responsibility for leading the Commission's work on the European Green Deal.  At the Velo-city 2021 conference in Lisbon in September 2021, he stated that: \"The Bicycle is the most important instrument in meeting climate change targets.\"  I would extend his quotation be referring to the potential for e-bikes.  Our policies need to reflect that truth. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Damien &Oacute; Tuama","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. &Oacute; Tuama and invite Dr. Byrne to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#D00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank members for the opportunity to address the committee on this important issue.  I am a consultant geriatrician and general physician working with the frailty intervention team in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital.  I am here today representing Irish Doctors for Environment.  Irish Doctors for Environment is a non-governmental agency and registered charity comprising doctors, medical students and allied healthcare professionals in Ireland who aim to create awareness, interest, and implement action around environment health and the impact it has on our patients' health.<br\/><br\/>The climate crisis is a human health crisis and our future health as a species is inextricably linked to our planet's health.  We need to choose the best solutions that reduce emissions and improve our quality of life.  Electric cars and other vehicles are going to be an important part of the transition from internal combustion engines.  In the short term, many trips will, by necessity, have to be done by car and EVs will be important for these.  However, not every trip needs to be taken by car.  Just as someone would not use a combine harvester to pick the kids up from school, driving 1 km to the shop for milk is not the best use of a car when one could walk or cycle.  There are long-term health benefits to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through reductions in climate change effects, such as heatwaves, extreme weather, flooding and so on.  There are other shorter-term simultaneous benefits to reducing greenhouse gases.  The most obvious is a reduction in air pollution through a reduction in internal combustion engine vehicles.  Research that I have conducted into air pollution and stroke incidence in Ireland has demonstrated a correlation between traffic-produced air pollution and stroke admissions in this country.  Other researchers in Ireland have demonstrated similar effects on respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  These findings are in line with international studies that have demonstrated that there is no such thing as a safe level of air pollution.  Recent changes to WHO guidelines have reflected this reality.  <br\/><br\/>Cars have other effects on human health aside from just tailpipe emissions.  All cars, including electric-propelled cars, produce particulate matter from other sources such as tyre wear, brake pads and through dust agitation, for example.  Noise pollution is increasingly being recognised as a major health issue, with cardiovascular disease, stroke and dementia, among others, associated with it.Any noise above 55 dB can impact on human health, and all cars travelling at speed produce noise pollution through tyres rolling on roads.  There is little difference between internal combustion engine vehicles and EVs at speeds above 50 km\/h.<br\/><br\/>Another environmental health impact that is being increasingly recognised is the importance of green spaces, from impacts on activity and obesity to mental health benefits and stress reduction.  Trees and green spaces also help us to adapt to the effects of climate change by reducing flooding during periods of heavy rain and urban temperatures during heatwaves.  Car infrastructure obviously has a large impact on the available space in our cities and towns for green space.  Again, the use of electric cars does not reducing this impact.  Electric cars tend to be heavier than their equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles.  This has implications when it comes to road safety.  Heavier vehicles will have a greater impact in collisions, especially with vulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians, and will lead to lower survival rates in accidents.  Perhaps the largest impact of cars and other mechanically propelled vehicles is the impact on physical activity.A study recently published by <i>The Lancet <\/i>countdown on health and climate change calculated that by prioritising health in our climate plans, we have the opportunity to save 1.6 million lives due to cleaner air, and 2.1 million lives due to increased physical activity every year.  That is why climate change is such a pressing issue.  <br\/><br\/>Additionally, Ireland has an increasingly ageing population.  As a geriatrician, I know that while this can be perceived as being associated with an increase in frailty and physical dependence, it is not necessarily an inevitability.  Physical activity, in combination with a healthy diet, can help to reduce the likelihood of frailty and physical dependence in older age.  The benefits start accruing at a young age and can persist throughout life.  Therefore, the younger that people start being physically active, the better.  We know that physical activity that is integrated into our daily lives is more sustainable and persistent than having to set time aside in the day for physical activity.  With an ageing population, we will have a more robust population if we can integrate physical activity into our daily lives.  However, for multiple reasons, we live in a world that is hostile to this.Many of us live in one-off homes with no footpaths or cycle lanes that are accessible to us.  In our towns and cities, the car is king.  Pedestrians and cyclists are afterthoughts in design, in contradiction to national design manuals and best practice.  Cars are frequently parked on footpaths.  Our footpaths are in a poor state of repair and are often a trip hazard.  Many of our public benches have been removed, despite the fact that many older people need to stop regularly to rest.  These multiple microaggressions create an environment that is unappealing to be in for pedestrians or cyclists, especially if they are disabled.  <br\/><br\/>Cycling is great for our health.  One study from Denmark demonstrated a 40% reduction in mortality over 12 years in people who commuted by bike, as opposed to those who commuted on public transport.  Similarly, another Danish study has demonstrated an 8% increase in the concentration levels of children who cycle to school versus those that are driven.  Sometimes electric bikes can be seen as cheating.  However, studies have demonstrated that people will cycle further on e-bikes and often end up exerting themselves just as much as on a regular pedal bike, as they travel further and more frequently.<br\/><br\/>When we talk about EVs, we need to have a more open mind than electric cars, trucks or vans.  We need not just to replace internal combustion engine vehicles with EVs, but to reduce the number of cars on the road overall.  In 1990, there were 900,000 cars on the road; today there are 2.3 million.  Indeed, 1 million EVs alone will not, by themselves, bring us in line with our 2030 transport emission targets.  There needs to be a shift to alternative means of transport.  Electric bikes, trikes and cargo bikes will have a big impact on our transition away from  internal combustion engine vehicles.  Electric bikes can extend the cycling range of people, reduce the effort required to get up hills or carry heavy loads and extend the range of people who can cycle.  As a family, we have recently gone from a two- to one-car household.I was already cycling to Sallins station to get a train into Dublin for work.  Therefore, we found that my car was sitting on the driveway for most of the week.  We bought an electric cargo bike that has been revolutionary for our family.  We now use it to cycle to most places in Naas, to visit my wife's family, to go to the supermarket, the playground and so on.  My wife, who was not previously a regular cyclist, finds it easy to take out the bike and continues to cycle it, even though she is now in her third trimester with our second child.  Electric bikes increase the ability of people to cycle.  Additionally, in my work I have observed an increase in older patients who report cycling on e-bikes, even into their 80s.  For those with reduced mobility, there are e-trikes and even e-cargo trikes that can improve people's mobility more than walking alone.  <br\/><br\/>It is just a case of using the right tool for the job.  Someone would not cycle from south Kerry to Dublin for work on just an e-bike.  However, if he or she can combine cycling with bus or train transport, whole areas of the country become accessible without having to resort to driving.  Safe cycling routes not just in our towns and cities, but in our rural villages and countryside, are essential to enabling this vision.  Appropriate speed limits, quietways and greenways that link villages and towns are key infrastructure points.  For instance, despite being a confident cyclist, I would be hesitant to cycle out to my parents' house in a rural part of county Kildare, with my son in tow.<\/p><p>Roads need to be made safer for cyclists and pedestrians to enable a move back away from car transport.  There also needs to be safe, well-lit cycle parking at bus stops and train stations to ensure the infrastructure is both safe and seen to be safe to encourage people to use it.<\/p><p> Electric cars are part of the solution.  However, we have an opportunity to build back better as we try to get ourselves out of the many issues our society faces.  Climate change is an important issue that we face and addressing it can have co-benefits by reducing noise pollution, air pollution and physical inactivity, and can create a healthier and more resilient society.  It would be a shame to miss the boat and continue to embed the harmful effects of driving on our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Byrne for his opening statement.

The reality is that we need to move away more quickly and cannot leave it to future generations.  We need to move away from fossil-fuel-powered cars and towards EVs and bicycles.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Cooke for his presentation.  He talked about the target of having 1 million EVs by 2030.  Is that possible based on where manufacturers are at?  Is it possible in light of the supply difficulty with second-hand vehicles?  If the situation with the UK is to continue, should we consider a means-tested grant to make EVs more affordable based on people's income?  Buying a new electric vehicle is not feasible for families in certain income brackets who normally, either through life choices or lack of resources, would buy a second-hand car.  Should we provide a greater level of support to those families for a limited time to increase supply?  Mr. Cooke spoke about the benefit-in-kind which is helpful.  Should consideration be given to removing some of the increased cost for second-hand imports from the UK for a period until supply increases?  He spoke about extending the grants.  Are they adequate to reach that target?  <\/p> <p>  I thank Ms Sayers for her presentation.  The ESB is a wonderful company that has done so much in the development of infrastructure.  However, it has shown a lack of ambition in recent years.  I believe we should be much further on.  The ESB should have taken the bull by the horns much earlier.  I acknowledge she mentioned the &euro;10 million from the climate fund.  The reality is that the ESB is a very profitable company.  It is a semi-State company with a different charter from other private electricity supply companies.  She mentioned having invested &euro;80 million to date.  I am shocked at that; it should be ten times that.<\/p> <p>  We need to get people to adapt to the technology that is coming.  It is a chicken and egg situation.  Range anxiety is waning somewhat based on the cars.  However, I receive regular complaints from people who say the chargers are not working or not enough of them are available.  I would have liked to have seen the ESB go in heavy at the beginning.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to decarbonisation, the ESB has lacked ambition.  It is a separate area from where Ms Sayers is involved, but the ESB expects it to take ten years before moving out into the Atlantic Ocean for floating offshore wind energy when other countries are dealing with that right now.  I do not hear the company demanding changes in State policy to make that happen.  I may be putting too much on Ms Sayers's shoulders.  Based on how charging points are being rolled out, the ESB's ambition is considerably short of where it needs to be.  There may be very good reasons for that and I am sure she will highlight them for me.  This committee meeting offers her an opportunity to share with us why the ESB has not been able to do that.  If there are impediments from the State's side, I ask her to share those with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#E00300","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>The target for 2030 represents a massive challenge.  The Senator asked if it is possible.  I would say it is not impossible, but it is unlikely based on the current level of new car sales, which averages less than 120,000 a year, compared with 165,000 a year between 2001 and 2008.  We would need to see a significant increase in the new car market.  If we can create a new car market through incentives and through taxation systems that support an overall stronger new car market, we would have a much better chance of getting there.  We could also generate more revenue for the State.<\/p> <p>  We talk about the 1 million vehicles for 2030.  However, there are also 1 million vehicles that are over ten years old.  Those 1 million vehicles are only half the job; we have the other 1 million older vehicles.  We do not want to get to 2030 and find we have 1 million vehicles that are 16 or 17 years old.  It is only part of the job.  The target will be very challenging.  The more important target is the level of emissions we can take out.  As some of the other speakers have highlighted, we cannot put all our eggs in the EV basket.  Other elements such as cycling and e-bikes will also be important, as will public transport.  The target will be very difficult to achieve.<\/p> <p>  The overwhelming source of EVs in Ireland over the next five or six years will be the new car market.  A typical used import is between five and eight years old.  That supply of vehicles cannot be met from the UK or the other potential used car import markets.  That supply of vehicles will probably only arrive in any significant numbers towards the end of the decade.  If we were looking to free up the used car import market by putting in some sort of support, now is not the time.  It is something that could be reviewed further down the line.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned means-tested grants.  We need to get as many new EVs as possible on the road now.  The more we can do today, the less we will need to do in 2028, 2029 and 2030.  We need to create that active used car market.  The people we want to get into EVs now are people who may have a three- or four-year-old car and are changing.

However, we need to be realistic.  Someone who is driving a ten-year-old car does not have very much equity to trade in and so the level of that support would need to be very significant.  As with all supports, there is a limited pool of money to support the purchase of EVs.  The pool of money in the short term should be aimed at getting as many new EVs on the road now as possible.  That means that in three years, more people who buy three- or four-year-old cars will have a bigger selection, and in six years, people who buy six-year-old cars will have a bigger selection and so on.  In an ideal world, we would be very supportive of that.  The most important thing is to help the people who are about to buy a new car, on the back of having equity in a used car, to make a better decision.<\/p><p>In the context of the cost of change, &euro;5,000 is a lot of money.   Even if an EV costs &euro;40,000, the cost of changing in that context might be &euro;16,000 or &euro;17,000.  That is a lot of money and that can be a real game changer.  <\/p><p> The other important thing I must underline about incentives is that we are competing for a supply of cars.  There is a shortage of not only used cars in Ireland now but also of new cars.  There is a shortage of EVs overall and every market is competing for them.  We cannot get enough of them now, so the better the incentive package we have, the better will be the chance that Ireland will get more than its fair share of EVs in the short term.  Again, the more of these vehicles we can get today, the faster we can create that used car market in EVs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cooke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cooke.

I did, and do, consider &euro;80 million to be a significant amount of expenditure.  As will be appreciated, however, within the ESB, as within any company, there is competition for resources.  In addition, the ESB is playing a role right across the decarbonisation agenda.  That includes e-heat, where we have just started a retrofitting joint venture.  More particularly, our networks business connects all the renewable projects in the country that are helping to decarbonise our generation of energy.  We are also the owners of generating plants and that area also requires significant investment.<\/p> <p>  Speaking to profitability, then, typically it would be announced in a good year that the ESB had earned profits somewhere between &euro;400 million and &euro;600 million.  Equally, however, much of our annual investment goes on decarbonisation projects.  As I have outlined, we are spending &euro;1 billion in that area.  Therefore, I think a company spending that amount has a significant level of ambition.  We are trying to play our role right across all those emissions areas.  That includes 20% in transport, 20% in the electricity generation and 20% in heat.  When a company like ours is trying to play a role across all those areas and trying to do all the heavy lifting with the e-car infrastructure as well, as we have been doing for the past decade, that means we have limited resources and we must deploy them in a sensible way.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the e-cars network, we have been doing that and trying to keep pace with demand.  The Senator is not wrong to suggest that up to approximately two years ago we had many faulty chargers.  We were not then in a position to be able to replace or fix some of them because several of the original manufacturers had gone out of business and we could not get spare parts.  We are pleased now that we have been able to replace all those faulty chargers and increase the level of reliability.  Hopefully, that will mean that the Senator will not have the same volume of people coming into his office with complaints in future now that we have 98% reliability.  It is, though, something we will continue to monitor and to work on.  We are keen to continue to play our role in respect of helping the country to decarbonise in the various ways I mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Marguerite Sayers"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Dooley and Ms Sayers.

I ask him to speak to some of the supply issues and what the situation might look like from January to July next year regarding advanced purchases and orders.  Does he have an opinion concerning how the uptake of EVs in areas of high car dependency might be increased?  I presume many sales of EVs occur in the Dublin and greater Dublin area and many other urban areas around the country.  We have, though, and will continue to have, much higher car dependency in more rural areas as well, where we tend to see less of an uptake of EVs.

The economic outlook is good and suggests that it could support a new car market of close to 130,000 vehicles.  It will probably be less than 120,000 because of the supply issues, however.  The share of EVs will increase.  Regarding pure EVs, we might expect that segment of the market to account for between 13% and 15% of the market, which suggests that 15,000 EVs will be sold next year.  The semiconductor issue, however, may mean that we will have strong sales of cars with 222 number plates from July to December 2022.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the question of the second-hand market, if we succeed, and next year will be a challenge, then 2023, 2024 and 2025 will probably determine when we have an active second-hand market for EVs.  If we can do well in those years, then we can bring forward the date for the advent of an active second-hand market by several years.  I assume the other part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question referred to people in rural areas who have to travel longer distances, and whose major issue is range anxiety.  In that regard, newer EVs clearly have improved range.  Again, however, the other facet of range anxiety is the ability to charge.  In the context of charging in Ireland, though, I point out that not every country has the home charger grant support.  It is to the credit of the Government and the SEAI that we have that measure in place.  It is vital that support remains in place.

If we are serious about trying to transition away from the internal combustion engine, we need to look at the obvious supports.

I want to focus on cost and infrastructure, and a little on alternatives.  The first point, which others have made, is the disparity between the cost of an internal combustion engine vehicle at the starting point in the market and the entry level electric vehicle.  It is &euro;11,000 or &euro;12,000 for the cheapest internal combustion engine car, which is a Dacia.  It is probably not a good example because most of them are approximately &euro;15,000.  The starting price for an electric vehicle is approximately &euro;28,000, which includes the &euro;5,000 grant.  This is coupled with the fact that there is not a big enough second-hand market.  This question is directed at Mr. Cooke, unfortunately.  While the State is doing a fair bit of the lifting with regard to the provision of grants, the motor sector also needs to work on reducing prices, especially at entry level.  Some of the vehicles that I have referred to are small cars.  We are talking about the supermini class, or whatever it is called in the trade.  There is something that can be done to reduce overall costs.  For instance, in France, Germany and Austria, an EV can be bought for just over &euro;20,000.  I know that the witnesses will say that is due to taxation or such, but there are other measures relating to the costs being higher in this jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>  It is important to recognise what is being done by ESB for infrastructure, notwithstanding what Senator Dooley had to say, with which I kind of agree.  There are positive aspects to it.  The SEAI grant for home charging is welcome.  One area that we are still deficient in is the fact that our building regulations do not mandate new properties to have electric charging infrastructure included when the homes are sold.  That is an important part of the puzzle to support what Ms Sayers said with regard to 80% of charging taking place at home, with the network being provided really only being for a charging boost on the journey.  My questions are about what we can do to reduce the cost.  Is it purely taxation and do we need to look at that?  Would the industry support the building regulations being changed?  In recognition of the alternative means of travel, with the investment in public transport and personal light EVs, PLEVs, which are now being changed to personal powered transporters, PPTs, should the grants be extended to include the likes of cargo bikes?  It is an obvious deficiency in the existing State supports for bikes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#G00600","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I have to be very careful when I talk about price because I could get into trouble.  Taxation only plays a small part with the lowest-cost vehicles, but we are a smaller market, which affects costs of distribution, and manufacturers have their own costs.  EVs are more expensive to manufacture at the moment.  Much research and development has gone into them.  Most research and development expenditure in the industry goes into that.  I think they will come down in price.  I think that internal combustion engines will go up in price with the next EU regulations.  There are vehicles that are good value.  Many vehicle manufacturers offer low interest deals.  People can get into an EV at a relatively low monthly cost, especially if they go on a personal contract plan or some sort of finance deal.

This is based on information that we have from Bloomberg.

That is based on external advice to us.<\/p><p>I endorse what was said about infrastructure.  It is very important that in the future homes would have an e-car charger or at least the wiring in the house to allow that to happen very easily.  That would be a worthwhile step because it saves a lot of work afterwards if it is already mandated that such work would happen.  What we are finding is a lot of builders are also taking the initiative themselves because it is a point of sale.  Having an EV home charger makes a huge difference to the experience for an EV driver.

They have three types of car on their forecourts: diesel, petrol and EVs.

They want more electric vehicles than they can get at the moment.  If an electric vehicle is available for a customer, they will sell it to them.<\/p> <p>  It is very hard to know what can be done to bridge the gap.  At the moment there is Government support and that helps to bridge the gap.  There is a message for consumers, which is to look at the total cost of ownership.  The electricity costs much less than the fuel costs and the servicing costs are less for electric cars.  We need to get that message out on the total costs of ownership because there is a focus on the upfront price, the metal price of two comparable cars, whereas the running costs are less for EVs.  The SEAI does quite a good job on that at the moment.  Over the lifetime of the vehicle, the equation between the total cost of ownership between the two cars is starting to narrow.  For some people the upfront costs are the biggest challenge of all, so if you do not have the financial wherewithal to buy, you will not be able to benefit from the longer term savings.<\/p> <p>  Our members cannot get enough electric vehicles, both new and used, at the moment.

They are carrying out those trials in Dingle to make sure they can understand the impact of many people in one location charging EVs.  What will be important for all of us is that the signals are given to users - I am one - that we charge at night when there is effectively spare renewable generation that otherwise might be constrained off and might not be used.  That can be used now and helps to decarbonise.  It is, in effect, a way of storing renewable energy.  To give signals to people, especially if we have 1 million cars on the network, that they use night-time primarily to charge their cars and that they do so through home charging would be beneficial in terms of emissions within the country.  The ESB is already planning for the additional requirements for charging in various locations and it probably will require a level of network reinforcement.  It will be less reinforcement if that charging happens at night for all those good reasons because other loads will not be there at night in locations.  They are doing a lot of work and planning for that as it stands.<\/p> <p>  From our point of view, having the signals to move to night-time charging is beneficial in terms of emissions.

Before a second round, I might ask one or two questions.  A few years ago, I decided my next car would be an electric vehicle but they were too expensive, and there was certainly range anxiety.  I decided I would keep driving my internal combustion engine vehicle and I did so until it broke down.  The price of EVs had not come down, nor had the technology improved, and I decided to go without a car for a while.  I have not got the EV since then.  I have gone five years without a car.  I have been getting by quite well, by bike, by bus and by train.  In many respects, my life is much easier not having a car.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the point made by Dr. Byrne.  It is something I have noticed in my experience in recent years.  The space that electric vehicles are taking up, especially in urban areas, is quite concerning.  You only have to look to photographs of the streets of our towns, village and cities from the past to see that the vehicles before were much smaller.  There seems to be a trend where vehicles, particular electric vehicles, are physically quite big.  That is a considerable problem.  There are all kinds of consequences to that.  The value of space in our towns and cities is high and it is increasingly being taken up by vehicles and electric vehicles.  I would be interested to hear further from Dr. Byrne on this point but perhaps I could put a question to Mr. Cooke.  Would Mr. Cooke acknowledge this and, if so, will he advise on incentives to promote the uptake of smaller electric vehicles?  In other countries such as France and Italy that have old cities with narrow streets, it is perhaps more obvious that they need smaller electric vehicles.  Is Mr. Cooke aware of incentives?  Should we be looking at incentives in this country for physically smaller electric vehicles?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#J00600","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I am not aware of any specific incentives.

If there was an increased level of support at a lower level, that could possibly help.  If you look at the electric vehicles for sale - I am always loath to talk about specific cars and specific brands - Volkswagen has the ID3, Renault had the Zoe, Nissan has the Leaf, and Hyundai has the Kona.  There is a wide selection of smaller electric vehicles.  They are obviously not as expensive as the bigger ones.  Some of the larger ones do not get support.  Therefore, there is a strong suite of small electric vehicles out there.<\/p> <p>  A small car does not suit everybody but some people have one out of choice.  People with big families, etc., feel they need a bigger car, and if they want to go electric, they go for a bigger one.  However, there is a wide selection of small electric vehicles out there.<\/p> <p>  I will look into it.

It seems to me we are simply not appreciating the potential for electric bikes to cover those 5 km to 10 km journeys.  If we capture those journeys, or anything under 5 km, by bikes or e-bikes, then we are solving a lot of problems around transport.  Of course they will not cover the interurban journey or perhaps those rural-generated journeys, but a huge proportion of journeys could be transitioned across to e-bikes.

I do not have the figures to hand so I would need to send them in.  The general point is that the emissions savings arise when there is a switch from using a motor vehicle to using a bike or an electric bike.  The Nissan Leaf, for example, is 2,000 kg.  I do not know about anybody else but if you are hit with 2,000 kg, it is a significant mass.  I do not believe that this is a particularly small vehicle.  Consider the elegance of the bike weighing 20 kg moving an 80 kg person, as opposed to 2,000 kg moving an 80 kg person.  I once had a maths teacher who was all about finding the elegant solution.  For urban areas, moving people with minimally sized machines with minimal emissions is an elegant way to solve the problems.  I would be happy to dig out some up-to-date research figures on the emissions savings.

As I said in my statement, electric vehicles are heavier than their internal combustion engine counterparts.  When we look at those vehicles' impacts in accidents, especially on vulnerable road users, there is a danger there in switching directly over to electric vehicles.  Where families need bigger cars, unfortunately, a lot of the bigger cars are SUVs, and by design they are more dangerous again for vulnerable road users.  In impacts they are not as safe.  Maybe the industry needs to look at that and at the design of vehicles that are designed for families.  Many of them are being pushed into SUVs when they do not want to be using them.<\/p> <p>  There are also impacts with regard to the physical space that is used and taken up by cars such as when parking overnight in our towns and cities, and when it comes to charging with cables and so on. We see this in London where there are a lot more electric vehicles.  Cables are strewn across footpaths and block pedestrians, especially disabled pedestrians, from being able to walk around their locality.  This is an important consideration when looking at how these vehicles are going to be charged in an urban environment without impacting on vulnerable road users.<\/p> <p>  Another aspect to consider is that with climate change our population is going to increase.  We are probably going to have a migration of people into this country and our towns and cities will come under more strain.

There are bottlenecks around resources in local authorities and in having a sufficient number of engineers, planners and community liaison people, which is important also.

I missed many of the questions of committee members, so the witnesses can be certain that I will repeat some of them.  I will plough on.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Byrne commented in his opening statement on many of the negative aspects of a move towards 1 million EVs on the road.  His point was on reliance on EVs.  I think I am the most rural Deputy on the committee.  I am down in west Cork, which is a four-hour drive from Dublin.  I firmly believe in active travel and more frequent, better public transport.  Everyone can attest to the fact that I continually push for these but I believe that even if we introduce a concept such as a service in every village every hour, it will still leave many challenges.  I would like Dr. Byrne to comment on this.  While we want to move towards more active travel and public transport, surely EVs will play a greater role in places like west Cork, peninsular areas and other rural areas.  <\/p> <p>  If I am misdirecting my questions, I would not mind the help of the Chairman.  I believe my next one is for Mr. Cooke.  In the past few months, I have been able to visualise far more EVs on the road.  In only a few years, the majority of cars on the road will be electric.  I hope that in five, six or seven years, those EVs will be powered in people's houses and that, in Clonakilty, where I am from, they will be powered entirely from clean, renewable energy from floating offshore wind facilities.  I hope motorists will have no range anxiety when heading to Dublin from a place like Clonakilty.  The range of the cars is increasing all the time.  We are seeing more products on the market and more car manufacturers excelling in the EV space.  Am I way off the mark with that kind of vision?  Everyone present will have noticed that the number of EVs on the roads is increasing every week.  We have seen that in the percentages.  Is my vision a reality?  When will there be a critical mass that will make EVs more affordable and result in a variety of products with sufficient ranges, such that one's next car will be an EV?<\/p> <p>  The next question is for the ESB.  Much of the charging will be done from people's homes.  The battle to convince local authorities to install fast chargers in their space and public car parks is like coming up against a brick wall.  Clonakilty is a perfect example.  It has one fast charger.  It is a matter of getting to it first if one can, which is not good enough.  It is not an incentive.<\/p> <p>  I apologise if my questions have been touched on already but I was late for the call.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#L00600","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I do not believe anyone is saying people will have to use vehicles other than cars, especially in the short term.

It is such shorter journeys that we will focus on initially.  As people build up confidence in cycling, we can then focus on longer journeys.  I am referring to short trips to the shop.

Longer trips will still be made by car but the shorter trips may be by bike.  That is what we are saying.<\/p> <p>  We also need to examine our planning decisions.  We must ask what long-term car usage are we embedding by building a lot of one-off houses in the country.  This embeds car use.  When one hops in the car, one is less likely to go to the local shop.  One might go to the bigger town to one of the multiples instead of the local shop, butcher or post office.  If we are to regenerate local villages and towns, we need to make planning decisions that will have people congregate in them.  We can put in the infrastructure so that shops, post offices and schools will not have to shut down and so that we will not have to embed car use.  We would be able to do many more of our daily activities by active travel rather than driving everywhere.  Not everyone can drive.  A teenager cannot drive.  I grew up in rural County Kildare, which is not quite west Cork, and relied on my parents to drive me everywhere.  It is quite isolating to have to rely on that form of transport.

A major shift in transportation over the past two decades and in society is the greater use of digital technology.  Once upon a time, traffic engineers and transport planners thought about travel time as dead time.  That is definitely not the case if people are using public transport and have Wi-Fi.

Like Deputy O'Sullivan, I was also in the Chamber, so I missed the first section and the opening statements.  I have some questions.  I apologise if they repeat my colleagues' questions.  This question is probably specifically for the Society of the Irish Motor Industry.  Regarding the electronic vehicles and the supply chain, what level of supply is there for second-hand or used electric vehicles?  Is there a good supply chain into Ireland given Brexit and all the challenges it has posed to the economy and to the country?<\/p> <p>  My second question is about the need for more electric charging points, whether at garages or on street.  The witnesses mentioned that some local authorities are better than others.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is good and proactive.  Maybe this is more a question for ESB.  I am thinking about public lighting doubling as a charging point.  I am sure there is an additional cost to such infrastructure but it is about being imaginative in our public spaces to transform the available charging points automatically and quite easily.  One of people's biggest causes for hesitation when buying electric vehicles is whether charging points will be available on their journey.  Documentaries often show charging points in garages being in use when people pull up, which delays their journey.  It is all about efficiency.  The witnesses might address what can be improved about the infrastructure for charging points, both from a local authority and an industry point of view.<\/p> <p>  My third question is on car and bike-sharing schemes.  One regression in Dublin was when four local authorities all had individual tenders for a shared bike scheme.  There is no uniformity for car-sharing schemes either.  There might be one car-sharing scheme in one local authority in the greater Dublin area compared with another local authority.  It is not so bad for cars but it is problematic for bike-sharing schemes.  I thought it would have been better to have an all-of-Dublin contract, like the bike scheme to which Dr. &Oacute; Tuama and others referred, across all the Dublin local authorities to ensure there was uniformity and ease of use to encourage people to use them for whatever reason, whether it is because they do not have storage for bikes or it is more convenient for them.  Those are my questions.

It is not only Brexit that is impacting on the supply of cars to Ireland.  It is also the fact there is a shortage of used cars there, so it needs to feed its own market.  The only way we will have a significant number of used vehicles is to grow our own, by having cars newly registered in Ireland that will become used in three or four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cooke"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Is there hesitation from customers to buy second-hand electric vehicles?

One of the things that was causing much frustration for our users was people driving up to a charging point to park for a day, and then nobody else could use it.  With the approval, and almost the insistence, of many of our network users, we now have an overstay charge.  It encourages fair use of the network, so somebody can drive to a charger and get as much charge as they need to move to the next stage of their journey, but they are penalised if they stay for too long.<\/p><p>That is something most EV drivers endorse because it allows for fair access to the network.

No more than ourselves, there is a huge draw on their resources and they must decide what best they can do at any point in time.

My colleague, Mr. Byrne, might make some additional comments in case I have left out any pertinent point.<\/p><p> Regarding charging from public lighting, it is a way of charging if there is no other way of doing so.  I say that because when those lights were installed, there was fairly light cabling in between the lights because they were only taking the load or current required for lighting.  In the absence of anything else, they will give a charge if motorists adapt the pillar to do that, but there are faster means of charging.  They are a great alternative when there is nothing else but if something else, including a home charger, is available, it is likely to be faster.<\/p><p> I will hand over to Mr Byrne now in case I have left out anything on any of the points raised.

People may not necessarily want to buy a depreciating asset that is sitting on their driveway for a large chunk of the day, but they certainly want to be able to drive some of their journeys.  We hope that is what the future is going to involve, namely, public transport for longer trips and shared mobility, whether of car, bicycle or e-bike, for the other trips.

What is being done to encourage the owners of commercial vehicles, including taxis and lorries, to switch to EVs?  I am interested to know what the engagement has been with the commercial side of the sector.<\/p> <p>  I have another question that might be more suitably addressed to the representatives from the ESB.  I only encountered this issue recently.  For people living in an apartment block or housing that does not have a private laneway, there is no way to install an electric vehicle charging point.  Thousands of people in apartments will not be able to avail of an EV unless their management company has decided to put a charging point or two within the development, which is not the case everywhere, and it is a free-for-all to access them.  What is best practice elsewhere on the Continent in terms of providing electric vehicle charging points for people living in apartment blocks or who do not have a private driveway on which one can be installed?  What is the solution for those people and what do we need to start doing to make sure they can avail of electric vehicles?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#N00400","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Regarding measures that can be taken to create a second-hand market, what we have in place is very significant.  We need to give some certainty to the industry that the grants will be extended for a few years.  The only way to create a used car market, as I said, is to have a strong new car market today.  The more we can sell today, the more quickly we will be able to create that used car market.  We have incentives in place and they need to be extended.  The company car sector is an obvious one to target because such cars tend to come back onto the market within two or three years.  The benefit-in-kind incentive has started to reduce, which means someone who buys a car next year will not get as much benefit in the following two years.  I mentioned the Government fleets.  It is encouraging that the Government has committed to go electric on the next vehicle change.  If those vehicles are changed every couple of years, the cost to the State would not be huge and it would provide good-quality used vehicles to the market.<\/p> <p>  In terms of investment, it is hard to put numbers on it.  The vehicle manufacture sector at European level is putting billions into the vehicles, including research and development.  At a local level, particularly in the franchise dealer sector, a lot of money has already been put into it.  We have some dealers who installed electric substations in advance of electric vehicles coming to their premises.  In the case of new dealership premises, the service areas are huge and very well equipped.  We could be talking about hundreds of thousands of euro of investment by some dealerships.  Even at the independent level, there is a huge demand for equipment and training to upskill people to deal with hybrid and electric technologies.  Many of them have not yet seen an electric vehicle in their workshop but they are putting in that investment now.  We provide that upskilling training for them and Skillnet Ireland gives us very good support to do it and offers value for money.  Investment is going on at all levels.<\/p> <p>  The commercial vehicles sector is behind the car sector.  The vehicles are bigger and need larger, more powerful batteries.  When the battery technology improves in the second half of the decade and the batteries in cars get smaller, we will see more vans going electric.  The State has a very generous scheme for taxis, which I understand is oversubscribed this year.  It offers up to &euro;11,000 and is a significant scheme.  The State has really stepped up to the mark and there is a commitment to give money to the scheme again next year.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned electrification of buses.  We are already seeing hybrid buses and we will start to see some electric ones.  Over the next decade, we may be having the debate about hydrogen technology, which offers zero emissions, especially for heavy goods vehicles and buses.  There is investment right across the industry and from Government.  There is a real appetite for this from all the stakeholders.  The ESB's e-cars initiative has also been very supportive of this project, which has very much helped to sell it in our sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cooke"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Before my question about charging points for apartment spaces, does the Chairman mind if I ask one other quick question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#O00100","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Go ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#O00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>This question is directed towards Dr. &Oacute; Tuama or Dr. Byrne.

The big advantage is that it is enabling older people in particular to extend their cycling lives and enabling people to cycle longer distances and cycle in hillier places.  The advantages are multiple.  The bike-to-work scheme currently has a limit of &euro;1,500 for the value that can be written off against tax.  For a good electric cargo bike, we are probably talking closer to &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000, so it would be worthwhile taking a close look at those figures.<\/p> <p>  As I said earlier in the discussion, it is about the creation of safe cycling routes, both in urban areas and rural areas, the reallocation of road space, the design of high-quality junctions and pre-green signals for cyclists at those junctions.  It is about the creation of a safe environment for people of all ages and abilities, including children and women, who are the missing demographic in cycling in Ireland at the moment.  It is really the creation of the conditions where people feel safe to jump on the bike, and that is the No. 1 thing.<\/p> <p>  The other point I was making is around intermodal trips through creating high-quality, high-capacity cycle parking facilities at all bus and train stations.

Some people are very frustrated, including members of my own family, who say it is preventing them from adopting an EV.  My understanding is that the problem has been solved for future apartment blocks that are being built because it is now a part of the regulations for multi-residential units to have to include a level of charging.  In the meantime, there are a number of solutions.  We are largely reliant on the management companies to install a number of charge points, as the Senator indicated, and there would have to be some scheme among the residents to ensure these are shared adequately.<\/p> <p>  As to best practice, what I have come across in dense city locations is that when somebody buys an apartment now, the shared ownership of an EV comes with that apartment, so they would already have the infrastructure in the building, they already have a number of vehicles and they book the vehicles.  It is a mixture of timeshare and shared ownership, along with electric vehicles.<\/p> <p>  The other option for people as we are installing these high-powered chargers, or even the 50 kW chargers, is in regard to the additional range.  Given the distances are quite short within urban areas, which is where most of our apartment blocks tend to be, if people do travel and they decide not to use the bicycle and they use a car, they could possibly do with charging once a week or once a fortnight at some of our infrastructure or one of the other networks that is out there.  When people are sitting in traffic, the beauty of an EV is that it is not emitting anything and it is not losing battery power unless it is moving, so they are very useful within traffic.  It could be that people could use public infrastructure and, with 400 km of range, only need to charge it once a week or once a fortnight.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of things.  It is not an ideal situation and in some cases it will go back to that need to have charging based on the public lighting system or using lighting columns.

When the witnesses were answering questions, I found that piece of research from the UK on carbon emissions.  It is peer-reviewed research that says that if there is a very significant transition to e-bikes in the UK, it can halve its transport emissions, which is staggering.  We need to look at the potential here as well because, at this point, we do not quite know how we are going to get to the 50% reduction in emissions in the transport sector by 2030.  The EVs obviously play a role, public transport plays a role and active transport pays a role, but if we do all the sums around this, it does not add up to the 50%.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask Dr. &Oacute; Tuama about infrastructure.  He made a very clear and good point about the importance of coherent and cohesive networks if we really want to see the uptake of cycling, walking and e-bikes as well.  Will he comment on the need for quick interim infrastructure?  Much of what we are seeing in planning is infrastructure that will take a few years to develop and the process is quite unwieldy, with multiple stages of consultation, and the cost of this kind of infrastructure is very high.  However, during the Covid pandemic, we saw the roll-out of interim infrastructure right across the country, in our towns and cities in particular, and we could see how effective it was.  Perhaps Dr. &Oacute; Tuama could comment on that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the experimental traffic schemes that are mooted, I know the Minister has talked about amending the miscellaneous provisions Bill to allow for experimental traffic orders of the kind they have in the UK.<\/p><p>I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that, in addition to the big question of reallocation of road space.<\/p><p> I will go through a few questions and then bring the witnesses in.

If he has anything he can send to us, we can certainly seek to include it in our report because it is very important.<\/p><p> Dr. Byrne also touched on the risks around larger vehicles and SUVs, the height of these vehicles and the fact their drivers do not have the same scope of vision.  These cars may be safe for the people in them but are much less safe for those who are not.

Following the pandemic, it has been said the future of mobility is not what it used to be.  There has been a rapid change in thinking about mobility over the past two years, not just in Ireland but across all European cities.  There has been an acceleration in the provision of wider footpaths and cycle lanes because people have been reluctant to take public transport.  The pandemic has also accelerated the process of building cycle networks.<\/p> <p>  The greater Dublin area cycle network plan was published in 2013 but the pace of its implementation has been glacial at times.  It has been very slow but the introduction of some of the quick-to-build cycle facilities has encouraged engineers to adopt a more experimental approach to trying out schemes.  This is what the Dutch have been doing since the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  There was a reluctance among Irish local authorities to try out different schemes.  We have had a wonderful opportunity to try out different schemes, do before and after monitoring and assess where they improve facilities and where the weaknesses are, which has been a very positive part, if one can say that, of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  If we are trying to nurture a shift in travel patterns, we need coherent, cohesive and high-quality networks.  I mentioned earlier that very few women are cycling.  They are approximately 25% of commuters who cycle, as per the census data.  In the previous census, just 693 secondary school girls nationally were cycling to school in 2016, which is a shocking figure.  When I was in secondary school, almost 20,000 secondary school girls were cycling to school.  A large part of it is due to a deterioration in road conditions arising from more motorised traffic, less quality space for people on bikes, bigger vehicles, higher speeds and a scary traffic environment.<\/p> <p>  The way we will transform our culture is by creating high-quality cycle networks in each of our five cities, in addition to our towns and rural areas, with signed cycle routes along Rothar roads, which are quieter and have lighter traffic.  Electric vehicles certainly have a role, but we need to pay serious attention to the slow mode because it is win-win for everyone.

It is all at the trial stage so I feel having a concrete system is something that will happen in the future rather than at present.  We will continue to investigate and do trials.

It is for Ms Sayers.  In Fingal, north Dublin, the council and a third-party electricity supplier, which I believe is German, is trialling lamppost charging.  I have used it.  It was quite effective, although a little slower than the ESB's facility, which is across the street from the lamppost I used.  Given the infrastructure that the ESB owns and the light standards owned by local authorities around the country, is this a matter that the ESB has looked into?  On the basis of my experience, parking spaces that have EV facilities are not necessarily in the centres of towns but in and around them.  They are mostly on the periphery.  Considering the growing numbers in communities such as Malahide, which has a population of 25,000 in close proximity, and the higher socio-economic income thresholds, there are many more electric vehicles.  Therefore, two public charging spaces is not enough.

I am glad he mentioned the bicycle festival in Clonakilty and the Bike Circus.  Those concerned comprise an extraordinary group.  Not only are they promoting cycling, but they are also promoting getting more use and a longer life out of bicycles.  For a long time now, the group has been advocating safer cycling routes in and around Clonakilty.  This comes back to the rural nature of the town.  Some of its best amenities and attractions are perhaps 3 km, 4 km or 5 km from the centre.  Unfortunately, the only way to get them safely is by car because you are genuinely taking your life into your hands on a bike.  The group has been wonderful in trying to advocate additional cycling routes and signage.  In many instances, they have been successful in getting extra signage to promote safe driving to give cyclists space.<\/p> <p>  Let me refer to one of the main challenges, which many Deputies and Senators at this meeting will have experienced.  We are seeing a fantastic investment in active travel.  A figure of &euro;360 million was referred to.  In some urban areas, this has translated into cycling routes and cycling lanes, but we are not seeing these to the same extent in rural areas.  For me, a huge stumbling block is that local authorities are willing to back or invest in a project only when it gets to a shovel-ready stage.  There is a big problem in this country getting projects to shovel-ready stage, mainly because local authorities are very slow to go near any project that involves a compulsory purchase order, a right of way or some type of access.  They generally run a mile from it.  I have experienced this at first hand.  With the group Dr. O'Tuama mentioned and others, we are trying to promote, and get local authorities to back, the cycling routes we have identified, but they will not go near them.  Has Dr. O'Tuama any suggestions on how to get around that or international examples of where people got around the issue of NIMBYism?  People may not want to see additional cyclists passing their front door.  There is an issue in this regard that is slowing down progress.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to EVs and the ESB's electric car division.  I will read the delegates' opening statements as soon as I get a chance.  They may have touched on this subject already.  What is the relationship with local authorities?  Where a local authority owns the large car parks within a town but there is no sufficient provision of fast chargers, what is the process from the local authority's point of view?  If an approach is made to a local authority by a group or a councillor to have fast chargers installed in a public car park, what is the process and where is the relationship?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#Q01000","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>It is a tough question.  I have cycled from Clonakilty to Inchydoney beach.  I am aware of groups in Bandon, Skibbereen and Kinsale that are also looking for safe cycling routes.  Building up community support for them is important.  Consider the example of the Waterford&ndash;Dungarvan greenway.  Kilmacthomas, which is on the route, has benefited greatly from all the additional visitors owing to coffee shops, pubs, bike shops, restaurants and local attractions.  The local community needs to see the benefit of having good-quality routes.  Maybe the main benefit for locals is not having to drive children to school.  A child should be able to cycle to school by himself or herself.  There needs to be a little bit of selfish interest.  Maybe it is about freeing up people's time by not requiring them to drive children to school.  I do not know what the local school bus situation is in Clonakilty.

However, I would agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s earlier statements that some of them are further along the journey than others.  In regard to the approaches, they come in many guises.  Some are more formal and under direction, and some are less formal and come through councillors or town engineers.<\/p> <p>  In terms of assessing their viability, there are a number of key criteria or pillar criteria we look at.  One is the available space in the area that is being proposed.  A second is the traffic volumes and whether they will support additional charging infrastructure and whether that is actually required.  We also look at local population densities and EV ownership rates in that area.  Clonakilty would be a prime example, as well as other towns like Dingle, Lahinch, Clifden and big towns along the Wild Atlantic Way that attract quite an amount of tourism, so that would certainly be a factor in our deliberations.  Ultimately, the last two would be grid capacity at the location and consent.  In that format, while the local authorities would not have concerns over the longevity of the infrastructure, it is important to note that once the charger goes in, there are revenue and maintenance implications.  They recognise they are sometimes not the best placed entity to undertake that and it is handed over to us, by agreement.  As Ms Sayers said, that is quite prevalent in the UK, where they package large quantities of chargers together and run them in a competitive tendering or procurement environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#R00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Where they are looking for a fast charger in a public car park, that first step would come from the area engineers in the local authority, who would identify where it may be suitable and then assess it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021113000002#R01000","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Yes, that is typically the way it goes.

There is a lot more research and thinking happening in the development of active travel now than there was 20 years ago, so it is positive in that sense.  Mobility is changing all around Europe.  Transport emissions have been growing incredibly quickly in Ireland since 1990 and it is simply unsustainable.  The future of mobility has to be different.  It is going to be partly electric and partly shared.  It is going to involve much better public transport, but is also going to be active.<\/p> <p>  It is about de-siloing public health from mobility.  Traditionally, they were very different spheres.

We need to start thinking in a more integrated way about the future of moving and public health.  I would strongly endorse the points made by Dr. Byrne in his contributions.  We need to imagine a future where moving around is not creating all of these negative externalities, which are very difficult, wicked problems to solve.  Instead, when we are moving, we should be adding to society, adding to the environment and adding to our public health.  We need to change radically how we think about mobility.

I am delighted to address the joint committee today.  My ESRI colleague, Dr. Selina McCoy, and I made a submission to the committee on leaving certificate reform, drawing on a large body of research conducted at the ESRI over recent years.  I will highlight a number of key issues from that submission.<\/p> <p>  Much of the discussion of senior cycle has centred on the leaving certificate established, LCE, programme so I will focus my remarks on this programme.  While some LCE subjects have non-exam assessment components, such as orals and project work, exam-based assessment retains a dominant role and exam results are very high stakes in determining entry to higher education and influencing employment access.<\/p><p>Our research shows that this exam-based assessment has a significant negative effect on the nature of teaching and learning, on the skills acquired by young people and on their overall well-being.<\/p><p> Preparation for the leaving certificate exams means that classes in fifth and sixth year are often characterised by teacher-led instruction, with a strong emphasis on regular homework and exam paper practice.  In in-depth interviews, students have contrasted their classroom experiences in senior cycle, where they feel under pressure to cover the course, with that in junior cycle, where they enjoyed more time and space to engage in a variety of approaches to learning and to have more interactive classes.  The exam-focused approach is seen by students, parents and teachers as leading to rote learning, with a focus on memorising material at the expense of authentic understanding and a neglect of the development and assessment of broader skills.  Exam marking schemes have become a key driver of student engagement in exam preparation.<\/p><p> In Ireland, as elsewhere, we have found that students tend to value hands-on and interactive classes in which they have active involvement.  By sixth year, however, many students, particularly those with more ambitious career plans, are critical of teachers who do not focus on what will come up in the exam.  For them, good teaching becomes focusing precisely on the kinds of knowledge and skills needed to do well in the exam.  Thus, an emphasis on broader educational development or on life skills comes to be seen as irrelevant.  Indeed, some of these students negatively contrast approaches to teaching at school with the more narrowly focused approach to exam preparation that they have experienced in private tuition or grinds.<\/p><p> All of this has a significant effect on student well-being.  Levels of stress tend to escalate in sixth year with students finding their schoolwork even more difficult than previously.  Many students, especially female students, report feelings of strain and loss of confidence in sixth year.  For example, more than half of female sixth year students reported feeling constantly under strain more or much more than usual in January and February of their exam years.  As a result of this pressure, many students curtail extracurricular and social activities in sixth year, further exacerbating the hothouse climate of exam preparation.<\/p><p> Rates of school completion are now high, with the vast majority of young people in Ireland completing senior cycle, which is a success story.  As a result, the composition of the student population is more diverse than previously.  In a consultation with stakeholders, students and their parents pointed to the neglect of vocational and practical subjects within the current curriculum.  Senior cycle was seen as better suited to those with an academic orientation and with the ability to memorise material, with a neglect of those with more vocational interests and those with special educational needs, SEN.  The introduction of level 1 and 2 programmes at junior cycle has provided new routes to recognition for young people with SEN.  However, there is no comparable programme at senior cycle, which suggests a need to develop new programmes that build upon the skills developed at levels 1 and 2.<\/p><p> Young people report that the current leaving certificate model does not prepare them well for life after school.  The movement from a more teacher-directed approach to a greater focus on independent learning and a broader variety of assessment methods in further and higher education contribute to student difficulties in adapting to post-school education.  In addition, a significant proportion of young people do not see their education as helpful in preparing them for the world of work or for adult life.  At present, student access to work experience depends on which senior cycle programme they take.  In a consultation, there was a strong consensus among students and parents that all young people should be provided with an opportunity to take part in at least one work experience placement.  There was also a strong consensus that senior cycle should embed life skills in the curriculum to better prepare young people for further and higher education, employment and adult life.<\/p><p> Research findings suggest that the current leaving certificate assessment model has a negative impact on teaching and learning, narrowing the focus to covering the course and preparing for what will come up in the exam, rather than engaging in promoting critical thinking and broader skill development.

I am delighted to be here to contribute to the discussions.  Science Foundation Ireland's education and public engagement connect the Irish public with STEM, science, technology, engineering and maths, which will be my focus.  We also aim to inspire young people&rsquo;s confidence and aspirations to pursue skills development and career choices in the STEM fields.  It has been clear over the last 18 months more than ever that we need scientists, engineers and a public that can have a meaningful input into how research shapes our society.  We want to smash the stereotypes which might tell our young people that STEM is not for them.<\/p> <p>  The 21st-century workplace will be a fast-evolving environment.  Knowledge and specialist expertise will continue to be critical, but even more important will be the ability to apply that knowledge and expertise in previously unimagined ways.  Therefore, the new senior cycle must encompass a programme of learning that enables students to develop skills and knowledge needed to address future challenges.  They need to be equipped with the ability to solve complex problems by nurturing creative thinking and innovation.  Students entering the workforce will benefit from having good communication and interpersonal skills and the ability to work as part of a diverse team and will be personally effective.  Ultimately, we need to create students who will be lifelong learners. <\/p> <p>   SFI, through its programmes, engages in supporting all stages of our STEM talent and skills pipeline, from the early years in primary schools, through the discover primary science and maths programme, through to smart futures programme for career advice in secondary school, and on to fourth level through master's degrees and PhDs.  In fact, we engage the entire country in a discussion about STEM during Science Week in November, which reaches over 250,000 people.<\/p> <p>  Our annual discover programme is assessed by international peer review and supports between 30 and 40 projects a year with an investment of approximately &euro;4 million.  These projects cover a diverse range of interventions, for example, coding, supporting profession development for teachers, activities for transition year students and, importantly, research projects examining why, for example, girls might be less likely to select physics as a subject choice.  Our programmes are targeted towards a wide diversity of audiences, including the Traveller community, children and parents in direct provision and students on the autistic spectrum.  Projects that we fund promote a more active form of learning and the use of a range of authentic assessment strategies.  <\/p> <p>  At the core of our actions is the focus on building STEM learning throughout a life, what we term STEM capital, or all of the access to scientific and technological aspects throughout a person's life.  We recognise that young people must be able to apply their creativity in real-life situations.  Participation in informal STEM education projects such as CanSat, SciFest and the BT Young Scientist offer these opportunities and we would welcome recognition for participating in projects like those as part of any future leaving certificate assessment process.<\/p> <p>  Helping our learners to work in this way requires our teachers to have sufficient pedagogical content knowledge and expertise in assessment so that they can design and enact high-quality learning experiences and use innovative approaches to support both formative and summative assessment approaches.  Teachers require ongoing support to transform their professional practices so that learners are more actively engaged in their own learning and ensuring they are ready for the world of work and a society where lifelong learning is now a key competence.  We would welcome the formal accreditation of teacher training and teacher professional development offered by SFI and other organisations to ensure a high standard and act as a teacher incentive.<\/p> <p>  Building on those approaches, we welcome projects such as the assessment of transversal skills in STEM, led by DCU, which highlights the use of appropriate tools, digital resources and innovation in both the curriculum and assessment, so we have a more integrated and active approach to STEM teaching and learning.  Digital technologies have the potential to transform teaching and learning in new ways.  Many schools now want to capitalise on the efforts made by their teachers during the pandemic and on the new knowledge they have acquired to support different practices.<\/p><p>We also support the development of digital skills and digital technologies that can contribute to future resilience while ensuring that such developments are inclusive and remain focused on bridging the digital divide.  We worked on the STEM education policy statement, which identifies the reforms under way in the Irish education system, and we would very much support those.  We recognise that young people require more than the ability to memorise facts and procedures.<\/p><p> Many governments have already begun implementing fundamental changes to their education systems as part of reimagining how they organise teaching, learning and assessment to better meet the needs of society in the 21st century.  Those countries are now in the process of moving away from an over-reliance on teachers preparing students for this high-stakes summative assessment to a different way of education that is focused on cultivating engaged, connected global citizens.  SFI has funded many initiatives which could be mainstreamed into the education system and which could help to bring Ireland on the same journey.<\/p><p> I strongly believe that we need our education system and broader society to recognise different types of learners, different ways of thinking and to consider the different skills and expertise that contribute to a functioning society.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that we educate now in a way that will enable us to build a sustainable, inclusive and just society in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ruth Freeman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Freeman for that.

I am a policy executive at IBEC, Ireland&rsquo;s largest business and employer representative and lobbying group.<\/p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s education system has played a significant role in the economic transformation of our country during the past four decades.  As we move to a future of work defined by the rapid adoption of new technologies, digitalisation and increasing globalisation, the education system is being called upon again to renew itself and innovate in several fundamental ways in order to meet major socioeconomic challenges.  Responding to the future of work will require creativity, problem solving, digital literacy and communication skills, coupled with an appetite for continuous learning.  We need an education system that values inclusion and focuses on formative learning, with multiple assessment modes and progression pathways, and that places a high value on experiential learning.<\/p> <p>  While our submission committee contains greater detail on IBEC&rsquo;s recommendations for the reform of the leaving certificate, today I will share some of our key messages.  Higher order skills must be embedded across all subject curricula in the leaving certificate to prepare students for active citizenship and the future of work.  Moving from a content-based to skills-based learning model at an early stage is more likely to equip students with the skills to become better prepared to engage in the future of work and to tackle grand challenges such as climate change.  From a business perspective, our education system must develop learners who have the capacity to adapt quickly, work successfully in a team, cope with ambiguity and continue to learn and be curious.  The reformed leaving certificate needs to develop skills such as logical and analytical reasoning, problem solving and intellectual curiosity, effective communication skills, teamwork skills, capacities to identify and manage knowledge and information, and personal attributes around imagination, creativity and intellectual rigour.<\/p> <p>  The reformed leaving certificate needs to support learners in developing their digital literacy and provide greater opportunities to engage in STEM and digital learning.  Our experience with Covid has demonstrated the value and importance of digitally enhanced learning both at home and in the classroom.  However, it has also brought into stark relief the digital divide that exists between schools across Ireland.  All students need the opportunity to develop the mixture of digital and complementary soft skills necessary to fully engage in an increasingly digitalised society and the future of work.  This requires bridging the divide between schools in relation to access to technology, broadband connectivity and technical assistance.<\/p> <p>  The leaving certificate process should use a wide variety of sources to provide evidence of learning.  The dominance of the points race poses a challenge in providing an integrated education experience for students.  The student experience is concentrated on rote learning at the expense of developing higher order skills and autonomous learning skills.  Reformed and modern assessment methods should focus less exclusively on final examinations and expand opportunities for continuous assessment such as teacher assessment, portfolios of achievement and learning journals.  This will better capture the broader experience of learning and help to develop a strong relationship with lifelong learning.<\/p> <p>  Appropriate resources must be made available to facilitate curriculum development and teacher development to underpin future leaving certificate reform.   Teacher quality and professional development should be acknowledged as the most important factor influencing senior cycle review and reform and teachers must be empowered for change through professional development and other supports.<\/p><p>Junior cycle education principles should be extended to the leaving certificate.  The senior cycle should recognise all talents and abilities and support all students towards fulfilling their potential, including by providing a wider range of options for learning pathways at senior cycle.  There is significant opportunity to introduce new learning pathways such as apprenticeships and further education and training, FET, courses into the senior cycle programme.  The new junior cycle curriculum offers a template for enhanced flexibility in programme design that places the learner at the centre, including opportunities for short courses.  This approach should be extended to senior cycle to ensure continued flexibility within the system and to support students of all abilities and talents.<\/p><p> We are living through a period of rapid transformation and disruption, but also great opportunity.  The availability of talent, skills and people remains a top priority for Irish business and requires a strong emphasis on building a sustained lifelong culture of learning.  Flexibility, resilience and an appetite for learning must be ingrained in what we teach and how we teach it to help people and businesses take advantage of the opportunities that will present themselves.  I thank members of the joint committee for the opportunity to present IBEC's views on this important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Meadhbh Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>ISME thanks the committee for the opportunity to make a submission on this matter.  Regarding the issues raised on the consultation on assessment, while the leaving certificate has come in for legitimate criticism for the rote learning issue over the years, its fairness, objectivity, reliability and consistency were not in doubt.  The significant difficulties caused by obvious grade inflation in the accredited grades system in 2020 and 2021 have demonstrated the failures of adopting an <i>ad hoc <\/i>approach to continuous assessment.  This has damaged the credibility of our education system as a whole.<br\/><br\/>On key subject areas, Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, rankings now include a focus on digital literacy.  However, ISME and our members have noted basic failings among graduate-level recruits in accomplishing relatively simple tasks, such as formulating a cogent paragraph of text on a business-related topic free of spelling or grammatical errors.<br\/><br\/>We are not aware of specific issues around access and equality.  However, we have had anecdotal representations made to us about the quality of teaching available in certain schools and areas such as STEM and European languages.<br\/><br\/>On higher and further education requirements, our determination to open ever more universities at the expense of education in technical disciplines is worrying.  Annual surveys of the best third level institutions in the world consistently show three technology institutions in the top ten, with Massachusetts Institute of Technology in first place for the last five years.  While accepting that university status confers additional cachet on any educational institution, it is essential, bearing in mind Ireland&rsquo;s relative attractiveness to foreign multinational companies, that we continually strive for excellence in technical education.<br\/><br\/>We have a significant density of high-tech foreign multinational employers here and a diminishing ability to supply them with suitably qualified labour.  Conversely, a study by the IZA Institute of Labour Economics concluded that Ireland had the highest rate of overeducation among employees in Europe.  Overeducation was defined as &quot;the proportion of employees in employment whose... level of schooling lies one level or more above the occupational mode.&quot;  At the same time, the OECD economic survey of Ireland in 2020 found that measured literacy skills of Irish adults remained &quot;close to the OECD average, and numeracy and problem solving skills [were] significantly lower for all age cohorts.&quot;  This suggests a significant skills mismatch between the output of our education system and inputs required by business.  <br\/><br\/>We note that despite the fact that Irish is an official EU language, Ireland is struggling to fulfil its quota of translators for the translation of EU law, directives and regulations.<br\/><br\/>On international evidence and best practice, despite domestic views of our education system, the World Population Review puts our education ranking just ahead of the global average.  The PISA rankings are now far more granular and useful in their ratings than they used to be, but Ireland is not class-leading in any noticeable respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McDonnell and call Mr. Donohoe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#K00100","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to address it on the really critical issue of leaving certificate reform.  As the committee will be aware, the EGFSN is the independent body tasked with advising the Government on the current and future skills needs of the Irish economy.<\/p> <p>  In making its recommendations on how these skills needs can be addressed, the group is very conscious the secondary education system plays an integral role in ensuring a future pipeline of skills across the economy.  This is especially true with respect to the formative influence leaving certificate subject choices can have on future career choices.  It is equally important to note the quality of the leaving certificate learning experience has a fundamental impact on inculcating an ongoing appetite for learning after school into adulthood.  We have a well-educated and highly skilled labour force, but it is important people of all ages and at all educational levels participate in learning and upskilling on an ongoing basis.  This is necessary to sustain their employment and maintain the competitiveness of the Irish economy.<\/p> <p>  As the group&rsquo;s submission to the committee details, there is a need to ensure the leaving certificate that is as responsive as possible to current and future labour market trends, maximises awareness of the wide range of potential career opportunities and effectively prepares students for higher and further education, as well as subsequent lifelong learning pathways.  As reflected in the EGFSN&rsquo;s work in recent years, there are a range of critical skills areas for Ireland&rsquo;s economy that need to be reflected in this process of reform.  One area is the development of digital skills as a core workforce competency, as well as higher-level ICT skills to facilitate and leverage digital transformation across Ireland&rsquo;s economy.<\/p> <p>  A second area is the embedding of technical decarbonisation and environmental awareness skills across construction, engineering and business subjects.  This is required to inform and secure a pipeline of skills into zero-carbon activities and deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s climate action commitments.  The third critical skills area concerns logistics and supply chain management, as well as foreign language skill sets, to support the competitiveness and diversification of Ireland&rsquo;s trade with non-UK markets post Brexit and allow Ireland to operate and advance its interests in an increasingly globalised economy.  Importantly, transversal or softer skills, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, communications, creativity and leadership will also need to be embedded to support students' capacity and resilience, as well as that of the wider economy, in dealing with change, such as the transition to a digital and greener economy and the resulting impact on job roles and occupations.<\/p> <p>  However, as it stands, the so-called points race and dominance of a final leaving certificate exam limit the integrated education experience needed to develop these higher order skills.  Many leave school without developing the ability to self-manage their learning.  The examples of alternative assessment methods, witnessed during the pandemic involve a wider variety of sources to provide evidence of learning and produce a qualification.  These should be considered in the committee&rsquo;s deliberations.<\/p><p>International evidence points to greater involvement of teachers in assessment practice in classrooms as a key way of improving standards.

Some of the witnesses have already touched upon this issue and I do not want to prescriptive in terms of who answers my questions.  Over many weeks and again this morning we have discussed the fact that the leaving certificate is good at certain things but deficient in other areas and that there is a question mark over whether it prepares students for the world of work or even third level and further education.  My fundamental question is whether the leaving certificate as it currently stands is an appropriate barometer of students' ability to perform in the workplace and it appears from what the representative of ISME, Mr.  McDonnell, had to say, that may not be the case.<\/p> <p>  I  want to focus on trying to move away from a terminal examination and on the points made around continuous professional development, CPD, and how that might be worked into a reformed leaving certificate.  I wish to focus on moving away from the terminal exam system towards a more appropriate, module-based assessment within the classroom and on how the introduction of such a model would benefit the workplace.  My first question is a broad one around changing the leaving certificate from a terminal to a module-based structure.  I would also like to focus on new areas of economic activity where the leaving certificate is not measuring or training students.  I am thinking here of coding and climate change.

As has already been mentioned, there are many positives associated with the leaving certificate that we need to retain in any reformation including the public perception that there is a high level of fairness in the final exams.  However, the leaving certificate does not completely prepare students for entering further education or the world of work.  We really need an assessment model that champions what we value in the student experience and recognises and rewards all types of learners.  This needs to embed transferable skills as well as employability skills.  These higher order skills really need to be recognised as a valuable component of an individual's learning.  The current assessment model, because it focuses on a final examination, narrows the student's learning experience to rote learning and an ability to recall, at one moment in time, two year's worth of knowledge.  What we would like to see is continuous assessment in different formats which would be better able to capture a learner's learning journey across those two years.  This should take place over a number of different assessment modes that can capture things such skills in areas like critical thinking, problem solving, team work, communications, data analysis and data identification which will enable students to develop an ability to tackle the grand challenges facing society.<\/p><p> On the question of what type of skills students will need for the future of work, a number of key areas are alluded to in our submission and opening statement.  Digital skills is a key area.  Ireland is a hub for many major global ICT firms and we need to ensure there is a strong pipeline of ICT graduates, which will continue to raise Ireland's profile in this regard.  It is a fact that digital skills and digital literacy have penetrated almost every sector of society and that everybody will need to have access to those skills.  We need to see digital literacy embedded across the education system and the foundation for that needs to be built not only at second level but also in primary schools to ensure that students have the right preparation to launch them into more advanced digital skills such as computer science, coding, data analysis and even artificial intelligence, AI, skills.  Other areas of interest include green skills, construction skills and the transferable skills to which I referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Meadhbh Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>We substantially agree with both of those views.  I would not want it read into what I said that the criticism of the leaving certificate is a criticism of the leaving certificate alone, because I am talking about graduates.  Our experience is of graduates coming out with some of these difficulties.  They are almost set up for failure as a result of some of the issues Ms Costello and Dr. Freeman identified, specifically the emphasis on rote learning rather than the skill of communication.  Perhaps our ability to communicate digitally has also been reduced as a result of smartphones and techspeak.  That can work very well on a peer-to-peer or youth-to-youth basis, but when it is inadequate and unprofessional to use it when putting something in print in a work-based setting.  It is frequently not understood by the other person.  The criticism is not exclusive to the leaving certificate, but the over-emphasis on rote learning certainly diminishes people's ability in the problem-solving area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Implicit in the questions is that good learning outcomes are in some way different from what business needs when, in fact, they are very much aligned.  We might use different language to describe them, but good learning is generally what businesses require, as is the mastery of a particular occupation, skill set or mindset, but also synthesising and creative skills.  Ethical awareness and being a good citizen are in no way different from being a good, productive worker.  Sometimes I think we talk different languages in education and business but we are looking for the same thing.  The most important outcome I would say is learning to learn.  In a world that is constantly changing, we need to spark this continuous appetite for learning.  Ireland's performance in lifelong learning measurements is medium.

Mr. Donohoe's point about learning is also of concern to me as regards the importance of the love of learning.  The pressures of the leaving certificate were touched on with respect to well-being.  I am pleased to see that included.  It concerns me that this pressure can almost knock the love of learning out of people.  We must also look at learning, not just for the labour market but for our self-actualisation as we go through life.<\/p><p>I have a couple of questions.  My question for Mr. Donohoe is how can we do more to address that so we really instill that love of learning in people.<\/p><p> The IBEC submission refers to the need to bridge the divide between the schools regarding access to technology.  I want to ask about digitalisation in businesses.  We hear time and time again it is the way forward.  It is so vitally important.  How much of a drag is it on business that we do not have the digital skills we need at the moment?  How concerned are our guests about that?<\/p><p> On competitiveness, how long do we have before we are left so far behind we start to lose jobs and lose that competitiveness as well?  How important are the inequalities that are being created with respect to creativity, especially in rural Ireland?  We have young people trying to study and do their leaving certificate and the National Broadband Plan says their houses will be reached in 2025 or 2026.  How concerned are our guests about that?  How concerned are they about the lack of computer science in second level schools?  How can we address that?  We have a huge inequality at the moment.  We will have people sitting their leaving certificate next year who have had to teach themselves computer science, whereas in perhaps more affluent areas there are students who will have got full tuition.  How can we hope to create a level playing field around that?<\/p><p> The ESRI has also spoken about the inequality with respect to the disadvantaged areas.  We are aware 5% of students from TCD are from disadvantaged areas.  Better off parts of this city, such as Dublin 2, 4, 6 and 14 have progression rates of 90%.  In Dublin 10, 11, 17 and 24 there are progression rates as low as 7%.  What are we doing wrong there?  We are really failing these people.  That will not only have an economic impact on society but a social one as well.  I accept that there is much in what I have said, but maybe our guests could speak to a couple of those aspects to start with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#M00500","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I will briefly pick up on two issues the Deputy raised.  The first is that inequality.  Our research has shown that all students really lose out from this mode of teaching and learning but it is those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds who disengage more and are less responsive to an exam-focused curriculum that does not take account of broader practical skills.  That is an issue.  The distinction between ordinary and higher level subjects with respect to points means young people who take ordinary level feel that even though they are working hard, they are not necessarily getting the reward for it and they can become disengaged.<\/p> <p>  I was glad the Deputy brought up the broader love of learning.  As well as pointing to gaps in the preparation for the world of work and adult life, young people we have surveyed have repeatedly said they do not feel their second level education is fostering that love of learning.  This relates to reading for pleasure, appreciating art and music and even engaging in sport and physical exercise.  There are issues in producing that more rounded person who can go on to further develop his or her skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emer Smyth"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I wanted to respond to the Deputy's specific question on stimulating a love of learning.  There is clich&eacute; about education policy that no education system can exceed the quality of its teachers.  Teachers are critical in this.  I think we are all instinctively know this and probably remember at least one teacher from our childhood who inspired us in a particular way.  We should be relentless in concentrating on CPD for teachers.<\/p><p>That links into curriculum reform because there is another clich&eacute; around education policy that the assessment tail wags the curriculum dog.  As other contributors have already mentioned, if one focuses on a single method of assessment it is quite logical that the whole learning experience will be skewed to meet that.  The importance of not having one method of assessment has already been well covered at this session and at previous sessions.<\/p><p> I mention the importance of linking what happens in the classroom to real life.  Sometimes it feels like a parallel process and that is how one excites and interests students such as in the way Dr. Smyth has outlined.  Students need to have a well-rounded education experience.  People like me make a living out of the more utilitarian skills required for an economy but in the business world we are conscious of needing to produce well-rounded individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I refer to the digital divide and digitalisation and how much of a pullback that is.

On the love of learning, we know that enquiry-based learning is critical.  Teaching people to learn gives them a love of learning.  Our evidence from our interventions with primary school teachers shows that confidence is the big issue there.  I echo what Mr. Donohoe said; we need to focus on the teachers and we need to recognise those who are doing the CPD, particularly the CPD that is offered by other organisations outside of the formal Department of Education structures.  We also need to recognise the opportunities and real world learning that exist outside the classroom.  We can cleverly integrate this into assessment modules that are evidence-based and that can be objective.  We need to be careful not to think about what we did during the pandemic as the best we can do in terms of continuous assessment.  That was an emergency response and we have a lot of excellent research that we should lean on to show us how we can do that better.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on computer science briefly.  We have concerns about computer science in schools.  We still see low levels of girls taking computer science in school and we see high drop-out rates at university level.

Last night I had the privilege of being part of a judging panel with young people in the Rotary Club of Newbridge to choose ambassadors for all the values that define the Rotary Foundation to go forward to a national final.  I was incredibly struck by all of the young people.  They were engaging and effective global citizens to borrow the phrase that Dr. Smyth used earlier.  I have been reflecting on that while I have been listening to the debate and I have been thinking about those young people.<\/p> <p>  Apart from knowledge and having the opportunity to engage in a lot of different and relevant topics and apart from the importance of language and literacy, fluency is hugely important.  We see that time after time.  While to a certain extent leaving certificate exams examine a certain amount of written fluency, apart from language subjects fluency is not really measured.<\/p><p>I contend that is hugely important, as is very valuable group work.  Ms Costello mentioned the importance of group work to moving into the working environment.  When we think about it, the leaving certificate, as it stands, is a very individual assessment.  It is very important to be able to work as part of a team on projects, either at work or in our communities and families.  I am interested in getting some feedback from the witnesses on what they think about the importance of how we assess group work.  Should it be part of what do as we go forward?<\/p><p> Work experience was touched on.  Other members will have heard me speak previously about the importance I attach to work experience undertaken during transition year but it is not really measured.  Many young people find it very difficult to get relevant work experience unless their families have a network.  That work experience is hugely important to how young people define what kind of study or work they would like to go into afterwards.  It is very important for all the witnesses, and the interests they represent, to acknowledge that we need a far better system.  Some chambers and local enterprise offices, LEOs, are quite good but we need a more formalised structure.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on that.  <\/p><p> Teachers are in a dilemma.  So much of what we are talking about focuses on excellent teaching yet we have a situation where teachers are judged by the points their young students attain.  A comment was made earlier about the fact that there is sometimes criticism if teachers are not completely focusing their students on exams.  How do we get around that?  It is very important.  The Gates Foundation spent approximately $500 million in the United States on looking at this issue and trying to support very important, empowering, effective teaching that gets away from teachers being measured by the exam results their students get.<\/p><p> It is good to see Mr. Donohoe again.  He spoke about the leaving certificate being as responsive as possible to current market trends and lifelong learning.  I absolutely agree.  How do we build that into a system in a way that needs to be continuous?  We are spending 13 weeks, which is a significant amount of time, on this very important topic but we cannot do that every year when it comes to current market trends.  How do we build our reaction to, and support of, market trends so we do not have to come back and spend 13 weeks examining, listening and making recommendations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#O00400","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I will address the Senator's questions directly.  On how responsive the education system can be, let us face it, most people at leaving certificate level do not go directly into the workplace.  Some do, but it is a small percentage, probably in the order of between 10% and 12%.  Most will go on either to higher and further education or apprenticeships.  It is about having the appropriate skills architecture that can inform the system.  The expert group, for example, does its best to look five years hence, but in fact we are trying to prepare young people who will still be in the workplace in or around 2070 or 2075.  It is impossible to predict that, but we can predict the general direction of travel.<\/p><p>We try our best to match up skills supply with demand in terms of ICT, etc., but it is not a precise science.  Who would have predicted the pandemic, for example, and its impact on digital skills?  Responsiveness must be built into the system, particularly in further and higher education, apprenticeships, etc.  We have to develop that mindset for change, resilience and ability to develop different learning strategies as the environment changes around us.  That is inevitable.  We are all concerned about carbon at the moment; five years ago, not as many people were.  These trends increase in significance so it is around that responsiveness to change.  <\/p><p>I will take Senator O'Loughlin's second question around assessing group work.  As Ms Costello has pointed out, that is important.  I chaired the NCCA's curriculum board for the new business studies course for the junior certificate a number of years ago.  Part of that is assessment of group work.  It can be done around teacher assessment, but also presentations, which speaks to the Senator's other point around oral presentations.  Having projects, asking students to present on them and having teachers trained in these methods of assessment is a possible approach.  There are very few jobs where one goes in, memorises as much as one can and is then put in front of a blank piece of paper to write as much as one can.  That is not the way the world of work works.  It is important not to make total generalisations because significant progress has been made, particularly at junior cert level.  It is not the finished article but progress has been made.  However, the classroom still looks like something that was there 40 or 50 years ago, in some instances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I agree with Mr. Donohoe about the importance of group work and young people find it engaging so it is a win-win on learning and assessment.

The ability to work in a team setting is essential.  Second, on recognising and rating teachers by points and performance, the body politic bears some responsibility for this.  We raised the point earlier about converting all our ITs into regional universities.  That suggests we value the academic, but not the technical, the skilled or trades.

Apologies, I have to leave after my contributions.  So the witnesses will be aware, we have had a number of presentations over the past weeks.<\/p><p>The committee in general feels that this is our one opportunity to do something about the leaving certificate and that if we do not do something now, we will have lost a historic opportunity.  I have a sense that the education system in general perpetuates inequality and, therefore, the leaving certificate also perpetuates that inequality within the system.  It prepares people to be good at doing the leaving certificate but does not necessarily prepare them for much else.  People with means can buy results by stepping outside the system and facilitating their children to go to the Gaeltacht for Irish, access grinds for any other subject and so on.  There is also a great disparity between what certain second level schools can offer.  We saw that with Covid and the digital divide but also with DEIS second level schools.  Some 85% of students make it to leaving certificate.  We have a system that we feel needs to be radically overhauled but how do we do that?  There are two issues.  One is what the students are studying and the second is how we assess what they are studying.  Is it fair to lump a load of written exams at the end of sixth year and expect that to be an adequate reflection of anybody's abilities?  There is also all the commercial pressures that go in with that and the journalistic obsession with points and the ranking of schools.<\/p><p> I have a question for the business representatives.  I am trying to be as fair as I possibly can.  Is there not a hard business case for the eradication of educational inequality?  Does it not make sense for representatives from ISME and IBEC and others to have radical positions on the economic viability of the State for prosperity, that is, that inequalities within the system be got rid of and that we have a fully literate 18- or 19-year-old cohort leaving school?  We would not have one third of children in disadvantaged schools coming out with basic reading problems, there would not be that level of drift from 16 years onwards in disadvantaged areas, and 17.9% of our adult population would not be functionally illiterate.  People would not be falling through the cracks and, therefore, leading lives in which they do not contribute as much as they possibly could to their own happiness and well-being, as well as to wider society.  Is there not a hard, cold, economic case to be made for the eradication of educational inequality?  Do the witnesses not think their own presentations into the future could be more balanced?  They could address both the needs of business but also what is needed for wider society.  I sometimes think the presentations are a bit lopsided.<\/p><p> For anyone else who wants to contribute, do they agree with my assessment that the leaving certificate basically makes people good at doing the leaving certificate?  We need a model which, I have to be honest, will potentially involve teachers embracing the idea of self-assessment in the context of their students.  That is something we got used to over the last two years as part of the Covid response to the leaving certificate and it could potentially be part of a future leaving certificate.  Those are my questions.  I ask the witnesses to address the business case for the eradication of educational inequality and how restrictive an assessment model this is for what students are studying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#Q00400","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  He makes a valid point.  The important thing to highlight here is the types of challenges we are going to be facing into the future.  Covid is a good example of this and there are other things like climate change, land use, food security, sustainability and demographic changes.  They are all business challenges but they are also wider community challenges so it is important that we do not completely separate what is happening in the future of work and the business environment from what is happening in the community.<\/p><p>We need to ensure the education system is geared towards preparing everybody to be able to face these challenges, whether it be in the workplace in developing solutions and responses to these challenges or in broader society, and that they have that level of resilience as we move forward.  That requires these broad concepts and buckets of skills in terms of problem solving, critical resilience, digital literacy, numeracy and general literacy.  The challenges we face as a business community are shared with the broader community.  Working together through the education system is the way we can best build the resilience of the community overall for the benefit of everyone.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's point on the assessment process, from our perspective the assessment process is driving how students learn.  We need to ensure the assessment process embeds the values we want to see in the students' education experience.  That assessment process should therefore take account of skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, group works and the way we can measure those in a practical sense.

The final paragraph of the opening statement begins by stating, \"In conclusion, existing evidence points to a negative effect of the Leaving Certificate assessment model on the education and socio-economic development of young people and points to the potential to adopt a broader approach to assessment that is not focused on a short window of time at the end of their second-level education.\"  The paragraph goes on to rehearse a lot of the deficiencies in the leaving certificate model that have been repeatedly identified at this committee.  There has been close to unanimity expressed on the deficiencies that exist in the leaving certificate.  There has been mention of the need to move to an alternative assessment model that works across the senior cycle.  There is also the fact that we tend to point at the matriculation element of the leaving certificate and to focus too much on that.  There is also the temptation within all schools to move to a system of rote learning, which definitely has an ongoing impact into third level, and further and higher education where people who are good at rote learning are promoted and the deficiency in critical thinking skills remains in place.  I would encourage people to read the last paragraph of the opening statement as supplied.  It is a very good summation of many of the contributions that we have had at this committee so far. <\/p> <p>  I have a range of reasonably specific questions for Dr. Freeman and Mr. Donohoe.  I will start by asking Dr. Freeman about the STEM field.  We have never before experienced such a rate of change in the STEM area.  Are we keeping pace in terms of the curriculum specifications for sciences such as physics and computer sciences?  There has been an extremely high rate of change in computer sciences in particular.   We referenced teaching skills as well.  Are we getting the engagement on CPD that we need in order for teaching to deliver at the level needed?  Formal accreditation has been mentioned.  Are we incentivising this?  Unless there is a carrot to that stick, in respect of people taking on CPD in their own time, then we cannot expect people to engage as they lead busy lives.  Are we doing enough to support the learning of digital skills and digital technologies?<\/p> <p>  In the specifications for subjects, are we pointing at things that really do develop problem solving and critical thinking?  Coding is a very logical format and is based around problem solving and critical thinking skills.  Are we doing enough to retrofit STEM subjects in schools to keep pace with the actual change in the area? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#T00100","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The STEM subjects for the leaving certificate are subject to the same general issues that we have all talked about this morning, namely, rote learning and the regurgitation of facts in the final summit of exams.  Through the work that has been done in Dublin City University and other places, we can see that there is a good opportunity to bring in that inquiry base in respect of the STEM subjects.  As experimentation, by its very nature, is in the STEM subjects, we can bring that in.<\/p> <p>  The general issues, however, remain in STEM.  We have discussed the idea of portfolios of work and teamwork.  We need to start bringing those aspects into the formal assessment processes.<\/p> <p>  We can think about recognising the learning and informal education outside of schools.  I wish to reference things like SciFest, BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, and the CanSat competition.  There are also things like Model United Nations, where students undertake to do teamwork and presentation work.  We have some very strong activities in Ireland with which we could build more formal partnerships in terms of the education system and we could think about how we can make sure that all schools have access to those kinds of extracurricular activities and that they are incentivised and enabled for schools.  We can do that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of STEM, and I think Ms Costello referred to this, we need people to go and access data.  We can all get data by typing into the Internet now.  What we need to do is teach people the scientific method.  I mean how to set up an experiment, analyse data, assess the information generated by the experiment and generate a hypothesis.<\/p><p>Those are core skills that will be addressed across the whole curriculum.<\/p><p> When it comes to teachers, our CPD interventions are primarily at primary school level.  We can probably extrapolate from some of the lessons there, however.  We need to incentivise teachers to do CPD courses.  It is not formally recognised if they do CPD through SFI.  Most of the CPD in the primary system, perhaps understandably, focuses on numeracy and literacy.  Those are clearly core skills we want people to come out of school with.  Our focus is on inquiry-based learning and supporting teachers who do not have the confidence in STEM to teach STEM for those early years.  We have to put in place backfilling and make it possible for teachers.  Teachers have a busy curriculum and they work hard.  We have to be realistic about what they can do.  When we bring in these interventions, we need to make sure that they can work in the context of the school working day for teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ruth Freeman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions for Mr. Donohoe.

It asks people across Europe if they have had experience of lifelong learning or been involved in any sort of course in the previous four weeks?  Ireland had an 11% rate.  The EU average was 9.2%.  I can remember when we were at 7%, and at 6% at one stage.  We have improved but we are still not at the levels which can be seen in northern Europe.  Sweden has a rate of 28.6%, Finland is at 27% and Denmark is at 20%.  We have targets to hit.  I do not think we can overemphasise the importance, from a business perspective, of lifelong learning and the requirement for it because of the pace of change.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McDonnell mentioned the SME sector.  His organisation is involved with the implementation of a report which looks at introducing best practice management methods for owner managers and the SME sector.  Looking at our analysis of what needs to happen there, it goes back to developing this entrepreneurial mindset in the school system.  This is where it starts.  When we think of entrepreneurship, it is not just creation of financial value, but seeing opportunities and exploiting them to create value.  It can be financial and economic, but it can also be cultural and social.  It goes back to my original point that there is not an exclusive business voice in this conversation.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked questions about zero-carbon and environmental awareness.  Yesterday, we launched a report on skills for the zero-carbon economy, which is tied into the Government's climate action plan and what will be required to deliver on this.  We are fishing in the same pond as the construction sector with the Housing for All targets, etc.<\/p><p>Much of it is in those traditional craft occupations and construction skills.  However, they have another dimension.  The Deputy mentioned retrofitting the curriculum.  We must also introduce retrofitting skills into traditional apprenticeships.<\/p><p> We must also modify our motor maintenance courses and certification processes to acknowledge that electric vehicles are coming down the track.  Many of the skills involved can be completely new.  We have, for example, a new apprenticeship for wind turbine technician coming on stream.  Many of them are for new occupations but more of them are actually for modifying existing courses, as I said in my opening remarks, across business studies, engineering and a whole range of occupations.  We are also producing a report we hope to launch before the end of the year from the EGFSN on artificial intelligence.  Again, we want the specialists but it is more likely to be something plus artificial intelligence or something plus zero carbon.  Rather than totally new occupations, it is about disruption of existing occupations and tasks that need to reflect what are sometimes called mega-trends, such as zero carbon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for coming before us.  I will begin with a question for Dr. Smyth.  She referred earlier to the leaving certificate being a very high-stakes exam.  I think we all recognise that because it determines what a person does at third level and determines, to a certain extent, what his or her opportunities are going to be.

There is an argument to say we could have a core set of science skills.<\/p><p>We touched on this earlier.  I think Deputy Conway-Walsh talked about schools being measured by students getting 97% conversion to university with other schools getting much lower levels.  There is an argument that schools with 97% conversion are failing huge numbers of their students.  There are probably many students in that cohort who are perhaps very technical and would do very well through STEM routes, in apprenticeships and in other kinds of STEM-type roles.  Perhaps we could do that through having other routes as well, through STEM in the leaving certificate, and not just a points race with these three very clearly divided subjects that, because of stereotypes, attract very different cohorts of students to study them.

The fact is rote learning tests people's ability to recall information at a specific moment in time, but does not necessarily allow people to critically analyse and assess that information because they are training for a very specific final examination, with set questions, etc., they can prepare for.  We need to look at how we can assess those pieces around critical skills and critical thinking.  That comes back to things like looking at project work and the modernisation of some aspects of further education that could be brought into the second level education stream.  We should also look at things like portfolios of achievement and even external options for different project-based work that can all build up that critical thinking component.

That requires a very high aptitude for critical thinking.<\/p> <p>  Businesses are often very focused on STEM subjects but, equally, multidisciplinary learning that combines the humanities with STEM subjects will be incredibly important as we go forward.  We need the technologists who can develop new technologies and resolve very technical issues, but we also need, for example, behavioural economists, coming from the humanities who can tell us how to apply these new technologies, and who can create that type of behaviour change we need around issues such as climate change, which we have even seen during Covid. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#W00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Meadhbh Costello"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Mr. McDonnell referred in his paper to some concern about an <i>ad hoc <\/i>approach to continuous assessment.<\/p><p>Do I detect from this that although Mr. McDonnell recognises the faults in the leaving certificate, he believes it is better than what would replace it if we had internal assessment by teachers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#W00600","speaker":"1553","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>The point was that the manner in which the continuous assessment was marked for two successive years was <i>ad hoc<\/i>.

I will follow up on a couple of points now that we have a bit of time and have heard the opening statements and initial responses to questions.  One such point is around citizenship.  I met the Dublin Chamber task force on sustainability last week.  I am keen to look at what we can do in education to ensure people are fully informed about things like putting in submissions and planning, as well as the impact that has on both the wider community and on business.  For instance, we know that cycling and walking in urban areas increase footfall, bring people into retail and support local businesses.  Dublin Chamber has put out some helpful statistics on that.<\/p><p>However, that is not always reflected in the submissions that come in.  Is there something that can be done in that regard in schools to ensure people are fully informed?  There are cities, though I cannot name them off the top of my heard, where the vast majority, or between 80% and 90%, of people were against public realm space being developed but, once it was in place, 91% were in favour of it.  That is a real challenge for us in the context of moving fast enough on the climate and biodiversity crisis.<\/p><p> It is also a real difficulty when it comes to sustainability in business, because businesses are trying to do two things.  They are trying to appeal in some ways to their customers who are saying one thing but they know the green way is the way of the future for business.  I would love any insight our guests may have on that and how we could build that into leaving certificate or the education system more generally.<\/p><p> A really interesting point was made in respect of working in a team.  I cannot remember whether it was Mr. Donohoe or Mr. McDonnell who bought that whole issue up.  Where are we seeing the downsides to people not having the skills to work in a team?  Is there some way in which it is crystal clear when people leave school that they do not have those skills?  Mr. McDonnell made a point in his opening statement in respect of the fact that, contrary to the narrative we hear, we are not a world leader when it comes to education.  We may be just above average but when one considers Ireland in the global context and the kind of wealth the country has, one would probably expect us to be doing far more there.  It would be a shame for the committee to come out with a report that continues that false narrative when we actually have an opportunity to be really creative and innovative about what we can do next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#X00500","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":254,"content":"<p>On the team working issue, many schools are good at that, certainly in transition year but also up to junior certificate level.  They put kids doing syndicate work and project work together.  Where there is no emphasis on this, that should be addressed.  I always say to new employees that it is not necessarily their technical skills that will result in them getting into trouble or an end to their employment, it is their soft skills, that is, the ability to deal with other people and communicate with people.  Soft skills are essential in the workplace and if young people do not have an exposure to working in teams, they may struggle in that regard.  Team sports are a great educator in that way but many kids are not involved in team sports.  Similarly, students being given a project where a big task is divided into three, four, five or six smaller tasks and each person is responsible for one part of that task and that has to be co-ordinated is an introduction to the way the working environment works.  Initiatives like that on a structured basis in the education system are really necessary.   This is an area where young people run into trouble when they come into a formal work setting and are told to go away to work, possibly with a person who is 20 or 30 years older than them, and that is a big deal and they have never done anything like it before.  That is an essential skill.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of Ireland not being world-leading, I do not wish to give the idea that I think the education system is going backwards.  What I am suggesting is that peer countries are moving forward far more quickly than we are and they are constantly improving.  Education is an iterative process and things change all the time. The advances we have seen in digital learning in the past two years purely because of Covid have been extraordinary.  That will be a worldwide phenomenon.  Are we going to be able to exploit it?  If we are very conservative or move at the speed of the slowest participant in educational reform, that is where we will be left behind.<\/p><p>Other countries will advance quickly on that.

We know what we need to change; we just need to be bold about how we do it and to empower the teachers and the system to do it.<\/p> <p>  The continuous assessment and the calculated grades that happened during Covid are not the ideal scenario.  That was an emergency response that we had to take on.  It is important that we do not judge what a continuous assessment might look like based on that.  We need to go back to the experts and researchers who are looking into this and who are developing ways that we can do more objective continuous assessment.  We can empower and train teachers to do that.  There is no doubt that additional skills will be required for teachers to do that.  In terms of global citizenship, we must change the narrative that everything is about the points at the end of the day, and we heard about students almost complaining about teachers who went off-piste away from what they needed to do in the exam.  That is when we can reframe the discussion and we need to think about school as more than just preparing for that academic pathway.  It is for preparing for many different pathways and it is about preparing for life.<\/p> <p>  I will raise the following point because it comes up in a lot of our campaigns around women's' health and menopause.  Are we equipping people to even look after their own bodies once they leave school?  Are we giving people basic training in life skills?  That has to be more than just a couple of modules in transition year.  We need to think about those kinds of empowering skills for everyone.

I represent a group that is looking for education that is relevant to particular needs of the economy but companies want good citizens as well as productive workers and there is no contradiction in that.<\/p> <p>  The writer who I frequently refer back to is Howard Gardner, who made his name in the 1980s in the field of multiple intelligences.  I am sure that colleagues would be aware of that in general terms at least.  More recently he wrote a book for business leaders and he talked about the disciplined mind, the creative mind and the synthesising mind, which is an important one.  Members will have heard previous contributors talk about technology.  It is not just about the technology itself but the design, the design thinking and understanding what people want and need.  That brings in the humanities as much as the technical skills.  Howard Gardner also talks about the respectful mind and the ethical mind and it is important in a business context that we are respectful.  That thought refers back to our conversation around teams.<\/p><p>It is also about working in companies with globalised structures, respecting differences with people.  The ethical mind is not just about moral ethics, but about exercising one's responsibilities against the Senator's point as a citizen.  We have seen some fairly graphic examples of this, particularly in the debates around climate.  The OECD's PISA study suggests that Irish school kids, or 15-year-olds, show a relatively high awareness of environmental issues.  We should not, therefore, go too hard on the system.

We are all here to talk about reform of the leaving certificate.  It is great to hear that in the submissions, from what I can pick up on, overall there is quite a lot of support for us looking at a reformed leaving certificate.  That is what our committee is here for.  We welcome the witnesses' submissions.  This is going to feed into a report and many recommendations.  It will drive change within the Department of Education.  I thank the witnesses for the time they have spent in putting the submissions together and for the thought they have given to them.  I have a few questions and will give a bit of an overview as well.  On the future of skills, witnesses talked about the artificial intelligence, the digital transformation and the challenges we have and have seen over the past year and a half with healthcare and with climate change.<\/p> <p>  I might pose my first question to Science Foundation Ireland.  It is great to see Dr. Freeman. First, I congratulate Science Foundation Ireland's new director general, Professor Philip Nolan, who will be taking up the role shortly.  Professor Mark Ferguson, I suppose, will continue as chief scientific adviser.  He has led the ship over a long number of years, which has been great to see.  I welcome some of the projects that SFI has been doing in the community.  I am based in Ballinasloe, County Galway, and I represent Roscommon and Galway.  The Creating our Future roadshow and the impact it has had in engaging with the communities across towns and villages has been excellent.  I thank SFI's team for that.  I have some questions for Dr. Freeman.  In the submission from Science Foundation Ireland, Dr. Freeman talked a little bit out the accreditation of teachers.  I know that previously, teachers were involved in different projects - perhaps at the centres of excellence around the country - working with researchers, getting a flavour and making them more exhilarated about science and the potential of science and so on.  Dr. Freeman might speak a little about the accreditation of teachers and what that could look like, were we looking at it for a secondary school.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses also mentioned lifelong learners.  I have enjoyed this theme, which has run through a number of the submissions.  I work closely with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, on the apprenticeship programme about rolling out all the opportunities.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, through the Central Applications Office, CAO, reform next year, will showcase everything that is there including the post leaving certificate, PLC, and further education sectors and the apprenticeship programme, as well as our traditional routes into college.  I like this focus.  I ask Dr. Freeman to comment on STEM in the CAO reform and what impact that might have on science.  She spoke as well about girls taking up STEM subjects.  I remember from when I was there about the importance of role models.  I note role models were important in the reports that came back to us.  What sort of role models do we need for the future for both boy and girl students going forward?  Maybe Dr. Freeman can say something about that. <\/p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Donohoe about the expert group on future skills needs.<\/p><p>He referred to our school and educational experience giving an appetite for learning after school.  I liked that phrase.  As part of the expert group's report, Together for Design, it worked with career guidance teachers.  Is there any feedback from that?  Was that solely to do with transition year?<\/p><p> Mr. Donohoe spoke about the low levels of lifelong learning and I am aware of the 11% statistic.  We need to get people back into the workforce and back into study.  So many people have taken career breaks.  There are mums and dads at home who have taken time out.  How do we encourage them and get their confidence back so they think about study, working or taking part in their local communities?  Community groups are coming to the fore in towns and villages.  They are driving change in our local areas, which is why it is important that people consider living and working in regional areas.  I ask the witnesses to say a little on that.<\/p><p> Mr. Donohoe also spoke about languages.  As an arts student, I appreciated that because languages are very important.  I have to upskill as Gaeilge but French and Spanish are very important to me.  I ask the witnesses to expand a little on language skills.<\/p><p> Dr. Smyth from the ESRI spoke about the stress for students and I appreciated that.  I am not sure I like the term soft skills.  I never did.  I was an arts student and people would always talk about soft skills but I never liked the term.  I like thinking about skills we have for life.<\/p><p> I will come back to fifth year and leaving certificate students.  In an ideal world, what would a perfect leaving certificate look like?  I would welcome a comment on that from any of the witnesses.<\/p><p> I again thank the witnesses.  We need to develop our skills and equip our students.  They are our talent and the people who will drive forward and lead our country, whether in public representation, communities, business, research or any other walk of life.  Education is crucial for that to happen and the witnesses' submissions are crucial for us in looking at how we ensure students are equipped to take on these challenges and succeed in them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#AA00300","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Dolan for those questions.  I will try to be brief so we can get through them all.  On accreditation, there are lots of models in other professions whereby we can recognise CPD more broadly, rather than just the CPD coming through the Department of Education.  We should be thinking about where can we get teachers to go out and get these skills.  We can then accredit them and make sure they reach a certain standard and they can use a portfolio of different accreditation.  At primary school we have the green schools and the discover primary science and maths, DPSM, programmes.  We can develop a model of accredited skills for teachers.  We do it in engineering and accountancy and loads of other professions so we can do that.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to role models, we have done research and spoken to thousands of students in their first year of college.  We have spoken to 3,000 or 4,000 students and asked them detailed questions about why they are doing the course they are doing.  The biggest factor in determining the course is whether they think they will fit in with the other people on the course.  They are thinking about whether they will be like the other people on the course, and that is true whether they choose a STEM subject or a non-STEM subject.  As a society we need to think about what kind of role models we are putting out there.  In the STEM area we work with RT&Eacute; and that is why we do things like Science Week.  It is about opportunities to get out there and present all these different kinds of careers and options and show people that they can be a scientist, for example.  We have to smash those stereotypes and that is just as much the case in the arts.  There are probably young boys out there who are interested in dance and music and may feel that stereotypes are not allowing them to pursue their passions.<\/p> <p>  We hugely welcome the new options on the CAO form.

The levels of stress associated with the leaving certificate assessment and preparation are concerning.  It drives activities such as sports outside school, which are a protective factor.  We have seen positive developments related to well-being in the junior cycle, with time and space devoted to it.  We need to see that carried forward into the senior cycle.  We need to not see well-being as an add-on that should be pushed aside in preparation for the examination.  We need to embed some of the life skills that we have been talking about in that way.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is currently reviewing relationships and sexuality education.  Data from Growing Up in Ireland have shown that there are still gaps for young people.  We assume that young people are talking to their parents about sex and relationships, when they are not necessarily, and young men in particular may be missing out on those conversations.  It is important that we have a nuanced view of sex education in our schools in the context of broader well-being.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emer Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Smyth.

As we have said before, we all agree about developing an appetite for lifelong learning.  There is also the matter of providing opportunities.  There are some interesting projects happening in the human capital initiative, including a project relating to microcredentials, which provides learning in bite-sized chunks.  For many full-time workers, it is impossible to allocate time to get a master's or bachelor's degree.  Turning that into chunks and having an education system, including universities, technological universities and institutes of technology, that presents information in a modular way is positive.<\/p> <p>  The second question was about apprenticeships.  These will work if we give people real progression opportunities.  There has been significant discussion about apprenticeships since we had the reform in 2012.  There is evidence on the ground relating to taking up new apprenticeships.  The traditional 27 craft apprenticeships will go with the ebb and flow of the construction sector.  Demand is high at the moment.  There have been 6,700 so far this year, which is higher than last year and is encouraging.  I am particularly interested in the other apprenticeships, which go up to PhD level.  The University of Limerick provides a PhD for principal engineers.  That is needed.  It is about  young people's aspirations and breaking the stranglehold of the points system and the leaving certificate on young people's aspirations.  That can be done by providing them with opportunities to progress.  Those are the critical elements of the apprenticeship model.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of languages, I have been involved in education policy for a long time.  I find languages the most problematic of the lot, with regard to how they are actually addressed.  It is a disadvantage of being an English-speaking country.  I do not think the teaching and learning of Irish has done any favours, which is due to the way that Irish is taught rather than the fact that it should be taught.<\/p><p>It might have dissuaded some people from taking up languages.  Basically, we need to give young people opportunities to use languages, be it in sport or wherever else  and in different contexts.  Believe me, language skills are critical in this post-Brexit world.  Those in the Irish indigenous sector, in particular, will have to diversify their markets.  There is an old saying that you buy in your own language but you sell in your customer's language.  If one wants to be successful in export markets one needs to have staff who have a facility with languages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#CC00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Donohoe for that response.

There are exciting opportunities to embed aspects of the apprenticeship system or further education and training, FUT, offerings into the second level education.  On apprenticeships, there are clear opportunities to introduce apprenticeship programmes.  That would help to achieve the overall ambition set out in the national apprenticeship action plan of increasing the number of apprenticeships to 10,000 per year.<\/p><p>The introduction of employer-led apprenticeships in key industry areas, such as cybersecurity, finance and accounting, has really transformed the apprenticeship offering in Ireland.  However, we really need to boost the perception of apprenticeships for key stakeholders, including parents, guidance counsellors and students themselves, to create a narrative around apprenticeships that actually shows their true offering.  We need to highlight that the apprenticeship is an alternative model of learning that crosses the boundary from further to higher education.  There are opportunities to earn while you learn, develop a lifelong career and earn qualifications up to level 10.  <\/p><p> One example of a potential opportunity is the P-TECH pilot, which has been rolled out in Dublin's North East Inner City, with a number of schools involved there.  It provides an example of this type of public-private partnership that is supported by industry and education institutions to increase the number of students who are engaged in this type of learning and to help them achieve a qualification on the QQI framework, as well as a school qualification.  We need to assess the progress that the pilot has made and explore what type of opportunities there are to expand it into other areas.  <\/p><p> On the issue of modern languages, I think it was mentioned earlier that from a business perspective, it is critical that we increase the number of people who are engaging in modern languages, as well as diversifying the languages that they are engaging in.  In recent years, we have seen a growing demand for language skills.  However, we do not have the skills available in Ireland to meet these needs.  Indeed, prior to Covid, there was actually an increasing number of vacancies associated with those language skills.  Ireland's language strategy sets out the objective of diversifying and increasing the uptake of languages learned, as well as cultivating the languages that exist in our community.  We have people of more than 200 different nationalities in Ireland.  We need to look at the impact of issues such as Brexit and globalisation, which are actually driving the demand for the learning of different languages.  We must look at the challenges around the dominance of English in the global area, the lack of awareness around opportunities that foreign languages can bring to the individual and the perceived difficulty around learning languages, as well as the shortage of teachers who are qualified to teach modern languages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#DD00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Meadhbh Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I address my questions to Dr. Smyth and Dr. Freeman.

Of course, there is a need to reform the leaving certificate, but do Dr. Smyth and Dr. Freeman feel there is a need to reform the way some of the subjects are being taught?

We have seen that the focus on exam preparation, in the context of subject areas with quite detailed course content, puts pressure on students and teachers to focus on very teacher-led methods, and not the kind of experiments and group, presentation and interactive work that students find engaging and that actually help them learn better.  If we reform what is rewarded or how we assess what is done in senior cycle, that will help foster more engaging approaches to teaching.  However, that alone will not be sufficient.  We will have to support teachers to take advantage of the opportunities that an opened-up system would provide.  We have seen that they have reacted positively to junior cycle reform.  It would provide an opportunity for those kinds of methods to carry forward into senior cycle for both teachers and students.<\/p><p>The language issue is very tricky, as Mr. Donohoe has said.  It is a curse of being an English-speaking country.  When we talk to young people and interview them about languages, they ask why they should bother with them because everybody speaks English.  It is back to awareness and the facilitation of guidance early in junior cycle on course choices and thinking about options for the future.<\/p><p>  We also see this with apprenticeships and there has been a change.  Having apprenticeships in the CAO process will likely have positive outcomes.  What we see when we speak with parents and students is that higher education is the cultural norm.  If young people get into a post-leaving certificate course or apprenticeship, they often see it as second best in many cases.  They see themselves as not having attained what they really wanted.  We really need to support young people's choices from very early on, even as far back as primary school, keeping options open for them regardless of gender or social background.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#EE00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Emer Smyth","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I fully support Dr. Smyth's comments on the assessment methods.  In looking at STEM, as I alluded to earlier in my comments to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, the big difference we see between students who take biology versus physics and chemistry is not reflective of what we see in STEM in the world of work or in university.  If we step back and think about the key capabilities we want, we are talking about developing curiosity, inquisitiveness, critical thinking, analytic and problem-solving techniques and group work.  Perhaps we could have a more modular curriculum that is not fully teacher-led with a vast array of set knowledge but rather one where students can identify modules in which they are interested and curious about within the scope of a curriculum.  It would not be so defined.  Some of the curiosity and love of learning we have all identified as important comes from being able to spend some time exploring and learning what people are interested in.<\/p> <p>  The more modular approach was discussed in terms of microcredentials and breaking down the experience in different ways and that would certainly be beneficial in STEM.  It gives a resilience as people would be learning to learn rather than just learning a set of information when, quite honestly, they could probably google much of it or it will be out of date, as we have all acknowledged the fast pace of STEM and of everything.  There is also a creative piece that we see as really critical in STEM and there are hard lines sometimes drawn between STEM subjects and the skills associated with languages, arts, design and creativity, for example.  We must have a more cohesive approach in bringing them together and recognising we do not just want people strong in one area but we need to foster all those skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#FF00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ruth Freeman"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Mr. Donohoe is chair of his grouping and, therefore, I ask him about the importance of apprenticeships.

This one has been around for the last decade.  During the last crisis it was decided by the then Government that the apprenticeship model and the number of apprenticeships available were not meeting the needs of the economy, especially given that there were just 27 craft apprenticeships.  There are 62 apprenticeships now.  There are opportunities but, as Dr. Smyth has said, it is very difficult to change the cultural mindset.  Ireland has either the highest or second highest succession or progression rate to higher education in the EU.  It is very difficult to persuade people that educational attainment involves anything other than higher education.  Culturally, it is what all levels of society aspire to.  We should not underestimate that challenge.  I still believe that by providing for a broader number of apprenticeships and making these progression pathways a reality for people, we can demonstrate that they can go on and do an honours degree, a master&rsquo;s degree or a PhD if they want to.  If those progression pathways are transparent, this approach is more likely to work but it is going to take a heck of a long time.  It is worth doing.  The earn and learn model works in other countries.  I believe that the institutes of technology and the technological universities have an important part to play in this as well.<\/p><p> I agree with Senator Dolan&rsquo;s point on investment in equipment.  We found that in some apprenticeships, we need more capital investment in medical devices, etc.  This is part of a much broader conversation about capital investment in higher and further education.  Education is trying to compete with health and housing, which are the current must-haves.  Due to its longer term nature, we tend not to notice the deterioration in capital and the lack of investment over a longer period of time.  That is a big mistake.  We are shoring up problems for the future.<\/p><p> I agree 100% that there is a significant opportunity to embed transition year in some other way into the leaving certificate.  Ireland&rsquo;s transition year is quite unusual when one looks at other education systems.  It is a real strength.  It provides an opportunity to bring business and education together.  I believe IBEC organised an event last year with the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals which enabled many young people interact with business online, ironically.  Anything that brings business and education together is very powerful.  If that is to be valued, it has to be assessed in some ways.  There is an old business adage that what gets measured gets managed.  That also applies to education.  It does not have to involve examinations, but it needs built in to the evaluation and assessment process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#FF00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>delete<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021113000002#GG00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I have two comments on the apprenticeships.

That is certainly not helping the situation.<\/p> <p>  On PLC courses, I understand that approximately 4% of people who do the nursing PLC can then go on to actually take up nursing.  That is also a real problem.  There are too many very simple blocks that need to be taken away and for which somebody needs to take responsibility.  We can be forever and a day talking about the future and the big broader pictures but if we do not remove these blocks, people are still going to find themselves in a situation where there are no defined pathways.

As I said before, a lot of the challenges we face as a society will, at least, involve conversations about STEM.  We have had loads of conversations over the past 18 months.  We are all armchair scientists now.  We have embedded in our programmes the idea of access and reaching those who do not have the same science capital that maybe the more privileged in society have.  That is a fundamental objective of our discover programme.<\/p> <p>  When we put in place initiatives to break down those barriers or open doors, they are often focused on those less-privileged communities.  In fact, our science in Ireland barometer survey, which we run to assess what level of access to STEM people have, clearly shows us the areas regionally where people have less access and the communities that have less access.  It is, again, not surprising that it is actually young women in a socially disadvantaged background that are least likely to be able to engage with STEM.  We have a number of initiatives that have specifically targeted getting to those communities.  As I said in my opening statement, we have projects that are targeted towards the Traveller community, those in direct provision and those with autism.

I think we know what to do.  We now need to get to the how and get it done because we have developed the evidence base.  It involves doing the research.  We all have opinions about these things and have our personal experiences about what we see working and not working in our own families or our own communities.

Colleagues, led by Dr. Selina McCoy, are doing some work at the ESRI looking at post-school opportunities for young people.  It is a case of resources but also of inclusive practices at the school level.  It is also about providing opportunities that will follow on from the level 1 learning programme, L1LP, and level 2 learning programme, L2LP, which have been a success at junior cycle level, and linking them in to options at a senior cycle level.  It is also about providing flexible pathways within senior cycle so that we do not have, for example, a ring-fenced leaving certificate applied and that those kinds of opportunities and learning experiences can be experienced by all young people and that they could perhaps take a suite of short courses that would better suit their needs.

I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to the subcommittee on mental health.  As outlined in the introduction, I am head of the office of mental health engagement and recovery in the HSE.  I will give a brief outline of the work of mental health engagement and recovery because it will help inform the discussion on the Mental Health Act and why it needs to facilitate the recovery approach.  The office of mental health engagement and recovery was established in 2018.  It aligned the previous function of advancing recovery in Ireland and the office of the mental health engagement into one function.  The role of engagement and recovery is to ensure that the experience of service users, family members, carers and their supporters inform the design, delivery and evaluation of our mental services through co-production processes and to ensure that the personal lived and recovery experience of service users, family members and carers is utilised as a service improvement and therapeutic resource within our services.  The work of mental health engagement and recovery is central to achieving the person-centred and recovery-oriented service as set out national policy Sharing the Vision.<br\/><br\/>Currently, in engagement and recovery, we have area leads for engagement in all community healthcare organisation areas and these facilitate 35 local engagement forums of local service users, family members and carers.  Additionally, we are continuing to develop a lived experience cohort to our workforce through the introduction of peer support working on to our multidisciplinary teams and through our recovery education and recovery college structures in partnership with our NGO colleagues, Mental Health Ireland.  Through this we empower service users, family members, carers, staff and other stakeholders to an enhanced knowledge of recovery and their role in achieving recovery for themselves or facilitating others to do so.In 2022 we expect to increase our number of experts by experience working directly in the HSE to around 130.Engagement and recovery also oversees the individual placement and support, IPS, programme which supports people with long-term and enduring mental health challenges find meaningful work.  As of March 2021, more than 100 people are registered the IPS programme, with 441 people having secured meaningful employment since the start of the programme. <br\/><br\/>In response to the Department of Health's request for submissions to the drafting of the new Mental Health Act, we partnered with our Mental Health Reform colleagues, and I am delighted they are with us today, to hold a consultation process with service users, family members and carers on their views on the draft heads of Bill for the new Mental Health Act.  Some 135 people registered for our consultation process which took place over two days. <br\/><br\/>Mental health engagement and recovery recognises and very much welcomes that the current Mental Health Act draft heads of Bill is more person-centred, promotes autonomy and shared responsibility and has more recovery-focused language but we think there are still opportunities to strengthen this further.  In this regard and based on our consultation feedback, we believe the Act should be underpinned by the core values and principles that reflect a recovery-oriented and person-centred service.  These principles include recovery, autonomy, accessible language, partnership, co-production, empowerment, transparency, and quality and evidence-based and evidence-led interventions.<b><\/b><br\/><br\/>We received a substantial amount of feedback through that consultation process, which is available for review and which we will use to inform our planning and service improvement processes in the HSE.  The overarching themes of the consultation feedback can be broken down into a number of areas, namely, the need for a human rights approach; the autonomy of people in relation to their own care, treatment and recovery; the importance of co-production and shared decision making; a range of service provision that meets the diverse needs, preferences and choices of people on their recovery journeys; the vital that role family members, carers and supporters can play in facilitating recovery; and an effective system on how to complain to an independent body for mental health.<br\/><br\/>We have fed back direct commentary to the Department on 12 heads of the Bill, which are listed in my presentation.  As the members have a copy of it, I will not name them all individually.  This feedback relates to suggested change of language, omission or addition of wording.  We also make recommendations on additional themes we believe should be covered in the Act.  They include the rights of families, carers, supporters or a nominated person and the recognition of that expertise in the care and recovery processes of individuals; an evaluation by a second consultant psychiatrist; and advanced healthcare directives and complaints procedures.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge the contribution of the following in this consultation and feedback process: the national mental health engagement and recovery team, the area leads for mental health engagement, the local mental health engagement forums, and other individual service users, family members and supports.  I also thank this subcommittee for the opportunity to present the perspective of service users, family members and carers today and while the subcommittee will engage with many stakeholders in informing the content of the Mental Health Act, the views of service users, family members and carers must be one most important areas for its consideration.  I thank the members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I call Ms Fiona Coyle from Mental Health Reform to make her opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#B00300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Glacaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus le baill an choiste as an gcuireadh teacht in bhur l&aacute;thair inniu.  I am the CEO of Mental Health Reform.  Today I am joined by Ber Grogan, our policy and advocacy co-ordinator.  Mental Health Reform is Ireland&rsquo;s leading national coalition on mental health, with more than 75 member organisations working for progressive reform of mental health services and supports in Ireland.  We welcome the opportunity to take part in this historic pre-legislative scrutiny of the mental health (amendment) Bill.  This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for positive change in our mental health legislation.<\/p><p>The work of this subcommittee will profoundly affect some of the most vulnerable people in our society, namely, those who find themselves in need of inpatient mental health treatment and care.  The reform of the Mental Health Act 2001 is a key step in the transition towards person-centred, recovery-focused services, as set out in our national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision.  We now have an opportunity to be world leaders in the delivery of mental health legislation that adequately protects human rights.  The heads of Bill before the subcommittee are very welcome and propose to make fundamental reform in our mental health legislation.  However, there are a number of proposed areas of improvement, three of which I would like to highlight today on behalf of our member organisations.  These are part 8, admission of children to approved inpatient facilities; part 6, restrictive practices; and an additional part relating to provisions for an independent complaints mechanism.<\/p><p> Part 8 of the heads of Bill provides for all aspects of legislation relating to under 18s.  While this is welcome and necessary, we have some concerns on the specifics.  Head 128, section 108 on admission of a child to an adult approved inpatient facility, still provides for the admission of under 18s to adult facilities.  The 2020 Mental Health Commission annual report showed that there were 27 child admissions to nine adult units during that year.  The commission also reported that there was 0% compliance with its code of practice on the admission of children to approved centres as none of the services provided age-appropriate facilities and programmes of activities in adult units.  It is very concerning that the legislation still allows such practices.  As such, we request that an express provision should be contained in the amending legislation that no child or young person shall be admitted to an adult inpatient unit. <\/p><p> On issues relating to under 18s we wish to also highlight a lacuna between the heads of Bill and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  Part 8 of the mental health (amendment) Bill is set to provide for 16- and 17-year-olds to give or withdraw consent to treatment in mental health services if they are deemed to have capacity.  The heads of the Bill state that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 would apply for the purposes of conducting the necessary capacity assessments.  However, the Act does not provide for decision supports for under 18s.  Mental Health Reform has written to all relevant Ministers highlighting this lacuna and we hope that a remedy will be found as a matter of urgency.  We request that such a recommendation be included in the subcommittee report and that members engage with their counterparts on the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. <\/p><p> I would like now to draw the subcommittee's attention to part 6 in regard to restrictive practices.  Mental Health Reform considers that as a first principle, force should not be viewed as a method for engaging service users in treatment.  Force is not the way to support recovery.  We advocate for a zero restraint, zero seclusion policy as set out in Sharing the Vision.<\/p><p> This year, Mental Health Reform commissioned an independent, human rights analysis of the heads of the Bill to reform the Mental Health Act 2001.  This has been provided to the subcommittee.  In this paper, there are a number of recommendations to transition to the abolition of coercive practices in mental health services.  The recommendations are adapted from those developed by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly and the work of the World Health Organization QualityRights initiative.  The full list is in the accompanying paper but some of the recommendations include the following: additional funding should be provided for the development of pilot community-based responses such as peer-led crisis or respite services, and other initiatives identified as international best practice; and additional funding should also be dedicated to the development of prevention and early identification of mental health conditions and early, non-coercive intervention, especially for children and young persons.  This should be included as a stand-alone section in part 7 of amending legislation.  Persons with lived experience of involuntary detention should be involved in the development and delivery of this human rights training. <\/p><p> I want to now draw the subcommittee's attention to the omission of a provision for an independent complaints mechanism.  Since 2014, Mental Health Reform has been highlighting the need for an independent complaints mechanism.  People have been, and continue to be, deprived of their liberty through involuntary detention.  This is contrary to Article 14 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  While Ireland, belatedly, ratified the UNCRPD in 2018, we did not ratify the optional protocol.  People with psychosocial disabilities and experiencing mental health difficulties should have a safe and independent avenue for complaints.  The need for such is continuously highlighted to us in consultations with people using services and their families, friends, carers and supporters.  Therefore, we propose the following recommendations.  First, the heads of the Bill should provide for an independent direct and specific complaints mechanism for mental health services.  This needs to be separate from the existing HSE Your Service, Your Say complaints mechanism.  Both adults and children should be entitled to avail of this complaints mechanism.  Second, the Inspector of Mental Health Services should be conferred with a statutory obligation to receive, investigate, and determine individual complaints relating to mental health services.<\/p><p> It has been 20 years since our last major change in mental health legislation.  A whole generation of people will be impacted by the long-awaited reform of this legislation.  We must grasp this opportunity to make fundamental improvements to the delivery and support of mental health services in our country to ensure horrors of the past are not revisited.  Time for reform is long overdue, but we have this historic opportunity now.  Reform should be brought about with expediency and due process.  This subcommittee has a vital role to play in ensuring that our updated mental health legislation puts people at the centre of the support and services they need; respects their human rights; and respects their will, preferences and experiences.  This legislation must fundamentally be about people and we commend the subcommittee for its work and diligence in this important process.  We look forward to the discussion today with members and thank them for their time. <\/p><p> Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Coyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat Ms Coyle.

Almost all of those who have appeared before the subcommittee over the past year have said that this legislation is so badly needed.  I thank the witnesses for their time and their diligence around it.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions around issues raised in today's opening statements and I want to follow-up on some issues brought to our attention by the Mental Health Commission in previous sessions.  I will start with the definition of \"mental disorder\" versus \"mental illness\".  I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters which is tasked with implementing the UNCRPD.  I am concerned around the idea that \"mental disorder\" would include intellectual disability as a means for questioning somebody's capacity.  I would like to unpack that a little with the witnesses.  What are the dangers there?<\/p><p>I misunderstood this, but my understanding is that the reason we have held on to the term \"mental disorder\" is that it appears, or has previously appeared, in other legislation.  Is it time to move on from that?  Does it clash with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD?  I suspect that it does.  Is that something that the drafters of the Bill should consider further?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#C00400","speaker":"1559","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Would the witnesses like to speak on that?

I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter around language.  It is one of the other areas that we have been advocating for further reform in.  While we support the replacement of the term \"mental disorder\", we do not believe the term \"mental illness\" should be used in its place.  The reasoning behind this is that it is quite medicalised language and it does not adequately reflect the full diversity of mental health difficulties and their causes and the combination of origins and contributory factors.  The impact of mental health difficulties for those who experience them are unique to each individual.  For some, medical diagnosis and focus will be helpful and useful but this is not the case for everyone.  The use of medicalised terminology can be quite exclusionary and such terminology can have an unintended effect of narrowing how mental health difficulties are understood and responded to and the Deputy raised some of those points.  We recommend aligning this legislation with the policy sharing division, which uses the term \"mental health difficulties\" or, indeed, with the UNCRPD language, which refers to \"psychosocial disabilities\".  \"Psychosocial disabilities\", as a term, is not widely used in Ireland, which is why we put both forward.  We recognise that the language is something that the drafters should further focus attention on.

Head 4 was one of the areas that came up in on our consultations as well.  I note that in the earlier drafts the word \"disorder\" had been dropped but it now seems to have resurfaced.  As Ms Coyle said, in understanding the context of this and the importance of language, in the last few years, thankfully, there has been a growing understanding of the spectrum of mental health from mental well-being to acute mental health challenges.  We have to be careful that we do not lessen or reduce the significance of people who suffer from severe mental health challenges in our attempts to get people talking about mental health and so on.  We have tried to make it as populous as possible.  There remains a difference between somebody who has anxiety at the milder end of the scale and somebody who has severe and enduring mental health challenges.  In our consultation, there was a lot of feedback on this and there certainly was not consensus.  Many people believed the word \"illness\" captured the enduring and severe end of the spectrum well and people are familiar with the word \"illness\".  I certainly would not be happy with the continuation of the word \"disorder\" but on balance, the word \"illness\" would be more acceptable.  The Deputy raised a very important point about people with intellectual challenges and that needs to be decoupled.

It is great to be here this morning.  I watched the subcommittee's two sessions of pre-legislative scrutiny with the Department officials and with the Mental Health Commission.  The subcommittee is doing brilliant work so far.<\/p> <p>  That was one area that I was linking back with.  We commissioned the independent human rights analysis from Dr. Charles O'Mahony and Dr. Fiona Morrissey from National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, and I checked back with the recommendations that they had made around the intermediate category and that whole area.  It comes back to everything within the amending legislation and the general thrust of it, in that the intermediate category seems to have been introduced because of the grey area between voluntary and involuntary.  For example, if someone were a voluntary person and there was perhaps seclusion, restraint or restrictive practices used against them, Mental Health Reform has previously said that that should be questioned whether that person is voluntary or involuntary.  It is a very grey area across the board and that is why this intermediate category was introduced.  From my understanding, the heads are trying to firm up what is voluntary and what is involuntary and the fact that there can be people in this in between piece.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, there are concerns that it would just widen the net of coercion.  \"Coercion\" is a very strong word, but again, if someone does not want to be secluded or there is use of quiet time, it comes back to the main general thrust of the legislation of it being person-centred and that the person is involved in the decisions being made.  If it is all done properly, we can see why the expert group recommended an intermediate category.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, in our human rights analysis and the recommendations we have, there are some recommendations around strengthening the legislation around it.  There are some tweaks and things that could make it stronger, but, obviously, the Mental Health Commission members are experts in their own right as well, and that is the joy of all this pre-legislative scrutiny and hearing from as many voices as possible.  If it is to give protection to people while their capacity is being questioned between voluntary and involuntary, if it is strong enough, it should work for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Ber Grogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Ryan have any thoughts on that?

This opens up to us the question of the person's natural supports, such as the role of the family and the role of advocacy, whether the person being provided with all of the services he or she needs and whether all of the these services are linked in order that we can know if the person is in a position to consent or not.  It would be useful to have a definition of \"consent\" for this particular section, perhaps, under head 124, which deals with definitions.  <\/p><p> We broadly welcome this because we see it as an additional support in a time of crisis, but there needs to be good boundaries around it.

One of the recommendations of Mental Health Reform is that there should be a requirement in care plans to develop a decision-making strategy and that there would be certain constraints around care plans.  I take that point around supported decision-making, but I want to widen it out.  What should be the framework for care plans for the individual, but also for the care team such that they know what the constituent parts of it are?

I want first to note that earlier drafts of the heads of the Bill reference \"care and recovery plans\", but the reference now is to \"care plan\".  That would be a concern.  We have to think about what we are trying to achieve here, namely, better recovery outcomes for individuals using our services.  That is about getting them back to a life of their own choosing.<\/p> <p>  I refer to my opening statement where I referenced the individual placement and support programme which gets people back to work.  That is a very legitimate goal for every person.  It is a recovery goal.  It would be important that when we are talking about care and recovery planning we are very clear that this belongs to the service user or the patient.  It is the person's plan.  The role of the treating team is to facilitate the individual's personal recovery objectives, be that to get a job, to go back to college or to be able to walk to a bus stop.  For me, the process is around care, treatment and the recovery interventions which lead to a state of well-being for people.  We need to empower people to be able to fulfil their role in their own recovery journey.  That means that they are an active partner and able to lead on decisions that have huge impacts on their own lives.  We need to provide opportunities to empower them through recovery education, recovery colleges, peer support and advocacy so that the person is able to make the most informed choice about his or her life.  We come from a culture where, unfortunately, there is an expectation that people cannot recover.  Everybody has the potential to recover and to achieve personal goals no matter how lofty or how little they are.  We need a recovery and care plan approach that supports that, but also supports teams to be able to work in that way and to understand their role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Care plans already exist.

In terms of oversight, that is already contained in Mental Health Commission reports, but we would hope that with the strengthened statutory footing of such it would, perhaps, lead to increases in adherence.  This cannot be a tick box exercise.  There is further work needed on what a care and recovery plan looks like, which is individual to each person.  Each person has his or her own recovery journey.  That is a piece of work that we would recommend could be done over the coming years to support the centres in rolling this out and ensuring the service users have access to a really strong care and recovery plan process.<\/p> <p>  On how the plans relate to the assisted decision-making, I will ask Ms Grogan to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Coyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I have had a quick look at my notes on the Mental Health Commission and that issue.  Articles 12 and 14 of the CRPD require that mental health laws are replaced by consensual practices and services based on a social and human rights model rather than a medical model.  This comes back to the person-centred approach, working with the person on his or her care plan.  A welcome addition to the heads of the Bill relating to mental health is the review board.<\/p><p>There will be a psychosocial assessment, because, again, it is about looking at the person as a whole, including their housing situation, their financial situation, their supports and at all of those kinds of aspects.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was passed in 2015 and there has been a huge amount of work done to get us to this point where it will hopefully all be amended and commenced by June 2022.  The decision support service has been doing great work on having open consultations on its codes of practice and guidelines.  There are, therefore, many opportunities for people with lived experience and family members, supporters and carers to feed in to the process.  Members probably saw the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" piece a couple of weeks ago on wardship and on how it will be replaced but it will take up to three years for people who are already in the wardship system to be processed and to be given new decision making supports, depending on the level of need for them.<\/p><p> One of the things around the capacity assessments and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is that the heads call for two professionals to undertake the capacity assessments, whereas in Mental Health Reform's submission we called for three professionals so that there is a broader view from mental health professionals and not necessarily from the same cohort.  On that as well, our My Voice Matters research piece, which was done in 2019, is the largest piece of research of people who access mental health services, and there was another one done on the family supporters and carers.  A huge number of people want to be more involved in the care plans and maybe there is an over-reliance on the medical model rather than treatment as a whole, which includes talk therapies and all of that kind of stuff.  It is really about what is right for the person.  As Ms Coyle said, it is not a tick box exercise; people are not going to fit neatly into standardised care plans, therefore we have to meet them where they are at. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Ber Grogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I wish to come in for a second round.

In the statement on mental health reform, it was said that 27 children have been admitted to nine adult units.  What happens in these situations?

We would ask the Government and the Oireachtas to be ambitious in the goals that it sets and to ensure there is agreement that this should not be happening and, therefore, we should put it on a statutory footing.<\/p> <p>  The understanding from the service is that this is done as a last resort and these are not decisions that are taken lightly.  Unfortunately, it speaks to the availability of services and Mental Health Reform would advocate that everybody, in particular, children and young people, gets the supports and services they need at the earliest possible time so that they may not need to be admitted in an emergency into an adult inpatient unit.  While we need to ensure that this does not happen, we need to look at how we prevent that and go back to the root causes, which is investing in the services that are available to children and young people to ensure they are getting the supports and the services they need and that they are not spending up to a year on a waiting list and perhaps ending up in a situation where they need to be admitted.

Many of the areas have been already covered so I do not propose to rehash them.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was mentioned.  We appear to be tripping over ourselves in terms of that legislation and this Bill.  Head 7 of the Bill deals with the capacity issues in regard to people making decisions.  Head 87 deals with the nursing home supports scheme.  I have listened to what the witnesses had to say about how people are being treated in the system.  We know that the system is poorly staffed and under-funded.  Many of our nursing homes are pre-1970, pre-1960 or even pre-1950.  Today, we are discussing how we can bring about change on paper.  In my experience, over the years the system has not moved quickly or progressed in a positive manner.<\/p> <p>  The term \"person-centred\" was mentioned.  In 2018, the Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care was told that the State was spending roughly &euro;10 million on cognitive therapy and various other therapies, but it was spending more than &euro;400 million on medicines.  There is a massive gap when it comes to person-centred assistance.  This legislation is welcome and we are going in the right direction.  My biggest fear is that it will be 2023 before all of this is ironed out and the Bill is enacted, as it should be.  There are a couple of sections in the Bill dealing with law and the inability to provide this care as provided for in the UNCRPD.  I do not think there is one centre in the Thirty-two Counties that deals persons with a specific mental health issue and, say, autism.  I do not like to use the word \"disability\".  It labels people.  For many years, people with a disability were labelled as people who were not sick but nevertheless they were tagged and this caused them to be excluded.  We have not legislated on a rights basis for these people.<\/p> <p>  The following is an open question to anybody who might want to answer it.  If this Bill, as currently drafted, were to be enacted in late 2022 or early 2023, what would be the biggest worry in terms of its enforcement?  The Bill provides that a person with a disability needs a special, individual care plan.<\/p><p>Let us be honest.  We know the system is not capable of providing that.  In terms of the assisted-decision making capacity element, reference was made to coercion and I see there is a piece in the Bill that indicates you do not automatically become a guarantor for somebody because you are related to them.  I welcome that, but it is about the ability to provide all these services.  We know the system is creaking at the moment, yet I feel we are going backwards with mental health.<\/p><p> I will finish on this point.  We are probably in the worst pandemic that we have ever seen in our lives.  People are losing their jobs.  You could write a book on marriages.  We are not planning for what is going to happen next year in March, April or May.  In terms of where we are, what would be the witnesses' biggest fear about the capacity to provide what is outlined in the Bill?  Perhaps they could break it down into percentages.  Implementation of the Bill in its entirety would be 100% but, for example, it might only be possible to implement 10% of it.  Do the witnesses understand where I am coming from?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#G01200","speaker":"1452","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Buckley for the question.  I am happy to give the first answer.  I acknowledge that the process of setting out the legislation does not directly speak to issues of resourcing and funding.  While, on paper, this is a fundamental change to how services are going to be delivered and supported, we must also recognise and acknowledge that for this Bill to be implemented as it is envisaged it needs adequate resourcing and funding behind it.  It is important that is acknowledged.  We are concerned about language contained in the Bill such as \"in so far as possible\".  Human rights should not be dependent on funding or on what is or is not easy to do and what might be more complex.  We need funding and we need leadership to push it through.  We must also be aware of the people who will come under the legislation.  The focus must always be on the last source.  We must ensure all appropriate alternatives to inpatient mental healthcare and treatment are adequately resourced and supported by the Government.  That includes access to early intervention at the point of care.  There will always be a need for acute care, but we can perhaps look at reducing it and ensuring individuals get the support when and where they need it in their own community.  Resourcing and leadership are the two big levers that are needed to make this happen.  Aside from resourcing, the Mental Health Forum has been calling for the reinstatement of the director of mental health post within the HSE.  It would be very important to have a senior decision maker reporting directly to the CEO of the HSE to move forward these strategic pieces of legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Coyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Ryan want to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#H00300","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Buckley for his question.  The word \"vision\" is used in the mental health policy, Sharing the Vision.  I would like to reflect on that a little.  I came into this work about ten years ago and I bring my own lived mental health experience.  That is why I am employed.  The progress we have made in the past ten years is significant.  The first point is to acknowledge the will and desire to try to create more recovery-orientated services.  The 2006 policy, which has a butterfly logo - the name escapes me but someone might fill it in - as Ms Coyle said, was about trying to move care from the institutions into the community.  That work is still going on.  A lot has been achieved.  Sharing the Vision needs to build on that in terms of more social and peer-led services that will allow people to partner more in their own recovery.  The fear for me is that we do not miss the opportunity in the Bill to embed the structures that would allow that to happen.

As we speak today, some people are not being given chances within the mental health system for their own decision-making capacity.  Family members, who have their best interests in mind, want to look after them.  I know we should not rush things, but surely we should take a parallel approach in getting the Bill through.  It is great to see so much collaboration between services.  It is about time.  In other committees I have asked why all those involved cannot get into one room and agree one plan rather than be divided and have five individual plans.  It is a common-sense approach.  I have gone off the point.  We are pushing mental health forward.  Do the witnesses think there should be something running parallel with the Bill to try to start putting things in place so that when the Bill eventually crosses the end line, we will have appropriate buildings, services, back-up services and integration with the community?

I found the conversation and the reading material fascinating.  I have what I hope will be considered a constructive observation to make on what Mr. Ryan said.  His paper was so full of acronyms that I kept getting lost in it.  We all do that when we are in the system.  I got the thrust of what he was saying.<\/p> <p>  As someone who had a professional connection with mental health, when ordinary members of the public talk about updating the Mental Health Act, we must be aware that this is the very acute end of the mental health piece.  What struck me was that it is no wonder people are reluctant to come forward for fear of stigmatisation given that mental health covers everything from the mild to the seriously acute.  I listened to the previous discussions about restraint.<\/p><p>I am aware it is a comfortable place for legislators to comment on this and that there are extreme circumstances.  It is like asking the Garda to be physically restrained with prisoners.  Sometimes that is regrettably not possible.  Our role as legislators is to ensure those occasions when it has to be used are appropriate, humane and person-centred, which is what I liked about the Bill.  I ask Mr. Ryan not to take that to heart as it is not a criticism.  It is just that as I read through it, I suspected that Mr. Ryan was under pressure to get this done and that he was used to dealing with a particular audience.  I found it difficult to follow and I had to read it a few times, and I am reasonably bright.  Other than that I have been fascinated by the inputs made.<\/p><p> I have never come across the phrase \"experts by experience\" before and I really liked it.  That would represent such a shift.  We traditionally had such experts by experience in the health system who had no qualifications and then we moved towards a qualifications-centred approach, which was appropriate as well.  Can Mr. Ryan elaborate on that phrase?  We are talking about people who do not necessarily have to have PhDs or master&rsquo;s degrees but who have been immersed in this in a caring role or in an assisted role?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#H00700","speaker":"1572","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I apologise for the anachronisms.  I thought I had minimised those but the Deputy is highlighting the need for all of us to be aware of language and how important it is that it is as accessible as possible.  When the Bill is finalised it would be important that it is in language that is accessible to those it affects most.<\/p> <p>  The phrase the Deputy mentioned refers to people who have had their own lived mental health experiences and would now be in recovery.  In our traditional model of healthcare we would go to the doctor and expect him or her to fix us if we had a broken toe.  Our role is then to do whatever he or she says to do, be it to  rest or whatever else.  In a mental health setting the people who have to recover are experts in their own lives and they know what recovery means and what they want to achieve.  These people will have lived with a mental health challenge 24-7, possibly for years, so they will understand it a lot better than anyone else.  That also applies to their family members or supporters.  They will be able to recognise what is going well for someone, what triggers them and what helped them.  There is that expertise of living with a mental health challenge that only a person who is going through it has.  We would call that person an expert by experience and we would say from an organisational point of view that this expertise of lived experience can be used in a service improvement function.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy just gave an example of language, accessibility, time of appointments and simple things like that which work for people.  There is also a therapeutic value for the person and for others.  That is why we have concepts like recovery education, which are led by people with lived experience to say that they had condition X, this is their understanding of it and this is what they did to help.  Other people who are going through a similar experience find that beneficial.  We have also moved to integrate that experience into the HSE more systematically by developing the role of peer support workers, who are people with their own lived experience who are now in recovery and are part of multidisciplinary teams.  The Bill needs to ensure that it recognises the value of experts by experience and they must be incorporated into it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I like that idea of incorporation and multidisciplinary teams.

Is it based on the expertise of the medics involved - in other words, they work with a patient and they realise that he or she is an expert by experience who could fill the role?

We have to be careful that we are not creating arbitrary divides in people&rsquo;s experiences and so on.  Every person who has a mental health challenge is an expert in his or her experience.  That is a valid experience which needs to be honoured and listened to.  When introducing people to the multidisciplinary teams it is important to listen to their experiences because that is an important resource in how they will co-produce the intervention or treatment with the person.  As that person moves into recovery, he or she overcomes the challenge and starts to get back to work or achieve life goals, and that is his or her recovery experience.  On reflection he or she is able to objectively think about what happened, what the experience was like, how he or she recovered and what he or she has learned from it.  When these people are able to reconcile their experiences, then they are in a position to share it with others in a more formal way.  We would call these people experts by experience at that point.

Over the past two years the Covid pandemic has resulted in considerable discussion on mental health, well-being and looking after our mental health.  However, as the Deputy said, these are for people at the more acute end.  In preparing for today, I looked at some of the HSE national clinical programmes, one of which is the early intervention in psychosis programme.  One of our member organisations, Shine, has a particular interest in that programme.<\/p> <p>  During Covid, we had partnered with the HSE on a youth mental health Covid online webinar.  There was the voice of a lived experience from someone who started to hear voices and such and did not feel he could talk to people about it, whereas other people were talking about going for a walk and getting out in the air.  The clinical programme has 20 years of data, according to which an estimated 1,500 people could develop a psychosis disorder in their lifetime.  There would be a delay of between 18 months and two years in looking for the support and treatment because people try to get through this themselves.  They feel there is still a stigma and no conversations around this mental health difficulty.<\/p> <p>  On the economical side of it, it is said to be an invest-to-save programme.  For each &euro;1 invested in the early intervention in psychosis programme, &euro;18 is then saved by reducing admissions, relapse and such.  Some very good national clinical programmes are happening in some parts of the country.  It would be a pity if it were to be a postcode lottery of where they can be accessed.<\/p> <p>  It also comes back to the community and voluntary sectors, which are doing great work in their communities and having the first point of contact before it gets to that point of needing acute care.  If those facilities are locally accessible and affordable in our communities, it is hoped a greater cohort of those starting to go through psychosis, eating disorders or other mental health difficulties will be caught.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Ber Grogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":378,"content":"<p>The need for an independent complaints commission has come up a couple of times, especially in mental health reform.

Mental Health Reform has been raising this since 2012.  We did a paper on complaints mechanisms.  In Wales, there are concerns teams to which people can complain.  In New Zealand, there is an independent advocate called the health and disability commissioner who is the ombudsperson for mental health.  In 2018,  the World Health Organization's European region did a piece about the rights and standards of care for institutional care.  Some 28 countries in that report have different independent complaints mechanisms.  Even though the heads of the Bill state people should be informed of the facility's complaints mechanisms, that does not go far enough at all.<\/p> <p>  In the session with the Mental Health Commission, Deputy Ward asked about what recourse or routes there were for the people refused care.  In its submission on the heads of the Bill, Mental Health Reform has also called for the capture of the data of people who cannot get community-level care to find out who is being missed.  That may be separate from the independent complaints mechanism and complete wishful thinking that we would have these data on people who are not accessing community care.

I usually get in earlier than this.  All the good questions have been asked at this stage but that is part of stepping in as Cathaoirleach today.<\/p> <p>  I will bring up something that has not been touched on yet.  I agree with the statement that this is a once in a generation opportunity to positively change mental health legislation.  It is probably the biggest piece of work this subcommittee will do in its lifetime.  We also need to make sure we have the resources in place that will underpin, or will be the foundations of, this legislation.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Hourigan touched on the authorised officers.  Last week, the Mental Health Commission said that they do much of the work.  My concern is the HSE is not planning properly for this and that the law will be delayed as a result of these authorised officers not being in place.  All the good work we are doing at this subcommittee and all the good work you are doing as stakeholders could be delayed because the authorised officers will not be in place.<\/p> <p>  For example, in the past couple of weeks I have been doing a little bit of digging and a bit of research on it and I tabled a couple of parliamentary questions.  In 2019, there were 159 authorised officers in the State.  Currently, in 2021, there are 126.  The number is going down.  Someone mentioned postcode politics.  In my area of community health organisation, CHO, 7 it has dropped from 25 authorised officers down to 11, which seems to be the biggest decrease in any area.<\/p> <p>  We say language is important.  The response I received from the HSE stated that there is a review going on and that based on this review there may be a need to recruit additional authorised officers.  \"May\", again, is back in there.  Does anyone have insights into this review?  Is this Bill part of that review?  What is the importance of having authorised officers in place as soon as possible?  Those are my first questions for whoever wants to take them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#L00900","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I can start and I thank the Deputy for his questions.  It is my colleagues on the business side of operations who would deal with that sort of thing, so I cannot give specific details on the review.  I can just talk about the feedback in terms of service user experience around authorised officers.<\/p> <p>  It is important to understand the role.  It is the medical practitioner who will make the decision to admit somebody to a unit or not.  The role of the authorised officer is to support of the person and the family and in regard to the accountability of that process.  In practice, a family member or whoever will still have to make a phone call saying that a loved one is in distress and may need admission.  That has not changed.  We need to ensure they are supported in that process.  Who can become an authorised officer should be part of the review.  We mentioned peer support workers earlier and how they currently cannot perform that duty.  Therefore, we should look at who else might be able to provide that service.<\/p><p>In terms of resourcing, last year there were something like 2,000 involuntary admissions and maybe there is a need to map where they happen and to see where the need is.  I imagine that would be part of the review.  The point I want to make is that we cannot lose sight of what the role is.  It is a supportive role for individuals and families, and it is about how best we can do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021113000002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I have a quick question which Mr. Ryan may not have the answer to.

There is a need for us, as a subcommittee, to make sure it is in the report.  I would like witnesses' opinion on this in the context of the lack of early intervention for children.  At present, 8,500 children are waiting for primary care psychology appointments, for example.  Another 2,500 children are waiting for appointments with the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS.  Some of these children are waiting up to two years for appointments.

The amendment Bill is set to provide 16- and 17-year-olds with the ability to give or withdraw their consent to their mental health treatment.

If the assisted decision-making (capacity) (amendment) Bill is passed prior to the updated mental health Bill, it will be based on the Mental Health Act 2001 and there would be a subsequent amendment needed to Part 8 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, the part under the auspices of the Department of Health.  It will require further amendments to ensure the mental health Act will be fully commenced and that the supports will be available for under-18s in the context of their health care because the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act goes beyond that to include financial remits and property rights, which is not the case and is very specific.

It is great that the Acting Chairman is on both committees.  It was also in our human rights analysis, our expert piece, from National University of Ireland, Galway.  It flagged the lacuna, and we acknowledge that the Department officials who have worked on the reform of the mental health Act have tried to work around it and have said that the Mental Health Commission will come up with guidelines.

For members attending remotely, from within the Leinster House complex, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect to their contributions to today&rsquo;s meeting.  That means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person does who is physically present.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privileges they enjoy and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.

I will make a short statement here which I believe has been circulated to the committee but I will read it in any event.<\/p> <p>  I am the principal adviser for the marine environment in the water division of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I am joined today by my colleague Dr. Oliver &Oacute; Cadhla who is a scientific policy adviser in the Department.  The marine environment section has, among other things, responsibility for Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of the 2008 EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, or the MSFD, and the 1992 OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic.  I am also the current chairman of the OSPAR Commission.  <\/p> <p>  I will now provide the committee with a synopsis of the process so far and the next steps to expand Ireland&rsquo;s network of marine protected areas, MPAs for short.  However please note that I cannot provide an update on national processes or actions under the birds and habitats directives or the Wildlife Acts, which come under the responsibility of the Department&rsquo;s heritage division.  <\/p> <p>  The background to the marine protected areas in Ireland is as follows.  In one line, our national mission is to ensure that Ireland has clean, healthy, biologically diverse, productive and sustainably used seas that are resilient to the effects of climate change within our broader Atlantic Ocean environment. This is not just for now but also for future generations.  The marine environment supports our climate, our economy, our coastal communities, our cultural traditions and heritage, our health and our wellbeing. <\/p> <p>  From a legal standpoint, Ireland&rsquo;s drive to establish marine protected areas comes from the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which sets out to achieve and maintain good environmental status, GES, in the EU&rsquo;s marine area by 2020. <\/p> <p>  In 2016 Ireland&rsquo;s MSFD programme of measures included a measure to develop a national strategy to create and manage Ireland's network of MPAs.  This was part of a broad suite of measures aimed at achieving or maintaining good environmental status.  Both the MSFD and OSPAR adopt an ecosystem-based approach with the aim of ensuring that the combined effect of all human activities and the health of the marine environment are kept in balance.  GES is assessed and updated every six years by the member states across the EU using a broad swathe of measurable parameters, ranging from the health of species and habitats to the levels of pollution in the sea including marine litter and noise, for example.<\/p> <p>  However, with the exception of protected sites designated under the EU birds and habitats directives and the Wildlife Acts, Ireland has not had a legal tool with which to define, identify, designate and manage MPAs.  As a result, many species, habitats and processes occurring in our extensive maritime area have fallen outside the scope of area-based conservation, with consequent risks to marine biodiversity and ecosystem services that are of benefit to people and nature.<\/p> <p>  The MPA process to date is as follows.  Shortly after the establishment of the marine environment section in 2019, we initiated a process aimed at expanding Ireland&rsquo;s network of MPAs. This work was further underpinned in the programme for Government in June 2020, which contains commitments to realise our outstanding target of 10% MPA coverage in Irish waters as soon as is practicable, aiming for 30% coverage by 2030, and to develop comprehensive legislation for the identification, designation and management of MPAs.<\/p> <p>  The first step in this process was to convene an advisory group to provide independent expert advice and recommendations on the processes required and the challenges to be addressed in expanding Ireland&rsquo;s MPA network.  This group was chaired by Professor Tasman Crowe, director of the UCD Earth Institute.  It had its first meeting on 18 December 2019 and it subsequently met on a monthly basis, including remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the same one we still have. <\/p> <p>  As an important part of its research and deliberations, the advisory group gathered the views of more than 100 key societal, community, business and sectoral stakeholders.  The information gathered by the advisory group in August to September 2020 fed into its final report.  On 22 October 2020 the group submitted its report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and the Minister of State for heritage and electoral reform, Deputy Malcolm Noonan.  The full report  was subsequently translated and then published by the Department on 26 January of this year.<\/p> <p>  The report provides a wealth of material and includes a proposed MPA definition; an overview of existing protected sites in Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area; plus analyses and recommendations on what should be protected, why it should be protected and how Ireland should go about doing so.<\/p><p>In general terms, the expert group found that marine protected areas, MPAs, can be considered to be geographically defined maritime areas that provide levels of protection to achieve a set of conservation objectives.  While actively supporting long-term conservation, MPAs can also support economic activity.  Protection can go well together with human activities, provided those activities go together with the conservation objectives.  This can be through conserving areas of particular importance to marine ecosystems and ensuring human activity is kept at a level that will protect and conserve biological diversity and natural productivity as well as protecting human health.  MPAs can also help reduce the effect of climate change and ocean acidification by ensuring marine ecosystems are healthy and resilient and can capture and sequester carbon naturally.  There also exists a set of long-term conservation measures known as other effective area-based conservation measures, OECMs, that the report concluded could also contribute to overarching conservation goals.<\/p><p> A public consultation phase centred on the report and the wider MPA process began in mid-February 2021 and ran until the end of July.  This consultation and associated communications by the Department encouraged all stakeholders and the wider public to get involved by sharing their views on the process by which Ireland&rsquo;s network of MPAs will be expanded into the future.  In total the Department received approximately 2,400 individual submissions from members of the public and other stakeholders.  An independent review and analysis of all responses to the public consultation is being carried out at the moment.  The findings and conclusions from this analysis will be published in the form of a detailed report.  We anticipate this report will be completed and published in early 2022.<\/p><p> We have now commenced work on developing a general scheme for new MPA legislation.  The development of this legislation is expected to continue into 2022.  Its formulation, structure and legal provisions will be informed among other things by the requirements of Article 13(4) of the marine strategy framework directive, MSFD, the OSPAR Convention, other international agreements, European Community level policies and principles, and supporting strategies such as the European Green Deal and the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030.<\/p><p> While we cannot say precisely where the new MPAs will be placed, we have good information about the potential features that may need area-based conservation beyond that afforded by the birds and habitats directives and the wildlife Acts.  These include species and habitats listed as threatened and declining by OSPAR; the protection of features and ecosystem components that play a role in climate processes; the need for the network to be representative, coherent and connected; and the overarching advice and recommendations of the MPA advisory group and stakeholders that have participated in the MPA process so far.  It is important to note we also have extensive monitoring programmes in place to provide high-quality and up to date information on these features.<\/p><p> From our work on the MPA process so far, it is heartening to see the keen interest from society and stakeholders in Ireland&rsquo;s achievement of its national targets and overarching conservation goals. This ongoing involvement and engagement will be central to the process in 2022 and thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cronin.

When the committee produced our pre-legislative scrutiny report on what was originally known as the marine planning and development management Bill, one of our recommendations was that such a Bill would include scope for designation of marine protected areas or that we would legislate separately for maritime protected areas.

As the Chair said, as a committee we recommended, as part of our pre-legislative scrutiny report, that there would be legislation brought forward.  It is encouraging to hear there are heads being prepared.<\/p> <p>  The programme for Government has set out an ambition to have 30% of the marine area designated by 2030.  I am mindful the Department was only set up in 2019 and it has been working through a pandemic.  I congratulate the staff on the progress made to date.  It would be helpful for us to understand the pathway the Department sees to achieving that 30% target by 2030 if the witnesses could talk a little bit about that.  They mentioned that, in the interim, the Department is undertaking extensive monitoring programmes.  Will the witnesses share with us some of the specifics of the extent of the monitoring programmes that are being operated in the meantime?

There are two questions, the first is our view on the pathway to achieving the 30% by 2030 and then details on our monitoring programmes.  In regard to the first question, in Ireland at the moment we have about 2.4% designated as protected sites.  They are not legally defined as marine protected areas but they carry out the same effect.  These are under the birds and habitats directives and the wildlife Acts.  It is a long distance from 2.4% to 30%.  To go into that in more detail, it is noticeable that the coastal zone in Ireland, that first mile and out to six miles, has quite a number of designated spaces at the moment.  More than 50% or 60% of that space has already been designated.  This tells us already what we need to know, which is that to reach the 30% target, we are going to have to look at much larger marine protected areas.  They are probably going to have to be offshore as well.  When we look at the definitions we hope to develop for marine protected areas, there are some protection measures that already exist that may qualify and that would allow us to achieve some rapid progress, for example, on reaching this 30% figure.  What I am speaking about specifically is that there are already long-term fisheries control measures, for example, for deep water habitats.  These may also, depending on how we develop our legislation, provide the basis for marine protected areas.  We should be able to make progress.<\/p> <p>  The question I have been asked before is, will we hit the 30%?  I believe it is possible, from the position I sit in.  We will need this legislation in place.  With the legislation in place and with the contribution and partnership of the stakeholders and those who have a relationship either through their history or their economic practices, we certainly can meet that target.  Large MPAs will be required and they will need to be offshore.  We have a good deal of information already about those.<\/p> <p>  The second question was on details about the monitoring programme.  Under the marine strategy framework directive, we have a comprehensive monitoring programme we update every six years.  It measures all of the pollution pressures and other pressures such as marine litter and human-produced noise.  It also measures the effect of other human activities such as commercial fishing.  It also measures all of the biodiversity components, so it measures the condition of the sea floor and the health of non-commercial stocks - not just mammals we would be aware of but also such things as deep water sharks and non-commercial species.  We are also hoping to develop monitoring that will help us to understand the effects of climate change on the ocean.<\/p><p>That would be important for the future to provide resilience for future marine protected areas.  We have that overarching monitoring programme.  We then have specific focused monitoring programmes, and while they do not fall directly to me, we participate in them.  These include the ObSERVE programme, which is a partnership between a number of Departments where there is monitoring over a number of seasons and years of large mammals and seabirds from an aerial point of view and from ship sightings.<\/p><p> We have a number of these programmes.  There are other programmes in place with regard to commercial fisheries, such as a data collection framework.  Those programmes are under way all the time.  When we look at the sea floor, on which we have done significant work in Government to understand, we have a long-term programme run by the Marine Institute to map the sea floor.  This provides us with much of the information we need to make decisions about where we believe the MPAs are most likely to be and where the unique things that need protection are likely to exist.  Does that answer the question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":424,"content":"<p>It does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#C00200","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cronin for the presentation.  We have been waiting some time for this.  Obviously, we have been dealing with the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021 for some time.  As Mr. Cronin knows, international best practice strongly advocates that if one is introducing the kind of planning regime we have just introduced for the maritime area, especially given the scale of offshore renewable wind energy we need, it would be better if offshore planning and wind provision were done in parallel with marine protected areas.<\/p> <p>  We will have a significant time lag and I was hoping Mr. Cronin could be more specific in terms of the timeframes for the legislation.  Some of it is beyond his control and is covered by the Business Committee.  However, when does he think the general scheme will be published and when does he hope to have the legislation introduced and passed through the Oireachtas?<\/p> <p>  My understanding from talking to experts in the field is it can sometimes take up to two years from the legislation to the point at which one really gets into large-scale designation.  That raises a serious concern about the legacy wind farm projects that we will progress prior to the establishment of the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, with the Minister providing the maritime consents.  That raises the question of mitigation measures.  Some people have argued for a situation in which large areas are designated on a precautionary basis as protected areas and certain areas then opt out.  It seems the Department is not considering that approach.  If not, has the Department considered it and why is it not adopting or advocating this approach?<\/p> <p>  What mitigation measures is the Department advocating, especially in the east coast and those areas that are the sites of the current seven legacy projects?  While obviously wind energy and biodiversity protection can co-exist, in the absence of designations and adequate data, it is not clear how that can be done in the most appropriate way.  Mr. Cronin is right in that a significant amount of the area one mile offshore is currently protected.  However, in very large areas, there is virtually no enforcement of that and the protections have very little value.  Will Mr. Cronin tell us what additional measures will be put in place to ensure designation is not just theoretical but is backed up by real enforcement and restoration where required?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#C00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for those questions.  I will see if I captured all of them here.  I have made some notes.  I will try to take them from the top, and if I miss any of them, I ask the Deputy to highlight it to me and I will try to pick them up again.  If there is anything on which I cannot be completely specific with the Deputy, I can pick it up again in a written submission, if necessary.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's first question was on the timing.  Our timeframe for the general scheme is the third quarter of 2022.  We have identified and have the additional resources on my team to start working on this at the start of the year.  We are talking to our legal team in the Department about setting up the project plan for that, but we have done considerable thinking about this, as the Deputy can well understand, and we have a clear idea of what we need.  We can get a general scheme together and published by quarter 3 of 2022.<\/p> <p>  We foresee a significant involvement needed from those not inside in the Department, both from the stakeholders who have shown a keen interest in being involved and other Departments that have a role in marine governance.  However, we can do that.  Everybody is well aware of where we are at this time.<\/p> <p>  We can have legislation in place in 2023.  We would not be starting from a blank sheet.  There are good models and examples of best practice both in our north Atlantic and European regions and further afield in countries with a similar profile to us and a similar marine governance arrangement.  We have been studying the background of this.  We had colleagues on the expert advisory group from Marine Scotland and from the Northern Ireland Administration who supported us in the drafting of that report.  We can make significant progress on that.  That is the timing issue.<\/p> <p>  The other question was whether there was a potential for time lag.  The subject of much conversation has been whether the time lag is real.  The first question is whether there is a real time lag and the second is whether there is a spatial overlap.  While we are working on the MPA legislation, other work will also be taking place on designations under the birds and habitats directives.  I do not have information about when those designations are likely to occur, but there is a clear sense of urgency about the completion of those designations.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the current locations and potential identified locations for the offshore renewables sector and where large offshore marine protected areas are likely to occur, the spatial overlap does not appear to be material, from my study of the situation.  If one was 100 km off the west coast of Ireland and 1 km down on a reef system, there would be no opportunity for wind farms to have an effect there.  The key point is whether there is a time lag and a spatial overlap-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Obviously the legacy projects are east coast, not west coast.

I had not finished the answer.  There are a couple of other points.  Notwithstanding all of that, the Deputy raised the point of us having an overall, global designation of some sort and then have these exception points within it.  This comes down to how we manage the marine space.  Do we go for 100% well-managed, where we have a good environmental status to meet, or do we only apply that in exceptions?<\/p> <p>  The way we implement the marine strategy framework directive is that everywhere, all the time, must achieve good environmental status.  That is the legal commitment.  Good environmental status has numerical values attached to it, known as threshold values, which are one of the components of good environmental status.  These values are based on how much pollution there is, what level of fishing is allowed or how much litter is allowed on the beach, if any.  These targets are then set up and they become part of our journey towards making sure everything we do contributes to the protection of biodiversity.  This is overarching above and beyond the laws that protect the individual species and habitats.<\/p> <p>  No matter what activity Ireland decides to use its marine space for, those activities, when considered in aggregation with all the other activities we decide to use it for, it must be demonstrated they are meeting good environmental status.  If they do not meet good environmental status, we have to have an adaptation to how we carry out our activity.  We have to adjust our activity through a programme of measures.<\/p><p>I do not see that biodiversity is likely to be explicitly harmed.  I made the point in my opening statement that it is not a binary choice between unfettered human activity or extreme protection.  There is the possibility of both co-existing.  A process has to be undergone and there are several legislative measures with which every activity must comply, whether the environmental impact assessment directive, the birds and habitats directives or any other directives.  The national marine planning framework sets it out as a legal requirement that all activities that form part of our marine spatial plan will meet that environmental standard.  If we decide to do something with a particular sector, whichever sector it is, it is not necessarily the case that we will automatically default to environmental degradation.  That is what I would say in regard to the time lag and the question of whether we should have widespread protection and then have exclusions.  The whole maritime space is already subject to a high environmental standard.<\/p><p> The question of whether biodiversity and activity can co-exist is an important issue for people to consider.  It was a key issue we discussed in our wider engagement with different sectors.  If we create a marine protected area that has a specific conservation objective, where, for example, there is something on the sea floor we want to protect, we need to think about what activities, such as tourism or some level of fishing, can co-exist with that conservation objective.  It depends on what the scientific advice tells us about the thing we are trying to protect and the status to which we want to get it.  It is about the current state and the desired state.  It is not necessarily a binary choice between having no human activity or full human activity with no protection.  Within that spectrum, of course, we can have marine reserves and make those choices.  It is important to say that the legislation will be shaped strongly by members, which is something to consider as we bring forward the general scheme.<\/p><p> The Deputy also referred to management plans.  In the work we have done so far, we have been very conscious of what management plans might look like in order to achieve a conservation objective, how they might be developed and who might have to implement them.  We see them as being central to how we bring forward the designation of marine protected areas.  These actions start on paper but it is the choices that are made after the work begins on paper that really makes a difference.  When we look towards the creation of a plan, which involves the gathering of the evidence to decide where the designations go and the processes that will underpin them, whether scientific or participation processes, it will ultimately be about the management activities.  Those activities can take a number of forms, including everything from interventions in a human activity to education, the marking on navigation charts and so on.  There are many different aspects that can take the form of management plans.  Without them, it is difficult for us to be able to demonstrate that designations are doing what they set out to do, which is to protect the marine environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":430,"content":"<p>There will be time on subsequent rounds if Deputy &Oacute; Broin wants to come back in and expand on any of the points raised.<\/p> <p>  The legislative timeline Mr. Cronin indicated seems positive and it is one to which I would like to adhere.

In that area of 13.5 million sq. km, there are 555 marine protected areas, which is not an insubstantial number.  Those marine areas are protected at both a national level, having perhaps been established under the implementation of European legislation, and on a wider level.  We also have 11 marine protected areas in the high seas, all of which were established under the OSPAR Convention.  Last October, we designated a 600,000 sq. km marine protected area for seabirds.  The north-east Atlantic is the best example we have of the scientific, participation and designations processes.  It is a great template and we are very lucky to be in that position.<\/p> <p>  When we get down to looking at particular administrations and how they manage this issue, there are different things we can learn from what is being done in different places.  We have a certain legal code in Ireland and we can look to our neighbours on the island of Britain, the different administrations there and how they have created marine protected areas.  We have some very good examples from our colleagues in Scotland in terms of the processes they underwent, the legislation they have and how it works.  We have a good working relationship with the officials in the Scottish Administration and they certainly will be contacted by us as we commence this work.  There are other member states in Europe that face similar challenges to those we face, particularly in regard to the types of activities we have in our marine space at the moment, the activities we hope to have and the participation and stakeholder processes.  We have good examples from northern Spain and France, for instance, as to how we might create a model of marine protected areas that has strong involvement in coastal areas.  We are very lucky to be able to rely on those examples.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the long-term protection measures I mentioned earlier, known as other effective conservation measures, we have done a lot of work with other countries in the north-east Atlantic, including both EU and non-EU countries.  Again, we can borrow some of those experiences to ensure, most importantly, that the designations are underpinned by the right amount of science and that they have a strong mandate because they are well supported.

In addressing questions under the second cycle of the ObSERVE programme, we see that, again, we are working to provide certainty not only to decision-makers for the marine environment and biodiversity but also to the decision-makers who have to consider things like consent and the size and scale of various activities.  We have information needs.  We have published knowledge gaps, that is, things we know we do not know, for example in our marine strategy framework directive report of 2020.  We actively seek information on those gaps through these monitoring programmes.  We have in place arrangements with other Government bodies and we are very open to the concept of agreeing with others to provide us with that information if they can provide it at an appropriate scale and at an appropriate time in order that we may make these decisions.

Could the witnesses answer the question about overfishing of some of our protected areas?<\/p> <p>  I will say it again: I ask the witnesses to explain this to me in plain English rather than technical terms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#E00500","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I will do my very best.  The Senator asked a couple of questions.  One was about the monitoring programmes.  I think she also raised a point about the paper parks.  If I could say one thing about marine protected areas, it would be that this will be a process and an ongoing journey.  It will not involve the drawing of a curtain, a map being produced and someone saying, \"Here you are.  The lines are on the map.  Everybody can go home now.\"  There has to be a monitoring process that underpins this, as the Senator rightly points out, that involves going out there and measuring what is happening.  It was one way at the start.  We put in place some control measures.  It is now in a different state.  We hope it has got better.  There has to be an adaptive process that underpins this once we set conservation measures.  We may want to protect it, we may want it to be this much better, we may want twice as many whales or we may want to protect the kelp forests or something like that.  We will need to go out there, so there will have to be a process.  Then we will have to decide whether the actions we are taking are good enough.  If they are not, we must take more action.  One of the key points from our engagement with stakeholders and on our own journey on this has been to understand that we will not say of this, \"Here you go.  There are your MPAs.  Everybody can go home now.\"  That is a challenge when you think about the sectors that need to operate because they have to get used to this new part of our set-up - this overdue part, I would hasten to add.  There will be monitoring.  There will have to be a level of adaption if we are not meeting our conservation objectives.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked whether this will have an impact on fishing rights and the potential for overfishing.  Whenever we are sent to committees to give evidence, we are always told not to say it is not our responsibility to answer a certain question.  What I will say about fisheries is that in our conversations with the stakeholders and the fishermen and fisherwomen, we have found them to be one of the strongest groups who want marine protected areas for their stocks and for the future of their communities.  All the fishermen we have met in our processes, both for the expert group and in our public consultation, want a future that has more protection.  They have a strong voice in that they have rights and entitlements to fish.  We have to make sure that as we create marine protected areas, their needs and the needs of nature are all included.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked how much space marine protected areas will take up.  If she looks at the map provided, she will see that 10% is about 49,000 sq. km and 30% is about 145,000 sq. km.  I will add a small subtlety to that for everybody to think about.  I do not have an answer to the following question, but this is the sort of thing I and people like me in other countries talk about when we meet.  When we say 30%, of what are we saying it is 30%?<\/p><p>Is it 30% of everything or is it 30% of the plan, the sea floor or every species?  We still have not received very strong answers to those questions.  There are a couple of terms that relate to things being ecologically coherent, connected and resilient, but those terms have specific meanings that give us an answer to what 30% should look like.  When we talk about, for example, connectivity in the sea, for a large whale, MPAs that are connected might be thousands of kilometres apart, depending on far it travels over its life cycle.  For something living on the sea floor, connected means touching.  Does that answer some of the Senator's questions?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":441,"content":"<p>It does.

I have a follow-up question for Mr. Cronin on the legacy projects.  If I heard what he said correctly, the aim is to have good environmental status everywhere all of the time.  That is fine, but designating an MPA has a meaning above and beyond that.  While I am very clear that an MPA does not automatically exclude other activities, having that designation would clearly impact on how An Bord Plean&aacute;la, for example, would assess an application for a large offshore wind project.  We want as much offshore wind energy as we can get as soon as possible, but the query many of us have relates to making sure that it is not done at the expense of our marine biodiversity.<\/p> <p>  The worry is, therefore, that because it will take us until 2023, as Mr. Cronin told us, before we have the legislation, and another one to two years before we start advancing the MPAs closer to 30%, what will happen to those legacy projects that are active and live now?  Those running the projects are doing some of their testing and exploration.  Once this legislation is through, they will get their MACs from the Minister and will then go to planning.  Is there a weakness in not having the MPA decisions as to whether any of those parts of the marine would be covered?  In the absence of that decision, what mitigation measures, or additional or temporary protections, can be put in place to make sure that we have the most informed planning decisions on those legacy projects, with an eye not only to protecting existing marine biodiversity but recovering some of the biodiversity loss of recent times, in addition to ensuring we get the offshore wind we want?  I am particularly keen to know about that.<\/p> <p>  I am also keen to know how much ongoing engagement happened between Mr. Cronin's team and his counterparts who have been responsible for the Maritime Area Planning Bill.  Clearly, those two areas of work are integrated and it would be very important to get some reassurance that officials are not so busy dealing with their respective areas that they do not have time for exchange.  Any information he can give us on that crossover will be helpful.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Cronin seems very convinced and, if I may say, optimistic about achieving that good environmental status everywhere all of the time.  Members of many organisations that have talked to us during this set of discussions on the maritime area, both on the maritime area plan and the planning Bill, take a much more concerned view that there have been very significant levels of biodiversity loss and maritime degradation.  They are, therefore, concerned that achieving that high level of good environmental status, even pre-marine protected areas, is a challenge.  Will Mr. Cronin respond to some of those concerns? <\/p> <p>  To be clear, I had always assumed, and please correct me if I am wrong, that 30% is a spatial designation.  There may be other qualifications within that, but is Mr. Cronin suggesting that it is not automatically a spatial designation or that it is but there are other factors to take into account whether those are about species and such like? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#F00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I was trying to make notes on the questions so I do not forget them.  The Deputy asked three or four questions.  The first related to legacy projects and timing.  In a way, this is linked to how we work with others in the Government who have other responsibilities.  In the absence of the MPA legislation being in place at this point, we work on legacy and future projects on an ongoing basis through a structure between both units in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, including those responsible for the development of the offshore energy sector, our colleagues in spatial planning and our colleagues who are responsible for the birds and habitats directives.  We work with all of them and others in government, including officials in the Department of Transport and other Departments, on the development of a new offshore renewable energy development plan for Ireland.  The target for delivery of that is the end of 2022.  The work on sensitivity mapping, which includes where there is likely to be a conflict and where the easier areas to start development are likely to be, is under way and is happening at two levels.  One is at a technical level among a number of experts and the other is at a senior steering level, where those timing and infrastructure risks are all being teased out to work out the real landscape.<\/p> <p>  In this Department, we are working on the development of a similar sort of timing map, across all the work and units, with our colleagues in planning and with those responsible for the birds, habitats and water framework directives.

If time mismatches occur, we can then take action.

That information is all freely available at present.  The information we have on the status of the marine environment is all fully available.  The key point is to ensure that it is accessible and accessed by the decision makers.  None of this is information that is in the pipeline; it is actually out there.  The most important thing is to create a consolidation of it so that there will be a single point of access based on the publication date in the climate action plan towards the end of 2022.<\/p><p>During that intervening period, the information is still available.<\/p><p> As regards whether we are confident about our status on good environmental status, GES, it is important to look at the Irish maritime space within a European context.  In relative terms, it is in very good condition.  We have achieved good environmental status for all of the pollution pressures as assessed in 2020 regarding things like nutrification, hazardous substances, contaminants in seafood and the levels of marine litter.  We think we can do more, by the way, but based on the assessments carried out in 2020, we have met our GES targets.  We are strongly of the opinion that we should be doing more.  We are trying to achieve a moving target that needs to become more ambitious.  Compared with some neighbouring member state administrations, our marine space is in good condition.<\/p><p> There are a number of pressures on and threats to the Irish marine environment, not least the threat to biodiversity from human activity.  This activity happens both inside and outside Ireland's marine space but the effects appear inside the space, so we must take action as a nation and internationally in co-operation with others to restore that biodiversity.  In pursuit of this, we have things like the European Green Deal, the biodiversity action plan and the recently published OSPAR strategy to reach 30% marine protected areas and restore species and habitats.  We are working on that.  We recognise what the problem is and we have a clear pathway, an ambitious target and a mandate to go forward with that.<\/p><p> The other emerging threat we see involves the effects of climate change and ocean acidification and what they mean for biodiversity and what the ocean does for Ireland in terms of the regulation functions we get out of it for our climate.  I am confident we are aware of what the problem is and what the solution will look like, and that we know the size of the challenge and believe we can achieve it.  That does not mean it will be easy.  It is hard work but it is necessary work.  If we are to be sincere and ambitious about all these objectives we have, for example, the deployment of offshore renewables, the protection of coastal communities or adaptation to climate, this is an essential part of the jigsaw and we must be serious and face up to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#F01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I am from a coastal county - Waterford - so all elements of this are very important to me and the people I represent.

Part of the cycle of managing the marine environment is an assessment phase where we carry out scientific assessments involving whether it is good or bad and whether we are satisfied with it.  We set targets based on what a better situation should look like and we have monitoring programmes.  As part of the phase we are starting in 2022 under the marine strategy framework directive, we will develop measures to manage human activity.  It is under those measures that we can ensure any of the sectors we are considering carries out its activities and protects the marine environment at the same time.  That is the key instrument we use not just in Ireland but across all the other member states of the EU to gather all the measures.  From the work we have done on that, every single human activity in the marine environment is well regulated.  Nobody is doing things outside of a regulatory framework.  The effectiveness of that regulation is something for me constantly to consider.  We think there is space for improvement, which is why we want to have marine protected areas in place.

Offshore wind energy is a huge aspiration of ours in relation to the carbon plan and greater and more efficient energy production.

Are there distinct issues in relation to the west coast and the east coast, given the fact that there are two very different bodies of water on each side?  We have an ocean on one side and a sea on the other.  Obviously, we are heavily industrialised along the eastern seaboard.  Do those two sets of circumstances present different issues and challenges for maritime matters?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#G00600","speaker":"1597","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Before I say anything else, the Deputy is right to state that we are an island nation. I am from County Cork.  It does not matter where you are from on this island.  We are living on an island and we should not forget that.  I thank the Deputy for raising that point.  The Deputy asked three questions, the first of which was on offshore wind and whether it can, or should, be capped.  At the moment, when I speak to the experts in the offshore wind field, what they tell me is that the technology is the key constraint currently to where it can go.  There are also issues around the economics of generating the energy.  Currently, we have an ambition to install 5 GW of offshore wind by the end of the decade.  That will take up a footprint of around 3% of our space.  There is further ambition to install 30 GW by mid-century.  I do not think that is necessarily six times extrapolation on the 3%, because we can do things like retrofitting the turbines.  At the moment, water depth and wave height are two of the key issues.  Of course, the further offshore you go with wind energy, the more getting out to it to service the turbines becomes an issue.  Looking at the expansion in the southern North Sea in places like Denmark, where the water is quite shallow, offshore islands have been constructed to get access further out.  Otherwise, there would be problems.  Platforms would have to be built for people to live out there.  The technology constraints are the key issue at the moment.  That is outside of all other considerations.  That is the main cap we have at the moment.  It is about getting the technology to catch up.  That is for the current offshore renewables that we see,  which are either fixed-bottom or floating wind turbines.  There are other types as well.  There are also environmental constraints, but the interface between the sea floor and wind turbines is well understood.  We see it in parts of the North Sea.  We understand the impact of turbines when they are anchored and floated.  We also understand the interaction with the blades and the interaction they may have with marine animals.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question on where we are in comparison with our colleagues in the UK and the UK administrations.  If I am honest, I would say that we are around six or seven years behind them.  I may have said it in some of the evidence I gave earlier, but we should be able to learn from the progress they made and the processes they had.  We should be able to foreshorten that time period and catch up much more quickly.  For example, from the establishment of the Scottish act in 2010, we saw the delivery of its MPAs in the middle to the end of the last decade.  That is where we are.  We are behind and there is no point in hiding from that, but we know where we need to go.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's final question was on the issue of west coast versus east coast.  There are a few points I wish to make on that.  The first, which is pretty obvious to anybody who has travelled, concerns the difference in the environment.  One coast is open and facing the Atlantic and the water gets quite deep in a relatively short period of time and drops off into very deep abyssal water.  There are also Atlantic Ocean frontal systems that push up against the west coast.  The most obvious one of those is the weather for us living on land.  That is one of the key issues.  The west coast part of Ireland forms corridors for biodiversity, in respect of both the upswelling of nutrients and the movement of stocks, including commercial species and mammals that are sea birds that are using that space because of all the biodiversity there.  The east coast, on the other hand, is relatively shallow compared to the west coast.  The energy levels from the sea are, in relative terms, much lower.  They are still pretty high and there are wave heights of 2 m to 2.5 m.  The main difference is in the energy level.  There are different biodiversity components on the east cost.  Much of that is due to the water depth and the flow of the currents.  Many of the oceanographic characteristics are different.  However, in general terms, the whole of the Irish marine space fits into an area known as the Celtic Seas, which is part of our waters, France's waters and the UK's waters.  It is one ecosystem and we assess it as one ecosystem, but we are aware of, for example, the distribution of where different things live and where different habitats are.  We are conscious of that.  From a human activity perspective, the difference is in the amount of energy there is out there, and waves and storms.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I know that Deputy &Oacute; Broin wanted to ask more questions, but he has had to go to another meeting.

We think it is not possible to assess some things at the moment, because we do not have enough information on them.  We believe there are some disturbed habitats.  We think there may be some habitat loss in relation to the sea floor.  We think more work needs to be carried out in that area.

When we do not have it, and we do not have it in all components and for everything, we need to take further action to achieve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cronin.

There is certainly evidence of that.  The question then is what is the benefit of that?  Does it benefit spillover from the wind array and is that benefit tangible?  That goes back to a point I believe I made in the opening statements, which is that there are benefits that can be derived from certain human activities and those benefits can deliver for the environment but also for the economic interests we have in the sea.<\/p> <p>  The key takeaway I would like the committee to consider is that we should not think about these issues in a binary way, where one has either a decision to site human activity and that leads to irreversible damage or one has a marine protected area which is going to, by default, lead to a total exclusion of human activity.  Neither of those may be the case.  They may be possible if we do not do things properly, but they should not be where our thinking is.  We should adopt a responsible approach to the siting of all human activities and the carrying out and management of that human activity, so that we deliver benefits not only for our economy but also for our environment.  We should not adopt a one or the other scenario, it should be both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cronin.  Much of the time talking about the Maritime Area Planning Bill  was spent trying to compare back to terrestrial planning because we know about that, and this is somewhat new to us.  If one has European designations such as special areas of conservation, SACs, or a special protection areas, SPAs, there are certain things one must do before one goes into the planning process and an appropriate assessment takes place on those areas.  Is there an equivalent in Europe on planning where a marine protected area is in place. We know the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, the agency with this responsibility, will have to carry out environmental impact assessments on all of the developments and much of the activity.  If it is an SAC, there are the appropriate assessments and Natura impact statements that need to be done.  Is there something for marine protected areas?  Is there a third space there?

When I consider the interaction between spatial planning and marine protected areas, there is a synergy between them.  If we create a marine protected area under national legislation, it would seem like a responsible thing to do to ensure that all activities that would occur inside the marine protected area, or would have an effect on it, should be considered in how they have an effect on the conservation objectives.  If we have a space and we decide there is something on the seafloor that is very important and that we want to protect, we would then consider what activities are permissible in that space.  Could one have navigation across the top of a marine protected area and site?  Could one have recreation?  Is there any level of human activity on the seafloor such as scientific research or the laying of communication or energy cables?  One would have to decide if it were possible for these to co-exist.  Outside of that designated space on the map, what sort of zone of influence around that would be appropriate would depend on what one is protecting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cronin for that answer.  I have a further question on the data.  We have a massive space and when one designates an SAC or SPA, it is because of a species or habitat that is present that one arrives at that point.  Because of the vast area we have and the lack of science and data, or not enough data on many parts of it, will that present difficulty in our saying we think this should be a marine protected area, MPA?  Would it be an MPA designation because we have indicators here that it is sensitive or that there is a certain species present?  I see that as being a difficulty as we have such a huge area.  When compared to other northern European countries, our maritime area, if we designate 30% of it geographically, would be larger than some of those countries.  It is an immense task ahead of us and I just wonder how we will be able to gather all of that data in the same way one would need to do if one was going to designate something under the habitats or birds directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#J00500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman again.  Before I answer that question there is one thing that is very important for us all to consider when we think about the marine space and that is its three-dimensional nature.  When we consider how we apply land-based approaches versus how we manage the sea, there is a three-dimensional aspect.  It was a part of Deputy &Oacute; Broin&rsquo;s earlier question that I failed to answer around the 30% and how the three-dimensional aspect of it is brought into play.<\/p> <p>  Turning more specifically to the Chairman&rsquo;s question, in my opening comments I made reference to the fact that we already have a list of the things we believe are important to protect.  We have a list of species and habitats that have been already agreed on by the scientists to be both threatened and declining, which I can provide to the committee after the meeting.  We have a good indication already of where we think these are.  We would be, of course, happy to have further information on this but we believe we already have a good start on that.  <\/p> <p>  Another point I raised was to look at things like how the ocean acts as a natural carbon store, with the natural carbon cycle and how carbon is stored either in the coastline, in things like seagrass and kelp forests, or how it is stored in sediments.  We have very good information also about where those habitats exist.  Yes, it is a vast and daunting area.  We are in the top six European Union marine or maritime nations based on our maritime footprint but we also benefit not only from our expertise but from the expertise of all of those scientists across the European Union and the north-east Atlantic.  There is much information available to us and we have a very strong underpinning of what we need to protect already.   These are on what I would call the biodiversity side.  <\/p> <p>  One of the key findings of the expert advisory report is that there is the potential for other types of marine protected areas as well that have a strong focus on our culture and on either the historical or heritage aspects of our marine environment.

I thank Mr. Cronin again for his replies.  There are many organisations out there, particularly organisations which track the alarming levels of biodiversity loss and damage both to our natural and marine environment who would take a much more critical view of our marine environmental standards, particularly in areas such as seismic surveys and who is responsible for monitoring and checking compliance with those.  Equally, there are other things that matter, like mammal observer rots, etc.  There are some very divergent views to those Mr. Cronin has expressed to the committee on some of these things.  That is naturally the nature of these types of discussions.  I return to the same question because I wish to press it.<\/p><p>When the Minister issues maritime area consents or when the board makes decisions on planning applications for very large offshore marine projects potentially later next year, is Mr. Cronin satisfied there is sufficient information in the public domain to allow the Department, which will be advising the Minister on the awarding of consents or the board on the granting of permission, to make a full assessment of the biodiversity implications of any decision?  From memory, the evidence we heard at an earlier stage on the Maritime Area Planning Bill is that there was an indication, which was confirmed by Sustainable Water Network and others, that we do not have a lot of the data we need.  This is one of the reasons the designation process had been so delayed.  It is not just a matter of the legislation.  It is also a matter of the poor data set we have.  What is Mr. Cronin's view regarding concerns, particularly on the part of a lot of environmental NGOs, on the state of our marine biodiversity?  How do we make sure that as we are granting consents and potentially granting permissions, they are done in a way, during this interim period before we have the designations, that fully protects marine biodiversity and does not consolidate biodiversity loss to date but allows for some of that to progress?  Regarding the 30%, my understanding is that it is a spatial 30%.  Is Mr. Cronin saying it is not automatically spatial or it is spatial but there are other considerations in that?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#J00800","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1638230400,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Regarding the spatial 30%, the marine environment is three-dimensional in nature.  If we look at a spatial plan area, we are not really capturing everything we need.  We can certainly go for 30% spatial coverage.  My view is that ultimately this is the measurement by which this will be achieved at policy level but below that policy level, there needs to be a set of conversations, which I am having with my colleagues in other countries, about how effective this 30% is as a high global ambition.  Thirty percent of what we want to protect - is it just a map or is it 30% of key species?  Should it be more of some or less of others?  Beyond the 30% and whatever it will look like on a map there is another conversation we are having and it is important for us to explain the subtlety of that so that we pay ongoing consideration to it.<\/p> <p>  Am I overly optimistic?  Are others pessimistic?  I cannot speak for others.  We have a process of assessment in Ireland and in our broader European area that we do together and that involves scientists and members of civic society.  With those assessments, we have information that tells us about the health of biodiversity.  I would not for a moment suggest the status of biodiversity is satisfactory, but we have seen progress across a number of key indicators where animals are now in favourable conservation status.  Our message at national and international level has been that we need to take more action, play our part, be responsible nationally and within our broader Atlantic environment and play our part to make sure biodiversity is protected and restored across our marine space and the north east Atlantic, and we have to do this with others.  Because of the three-dimensional space, the lines we see on our maps are really just administrative.  Where we create marine protected areas, they will have a relationship with those spaces outside Ireland's marine space, for example, in the high seas areas out to the west and to the north and south and those other countries as well.  <\/p> <p>  Do I have a concern about maritime area consents coming forward before we have the marine protected areas designation piece in place?  It is clear that all consents will come with conditions.  How we word those conditions and the obligation to implement them will be very important.  Another thing worth considering is that irrespective of whether we have a spatial designation in place for marine protected areas at the time, there is an obligation on everybody in Government and all operators to comply with the full suite of national and international legislation to which we subscribe.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":474,"content":"<p>Is there space within that for what are known as other affected area-based conservation measures to be used in parallel?

This might sound semantic but it is very important to think about it.  One group is calling for no take zones while another is looking for fisheries closures.  We have the fishing community looking for fisheries closures and maybe the environmental pillar looking for no take zones.  They both want the same thing.  They both want to protect biodiversity and believe that fishing in some locations should not happen.  They might have different reasons for believing and wanting it but they both want the same thing.  It is very important that as we come up with these other effective conservation measures, where we are going to put them and where they need to be from a scientific point of view, that we make sure they actually deliver for us.  When I explain this work to others and all the different acronyms floating around, I say that if you are living in the sea, you do not really care what the space in which you are living is called as long as your life cycle is protected.  You do not care whether it is called a marine protected area, a well-managed space or another effective conservation measure.

As I said in my opening remarks, we can have that.  In line with best international practice, MPAs exist in other European countries and around the world where human activities co-exist with the conservation objective.  When a decision is made to create an MPA for the specific reason of conserving something in the sea, it is possible to allow human activity that does not have an effect on that conservation status.  The idea of co-existence is very important for all of us to think about when we are considering what an MPA is.  I always encourage people to finish the sentence when they say they want an MPA and specify why they want it.  This helps us to understand whether a particular human activity interferes with that objective.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether there is likely to be something already in the legacy projects that may require protection.  When a detailed site investigation takes place, a lot of scientific information is gathered in the process of creating an environmental assessment and doing the other appropriate assessments.  A great deal of data are gathered in all of that process, which then feed into the decision on whether a consent can be given.  It is not a case of somebody taking out a map and saying, \"I would like to put it here and off you go.\"  There is a detailed process that goes on behind all of that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether we are putting the cart before the horse on this issue or shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.  As I said in reference to some of the evidence I provided, it would be preferable to have started this work a number of years ago.  We must remember, however, that Ireland has a very low level of economic activity in our marine space.  Apart from transport and fisheries, there is very little other activity taking place beyond the first nautical mile.  The real risk is quite low outside of those well-defined activities that are already happening.<\/p> <p>  In my earlier reference to different parts of our marine space already having a lot of designated areas, I was referring to the publication last year by the European Environment Agency highlighting the distance to 30% MPA coverage across the Union.  I can provide the Chairman with the reference.  The document breaks down each member state's marine space to the first nautical mile, that is, from the high water mark out to 1 nautical mile, which is the space to which I was referring.  We have those designations done under the birds and habitats directive.  The document also gives information on how much of the space from 1 to 12 nautical miles is designated, as well as for the area from 12 nautical miles out to the end of the exclusive economic zone.  In that third space, from 12 miles out, Ireland has very low levels of designation.  That was the specific reference I was making and I can provide the information to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referenced the precautionary principle.  In my comments, I mentioned the EU policies and principles, the precautionary principle being one we use all the time.  We are very conscious of having enough information to make a good decision, which does not mean we should make no decision if we do not have enough information.  In the exercise of the practice of this, we are very conscious, for example, of the likely risk of there being some harm caused that is irreversible or that would go against the broader conservation ambition we have around either a species or broader biodiversity concerns.<\/p> <p>  If I have missed any point, I ask the Deputy to come back to me.  His final question was about candidate areas.  In a previous answer, I mentioned that we already have a well-established list, which I will provide to the committee, of threatened and declining species, known as the OSPAR list, that are outside the EU directives.  It is a long list of more than 50 species and habitats that occur all across the north-east Atlantic, a sub-portion of which are found in the Irish marine space.  We know what we need to protect and we have information about where it is.  As set out in the recently published climate action plan, we also have an awareness that the ocean plays a key role in mitigating the effects of climate change.  It is our understanding that there are natural carbon habitats both on the coastline and possibly in deeper sediments that are not yet being given any protection.  We know where they are from the mapping programmes we have.  In our view, they could become candidates.  What we do not yet have in place is a process for setting up the criteria, bringing stakeholders along with us and creating the designation process.  That is the purpose of the new legislation we hope to draft and we see a key part of it as bringing in the views of all stakeholders, who are the people who will end up managing this for us.  Without their willingness to manage, it will be difficult for us to do it for such a vast area.  We need to bring them with us on this.  That legislation, and how we design the processes provided for in it, will be key to our success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":483,"content":"<p>On the issue of carbon habitats and carbon capture, I am aware that the marine planning legislation will go through first.

If I could address it on a global level, the national marine planning framework, which was published in July of this year, is Ireland&rsquo;s rule book for how we want to develop the space and for how we want to have human activity.  Contained in that planning framework document are Ireland's binding commitments to our protection of the marine environment.  Those include protected sites, compliance with laws such as the birds and habitats directive, the OSPAR convention, which is an international treaty that goes beyond European Union ambitions, and the environmental targets under the marine strategy framework directive.  We established 25 revised targets in 2020.  All those are contained in that document, and let us call it the overarching roof with which all activity and decision making must comply.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if there is a risk things might go wrong or we might make decisions we live to regret.  We have that strong framework, which was an excellent item of work published earlier this year.  Therefore, we have that in place.  We then get into some of the more specific issues on the decisions on specific sites.  Clearly, if we have a site, species or habitat that is unique and does not exist anywhere else, we have to consider whether any human activity could take place in that area.  Human activity is allowed, and we should not be shy about saying that.  Human activity should be done sustainably.  &ldquo;Sustainably&rdquo; means that we do not cause damage from which we cannot recover.  We should be conscious of that.  We should also make sure that if we make decisions about human activity, it is done in such a way that the overall health of the species as a population is maintained and if we need to increase the health of that population that we do that also.  We would set a conservation objective, for example, that we want things to stay as they are, we want them to get twice as good as they are or we want them to improve by a certain date.  Whatever that is, we can make choices about human activity based on that.  Among the decision makers, specialists and experts who advise us on this work, the knowledge about those parts of the eco-system that are fragile and sensitive, for example, very deep water, cold water coral reefs which can withstand very little interaction from human activity, are well understood.  We might not have a full map of exactly where they all are but we know what to look for.  If we are going to make decisions around consenting, scientific information will have to be provided around supporting the consent application or whatever it is.  Therefore, we would know what to look for.   The framework would be in place.  The implementation of that framework through the subsequent consent process would be the challenge.

We are also considering, for example, citizen science whereby we can get information from citizens on the state of the marine environment.  The key challenge we have in all those programmes is to have the right standard.  The right standards will get us good quality information.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the decision-making process.  I am not involved in the planning decision-making process but, clearly, whatever information is provided in a decision-making process, the important element is the level of assessment and rigour the decision maker makes in respect of it. I would have certain views on whether we should be comparing the marine space to the land space because one is pretty much two dimensional, it is pretty much flat and goes up 10 m whereas the ocean is three dimensional.  Regardless of whether we want to compare the two, we can still condition consents when we decide to do things at sea.  We can have a set of performance standards.  This relates to the precautionary principle we discussed earlier.  If we have a set of concerns that an activity might have a risk associated with it, we can create a set of performance controls on it.  We see this all the time.  If one is carrying out some sort of seismic survey, one must have certain noise parameters and certain checks and balances in place.  We condition activities all the time.  Therefore, we have ways of dealing with that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cronin for his response.

I get a sense we are coming close to the end of this meeting, so before I go any further I would like to thank my colleague, Dr. &Oacute; Cadhla, who is the brains in this operation.  While he has not spoken today, he is the person who provides me with most of the useful points that come out of my mouth; the rest of it is all my own fault.<\/p> <p>  On the particular issue, in my opening comments I described where we are.  We have started the development of the general scheme on the new legislation.  There is a list of things that we are going to link that to, including requirements of certain European directives, the EU green deal and, most important for us, the findings of the expert advisory report and the views of the stakeholders.  We are at that stage.  We hope to have that delivered by quarter 3, 2022 and we think that with the help of everybody who is going to support the process we can get the legislation together by 2023.  There are other legislative models similar to our legal code that help us to understand what needs to go into the legislation.  We have an understanding of the different processes such as the identification of the things that need protection, the criteria for qualification as highlighted by Deputy Boyd Barrett, the consultation and, most important, the participation process.  I would be strongly in favour of a stewardship model as opposed to a box ticking consultation.  I think that is the next stage in our development of engagement.  That piece is a big challenge, but it is important to face up to it.  That has to be designed.<\/p> <p>  On the creation of the designation, the management plan piece has to be put in place, which is the relationship with other legal requirements and obligations and how all of that is represented.  In other words, where does it go to and do we just see it on a map?  How we understand it is the communication and education piece.  When we get to the end of that journey for a marine protected area, there is the journey back to the start to check that everything is working, which is the monitoring programme, to adapt, update, improve and change if necessary.  I made the point in one of my earlier comments that once we set up the legislation, we will have a process that will go on and on.  We are looking now at 30% coverage.  We will be, I believe, looking at a different number at some point after the end of this decade.  We are looking at a part of governance reform here that is including protection as part of the overall plan to develop our marine environment and giving it a solid, independent footing such that we are confident we are making good decisions, so that we can provide assurance that the environment is improving and that it is protected, where necessary, and that when we carry out human activities we can say with confidence they are sustainable as opposed to just putting the word \"sustainable\" in front of everything we do.  We must have meat on that frame.<\/p> <p>  That is where we are at.  That is our journey over the next year to year and a half.  As I said earlier, we have committed to creating a parallel set of timelines across all of the different processes, including the environment processes, the birds habitats directive and the spatial planning processes and, hopefully, incorporating other processes such as offshore renewable development plans and so on.  We want to create an overall set of timelines such that we can then understand whether the risk around the potential mismatch in the delivery of different things is real or not, whether the spatial impact - where we want to put activities -  is real and, where we propose to put the marine protected areas, which will be where we think the habitats and species are.  We can have that mapped out.  From that mapping exercise, we can then make decisions about how real the risk is and what actions need to be taken to mitigate that risk.  There is a precautionary approach, as we discussed in the evidence and in the questions and answers today.  <\/p> <p>  That is the plan.  The next step is to take off the suit and start doing it.  While we may be the responsible people to do this, this is something that will happen for all of society.  For all the marine stakeholders, the people, Deputies and Senators, we will be the ones stewarding this, but it is really important that we all do this together.  That is clear from the feedback we have had.  To summarise the 2,400 public consultation responses we received, everybody wants them and they all want to be involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021113000002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Cronin"},{"type":"speech","time":1638230400,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cronin.
