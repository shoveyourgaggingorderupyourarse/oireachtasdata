I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with responsibility for land use and biodiversity, Senator Pippa Hackett.  She is accompanied by the following officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine: Ms Patricia Kelly, head of the forestry division, Mr. Kevin Collins, head of forestry environmental section, and Mr. Eamon O'Doherty, project manager, Project Woodland.  They are all joining from a witness room in Kildare House.  I welcome them to the meeting and thank them for making time to appear before us during the summer recess.<\/p> <p>  The opening statement has been circulated to members.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.  The Minister of State has ten minutes to make her opening statements before we go to questions and answers.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin I have an important notice in relation to parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence relating to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I again welcome the Minister of State, Senator Pippa Hackett.  It just shows the importance that the agriculture committee attaches to the forestry sector.  In her opening statement, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, outlined the many times that the committee has dealt with forestry in the past months.  We are seriously worried about afforestation targets and we see weeks where only four or five licences were issued.  There is a distinct target in the programme for Government, which I hope the Minister of State will address today.<\/p> <p>  Another issue which has been raised with me recently is thinning.  Is a licence required for thinning?  It is not a change of land use.  Could thinning not proceed without the necessity of obtaining a licence?  That would greatly free up a large number of licences.  As the Minister of State is aware, there is a huge number of people involved in the forestry sector who are under huge financial pressure through no fault of their own.  With the low output of licences, their businesses have gone into serious financial pressure.  I have had contractors on to me who have had machines repossessed by financial institutions and who are facing financial ruin.  The Minister of State has addressed ash dieback in her opening statement.  That is something I would like to elaborate further on.  The Minister of State has made changes recently, which have been welcome, but there needs to be more financial compensation for people who have suffered ash dieback.  They have suffered huge financial loss.  This committee has made recommendations that the premia would be available to them if they choose to replant that land and that they would again receive premia on that land as they have had no financial gain from the crop they planted previously.<\/p> <p>  These are just some of the issues and other members of the committee will want to raise other issues with the Minister of State.  I now ask her to make her opening statement, and then we will have questions and answers from the committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021080400002#A00400","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1628031600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the committee for the invitation and welcome the opportunity to be here to update members on developments since the last appearance by my officials before this committee on 27 May.  As the Chair indicated, my officials were also here on 29 January 2021, 3 December 2020, 17 November 2020, and I was here on 3 November 2020 on issues relating to forestry.  I acknowledge the ongoing interest of the committee with issues impacting the forestry sector in Ireland.  As the Chair said, I am joined today by Ms Patricia Kelly and Mr. Kevin Collins from the forestry service, and the project manager of Project Woodland, Mr. Eamon O'Doherty.<\/p> <p>  While there are many issues affecting forestry, licensing is the most immediate and impactful challenge this sector faces.  I am more than aware of its importance and it continues to be my top priority.  My officials, as well as working groups under Project Woodland, are completely focused on turning this situation around and we all want to reach a stage where licences are issued in a timely fashion.  We have been making inroads into this problem, as many members will have seen from the dashboard figures which are published weekly.  It is of note that the number of licences issued in June, at 415, was the highest since July 2019, and that the number of private felling licences issued in June was the highest in the past five years, at 220.  This is progress indeed and it is a trend I would wish to see continuing.<\/p> <p>  As regards the total number of licences issued in the year, this figure was at 1,900 at 23 July, which is around 42% of our annual target of 4,500 licences.  While one may expect that this should have been higher, it has always been our intention to intensify output in the latter half of the year, on the basis of system improvements and streamlining of procedures.  These improvements have already had an effect, as can be seen in the number of licences issued in June.  The system improvements introduced in the preparation of the various appropriate assessment documents have allowed our ecologists to optimise their time, and to concentrate on the ecology aspect of each application.  Currently, these improvements are applied to tree-felling licence applications and roads licence applications only, and we will be turning our attention shortly to applying the system to afforestation files.  This should increase output on these files.<\/p> <p>  Speaking of systems improvements, it is the case that better quality applications have a smoother progression through the licensing process.  In order to make the system more efficient, and to give a clear picture of why certain files are held up, we recently provided registered foresters and forestry companies with a list of felling files which require further information before they can be progressed by ecology.  We have found that around half of the applications for private felling files screened in for appropriate assessment require further information.  Working together with the registered foresters and in the spirit of co-operation, we can improve this situation to the benefit of forest owners.<\/p> <p>  Members will have noticed a downturn in licence output for July.  This is directly linked to the introduction of a second 30-day public consultation process for applications subject to appropriate assessment.  These requirements arise from the European Union (Birds and Habitats) (Amendment) Regulations 2021, which were recently introduced by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  This means that any application that is screened in for appropriate assessment, and which has had a nature impact statement or an appropriate assessment report, must be advertised with all relevant documentation on the forestry licence viewer for 30 days for public consultation.  This is part of an extensive public consultation process which affords all interested parties an opportunity to have their say in relation to projects with the potential to impact European sites.<\/p><p>There is no denying that this adds extra time to the processing of these applications.  We must now advertise all such cases, and we are currently working our way through them.  A total of 536 cases went to public consultation up to 23 July, an average of 178 per week.  The first of these will exit this process on 6 August.  We have not, to date, received any submissions on cases advertised, but if we do they will be taken into account before the file progresses to decision.<br\/><br\/>The reality is that this has indeed affected recent output, as certain files ready for decision were interrupted.  We are committed to making up this ground and I expect that by mid-August we will see an increase in the number of licences issued and a return to previous levels.  This new requirement means that we will have to redouble our efforts to reach our target of 4,500 licences this year, but I remain hopeful that we will do this.<br\/><br\/>The number of licences issued is not the only metric and the volume of timber licensed is a crucial factor for the sawmills.  The volume issued to 23 July 2021 is 3.727 million cu. m.  Overall output to 23 July is afforestation at 2,732 ha and road lengths licences at 157 km.  We are making progress but there is a way to go and clearly there is more to be done.<br\/><br\/>As I said earlier, Project Woodland is key to this.  Its work is focused on identifying the means to improve the system by introducing efficiencies and on resolving the backlog.  I will take this opportunity to recognise the excellent work done so far by the project board and the four working groups.  Since we introduced the project in February, there has been intense and active engagement by all involved, and the first interim report by the project board, published two weeks ago, bears witness to this productivity.<br\/><br\/>The board has received a number of excellent papers and recommendations from the working groups and has examined each, has spoken to the chairs and has evaluated the recommendations in detail.  It has provided feedback and suggested next steps, as outlined in the interim report.  I am glad to say that the board has agreed to immediately advance two of these recommendations.  Members here will be well familiar with the first recommendation, a regulatory review, which was one of the committee's own recommendations, and one I wholeheartedly support.  It was also recommended by the backlog working group and the process improvement working group.  It involves an independent regulatory and planning review of the licensing system to be conducted by an independent expert or experts and it has already been advertised for tender.  It will review the existing statutory framework for the licensing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework.  Arrangements in other EU member states will be considered to see if lessons can be learnt from them.  The review will also evaluate the current 15 km radius for screening for appropriate assessment, having regard to the requirements of European Union law.  The business systems analysis currently being undertaken by our business analyst, Shelly O&rsquo;Sullivan, will interact with and run parallel with the regulatory review, so that best possible system improvements are delivered.<br\/><br\/>The second recommendation, made by the shared national approach working group, is the prioritisation of an effective and inclusive public consultation on a shared vision for forestry.  Our future vision for forestry must ensure we bring nature and communities with us.  This important work has commenced and stakeholder and public attitudes to the role of trees, woods and forests in Ireland&rsquo;s future will be canvassed through various means and fora in order to reach a shared vision.  I expect that our forest strategy will be influenced by the new European forest strategy which was published on 16 July 2021.  We will be aiming for a balanced strategy for forestry in this country to address environmental, societal, and economic needs.<br\/><br\/>Of interest to members too will be the project charter for Project Woodland, which has been published along with the interim report.  This was drawn up by the project manager, Mr. Eamon O&rsquo;Doherty.  The charter outlines very clearly the scope, tasks, governance structure and reporting and communications framework for the project.<br\/><br\/>Members have on previous occasions raised the ash dieback scheme, which I know is of interest to many forest owners.  As the scheme has been in place for more than a year, I thought it timely to assess the response to its operation to date.  One question that arose was the availability of management options for plantations greater than 25 years of age.  After careful consideration I have now revised these management options as set out in Circular 12\/2021 of 23 July 2021, which is published on the Government website.  This change brings sites that are more than 25 year of age into the scheme.  We will review those cases more than 25 years of age that were refused under the previous rule and issue a fresh decision.<br\/><br\/>Another development I bring to the committee's attention is a proposed new riparian native woodland initiative under the national forestry programme.  We are all aware that we face significant challenges in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s environmental objectives.  This proposal focuses primarily on addressing our water quality goals but will have associated and real benefits for climate change and biodiversity.  It builds on the success of the native woodland establishment scheme, which can now be more specifically focused to target water protection.  The plan is to introduce, in addition to the current grant and 15-year premiums, a once-off bonus top-up payment of &euro;1,000 per hectare to those landowners planting critical source areas in EPA pollution impact potential zones and, similarly, in accordance with drinking water source protection plans.  The extra payment will also be made available in other defined circumstances.  These are to be identified by my Department in consultation with Inland Fisheries Ireland, the OPW, Irish Water, the local authority waters and communities office, LAWCO, and other water bodies.  We hope to roll this out in the autumn, once all details are finalised.  We will promote the scheme widely and, in particular, encourage farmer uptake.  My officials are engaging with Teagasc advisers, the local authorities water programme, LAWPRO, community officers and with the agricultural sustainability support and advice programme, Inland Fisheries and the Department of Housing<b>, <\/b>Local Government and Heritage so that we can achieve this.<br\/><br\/>I am confident that we are moving in the right direction and that the momentum already shown in dealing with all of the issues facing us will be maintained and indeed gather pace in the second half of this year.  I thank members for their attention and I am now happy to take their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021080400002#A00500","speaker":"1661","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1628031600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and her officials for coming before the committee today to discuss a real crisis in the forestry sector.  My serious worry is for the 400 to 500 jobs in west Cork that are on the line.  Many of these people are worried about losing their jobs.  We find ourselves in the astonishing situation where we are looking to bring in timber from another country.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions for the Minister of State.  I understand that other members want to come in so I will not hog the airwaves as such.  Why should any member of this committee or any member of the forestry and timber sector, a native industry that employs 12,000 people in rural Ireland, believe the Minister of State when she says that the Department is going to reach the target of 4,500 licences for this year?  Only 1,900 forestry licences have been issued up to 23 July.  In a response I received to a parliamentary question last week, I was informed by the Department that this figure is up by 25% on the same time last year.  This is the regular line we have heard from the Department throughout 2021.  It is a ridiculous defence when one considers the implosion in licence output in 2020.  What miracle is going to occur in the final few months of this year to enable the Department to turn out 2,600 licences to reach the 4,500 target?  Will the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and their officials please refrain from comparing the output of this year to that of 2020 in order to paint a rosy picture of improvements made on the output of issuing of forestry licences?  I tabled a parliamentary question in early July that outlined while felling licences issued in 2021 are up 28% compared to 2020 figures, they are down 191% compared to 2019, which was the last genuinely comparable year.  On a similar note, afforestation licences are up 8% compared to 2020 but down 28% compared to 2019.  It is unfair and disingenuous in terms of covering up the Department's ineptitude on this licensing issue.  It has to stop.  The Department must be honest and compare like with like.  It is down 191% on 2019 figures.  That is the only comparison we can really make.<\/p> <p>  I spoke recently to a lady from the Chairman's area, Killenaule, about the ash dieback issue.  This lady has spent the past 12 months trying to contact the Minister of State and her Department.  She has issued a very warm welcome to the Minister of State to come and see the crisis she has found herself in and to see the ash dieback on her farm.  This lady has met the Minister of State at the recent protest and she promised that she would visit.  The lady has contacted the Minister of State again but she has failed to reply.<\/p><p>It is not a nasty welcome but a genuine one.  She told me that if a farmer or anyone in farming has TB on his or her land, he or she is fairly and honestly compensated but if his or her forestry is ruined by ash dieback, he or she is not compensated.  She is the Chairman's area, so he might like to accompany the Minister of State.  Deputy Mattie McGrath has said he would do the same.  They might like to accompany the Minister of State to this lady's farm to see the devastation this has caused and the fact there is no proper compensation in place for these farmers.  These questions are genuine.  This issue has gone on so long.  It is causing serious problems.<\/p><p> I am also worried about the factory in west Cork and the sawmills in Enniskeane in that this will lead to massive job losses.  I would like to be able to find out today that the targets we are to meet with regard to the felling licences will be met.  Someone in the Minister of State's Department needs to talk and be straight up and tell the truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021080400002#B00200","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1628031600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy there is no cover-up here.  We have been transparent with the figures, with the output each week and with the reasons behind backlogs and the different backlogs that have existed.  The Deputy will have seen from my opening statement I did not make any comparison to 2020.  I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from.  Many comparisons are made with 2020.  I am only in the position 13 months.  I was not here before 2020, nor was the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, but I take the Deputy's point in that 2020 was not a good year.  It is not the best comparison but we try to compare with other years and I indicated that we had the highest number of licences issued in June of this year, at 415, compared with July 2019.  That is a positive trend.  That is something and I would like to think it would instil some confidence in the committee that we are on the right path here.  We have implemented system changes.  We have taken on more resources, ecologists, forestry inspectors and so forth.  From June alone, if we just look at this June, we have seen an improvement over the previous number of months.  That is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  We have always imported timber into this country.  We are probably importing more now than we should be and that is something we want to see the end of but it is not a case that we are only importing timber now.  We have always imported timber, in some shape or form, into Ireland.  Many of the stakeholders on Project Woodland, of whom I have 24 or 25, are representatives of the industry, the growers, the environmental sector and the community.  There is engagement there across the sector.  It is not an easy engagement to keep together.  I commend each and every one of them on sticking with the process because it is frustrating for many of them, for different reasons.  It is important they are interacting in a collaborative fashion, which is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's ash dieback query, we have in the past week or so extended the age to which plantations can avail of the scheme.  That has been widely welcomed.  The Deputy made reference to the TB scheme and that is, in a way, what the ash dieback scheme replicates because if you are a farmer unlucky enough to go down with TB, the animals that have TB are compensated for and removed but there is no knock-on payment for calves the animal may have had or milk lost.  In a way, the ash dieback scheme is similar.  You are compensated to remove and replant the trees but we are not extending the premium out and that is something we are not considering.<\/p> <p>  The ash dieback scheme is under review, because things keep changing.  Originally, a number of years ago, the purpose with regard to ash dieback was to try to prevent its spread.  We now know it is endemic in the country.  It is no longer about prevention.  It is about trying to slow down the spread and do what we can.  Extending it to plantations over 25 years has been widely welcomed.  I am happy to see that.  I know the lady the Deputy referred to and I indicated that I would, when I got the chance, visit her plantation.  I will stick by that, as soon as I get the opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021080400002#C00200","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1628031600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Carthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021080400002#C00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1628031600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I think Deputy Fitzmaurice was ahead of me.

I fear that these guys will turn the Minister of State into the Minister for reports and reviews.  I am struck by the Scottish experience, which was cited many times by a number of guests before the committee.  In Scotland, James Mackinnon was appointed to research its forestry issues and make a report and recommendations.  The Scottish authorities then took that report and implemented a number of the recommendations.  That resulted in Scotland planting 11,000 ha last year.  Apparently Scotland has an annual target of 15,000 ha for the coming years.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine also commissioned Mr. Mackinnon to carry out a report and make recommendations.  After that, we got somebody else to carry out a report into his report and recommendations.  That has established Project Woodland and the Minister of State tells us that the board has agreed to two recommendations.  It is important that we look at those.  The first recommendation is for a regulatory review and the second is for the prioritisation of a public consultation process.  Those are not actions; they are further reviews and reports.<\/p> <p>   I want to deal with the project board and the four working groups.

Equal with that person is a senior Department manager whose job is to also act as a reference point for the working group in terms of the actions and recommendations that are coming up from the group discussions, which are typically held fortnightly.  Each working group comprises a mix of forest policy group, FPG, members or sectoral interests that are not in the FPG.  The working groups also receive secretarial support from the Department.<\/p> <p>  It is important to realise that the four working groups contain elements of longer term activity.  Work group 3, for instance, is looking at the organisational development of the Department, possible transformation and a customer charter.  That cannot be done quickly because it also depends on work coming from the current process.  The current process around licensing is extremely complicated.  There is a systems analyst working on that full-time to try to understand the different nooks and crannies of the processes.  That is before we get to the point of recommending how those processes can be optimised or changed.  The organisational development can then be wrapped around that.  What we do not want to do is change the organisation and find that our processes cannot support it.<\/p> <p>  Work group 2 is looking at a longer term vision for Irish forestry.  The creation of that vision has to take place before 2023 but it is a longer term thing.  It has to develop a strategy and then feed into the EU forest policies that will come down the track in January 2023.  Those two groups do not provide quick and dirty solutions to anything.<\/p> <p>  The fourth work group, which is around the idea of process improvement, first has to understand the processes that are taking place at the moment and it is doing that well.<\/p><p>They are due to report on that sometime around the point at which the legal and regulatory team comes on board.  That tender will be due for submission in the early part of September.  It will be given three months to report.  Therefore, the short answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  It will be next year before that part that can come in.  The process improvement cannot take place until we understand what can and cannot be done in, for instance, the 15 km screening limit.  Many possible suggestions are coming from the working groups.  This is a complicated environment.  People are expecting quick and dirty things to be done.  However, in my experience of working in large industrial projects, that would be a mistake.  I appreciate that everyone is frustrated with where we are at the moment and with the long road to getting licensing on track.  However, there needs to be patience and an understanding that Departments cannot just change course completely overnight.  In reality, Project Woodland has been up and running since the start of May, or the tail end of April.  We are two months into it.  Much work has been done and many useful papers have been produced by the groups.  In my view, one or two of the recommendations that have been made are not ones that the Department can implement without appropriate advice.  Some of these were mentioned earlier - for instance, the single consent licensing and the planning grant.  We are going out for advice before ministerial direction can be determined.  Some of these things are important in regard to the role of the Minister and some of them can be done.

The working group's role is to bring recommendations to the board.  It filters those recommendations to decide whether they should be made to the Minister of State.  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, then receives recommendations from the board through the project board and Mr. Brendan Gleeson.

Despite the optimistic tone of the Minister of State&rsquo;s opening statement, there is no information over any considerable period of time to suggest that we have turned the corner.  In fact, at best, we would say that we are stagnant.  Has an analysis been brought to the attention of the Minister of State on why hectares of lands being planted do not even meet the number of hectares for which licences are being allocated?  Has she commissioned any such analysis?  This year, so far, more than 2,700 ha have been licensed but only about 1,500 ha have been planted.  We cannot say that this will pass on to next year, because last year 4,300 licences were granted.  This is already a pathetically low number, and yet fewer than 2,500 ha were planted.

They have three years to plant.  They do not have to plant within a month or two of having been issued the licence.  There will, therefore, be a certain lag.  After some period of time, people choose not to plant.  If they have gone through the process, especially as arduous as it is at the moment, I would be surprised if anyone did not want to plant.

It is nowhere close to even the Minister of State&rsquo;s own targets.  If the level of planting is in the region of about 60% of that pathetically low figure, then we can see how there is a crisis in the making.  It is even striking that there is not a quick answer that identifies the problem and how to sort it out.

The Senator and I are both farmers.  I speak to farmers, as does he.  There are pressures from other sectors.  We cannot deny that.  The question is whether a farmer will plant his or her forestry for 20, 30 or 40 years or whether he or she can rent to a neighbouring farmer who is out of it in five or ten years.  That is a pressure and that does exist.  Farmers say to me that they have to make that call.  What does that mean going forward?  How do we entice farmers?  How do we encourage and support them more?  I do not know; we have to look at that.  Certainly, it is important because we are going to be wholly reliant on farmers and landowners going forward.

We might, as a State, decide that we want more amenity forests and we are not too worried about other aspects but we must come to that decision and that process has started.  We have Irish Rural Link engaging with communities, particularly those which were affected by forestry in the past.  That is the start of that process and that will continue for the remainder of the year.<\/p> <p>  We have to have a new forestry strategy in place before the middle or end of next year and that is what we are working towards.

It would have been nice to have been able to stop the arrival of ash dieback, but that is the way the free market works in the EU.<\/p> <p>  Regarding a threat to our native oak trees, Senator Lombard might be referring to the oak processionary moth that has been identified in one or two instances in Ireland.  My officials deal with a sighting within hours whenever one occurs.  Touch wood, we have done alright to keep that pest out.  Threats from all sorts of issues, whether involving transportation or climate change and warming weather, for example, mean that we are going to be at greater risk from pests.  This year was the international year of plant health, which was extended from last year.  This is going to be an issue and it is something we certainly must keep an eye on and keep our guard up against as much as we can in the context of free trade in the EU.

Has there been engagement with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, regarding the major change observed in building patterns in the past 12 months?  Builders opting for timber-framed houses have reverted to building conventionally with concrete because of problems with the cost and supply of timber.  Builders tell me that the cost of timber-framed houses has increased by up to 15% in the past six months because of the issues with cost and supply in the building trade.  This is a major issue for carbon use and our future carbon footprint.  We are effectively promoting building with concrete over the use of timber because of an inability to source wood at an appropriate cost.<\/p> <p>  In that context, has the Department engaged with the CIF and the building industry on these issues?  It is a matter of ensuring we have sufficient timber to supply the housing market, specifically for timber-framed housing, rather than reverting to the use of concrete in new houses which necessitates an increased use of carbon.

The Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, which advises me and the Department from a forestry perspective and includes a range of stakeholders, has issued a number of reports.

I will try not to repeat any of the issues that have been raised.  Many of my colleagues have emphasised that there is disquiet, disappointment and indeed frustration in the agricultural community regarding afforestation.  Deputy Fitzmaurice used very strong words on this issue.  There is growing disquiet and a sense of frustration because issues flagged by the sector over many months have not been dealt with.  Everyone, including those within the sector, agrees that Project Woodland is good and will deliver.  The reality, though, is that it will be two or three years before we see anything emanating from the project.  Given the current state of the sector, it simply cannot wait for so long.<\/p> <p>  Everyone in the sector has been pragmatic.  Two forestry growers rang me this morning to discuss issues they were experiencing in trying to get their licence applications completed.  We can have nothing but empathy with them because they have been through the mill now for so long.  It is feared that there is a bottleneck within the Department.  Other members referred to this point as well.  Ultimately, we must find a way around it.  Having spoken to people in the forestry sector and the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, a practical solution has been proposed.<\/p> <p>  Can we remove the issuing of licences for roads and thinning from the overall licensing process?  I appreciate that might require emergency legislation, but we have invoked a great deal of such emergency legislation, much to the ire of our President, in recent months.  This is an emergency.<\/p><p>Something simply needs to be done to enable this sector to function effectively.  There is an element of double jeopardy in afforestation, particularly if we consider the area of roads licensing.  Most people who are applying for a roads licence, 80% or 90% of them, are also applying for a grant to carry out those works.  This is one of the most heavily regulated projects that can be done on a farm.  Numerous site visits are involved.  It is highly regulated.  There is a valid argument to be made that this process is already covered and that the rigours of licensing regulation are not required.<\/p><p> The case is similar in respect of thinning.  Everybody agrees that thinning is important.  Nobody plants a forest and then decides to let it go to rack and ruin.  Everybody wants to manage forestry effectively and to get the best value from it and best return on it, not only for the farmer or investor but for the economy and ecology that survive on the back of that forestry.  I have no doubt that this could also survive outside of the licensing process.<\/p><p> Are the Department and Minister of State willing to consider taking the issues of roads and thinning out of the licensing process?  Are they willing, on the return of the D&aacute;il, to look at emergency legislation that would allow us to do that?  That is the only thing that will get us past this impasse.  I appreciate the validity of everything the Minister of State has said and I have no doubt that she has come here with the best of intentions but the reality is that the credibility of the Department has been affected as a result of this.  We need to take significant action and that is what I am recommending.

I absolutely accept that the disappointment and frustration he has alluded to exists.  I feel it too.  We have a small plantation.  I suppose I should be thankful that we do not need a licence yet because the plantation is not yet old enough to require thinning, roads or felling.  I can certainly relate to the concerns.<\/p> <p>  With regard to afforestation, this is not only frustrating for farmers, but for the nursery owners who produce the trees for planting and find that we are not hitting the targets.  I dispute the Deputy's assertion that nothing is being addressed.  Many issues are being addressed and sectoral interests and the industry are involved in that.  We have been making progress, albeit slow progress, as I indicated in my opening statement.<\/p> <p>  There have been calls for derogations and amnesties in order to just get these licences out as quickly as possible without any process.  The whole process is incredibly complex.  There are complex regulations, compliance measures and legal issues involved.  We have to work together to find the best solution in this area.  One of the recommendations from the Deputy's group and from Project Woodland is that we should look at the regulations involved.  As I have said, we tendered for that last week.  I would like to think that those considerations will be completed well before the end of the year.  I would like the results of that to inform how we progress.<\/p> <p>  We could bring in legislation tomorrow but we would be in the High Court by the end of the week.  That is simply the fact of the matter.  We have to do this properly.  We need to look forward and consider how to develop a system that is efficient and does not make it arduous or difficult for forest owners to get licences.  The issue really has been causing the sector to grind to a halt.  People make reference to the levels of afforestation we need to meet.  We are struggling to issue enough licences even for the low levels we are meeting.  We have to get this right and we have to get systems in place that can deliver 8,000 ha and more per year.

The figures for June represented the momentum that had been built arising from the dramatic upscaling of our ecological resources.  It takes time for these to bed in and for people to be trained in them.  We had learned from our work on the Coillte licences and were beginning to apply what we had learned in the area of private licences through appropriate assessment assist, or AA assist.<\/p> <p>  If I may take one brief moment to explain, we have really valuable ecologists who are key in considering files to ensure that decisions meet the requirements of the habitats directive and are robust.  We wanted to make sure they spent their time looking at ecological issues exclusively.  This new process, AA assist, generates the material in draft format by pulling material from various spatial sources and so on and presents documentation to the ecologists, who then use it as the basis for their assessment.  We were beginning to see the efficiencies in June as a result of the ecologists coming up to speed, of AA assist beginning to bed in and of a separate triaging process that was under way whereby five or six inspectors were looking at more than 1,400 licence applications to see if they could be tidied up before they went to the ecologists.  It was interesting to see that approximately 50% of these applications had to be returned as further information was required.  These licence applications were intercepted.

They are both essential to increasing the value of the forest but I have seen an example of what might have been considered to be a benign thinning operation leading to a massive impact on a highly protected species in a nearby watercourse.  Both are significant interventions involving machinery and, potentially, the crossing of water or the disturbance of protected species.

The backlog in the issuing of licences is still unacceptable.  That has come across in every meeting we have had and every time we have brought in a Minister or someone from the Department.  There has been no visible improvement or internal reform within the forest service that would address the causes of the inefficiency.  Part of the problem is that the officials tell us they are waiting for a list of the actions needed to resolve the problems and the crisis.  They pretend they are waiting for the different parties involved in Project Woodland to come up with the solutions.  Nothing can emanate from that process other than the recommendations made in other reviews.  As has already been asked, how many recommendations or reviews do we need to have before action is taken?<\/p> <p>  Someone spoke earlier about having patience.

The crisis in growing trees within the private landowning sectors is deepening because the issues causing the crisis are not being addressed.  <\/p><p> I want a guarantee from the Minister of State that the level of consultation with the people who are growing these trees and who know what is involved better than most will increase.

There has been engagement with ash plantation owners and forest owners.  They have told us the value is not in a 25-year-old plantation.  That is why we introduced a change in the last week or so.

The scheme is only in place for over a year so this is a welcome change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021080400002#L00300","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1628031600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>The Minister of State spoke earlier of encouraging new farmers to come into the sector.  Someone else referred to patience.  I will use my county and that of the Cathaoirleach as an example.  The planting of trees in Tipperary plummeted to an all-time low last year, with 12 ha planted compared with 1,200 ha planted in 2001.  Forestry licences are taking almost two years to process.  How does the Department encourage new farmers to come into the industry when they see these figures?<\/p> <p>  Separately, recent figures showed that licences for 899 afforestation projects, 573 forest roads and 4,487 felling projects are still awaiting decision from the Department.  We all know the backlog is there but there is a kickback in that the backlog is causing problems further back with sawmills and so on.  What assurances can the Minister of State and the officials give that these kinds of figures will have improved by the end of the year?  Personally, I have no confidence at this stage.  We have listened every time the Department representatives have been before the committee and we keep hearing how it will be at the end of the year.  We are in the first week of August now.  The end of the year is coming fast.  Unless we take something out of the Olympics and people start sprinting, I do not see how we will get anywhere near the numbers being talked about before the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  Can the officials give assurances to farmers in Tipperary that the position as regards the figures I cited will improve by the end of the year?  Can they give assurances that sawmills and so on will finish up with enough timber at the end of the year and not have to source timber outside the country?  Everyone is being caught up in this, from farmers all the way back to building merchants, who are short of timber.  Timber is needed for the building of houses.  What assurances can the officials give these people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021080400002#L00400","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1628031600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>The Deputy referred to the target of 4,500 licences to be issued this year.

We were on an upward trajectory towards the end of June.  That would have continued.  I look forward to seeing that continue and achieving an increased number.  In itself that might instil some confidence in the sector and cause applicants to apply for licences and to afforest their farms in some way or other.<\/p> <p>  The example of Tipperary was given by Deputy Browne.  It is probably worse to think about land use in constituencies.  I do not imagine there are many areas of Tipperary lying idle waiting for something.  The land will be used for something.  Someone will be using the land.  Whether it is the owner or whether it has been rented to another farmer, it will be in use.  That is also an issue in terms of the competition for land for forestry and other land uses, which are usually agricultural land uses.  That is worth keeping in mind and it is something we have to look at in terms of how we encourage farmers, as Deputy Browne rightly said, to plant trees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021080400002#L00500","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1628031600,"counter":140,"content":"<p>There must be a bigger issue as the number has gone down from 1,200 ha to only 12 ha.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021080400002#L00600","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1628031600,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I suggest the challenges are from other land use sectors.  We have seen expansion in the dairy sector in recent years.  That puts pressure on.  It is easy for a farmer to rent land to a dairy farmer potentially when he knows he will get his land back after five or ten years, if he signs a lease that is long enough.  If we put that up against afforesting land for 30 years, it is a decision people can make in a short time.  This is where we have to look at what we want as a nation from our land.  Do we want to have more trees?  If we do, then we have to look at ways of incentivising farmers and private landowners to plant.  As I have said before, I accept that if we are to meet our afforestation targets in years to come, we will have to rely wholly on farmers and private landowners to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021080400002#L00700","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1628031600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I have some questions.  The Minister of State said the Department had not received any submissions to date on all the cases that have been delayed because of SI 293 of 2021.  If we do get submissions, is there a plan in place to ensure this will not cause further delay?<\/p><p>Alternatively, are we looking at a scenario like we had with emergency legislation needed for appeals in the recent past?<\/p><p> The prohibition on planting on unenclosed land is a policy introduced by a Government a number of years ago.  What is the Minister of State's view on that policy and on a complete or partial lifting of it to allow certain areas to be planted?  There is clear scientific evidence that a blanket ban on unenclosed land is not beneficial to the creation of habitats for the hen harrier or other species.<\/p><p> The Minister of State talked about afforestation and we are all in full agreement that the level of afforestation is worryingly low.  Senator Lombard said the next generation would ask questions about how we allowed this to happen.  Does the Minister of State have plans in place to increase the level of afforestation?  Does she have a plan for extending the premiums for between 15 and 20 years to make afforestation more attractive to farmers?  What is her view of the percentage of afforestation that should be Sitka spruce?  If we are to have a commercial industry going forward, we need Sitka spruce.  Does the Minister of State have a set ratio she believes provides the best divide between natural woodland and Sitka spruce?  What is the environmental-commercial balance she sees for the industry?<\/p><p> The officials spoke about putting through legislation to provide that thinning and roads would not need a licence.  They put environmental reasons forward for not doing so.  I do not agree with that assessment.  This land was granted a licence for afforestation.  It is a natural progression from that to have thinning and roads in place.  If we are to get to grips with the licence situation, thinning at least needs to be exempt from the requirement to secure a licence.  Whatever we have to do to achieve that in legislation needs to be done urgently.<\/p><p> I welcome the Minister of State's commitment that she will help people in financial trouble because of the lack of licence output in their negotiations with financial institutions.  As Deputy Martin Browne and other speakers have said, unfortunately people who have had machines repossessed have come knocking on our doors.  Their lifetime's work has virtually gone down the tubes.<\/p><p> I accept the Minister of State has made changes regarding ash dieback, which are welcome, but there is not near enough recognition of the financial hardship and loss that people who owned ash plantations have suffered.  This crop was going to be hugely valuable when it reached maturity at 35 or 40 years of age.  In many cases, ash was planted on good arable land because it was seen as suitable.  We have made a recommendation in this committee that once the land is cleared, these plantation owners should have the choice, given the experience they have had, of replanting their land or putting it back into arable production.  They should have that freedom to choose.  The least we can do as legislators is to allow those plantation owners to have access again to premiums.<\/p><p> We can argue about how the disease came into the country but one thing that is certain is that it was not the plantation owners' fault the disease came in.  Wherever the blame lies, it is not at their door.  They have suffered huge losses.  I and others have visited plantations in my county and surrounding counties.  It galled me to see the disease in those trees.  While some of them might have a salvage value for firewood, by the time labour is paid to get the timber out, the owner would be lucky not to be in a minus situation.  We owe it to these plantation owners to give serious consideration to allowing them to get access to premiums again.  In all other cases, when people are replanting, they have got a significant financial gain from the clear-felling of their crop, as they are entitled to do, but these plantation owners have not got that.  They have a salvage operation at best to clear the site and if they replant, it would be natural justice that they be entitled to premiums. <\/p><p> Those are the questions and observations I have and if the Minister of State could address those in the limited time left, I would be grateful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021080400002#L00800","speaker":"1611","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1628031600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.  I will go through his questions in no particular order.  I have scribbled notes in front of me.<\/p> <p>  The Chair mentioned premiums for afforestation.  That is something to look at in the next programme from 2023 onwards.  When we decide what our new forestry strategy will be, it can feed into that.  It will be a strategy for the next 50 years.  As immediate an issue as forestry is at the moment, it is a long-term project.  That is something we can examine.<\/p> <p>  On the proportions of spruce versus hardwood, there is no absolute figure on this.  We need a balance.  We are delivering for biodiversity and for the sector.  One of the programme for Government commitments is to look at having a closer to nature forestry model across the board.  Coillte is working on converting current Sitka spruce forests into continuous cover and that may be something we will look at down the line.  It is a cause of deep frustration to many communities that the current model is that the crop is planted and then clear-felled 35 years later.  It totally changes the environment and has a significant impact on the landscape and the land.  We may, therefore, see more continuous cover of spruce going forward.  We have to increase the amount of broadleaf planting we do as well.  We do not have any hardwood processing facilities here.  In the decades ahead, maybe we should look into whether that is worthy of consideration.  There may be an examination of that over the next few years.<\/p> <p>  The unenclosed land piece was one of the recommendations of Jim Mackinnon's report.  One could argue that unenclosed land tends to be upland or blanket bog.  Many upland areas were planted 20 or 30 years ago that probably would not be planted today.  We have to be cognisant of where we are planting.  Hen harriers do not particularly want trees around them.  They want big open spaces.  In my area near the Slieve Blooms, afforestation is having an impact on that species.  It is a protected species which we are actively trying to protect.  We do not want trees in hen harrier areas and people would appeal an afforestation licence in an area close to a hen harrier zone.  It is important to keep that in mind.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Collins will respond on the statutory instrument.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021080400002#M00200","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1628031600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>If I recall, the question was on whether there was a plan in place to deal with any submissions that come in.

It is important that the ecologist, before doing the final appropriate assessment determination, looks at the file to which submissions received are added and will be available for viewing.

There is clear evidence that different stages of afforestation are proving beneficial to the creation of habitats for hen harriers and that wide open spaces are not necessarily what is most beneficial for them.  We will not get into an argument on that.  Doctors differ and patients die.  There is clear evidence about different stages of afforestation.  The capital value of land has been decimated by the policy that has been introduced and is 20% of what it was before the ban.  If we are going to impose a blanket ban for whatever reason, whether it is beneficial or not, we have to have a compensation plan in place that will at least restore the capital value of that land.  I have never seen the capital value of land be eroded with so little compensation for landowners as in this case.  If land is in a designated area like that, it is worth 20% of what similar land in non-designated areas is worth.  That is factual and will have to be addressed.
