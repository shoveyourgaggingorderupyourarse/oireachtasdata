Deputies Carroll MacNeill and Sherlock have advised that they will be late arriving due to other engagements.<\/p> <p>  I welcome everyone to the meeting.  While Covid-19 restrictions have been relaxed, it is open to members and witnesses to attend in person.  They should continue to wear face coverings when not addressing the committee.  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness.<\/p> <p>  This morning we shall engage with officials from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to examine its financial statements for 2020.  TII has been advised that the committee may also wish to following matters during the course of the engagement: TII's role as a sponsoring authority for MetroLink; public private partnerships, PPPs; and matters relevant to TII's remit in recent correspondence from the Department of Transport to this committee.  That correspondence is item R0967.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from TII: Mr. Peter Walsh, chief executive; Mr. Nigel O'Neill, director of the capital programme; Mr. Pat Maher, director of network management; Ms Audrey Keogh, director of business services; Mr. Cathal Masterson, director of commercial operations.  Attending remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House are the following officials from the Department of Transport: Ms Ethna Brogan, assistant secretary; Mr. Garret Doocey, principal officer, who was with us last week; Mr. Andrew Ebrill, principal officer in the national roads, greenways and active travel division; and Mr. Dominic Mullaney, principal adviser in the regional and local roads division.  They are all very welcome. <\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask Members and witnesses to mute their microphones when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that mobile phones are on silent or switched off.<\/p> <p>  I wish to explain some of the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the precincts of the Parliament is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  A number of today's witnesses, however, are to give their evidence remotely, from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.  Such witnesses have already been advised of this and they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to specific witnesses.  If a question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time he or she contributes.  This applies mainly to those contributing online from a remote location.<\/p> <p>  I now call on Mr. Seamus McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022020300002#A00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643880600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>TII was formed in 2015 through a merger of the former National Roads Authority, NRA, and the Railway Procurement Agency.  TII&rsquo;s primary function is to provide an integrated approach to the development and operation of the national roads network and light rail infrastructure throughout Ireland.<\/p> <p>  TII&rsquo;s income in 2020 totalled &euro;1.435 billion, up from &euro;1.340 billion in 2019.  The majority of this income comes from Exchequer grant funding.  As a result of the impact of Covid-19-related travel restrictions, road toll income fell from &euro;192.6 million in 2019 to &euro;138.5 million in 2020.  There was also a drop in other income due to a fall in passenger numbers on the Luas system.  This resulted in TII making a &euro;30 million payment to the Luas operator, which was funded through a public service obligation, PSO, grant it received from the National Transport Authority, NTA.<\/p> <p>  TII&rsquo;s expenditure in 2020 amounted to &euro;1.466 billion, of which &euro;1.349 billion was related to expenditure on the road network.  The majority of this was in the form of payments to local authorities, including &euro;427 million provided in relation to the national roads system and payments of &euro;546 million made on behalf of the Department of Transport in relation to regional and local roads.  The Department retains decision-making power over the allocation of that funding and is responsible for the oversight and monitoring function for those roads.  Expenditure related to PPP contracts for parts of the national roads system amounted to &euro;173 million in the year, comprising operating and finance charges.<\/p> <p>  I certified the 2020 financial statements on 28 June 2021 and issued a clear audit opinion.

I am joined by Ms. Audrey Keogh, director of business services, Mr. Cathal Masterson, director of commercial operations, Mr. Nigel O'Neill, director of the capital programme, and Mr. Pat Maher, director of network management.  I understand that the committee wishes to examine TII's financial statements of 2020 and the area of public&ndash;private partnerships.  Before I make some general comments about 2020 and the area of public&ndash;partnerships, I would like to describe briefly the duties and functions assigned to TII through legislation.<\/p> <p>  The NRA, operating as TII since 2015, was established under the Roads Act 1993.  It is the general duty of the authority to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads, having regard to the needs of all users.  TII is the approving authority for national road projects.  In 2015, the NRA was merged with the Railway Procurement Agency, and the Roads Act of 2015 added the function of securing the provision of, or providing, such light railway and metro railway infrastructure as may be determined by the NTA.  The NTA is the approving authority for metro and light rail projects.  In September 2021, TII became the approving authority for greenways.<\/p> <p>  In relation to 2020, the onset of the global pandemic had a significant impact on TII.  In March 2020, the Government classified the national road network and the Luas network as critical transport infrastructure.  Luas and national roads continued to operate, without interruption, throughout all the restrictions that Government put in place to combat the spread of Covid-19.  All staff who could moved to remote working.<\/p><p>The measures imposed to combat the spread of the virus reduced the volume of vehicles on national roads and passengers on Luas, with a consequent reduction in revenue to TII.  Revenue from national road tolls for 2020 was &euro;56 million less than originally forecast.  The reduction in toll revenue was managed to ensure that all activities were kept going and fully funded.  The Luas revenue shortfall was addressed by the provision of &euro;30 million in PSO payments by the NTA.  This was the first time TII received PSO payments since the commencement of Luas services.  I am happy to report that the Comptroller and Auditor General expressed an unqualified opinion on the 2020 financial statements.<br\/><br\/>On PPP contracts, I would like to outline why TII entered into them, how TII's PPP contracts are structured and what the outcome was.  Why did TII develop and enter into PPP contracts?  In 1999, the Government decided to adopt a PPP approach on a pilot basis in order to fund public capital projects.  In the national development plan, NDP, for the period  2000 to 2006, the Government set a minimum indicative target of &euro;1.27 billion for private sector investment into national road projects.  The use of PPP contracts was identified as an essential component in contributing to the financing and delivery of the national road improvements.  The stipulated that funding structures, including road user tolls, where appropriate, were to be examined.<br\/><br\/>Section 4.109 of the NDP in question stated that the pilot projects announced by the Minister for Finance in June 1999 would all be developed as PPP projects within the period of the plan, namely, 2000 to 2006.  These included, subject to statutory procedures and negotiations where appropriate: a new western river crossing in Limerick on the N7; the Waterford by-pass, including a new bridge over the Suir, on the N25; the second West-Link Bridge on the M50.  In addition, the potential for a PPP to develop the Kilcock-Kinnegad section of the N4 was to be actively explored.<br\/><br\/>The Government established the central public private partnership unit in the Department of Finance at the beginning of 1999, to lead, drive and co-ordinate the process and in mid-1999 the Government established a Cabinet committee on infrastructural development, including public private partnership.  The Cabinet committee focused initially on transport, notably the core interurban road network.  In response to these policy decisions, TII established a PPP unit and developed a bundle of nine PPP contracts which, following competitive tendering, were entered into during the period 2003 to 2007.  Details of the nine projects are in an information note I provided to the committee.  In total, &euro;1.75 billion of private finance was raised by the PPP companies and used in the delivery of these nine road projects.  The NDP for the period 2007 to 2013 reiterated Government policy that PPPs would have an important role to play in the delivery of that plan.  It stated that a PPP approach would be considered for appropriate projects.<br\/><br\/>On 31 January 2008, the Minister for Transport informed the chair of the NRA that:<\/p><blockquote>\t... the Government recently reviewed the financing arrangements for Transport 21.  Arising from that review it is now proposed that a number of national road projects, involving capital expenditure of the order of &euro;1 billion euro, should be undertaken as unitary payments public private partnerships. <\/blockquote><p>In compliance, TII developed a bundle of four PPP road contracts and two motorway service area contracts.  In total, &euro;1.22 billion of private finance was raised by the PPP companies and used in the delivery of these four road projects and six motorway service areas.<br\/><br\/>How are national roads PPP contracts structured?  There are three types of PPP contract that TII has entered into.  Eight are road toll concession contracts.  Five are availability, design, build, operate, maintain and finance, DBOMF, road contracts and two are motorway service area concession contracts.  There are two key features of PPP contracts that make them different from the traditional form of civil engineering contracts which are used to deliver road infrastructure for the State.  The first is risk transfer and the second is the commitment to the long-term operation and maintenance of the asset.<br\/><br\/>In terms of risk transfer, there are two types of risk which are transferred from the state to the PPP company.  The first is construction risk.  I have been involved with civil engineering for more than 40 years and I know that construction risk does manifest and when ground conditions or weather conditions do not turn out to be what had been anticipated it costs money to rectify or mitigate the consequences.  Construction risk is transferred to the PPP company in all 15 of TII's PPP contracts.<br\/><br\/>The second area of risk occurs where the funding structures include road user tolls.  In these contracts, the risk relates to traffic forecasts.  Of TII's eight toll concession PPP contracts, the traffic risk has been fully transferred to the PPP company in six and partially transferred in two.  The traffic volumes that were forecast by the PPP companies in the years 2003 to 2007 did not materialise.<br\/><br\/>The second key feature of PPP contracts is the commitment to the long-term operation and maintenance of the asset.  TII's eight toll concession contracts have contract durations of 30 years for six of them, 35 years for one and 45 years for the remaining one.  TII's five availability contracts have contract durations of 25 years for four and 35 years for one.  The two motorway service area concessions have 25-year contract durations.  During those years the PPP company must operate and maintain the road or service area.  At the end of the period, the road or service area must be handed back with a minimum residual life.  The minimum residual life varies for different elements of the asset.  For example, for pavements it is ten years.  The payments relating to these services are strictly controlled by the contract conditions.<br\/><br\/>I will outline what was delivered by PPP contracts.  The major interurban motorway network, connecting Ireland's five major cities to Dublin was completed by 2010.  The PPP contracts delivered key elements of that network.  In total, PPP contracts have delivered more than 400 km, approximately one third, of Ireland's motorway network and six motorway service areas.  The contracts have proven to be robust, with the successful transfer of construction risk and traffic risk to the PPP companies.<br\/><br\/>The operation and maintenance requirements are appropriate for the safe operation of the motorways and the maintenance of the value of the assets which will handed back to the State at the end of the contract durations.  Today, the PPP companies employ 540 full-time and 400 part-time staff in the operation and maintenance of the 400 km of motorway and the provision of services at the six motorway service areas.<br\/><br\/>The operating standards have been maintained.  The motorway network remained open and safely operational throughout extreme weather events and Covid-19 necessitated public health restrictions.  PPP contracts have delivered, and continue to deliver, very good value for money for the Irish taxpayer and have contributed in a very significant way in the creation of a safe and efficient motorway network for Ireland.  That concludes my opening statement.  My colleagues and I will endeavour to answer any questions that members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022020300002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643880600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Walsh.

At that time, I raised the issue of roadside parking of heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, in Rosslare.  My next comment is not aimed at Mr. Walsh.  In general, the solution is not very satisfactory.  I know it is an interim solution.  We continue to park these vehicles on the roadside albeit they are off the main thoroughfare on a link road.  We have a serious commercial driver shortage.  It is a worldwide shortage.  As an island nation, Ireland depends very much on road transport.  None of the stakeholders that have been engaged in this - everybody from the Office of Public Works, OPW, to Wexford County Council to TII, the NRA, Rosslare Europort and even Revenue - have given consideration to the health, safety and well-being of the driving population.  That no consideration is given to their sanitary provisions is a poor reflection on how we regard what I would regard as front-line workers.  If you were to enter the OPW facility and tell the customs officers they would not be able to use a toilet, you would not get the same level of co-operation.  I want it on the record that we are doing nothing as a country to support our front-line workers in that regard.  I thank Mr. Walsh for his engagement because it is not his primary responsibility.

From a safety point of view, there are two programmes of work.  One is reactive and the other is proactive.  As for the reactive one, we take all the accident statistics and analyse them, identifying accident clusters and then reporting those back to the local authorities for them to comment as to whether an engineering intervention is an appropriate way of responding to that particular circumstance or whatever other comment they wish to make on it.  That informs our safety programme, and that could then end up in either a minor improvement, which could be a realignment of the road or a much lower level intervention or a widening of sight lines or whatever the issue might be.  That is one programme of work.<\/p> <p>  The second is a proactive one, whereby we undertake an investigation.  We inspect the routes and pick up what we think might be hazardous circumstances, which then make their way into a programme of works.  The structural or operational performance of the network is something Mr. Maher and his people in network management survey continually.  That is largely done by machines.  A vehicle drives the road and picks up everything from cracking to deflection to surface deformation and so on.

The decision is out of the hands of TII because it was delayed in 2012 when a decision made, which I imagine added costs to the project.  There was the route alignment, which I would love to investigate further with Mr. Walsh.

It is the first time we have come to this level of designation.   Bearing in mind that the Department has determined that there should be a specific amount for protection and renewal and a specific amount for new roads, the split in the funding we are receiving for the years 2021 to 2025 is 54% for protection and renewal, including minor interventions, and 46% for new roads.

However, there has been a substantial shift in funding with a greater emphasis being put on active travel.  I get that but there is a balance as well because we must get goods to and from ports, people have to get to work and there are long distances as well.<\/p> <p>  I raise the N80 bypass at Mountmellick.  By the way, the Maidenhead work is complete.  That was a good job.  That was going on for a long time.  On Mountmellick, two routes were proposed back in the 2000s.  One was a very long one that started back way out in Derrycloney and went a long way cross-country.  It was too long.  Then there was a very short one that came in over the bridge into Irishtown in Mountmellick.  However, it cut across through the car park of a restaurant and a business.  It was not good.  It had a right-angle junction on it.  That was too short.  TII has come up with another route which is better.  This is what I wanted to ask about.  The feasibility studies have been done and I am concerned there may be a move away from providing those relief roads.  This relief road shortens the journey distance and the journey time.  It is not getting traction in the sense of getting the priority it needs.  Mountmellick itself is congested with trucks.  There is a junction at Glanbia with Pearse Street where the road comes into the centre of town.  There are trucks trying to manoeuvre around that from both directions.  It is very difficult.  They are travelling up and down narrow streets.  It is a very difficult situation.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Rosslare Europort and Brexit, which Deputy Verona Murphy obviously will have a special interest in.  Instead of a lot of west of Ireland and midlands freight going to Dublin, it is now travelling down the N80 through Mountmellick and on to Rosslare.  I live further down on the N80 and have no complaints about that.  Does Mr. Walsh believe that now needs greater priority in terms of ramping up the need for that because this will go on forever?  The feasibility study will be out of date and so will the preferred route.  There is talk of a second bypass linking the road over to the Portarlington and Emo road.  That is important within the greater scheme of things but it is the N80 project that is really the big deal for shortening journeys and getting traffic, especially HGVs, out of the town centre.  Would Mr. Walsh see this as a major priority when it comes to carbon reduction and also trying to deal with the impact of Brexit and the greater importance Rosslare Europort now has?  That is my question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022020300002#Q01200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643880600,"counter":406,"content":"<p>Okay.

If we got the HGVs out of the centre, we might get more people walking and cycling in Mountmellick and get more businesses going because there would be more footfall on the street itself.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Walsh mentioned that PPPs reduce risk for the public purse, which is good.  He mentioned the two areas of construction risk and traffic risk.  I will deal with that briefly.  On the construction risk, let us say a 10 km or 20 km route must be built and has difficulties similar to what the TII had near Limerick, where the road had to go through a bog, or the tricky territory on the N7 and N8, a construction company would have a fair idea of the implications before submitting a price.  Mr. Walsh mentioned weather as well.  A lot of these roads were built before climate change became a major factor.  I am not convinced of that argument.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Walsh also mentioned the issue of traffic risk.  My understanding is that, for many of those roads, there is a built-in provision, what I think is called a varied operational payment.  I have read the advance briefing notes from cover to cover to get to the bottom of this issue.  There is a built-in mechanism where traffic volumes fall, for example, because of Covid in 2020.  Am I correct in saying in respect of the N7-N8 Kildare-Laois bypass that there is provision for a variable payment clause if traffic volumes drop below a certain point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022020300002#R00700","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643880600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022020300002#R00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1643880600,"counter":412,"content":"<p>There is for some of the routes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022020300002#R00900","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643880600,"counter":413,"content":"<p>Only two out of the eight, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022020300002#R01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1643880600,"counter":414,"content":"<p>When these roads were built at the end of the 2000s, traffic volumes were increasing and were projected to keep going that way.

The New Ross bypass was more than a year late in construction from the programme the contractor had originally presented and worked to, or tried to.  It had various difficulties but it bore all of that cost.  Until such time as that road was finished, the taxpayer paid nothing.  So the availability of the road was key and it was up to the contractor to manage that, and it did.<\/p> <p>  I know from our own experience of design-build and in terms of the alternatives, we have gone through various contract forms.  We would have had the third edition of the IEI contract first, and there were various clauses there for the claiming of additional costs associated with ground conditions, adverse weather and so on.  We had FIDIC, which is an internationally recognised contract type that had areas of allowable risk, areas where the risk fell back on the employer - the State.  Those claims were pursued in each case.  We always pursued a policy of lowest price tendering so the lowest price won the contract.  For that reason they have to price it optimistically.  Even under the current public works contract there is a schedule K of compensation events, which if any of those events occur, the contractor is entitled to payment.

That was impressive.<\/p> <p>  Moving a little bit further south to the Naas bypass, I am one of those who has been around long enough to remember sitting in a car in Naas for an hour and a half while travelling in either direction.  When the bypass was built I was struck by the two-lane carriageway to funnel traffic to Dublin from four cities, namely, Kilkenny, Waterford, Cork and Limerick.  From day one, the road became a bottleneck and it was then retrofitted.  I suffered as a result of that retrofit.  I remarked to somebody earlier that I spent three hours and 50 minutes travelling to the Houses one day.  I arrived here at 1.50 p.m. after leaving my office in Portlaoise at approximately 10 o'clock.  The road is now much better but from day one it was clear there was going to be a problem.

I thank the committee for holding this item over until this week.  I wanted to get a deeper understanding of how the service level agreements operate between nine Departments that are funders through the education silo of An Taisce.  When I looked at the 2019 accounts and the various circulars relating to the operation of the relationship between the line Departments and An Taisce, the correspondence coming back to us reflected a concern in respect of seeking clarification regarding the 2019 accounts.  An Taisce's 2019 financial statements stated that a change in An Taisce policy will result in a stipulation for a small allowance for organisational costs and innovation in all funding agreements going forward.  That set off an alarm bell in my mind because I was not sure whether some of the funding that is specifically for programmes that are well notified to us, such as the Green Flag, Investigate Forests, Clean Coasts and the Blue Flag, was being brought out of the educational silo of An Taisce, which delivers many of the programmes, and into the main An Taisce body.  That was the concern I had and I wanted to seek clarification.<\/p> <p>  Based on the correspondence we received back, it seems there are very specific engagements between the funders and An Taisce in respect of buttressing or strengthening service level agreements or reviewing current service level agreements or contracts in respect of that funding.  That provides one with a degree of confidence.  In the case of one Department, which I think was the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department clarified this was not compatible with public financial procedures, stating the grant moneys must be spent entirely on the programmes the Department has agreed to fund within the specific conditions of those grants and that failure to adhere to these conditions could result in funding being withdrawn and possibly the recoupment of unapproved expenditure sought or other legal enforcement.<\/p> <p>  The impression I had was that, quite literally, An Taisce was taking a bit of a tranche of some of that funding-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022020300002#DD01000","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1643880600,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Allocating it for a purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022020300002#DD01100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1643880600,"counter":581,"content":"<p>-----and allocating it to An Taisce, which I understand is essentially a membership organisation.  When we look at the delivery of the programmes I referenced, we can see they are excellent programmes and we are very lucky to have an organisation like An Taisce to deliver them.  I just wanted to seek clarity on that.  Based on the correspondence, it seems individual line Departments are taking a rigorous approach to interrogating that relationship and the 2019 accounts.<\/p> <p>  I am not a financial or management accountant.  If An Taisce is a membership organisation, from a public purse and financial probity point of view, do each of those line Departments, the State, the Government or, ultimately, the taxpayer have a right to look at the financial strength or otherwise of the parent organisation when they are funding that organisation?<\/p><p>In other words, does the parent organisation have to be in a solvent position before it can receive funds?  That is just a curiosity of mine.  The reason I am curious about that is because if, on An Taisce's previous year's financial accounts, auditors were saying that - and I am quoting from its financial accounts - for organisational costs and innovation and all funding agreements, that an allowance would be made and there would be a movement of some of the moneys then, one wonders, why that is the case if An Taisce is a financially robust organisation.  Hopefully, that can be clarified for me.  It may not be within the remit of this committee to have that clarified.  Again, I seek the Chair's wisdom on that.  <\/p><p> It serves a vital function in terms of the delivery of its excellent programmes, and it permeates out with citizens proactively involved in delivering those programmes.  It has built a consciousness and awareness and set of programmes that have had a massive impact in communities at the most local level.

The nub of the point the Deputy is making is that, before the parent organisation would provide funding to a body such as An Taisce, it would check the financial position of that body.

The Secretariat have reviewed all of the responses and have ascertained that the level of oversight of An Taisce by the entities is proportional to the level of funding that they provide, and the required service level agreements in place are in line with Circular 13\/2014 [this is the important one] - Management of and Accountability for Grants from Exchequer Funds. <br \/><br \/>The responses also vary in relation to the funding entities&rsquo; knowledge of the restatement of the 2018 figures within the 2019 financial statements. The entities that provide the higher levels of funding to An Taisce were aware of the restatements and placed reliance on the unqualified auditors opinion.  The remaining entities that were unaware of the restatement have made enquiries of An Taisce and will be carrying out the necessary reviews in order to ensure required compliance.  In some instances Departments noted that they withheld funding from An Taisce until they were satisfied with the responses received from their enquiries into the 2018 restatement. <br \/><br \/>Finally, in relation to the funding authorities satisfying themselves as to the intended use of the Exchequer funding, the responses received stated that regular meetings were held and An Taisce&rsquo;s reporting requirements under the various agreements were proportionate to the level of funding provided to An Taisce.  Some responses also noted that the majority of the funding on certain schemes run by An Taisce was on the basis of vouched expenditure.  <\/blockquote> <p>I thank the secretariat for scrutinising that and the Comptroller and Auditor General.

Just to get clarification, does the secretariat's briefing note cover the Government Departments and the non-departmental public agencies as well?

If it does not, could we incorporate that in terms of having an overall view, as we would with any organisation that is in receipt of substantial State funding?  The word that is being used in terms of oversight is that it is \"proportional\".  What we are dealing with is a large number of relatively small funding mechanisms.

It was very helpful.  From the 2018 restatement, I have to say it does not appear to be a major financial issue, rather a kind of accounting error.<\/p><p>Just for clarity, we are talking about many agencies.  We made inquiries and we got responses back from them as follows.  The Department of Rural and Community Development had no significant issues and was satisfied as was the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which had no significant issues.  None of the following raised significant issues either - the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Education, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Failte Ireland.  Usually, when something comes to this committee, it is because there has been a significant issue identified.  <\/p><p>This week, and I think it is important to have this on the record, a senior EU official, Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea, who oversees governance, enforcement action and compliance on EU environmental legislation, called Ireland out not only - and I know it was well reported - on the cost of observations in terms of environment protection but he also talked about the climate of discussion in Ireland when it comes to environmental protection.  <\/p><p>That is what we are really talking about here.  It is the work that An Taisce does, funded by its members.  As we all know, it does not use Government funding for this.  It funds this from its members to observe on issues such as cheese factories and environmental projects that might go ahead.  One of the things he said that is of particular concern to the EU is an increasingly aggressive stance being taken against environmental campaigners in Ireland.  I quote:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThere is evidence not only of increased use of (strategic lawsuit against public participation) SLAPP suits, but also negative reporting in mainstream media, and even from politicians &ndash; like threatening to cut off funding to certain NGOs... or negative reporting (of such).  <\/blockquote> <p>Just in today's session, we have had discussions around whether it is solvent and the financial strength, or otherwise, of parent organisations.  There has been a characterisation of the strengthening of the legislation or the wording in SLAs, as arising from something that has happened within An Taisce, which is absolutely not the case.  <\/p><p>Here we are today, watching this being played out.  We have not identified any wrongdoing in terms of public funds and An Taisce.  What we are doing today is undermining that organisation and fomenting suspicion around the operation of a body for wholly political reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022020300002#EE01100","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1643880600,"counter":593,"content":"<p>We are considering information that came back to us from An Taisce.

I would like to think that if there are items of clarification that might be of use to us in ensuring public money is spent to deliver value for money and for its stated purpose, we would ask the relevant question regardless of the issue or organisation before us.  I am an agriculture spokesperson.  I do not get involved, and have not passed public comment on, legal cases, even where there were Ministers on both sides, with one criticising and another supporting the legal action.  I do not pass judgment one way or another; I never have done.  As agriculture spokesperson, I deal with farm organisations whose objectives and mission statements I support but I would never consider those bodies to be above questioning by me on any matter requiring clarification.<\/p> <p>  Part of the problem we have had in this State for too long is that when politicians support the objectives of an organisation, they move to the point where they believe the organisation is beyond question.  That is a dangerous and unfortunate position.  I hope this committee is above that.  I do not believe that, in my time as a committee member, the questions asked and inquiries made were for anything other than to pursue the stated aims of the committee.  In most instances, I have been pleasantly surprised by the fact that Government representatives on this committee have been willing to support reports, questions and lines of inquiry that are very critical of Government Departments.  That is the way we should pursue our business here.  We should deal with every organisation in a courteous manner and ask questions when necessary.  We should accept the assurances that are given, but I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy that, when talking about public money, we have a right to know whether an organisation is drawing down substantial amounts such that members of the committee can be absolutely satisfied regarding it and say with hand on heart that we have done our job without fear or favour.  That is how I approach all these issues.

Part of the problem here was evident when we met representatives of the HSE for two or three sessions last year to deal with the health services in their entirety.  Therefore, there is no way any one area would get the level of scrutiny it probably deserves.  In talking about bringing in witnesses to talk about the mental health services, Deputies Catherine Murphy and McAuliffe have rightly pointed out that even within that category we could probably use all our meetings for the rest of the year to scrutinise a specific topic.  The first thing we must do is to expedite this endeavour as quickly as possible, because there has been serious public interest in this topic.<\/p> <p>  This week alone, I have heard four senior Government representatives say in the D&aacute;il that money is not an issue in this regard.  Clearly, then, we must find out what is happening with all this money that is apparently being allocated to our mental services if we as public representatives are dealing with people every day of the week who are telling us they cannot access them.  I suggest that we invite the senior management of the HSE, including the CEO, to appear before the committee as soon as possible, as proposed by Deputy Munster.  We can clarify in our private sessions what aspects we will be dealing with.  I do not envisage this being a once-off meeting.

The crisis in mental health is increasing weekly.  It is imperative to have representatives from the HSE appear before the committee.  As Deputy Carthy suggested, we could have a private meeting ourselves to set out what exactly we need to know.  The general topics, however, would include the budget, a breakdown of it and information on the delivery of services, including details of service provision in each CHO area.  We will need all that type of information.  It will be a minefield, but despite the amount of money we are told is being thrown at the mental health services, not one person could honestly put up his or her hand and say that he or she can see the results on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022020300002#HH00900","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1643880600,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I understand that funding for mental health services constitutes 6% of the overall health budget.

That is the best thing to do, and may be helpful.  Several difficulties arise when trying to schedule meetings.  As we have seen over the last year and a half, we can have difficulty scheduling meetings with representatives from organisations because of availability, diary conflicts or the time needed to prepare.  It is difficult to arrange the schedule as we would wish it to be.  The secretariat works diligently in this regard.  It is not something done just once a month.  The secretariat works not only weekly but daily, indeed, to engage and to try to keep things moving along.  They do that six, seven and eight weeks in advance.  It will be noted that it was difficult to schedule meetings at different times during the pandemic because we were not even sure if we would be able to have meetings.  Arrangements cannot be made fortnightly or every three weeks, because if representatives from one organisation do drop out, then it will not be possible to fill that slot at short notice.  It is necessary to give people a month's notice to allow them to prepare.  I ask the committee members to bear that point in mind.  Moving one meeting will have unintended consequences for people in other areas.  I ask the members to be mindful of that aspect as well.<\/p> <p>  To outline the schedule, we have matters nailed down until 3 March.  Commitments have been sought and given, and the preparation work has been done.  To allow the secretariat to make the necessary arrangements and to avoid any potential scheduling difficulties, I will set out the work programme up to 5 May, as outlined in the work programme document circulated for today's meeting.<\/p><p>From 10 March, we will move into a series of justice-related meetings.  We are scheduled to engage with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, on that date.  Last week, we agreed to engage with the Policing Authority the same morning.<\/p><p> The following week, beginning 14 March, is a non-sitting week.  On 24 March, it is proposed to schedule an engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and on 31 March, with the Department of Justice.  If, for example, we schedule the meeting on mental health issues for 10 March, it will mean changing that arrangement again.  I hope I am reflecting accurately that it is the committee's wish to get those issues relating to justice and the Garda, that is, with GSOC, the Policing Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, within the same block.  We agreed last week that we will try to do it over two weeks.  If we move the meeting of 10 March, it will mean kicking the can down the road on meeting those three bodies again.  I do not know whether the committee wishes to do that, but I am just pointing out that it could create a difficulty.<\/p><p> I am also mindful of the point raised by Deputy McAuliffe, namely, that it may be better to try to cover this mental health piece in a series of meetings.  There may have to be two or three related hearings on mental health-related issues.  I ask members to bear that in mind, although I am open to suggestions about how we deal with it.  As it stands, we will start those justice-related meetings on 10 March.  L&aacute; Fh&eacute;ile P&aacute;draig is 17 March and the next public meeting after that will be held on 24 March, when we will deal with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That will then conclude that set of meetings.  I appreciate the urgency of this and I agree with Deputy Munster on the area of mental health services.  We have had representatives of the HSE before us a number of times and, unfortunately, we have not had an opportunity to deal with mental health services.  The issue requires and deserves a proper examination.

The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that the witnesses comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  This committee will observe fair procedures in these meetings.  If any other persons identified in evidence before this committee is of the opinion that a mistake or a fact of misstatement, including a misstatement by the omission of necessary or relevant context, has been made affecting him or her, they are invited to give a statement of evidence in writing and relevant documents to this committee.

I am joined by my colleagues Mr. &Eacute;anna Rowe, our western regional manager and Ms Sin&eacute;ad Mallon, our head of administration for property and legal.<\/p> <p>  Waterways Ireland is the cross-Border navigational authority responsible for more than 1,000 km of inland navigable waterways across the island of Ireland.  It is the largest of six North-South implementation bodies established under the Good-Friday Agreement.  Its statutory function is to manage, maintain, develop, and restore specified inland navigable waterways, principally for recreational purposes.  Last year, more than 3.2 million people used the waterways, creating social, economic, and environmental well-being valued at &euro;560 million annually.  <\/p> <p>  Waterways Ireland was established through the transfer and consolidation of assets of multiple agencies, including the Shannon Navigation Commissioners, CI&Eacute;, OPW, Rivers Agency and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht, and the Islands, inheriting properties that were previously the responsibility of these organisations.  Very little of this property was registered in the Land Registry.<\/p><p>Waterways Ireland is before the committee to provide information in respect of petitions 9\/21 and 23\/21.  These relate to developments at Lough Ree.  There are several statutory provisions dealing with the River Shannon and Waterways Ireland property ownership.  An 1839 Act appointed and empowered the Shannon Commissioners to determine and define the limits of the River Shannon and to produce 45 maps known as the Shannon jurisdiction maps, which show property boundaries and jurisdiction.  Subsequent legislation transferred this ownership to Waterways Ireland.  The immediate focus of Waterways Ireland on its establishment was to ensure waterways were open and accessible.<\/p><p> In 2009, Waterways Ireland established a land recovery team, comprising two staff members, to secure the property portfolio on the Royal Canal.  This took four years to complete.  In 2021, we established a dedicated small group of staff to focus exclusively on recovery and first registration.  We continue to examine encroachments, including the alleged encroachments referred to in these petitions.  Currently, 52% of our property portfolio is registered or at an advanced stage of registration.  We anticipate completing the programme to secure the property portfolio transferred to Waterways Ireland will take significant resources.  The detail involved in registering our property portfolio is complex with significant administrative and legal inputs.<\/p><p> In relation to the leasing of Waterways Ireland property, planning permission is typically a prerequisite to considering any development and granting leases on our property.  In relation to Portaneena, this development began in the 1950s and has taken place incrementally since then.  Waterways Ireland was notified in 2012 about a development at Portaneena, parts of which were alleged to be unauthorised and encroaching on our property.  Since then, Waterways Ireland has conducted inspections and written to the occupiers.  We understand the same development was also brought to the attention of Westmeath County Council in 2012.<\/p><p> In 2017, Tidebrook Limited, of which the petitioner Mr. Michael Barrett is or was a director, applied to the Circuit Court for an injunction under section 160 of the Planning Acts in respect of the alleged unauthorised development, naming The Portaneena Company Limited and Waterways Ireland as respondents.  The Circuit Court made an order in 2019 refusing the application and dismissed the proceedings.  Waterways Ireland deferred completion of its own investigations of alleged unauthorised development at Portaneena until the planning authority had completed its investigations into the planning status, and until all litigation under the Planning Acts had been determined.<\/p><p> It is important to note that the Circuit Court has now ruled on this matter.  The court found no evidence that Waterways Ireland had engaged in any alleged unauthorised development or had consented to or facilitated any alleged unauthorised development and had acted in good faith in relation to all aspects of the matter.  The judge stated she \"was not satisfied that the applicant demonstrated proof of any adverse environmental or planning impact\".  Tidebrook Limited filed a notice of appeal to the High Court and later withdrew the appeal in July 2020.  We are not in a position to go into the specifics of any alleged encroachment at this time as it may pre-empt the outcome of any investigation and risk prejudicing any future action Waterways Ireland might wish to pursue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022020300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Nixon-King","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643846400,"counter":671,"content":"<p>By way of introduction, my name is Barry Kehoe and I am director of services for transportation, planning and economic development at Westmeath County Council.  I am accompanied by Mr. Cathaldus Hartin, senior planner with responsibility for delivering the daily planning functions of the local authority.  I welcome the opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Public Petitions and to provide assistance on matters related to the aforementioned petitions.  In this regard, it should be noted that the council has engaged extensively with respect to all developments to which the petitions relate.  Such engagement constitutes prolonged enforcement and associated legal actions and in this regard a brief summary of the history associated with the sites is set out in appendix 1.  This is included for the record but does not form part of the council's statement to the committee today.<\/p> <p>  Westmeath County Council has been engaged in planning enforcement activities in this area for many years and it is acknowledged that there are several developments on and adjacent to the lakes and the River Shannon that do not have the benefit of planning permission.  In some cases, the development in question predates the Planning Act of 1963 and in other cases, development took place on an incremental basis over the years without recourse to the planning authority.  Other development may have been undertaken in blatant disregard of planning laws and it should be noted that the council remains actively engaged in enforcement proceedings in suspected cases of unauthorised development, save for circumstances in which the Statute of Limitations applies.<\/p> <p>  The council monitored the hearing of the committee held on 9 December 2021 and welcomes this opportunity to give the council's perspective on the general planning issues raised.  By way of opening, it is considered that an Oireachtas committee is not an appropriate forum to ventilate legal arguments on particular cases, which have already been subject to court hearings and may be subject to ongoing legal action now or in the future.  Furthermore, this is a public meeting, none of the affected parties is present or represented and the council does not benefit from the protection of privilege that is in place for Members of the Oireachtas.  It has been noted that Tidebrook Limited, to which one petitioner would appear to be associated, is listed in the Legal Diary as having an ongoing High Court action against Portaneena Marina Limited, which is the subject of the petition.  Rather than discussing the individual cases, I refer members to the factual position from a council perspective, which is set out in the appendix to this statement.<\/p> <p>  In terms of general planning enforcement issues, having regard to the general issues raised at the previous meeting of the committee, the council comments as follows.  While the local authority is charged with the implementation of the Planning Acts, including planning enforcement, it is important to note that the council is not all-powerful in this respect.  The successful implementation of the planning system requires the co-operation of a large number of stakeholders, including the council but also landowners, developers, business people, the courts, Departments, State and semi-State agencies and local communities.<\/p> <p>  It is the case that the council has, on many occasions, prosecuted individuals and companies to the full extent permitted under the law and has nonetheless failed to achieve planning compliance.  While the legislation provides for the council to take direct action, this is not always practical or reasonable.  The process associated with securing these orders can be lengthy and costly and can carry significant risk for the council.  In this context, the council must, in all matters, be mindful of consequences associated with interfering with citizens' rights, property rights, proportionality and legal and financial risk.<\/p> <p>  We recognise the concerns expressed by the petitioners in respect of the current legislative provisions in this area.  Planning legislation has evolved significantly since the introduction of the Planning and Development Act 2000, undergoing extensive and incremental amendment.  Significant challenges have been presented in terms of alignment between national and European legislative frameworks, as evidenced in the increasing rate of challenge to planning decisions, many of which are based on environmental matters.  As such, the frameworks within which the council operates are complex and subject to legitimate challenge.  In this regard, the council welcomes a recent initiative by the Department to carry out a full review of the Planning Act.<\/p> <p>  A lacuna exists in our planning legislation in that it is not possible to regularise development in instances where an environmental impact assessment report, EIAR, or Natura impact statement, NIS, is required as part of an application for retention permission.  Previously, a mechanism existed under the substitute consent process, as set out under Part XA of the Planning Acts, which allowed parties to apply to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for permission to regularise permission for certain developments considered to be non-compliant with provisions of EU law.  However, following the Supreme Court decision of 2020 in the matter, certain provisions of this substitute consent legislation were struck down regarding the requirement to demonstrate \"exceptional circumstances\" for regularisation.  The decision also highlighted the requirement that members of the public should be able to participate in the process from the initial stage.  Consequently, the conditions under which substitute consent can be availed of are extremely limited and apply in exceptional circumstances only, as must be determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p> <p>  It should be noted that the removal of development in such circumstances can have further unintended and unwanted negative environmental impacts.  It is the case that a conviction for contravening the Panning Acts constitutes a criminal offence and, as such, there is a significant burden of proof attaching to the prosecuting authority.<\/p><p>This burden makes planning enforcement a much slower and more complex process than is realised by some observers and leads to delays that are very frustrating for impacted third parties.  It is also the case that the defendants in such cases often mount vigorous defences due to the seriousness of the charge.  In addition, some courts can be reluctant to convict, having taken all of the circumstances into account.  As with all matters, the council must make decisions on the action that is appropriate in any case based on a careful consideration of the issue, its local and wider impact, bearing in mind the human and financial resources available to it as well as the risk in terms of legal and other costs.<\/p><p> Westmeath County Council is actively engaged with and committed to the enforcement of the Planning Acts, as determined by the Oireachtas.  It is actively engaging in the legislative review that is under way under the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022020300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Kehoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643846400,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nixon-King and Mr. Kehoe for their opening statements, and I thank both organisations for attending.

I am struck by two other aspects.  One is the correspondence that we have received, which we went through in private session.  It has a lot of content and background information which I was certainly not <i>au fait<\/i>with or aware of at our December meeting.

I confirm that I am on campus but the fact we are even having this conversation shows that members are uncertain and unsure.<\/p><p>I ask the Chairman to deliberate on whether we should proceed and indicate whether he feels comfortable that we proceed.

We have given notice to the witnesses and I appreciate that they have come in and given their time.  From the correspondence that we went through yesterday in private session and from what I have heard today in the opening remarks made by both organisations, there seems to be a very grey area and a narrow point in which we can continue a discussion.

I am shocked by what we are discussing at this meeting.  We seem to be here to discuss a matter that has already been before the courts and on which a Circuit Court determined there is no evidence for the claim.  A court of law made that determination.  Westmeath County Council, in its statement, summed up my gut feeling on this matter when Mr. Kehoe said that this committee is not an appropriate forum to ventilate legal arguments on a particular case, which has already been subject to court hearings.  As Waterways Ireland said, that may prejudice potential future actions.  The Chairman spoke about fair procedure and the right of people affected to be invited before committees.<\/p><p>He spoke about our statutory obligation to ensure we do not identify anyone in such a way as to make him or her recognisable.  My understanding, however, is that at the previous meeting, many allegations were made, references to maps were held up and this did help identify people.

The initial petition on this referred to unauthorised development on the River Shannon.  Waterways Ireland's statement struck me in that it indicates very little of this property is included on the Land Registry.  I am not talking about any individuals or court cases; this is about the River Shannon in general.  The bodies that controlled this matter before it was handed over to Waterways Ireland, namely, CI&Eacute;, the OPW, the then River Agency and the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, surely had some paperwork to say who owned the land or whether they were just minding it for somebody.  In my constituency, in Youghal and east County Cork, there are agreements going back to 1604.  The Duke of Devonshire still holds the rights to the seabed in Youghal.  Waterways Ireland stated, &ldquo;Currently, 52% of our property portfolio is registered or at an advanced stage of registration.&rdquo;  This was supposed to be about unauthorised development on the River Shannon.  We are not here to catch anybody out.  In fact, this is a way of assisting our guests&rsquo; organisations.  Waterways Ireland seems to be overstretched, at only 52% capacity in regard to the properties it controls.<\/p><p>One term appeared repeatedly in the opening statements.  The statement by Westmeath County Council refers to &ldquo;several developments on or adjacent to the lakes and the River Shannon that do not have the benefit of planning permission&rdquo;.  It goes on to state:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn some cases, the development in question pre-dates the Planning Act of 1963 [so there is an issue there] &hellip; development took place on an incremental basis over the years without recourse to the Planning Authority.  Other development may have been undertaken in blatant disregard of planning laws and in this regard it should be noted that the Council remains actively engaged in enforcement proceedings in suspected cases of unauthorised development, save for circumstances in which the statute of limitations applies. <\/blockquote> <p>The committee is not pointing the finger at anybody, but is there a possibility, because of the limitations on the Land Registry or because of historical planning issues, that unauthorised development is still happening on the River Shannon over which the council does not have control?  Is it possible private companies are moving in without the council's knowledge or control?  That is the question we are trying to get at.  It is not about individuals.  Individual cases were raised as a red flag, but it seems Westmeath County Council, while trying to do its best with enforcement measures and so on, lacks power.  Similarly, Waterways Ireland is at an infancy stage whereby it is trying to gather all the information, statistics and what it can control and use.  In between, there are, possibly, people or entities taking advantage of the planning structure or the flawed planning laws that exist.<\/p><p>That is the case we are trying to highlight here.  It is not to point the finger at anyone but rather to get a collective picture, assist the organisations and flag it with the Government in case more resources are needed to deal with the issue.  Last night, I noted the term &quot;unauthorised development&quot; appears repeatedly in our guests' statements and in the appendix supplied by Westmeath County Council.  It is possible someone could come in with a caravan and put it on concrete blocks for seven years.  After seven years, the limitation period will have expired and he or she could install a solid structure and get away with it.  Is this a planning issue?  Is it possible this behaviour is still going on?  That is what I want to know.  It is a calamity at the moment because Waterways Ireland does not have all the information in respect of the portfolios and so on that it controls.  Westmeath County Council is trying to enact enforcement orders when it can but it is caught in a crux between archaic planning laws and seven-year rules.  Is it possible today that there are unauthorised developments all along the River Shannon over which our guests' two entities have no control?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CPP2022020300002#D00300","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1643846400,"counter":689,"content":"<p>On a point of information, based on our discussion before Deputy Buckley came in with a more general question, the agenda for today is quite specific and relates to a particular site.

To my knowledge, the Owenacurra centre has approached the Joint Committee on Health and the Committee of Public Accounts.  The centre has exhausted most avenues.  It has called for meetings with the HSE.  It has exhausted the avenues open to it which is why I feel that this committee dealing with it is so important.  In fairness to the health committee, it has said that it will facilitate a visit to the centre so that members can see it with their own eyes and compare what they see with the reports from the HSE.<\/p> <p>  Despite what people may think, it has not been disjointed.  There has been good dialogue between some of the worried families, the HSE and the health committee.  As I said, some of the petitioners want the Committee of Public Accounts to get involved because public moneys are involved here.  The investment of public money in the centre is the crux of the issue.  When committee members hear the petitioners' statement on this, it will totally clarify the situation that patients and their families are in.  It will also give members a clear picture of the impact that the choices being offered by the HSE will have on patients.  Then when we hear the HSE's side of the story, that will give clarity in terms of the whole picture.

In fairness to Senator Murphy, this committee certainly wants to hear about the concerns of constituents and their local centres.  There is no question about that.  To the point that Deputy Higgins made earlier, we also must be cognisant of our work and duplication with other committees.  The Chairman suggested that the clerk would seek information from other committees and I would not limit that to the health committee.  From listening to colleagues, nobody seems to be certain which committee is involved.  This group is obviously very active and I commend its members on their work to date.  If they have corresponded with other committees and subcommittees of the Oireachtas, we need to find out.  Perhaps they have been in touch with the Sub-Committee on Mental Health or another Oireachtas committee.  We need to be sure whether a site visit is happening.  Deputy Buckley says the visit relates to the physical building, and that is fair enough.  It might not be about the services.  I cannot imagine an Oireachtas committee attending a site and not discussing the services in tandem with discussions of a building.  Why would a building be repaired if there are not to be services?  They will have a discussion around everything.  We need to have that report, as Deputy Higgins rightly said.  I would also like for this committee to inquire of all other Oireachtas committees to see is this on the agenda for any other committee.  When we establish that, Senator Murphy's point about the regional health forum is a very good suggestion.  It is more targeted.  The regional health manager would be at those meetings, along with the other professionals within the HSE.  We might not actually get that audience at a meeting of ours but that is not to say we should not try.  We must ensure there is no duplication happening in the Oireachtas.

We are joined from An Taisce by Mr. Gary Freemantle, interim chief executive officer Mr. Ian Lumley, head of advocacy, and Dr. Mark Clinton, monuments and antiquities.  We are also joined from Archaeology Ireland by Dr. Sharon Greene, from the Local Authority Archaeologist&rsquo;s Network by Dr. Ruth Johnson, network chairperson, and from Transport Infrastructure Ireland by Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Swan, head of archaeology and heritage.  I thank them all for their attendance here today, for their submissions and opening statements in advance, and for assisting us in trying to craft this legislation so that it is fit for purpose.<\/p> <p>  On privilege, I must remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in the public meetings.  For those attending the meetings remotely from within the Leinster House complex, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contribution to today's meeting.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present within the Leinster House complex.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  <\/p> <p>  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I will ask our expert witnesses to make their opening statements and we will then move to a questions and answers session with members.  To keep the meeting flowing we will keep those segments to seven minutes, which is seven minutes in total for the question and the answer.  We have much expertise both online and in the room so if members wish to put a question directly to one of our witnesses, that would also be helpful.  If any of the witnesses wish to contribute they may raise their hands to indicate that they wish to come in on an answer and I will try to accommodate that as best as possible.<\/p> <p> I now turn to Mr. Freemantle, on behalf of An Taisce, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#A00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643846400,"counter":792,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  The National Monuments Act was passed in 1930.  Over the ensuing years, there have been periodic amendments with one motivation, that is, to perfect, strengthen and streamline the protection of our national built heritage.  As a result, the heritage protection legislation of this State reached the point of being the envy of colleagues from most other European jurisdictions, that is until the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004 undid all the good work of previous generations and cast us, in legislative terms, back into the Stone Age.<\/p> <p>  In 2001, the Heritage Council published Archaeological Features at Risk: A Survey measuring the Recent Destruction of Ireland&rsquo;s Archaeological Heritage.  The survey established that 34% of the State&rsquo;s archaeological monuments had been destroyed since 1840, and that the destruction was continuing at an alarming rate with land \"improvement\" work bearing a large responsibility for the ongoing destruction.  However, despite this warning, the 2004 amending Act determined that: \"The consent of the Minister ... shall not be required where the works [relate to] an approved road development\".  In the case of a national monument, the Minister could: \"issue directions to the road authority concerned\" to: A: \"preserve it\", B: \"renovate or restore it\", or C: \"demolish or remove it wholly or in part...\".  It is of great relief to find that this latter clause will be consigned to the dustbin.  We are left, however, with an enduring negative impact and legacy by the ethos created by the 2004 amending Act.<\/p> <p>  This State has never failed to promote and trade on the great history and heritage of the island.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland relentlessly sells it abroad, Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East being one example.  Tourists are encouraged to visit our ancient monuments and historic sites.  However, as tourism has constantly grown, our menu of sites to visit remains static.  Clearly, we need more new sites to cater to an ever-growing number of visitors to our shores.  Yet, while archaeologists are finding these new monuments, the State has been busy facilitating their systematic removal, resting on the full support of blatantly discriminatory legislation.  However, even if the legislation is rectified, there would still be residual problems.  How can it be appropriate for a Minister who has granted an excavation licence on strict archaeological conditions, to be the authority who can subsequently issue the<\/p> <p>destruction order for the same monument, in direct contravention of the terms of the original licence?  Surely, it should be unacceptable that the fate of a monument is subject to the decision of the Minister of the day.  The current Act states that, in considering the fate of a monument, \"the Minister ... is not restricted to archaeological considerations [alone] but is entitled to consider the public interest\".  The relevant Minister will arguably be guided by political expediency.  The Minister&rsquo;s officials and employees will inevitably have to service the agenda of the incumbent.  <\/p> <p>  Archaeology is a broad church.  It would be generally accepted that most of the recognised leading authorities on the various elements of archaeology are to be found outside the public service.  How can it be acceptable that there is no cultural-heritage court of appeal or ombudsman to adjudicate on the fate of disputed sites and monuments of note?  The original monuments Act clearly advanced the concept of having authoritative expert advice readily available to the Minister responsible for heritage in the form of an advisory council.  In these modern times the composition of a re-activated advisory council should have a broader representation but be drawn exclusively from a pool of suitably qualified independent candidates, with no conflicts of interest.<\/p> <p>  Having the input of an advisory council would facilitate openness and transparency.  It would create checks and balances, and ultimately confidence and trust in the system.  Opposition to the advisory council in the Republic of Ireland would bear a striking resemblance to the opposition generated against the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The subsequent work of that agency is now regarded as an essential aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s protection of the environment.<\/p><p>The 2004 amendment to the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994, in the words of the Supreme Court, &quot;removes a bundle of protections&quot; from the Act.  This was made crystal clear in the decision by the Court of Appeal on the 1916 Moore Street site.  It was ruled that, despite the monument having been declared a national monument, its full extent or historical landscape could only be defined by the relevant Minister.  The Court concluded that, as the law stands, it was a matter of &quot;a purely political assessment&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Circa 1,000 monuments at approximately 750 sites are in the ownership or guardianship of the State, that is, in the care of the Office of Public Works, OPW.  The remaining approximately 129,000 monuments are in private ownership and vast numbers of them are not accessible to the public.  Climate change will inevitably have an adverse effect on many of these monuments, especially those that are of purely earthen construction or located on exposed coastlines.  Given the scientific reality of climate change, should the proposed legislation not incorporate the necessary legal procedures under which these increasingly degrading monuments will be properly safeguarded and cared for?<br\/><br\/>Since 2007, nine prosecutions have been taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, on the recommendation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for alleged offences under the National Monuments Act 1930 and the National Monuments (Amendment) Acts 1954 to 2004.  The proposed Bill contains counterproductive defences that could be employed by a person accused of damaging or destroying a monument.  It would also:<\/p><blockquote>\tProvide for the establishment of civil enforcement procedures in relation to contravention of the Act, including powers for the Minister ... to issue enforcement notices requiring the remedying of contraventions of the Act, subject to a right of appeal to the courts. <\/blockquote><p>The former proposition is unwelcome.  The latter innovation may prove very useful.  It is commendable that the proposed Bill will assist in implementing the 1972 Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.  This convention was ratified by Ireland in 1991.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, informed this committee on 27 January that objective D was to provide for the ratification of key international conventions in heritage protection.  However, this begs the question of whether this is the correct time and opportunity to implement the 1992 Valletta Convention.  It is a valuable heritage protection instrument and has already been adopted by Ireland on 16 January 1992.  It came into force on 25 May 1995 and was formally adopted by Ireland in 1997.  The convention makes clear that archaeological or historical landscapes must be given full recognition and legislative protection; the &quot;protected monuments and areas&quot; and &quot;archaeological reserves&quot; referenced in Articles 2 and 4 of the convention.<br\/><br\/>Monuments that can be thousands of years old and are, by their geographical and cultural affinities, intrinsic elements of the very fabric of this nation can reasonably be defined as national resources.  Ownership of national resources is vested in the Irish people under the Constitution.  These cultural treasures deserve our respect and protection, even if it is against our own agents.<br\/><br\/>It is time to restore the credibility of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004 and introduce checks and balances into the system.  Failure to do so would be unforgivable.  The broad thrust of the proposed monuments and archaeological heritage Bill will clearly go a long way to achieve that objective.  It might be reasonable to suggest that with adjustments and additions, it could easily achieve more.<br\/><br\/>An Taisce proposes that the Valletta Convention should be incorporated and implemented into the proposed legislation; that the enhanced legal protection and potential penalties could be seriously offset and largely avoided by the notification of the relevant parties at the earliest opportunity, that is, to prevent destruction rather than to subsequently have to prosecute and to reactivate the monuments advisory council to integrate checks and balances into the proposed legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Freemantle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643846400,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I ask the witnesses to try to keep their opening statements to approximately five minutes.

At the time it was put together, archaeological heritage played a significant role the building of national identity.  By necessity, changing times gave rise to a number of amendments.  It has long been acknowledged that a new Bill is required.  Both Irish society and the practise and discipline of archaeology have changed in the meantime.  However, archaeology is still relevant to Irish society.  It plays a role, for example, in promoting a connection with your local area and a pride of place that does not rely on family connections and it can be used to help people to engage on important issues such as climate change.<br\/><br\/>Continued availability of information on places recorded in existing registers, such as the sites and monuments record, in the proposed new register is essential.  The National Monuments Service should be applauded for the accessibility of the current registers and much other important information on its website.  Included under head 9 of the general scheme is, &quot;promotion of public awareness of [this] Register&quot; and promotion of knowledge and awareness is key to other aspects of the scheme, especially Part 8 which explicitly refers to the promotion of public knowledge and awareness.<br\/><br\/>It will be essential that the details of this new legislation reach the general public when the time comes.  From our perspective, as communicators of archaeology, it is important to be aware that while there are many ways to make such information available, we must always ask whether it is actually reaching the intended audience.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that this proposed Bill continues to value our archaeological heritage and prioritise protection of sites, monuments, artefacts and related archaeological evidence.  Despite stretched resources, the National Monuments Service, the OPW and the National Museum of Ireland do excellent work in this regard and are always willing to make themselves available to members of the public who seek information or to report new discoveries or damage.  Our nationwide network of local authority heritage officers also deserve recognition, as they are recognised as the local point of contact on heritage matters.<br\/><br\/>My first year as editor of <i>Archaeology Ireland<\/i>coincided with the drought of 2018 and the widely publicised discoveries of new sites afforded by the resulting crop marks.  It was also the year of the discovery of the four impressive Bronze Age gold rings by a family in Donegal.  The public and media interest surrounding both of these events provided the opportunity to raise awareness not only of archaeology but of the obligations of the public in reporting discoveries and to explain how and why this should be done.  The result was a marked increase in numbers of newly discovered sites and artefacts reported.<br\/><br\/>Archaeologists might get the opportunity to share this information.  However, the audiences they meet tend to have already encountered or have an interest in archaeology.  Yet, archaeology is everywhere and belongs to everyone and we have an obligation to spread awareness of this heritage to all, both for their benefit and its protection.  The protect our past code for caring for monuments developed by the National Monuments Service last year is a valuable tool for those engaging with the public.  However, advice such as this and the 2014 advice to the public on the use of metal detection devices need to be continually shared and redistributed to ensure they do not become yesterday&rsquo;s news.<br\/><br\/>There is considerable public thirst for knowledge about archaeology.  However, when the public looks for information on archaeology, this is not generally the kind of information it seeks out.  This is why the provision in the proposed Bill for the requirement to label packaging of metal detection devices with a warning about the law with regard to their use is especially welcome.  It informs at the point of contact.<br\/><br\/>Irish archaeologists can be excellent communicators.  Many individuals and organisations have excellent publication records using books.  Archaeologists also engage with communities nationwide to share knowledge and research by giving tours or presenting talks.  A 2018 Heritage Council-Red C survey examined public perceptions of archaeology.  It was heartening for those involved in the profession to learn that 91% of respondents saw supporting archaeology as economically important.  However, the questions about the ways in which people engage with archaeology provided those of us dealing with communication with pause for thought.  The most common medium used is documentaries, with 45% of respondents watching them several times a year.  When one adds news reports on television and radio to this, the proportion rises to 71%.  Only 54% use the Internet and only 28% use publications.<br\/><br\/>While respondents agreed that archaeology is important for tourism, they were relatively evenly split when it came to awareness of the impact of high tourist and visitor numbers on sites.  Of greater concern, considering the high level of awareness within the profession and the efforts to make the information available, only 30% of respondents were aware that metal detection for archaeological objects without licence is illegal.  Consider the importance of the documentaries to which I refer.  It is inevitable that most of these are not Irish and, as a result, are potentially misinforming an Irish audience on some of these matters.<br\/><br\/>Clearly, while community engagement has increased in recent years, some vital information regarding care, conservation and legislation fall by the wayside.<\/p><p>Did the survey results suggest a way to combat this?  Perhaps they did.<\/p><p> There are high levels of interest, over 60%, in meeting archaeologists to learn more about what we do and to better understand archaeology&rsquo;s usefulness to the community.  Embedding archaeologists in the community would allow for a proactive as opposed to reactive approach.  It might be argued that this role is being filled by local authority heritage officers and there is no question that they have a role.  However, the remit of heritage officers is a very broad one that covers archaeology, biodiversity, natural heritage and more.  The heritage officers can come from any of these backgrounds.  It would be preferable to have a team of heritage professionals in all local authorities.<\/p><p> Recent increased funding for archaeological projects, such as the community heritage fund, are very welcome.  However, the capacity for those administering and supporting local funded projects at a local level also needs to be increased.  For this reason there is a need for archaeological professionals embedded in communities whether they be local authority archaeologists or some other form of regional community archaeologists.<\/p><p> As communicators of archaeology, we would make the following observations or recommendations to the committee.  When including provisions that directly deal with areas where the public engage with archaeology be it with monuments, artefacts or equipment, full consideration should be given to how people encounter and engage with archaeology.  This includes the fact that information and equipment can be sourced from outside the State, and that visitors to the State may need advice on Irish law.  A fully informed public can play a role in this.  Additional resources need to be made available to improve the capacity of existing organisations and institutions to deal with the increasing engagement of the Irish public with archaeological heritage.  As shown in 2018 and more recently during the pandemic, opportunities to raise awareness of public obligations can, when taken, result in a marked increase in workload for the authorities responsible for engaging with the ensuing engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sharon Greene","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643846400,"counter":797,"content":"<p>As spokesperson for the Local Authority Archaeologist Network, LAAN, I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to attend.  Today's meeting is held in advance of the network's scheduled briefing on the Bill with the National Monuments Service.  In light of this, and given the relatively short time that we have had to prepare, our response is going to be brief and high level.  We would welcome the opportunity to provide the committee with more detailed comments, through correspondence, following the briefing next week.<br\/><br\/>In 2018, the establishment of the Local Authority Archaeologist Network was approved by the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  Our members currently comprise 13 archaeologists working in seven local authorities, which are Cork city and county, Dublin city, and the counties of Kerry, Limerick, Mayo and Meath.  The network enables local authority archaeologists to share their professional expertise and join together to engage in communications with other agencies.  Local authorities deliver a broad range of services pertinent to that Bill, including planning and development management and care of the local heritage resource.  The archaeological resource is largely managed in accordance with the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.<br\/><br\/>The county development plans, and local area plans, provide the strategic framework and policy context for local planning decisions.  They provide the opportunity to protect, manage and promote archaeological heritage for public benefit at a local level.  Many development plans afford safeguards to archaeological sites discovered since the publication of the Record of Monuments and Places.  We ask that the new Bill will be designed in such a way as to interact effectively with the Planning and Development Acts, and support the role of local authorities in terms of our archaeological heritage protection.<br\/><br\/>The Monuments and Archaeological Heritage Bill is an important and very much anticipated piece of legislation.  As stakeholders, many of the network members have participated in previous working groups towards the preparation of this scheme.  We look forward to seeing a modern, consolidated and legal framework enacted that will meet the many challenges of today's operating environments.<br\/><br\/>A number of heads in the Bill directly concern local authorities.  The network will need more time to consider their implications in this regard and consult.  I refer, in particular, to where local authorities may be appointed as guardian by the Minister, in terms of enacted by-laws, and where the Bill refers to burial grounds under head 27.<br\/><br\/>The network will seek clarity and greater detail on a number of the heads in our forthcoming discussions with the National Monuments Service.  In particular, the interpretation and definitions of registered and prescribed monuments, the term &quot;relevant thing&quot;, and the levels and mechanisms for monument protection.<br\/><br\/>There are many practical considerations regarding the interface between architectural heritage and archaeology.  We note that there are both overlaps and gaps between the relevant legislative instruments with which we work today that leave gaps for industrial heritage and vernacular architecture.  We also have questions on the performance of functions, expenses, landowner consultations, dangerous buildings and environmental impact assessments.<br\/><br\/>The network welcomes specific aspects of the Bill, including Part 10, which concerns enforcement, and Part 4, which concerns objects.  We welcome the heads that concern activities, licensing and inventories.  We especially welcome the inclusion, and wish to emphasise their importance, of national guidelines and codes of practice to the committee as these are key to the Bill's successful implementation.<br\/><br\/>As an addendum to my statement, I wish to take this opportunity to draw the committee's attention, under Parts 8 and 9, to some personal considerations to resources, sustainability and managing the loss of archaeological heritage.  This is particularly an issue that affects subsurface archaeologists or archaeology in urban regeneration areas.  The principle of preservation <i>in situ<\/i>is enshrined in the existing legislation.  It is provided for in this Bill but it can be difficult to achieve, especially in urban settings.  Will provision be made for the reporting and evaluation of things of interest that are discovered during, for instance, licensed rescue excavations?<br\/><br\/>Further, where preservation by record is the agreed option, the project design excavation and post-excavation dissemination strategies are currently variable in rescue excavations.  We would like to see a levelling up to those standards currently implemented, perhaps, by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  Finally, I wish to refer to excavation results in the loss of the archaeological resource and the creation of a paper record, collection of artefacts and interpretative grey literature.  We ask that the committee considers whether the Bill can make provision for the dissemination of grey literature for public benefit as seen in initiatives such as the County Dublin Archaeology Government Information Service, GIS, and TII's web resource.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ruth Johnson"},{"type":"speech","time":1643846400,"counter":798,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Johnson.

Prior to that I was head of archaeology with the National Roads Authority from 2007 to 2015.  In total, I have 27 years postgraduate experience as an archaeologist.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the committee is undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny of the revised general scheme of the monuments and archaeological heritage Bill.   In my submission, I will highlight TII&rsquo;s purpose and outline our approach to managing archaeology and heritage.  I will then briefly refer to our consultations with the National Monuments Service of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage regarding this Bill.  Finally, I will highlight some of the important aspects of the Bill from our perspective.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, TII&rsquo;s purpose is to provide sustainable transport infrastructure and services delivering a better quality of life, supporting economic growth and respecting the environment.  TII delivers new national roads, light railway and metro, as well as active travel and greenway projects.  Furthermore, we operate these networks as appropriate.<\/p> <p>  Regarding archaeology and heritage, our primary objective is to minimise the archaeological and heritage impacts associated with our projects and programmes.  TII ensures this through legislative and policy compliance, and proactive risk management which, in turn, helps to build public trust.  TII is a key stakeholder within Irish archaeology in terms of commissioning works, promoting best practice, and developing guidelines and standards.  TII frequently engages with both statutory and non-statutory stakeholders concerned with heritage matters.<\/p> <p>  To ensure legislative compliance, we work in close partnership with the National Monuments Service and operate under an agreed code of practice for archaeology.<\/p><p>The most recent code was agreed with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2017.  The purpose of the code is to provide a single framework within existing legislation and policy to enable TII to progress with its programme of work in accordance with the Government's transport plans, for example, the National Development Plan 2021- 2030.  TII carries out appropriate archaeological assessment and mitigation having regard to an agreed set of principles.  The code requires regular communication between the National Monuments Service and TII with respect to the general approach taken to archaeology, as well as reporting on specific projects.  The code is applicable to all TII projects where TII is the approving authority, sponsoring agency, or both.  In managing risk, TII considers archaeology from the project's inception to the end of construction.  Where practical, TII undertakes advance archaeological works and, when this is not feasible, a bespoke archaeological strategy is developed.  This approach is reflected in TII's project management guidelines.  Furthermore, we use a suite of contract documents specifically designed for archaeology and heritage services in accordance with the Government's capital works management framework.<\/p><p> In building public trust, TII ensures that the results of archaeological and heritage works on TII's many projects are disseminated widely.  For example, making excavation and other heritage reports available through the TII digital heritage collections, which are publicly accessible on the Digital Repository of Ireland; engaging with the public at seminars and presentations; producing web-based story maps and audiobooks; and publishing books on the archaeological and heritage aspects of TII projects - accessible through the TII website.  TII is also actively involved in several research initiatives with archaeological partners both here and abroad.<\/p><p> In the context of the code of practice, TII has met the National Monuments Service on a number of occasions to discuss proposed legislative changes.  In October 2021, the Department of Transport invited TII to provide comments for the draft memorandum for observation in relation to this Bill.  Following this, TII met with the National Monuments Service to review our comments.  From TII's perspective, it appears from the revised general scheme that the Bill aligns well with current best practice in the assessment and management of archaeological and historic heritage in the context of delivering transport infrastructure projects and programmes.<\/p><p> TII believes this new Bill is timely, and we consider the following heads to be of particular relevance: head 3, which articulates broad policy principles at the outset; heads 13 and 15, which provide the Minister with the ability to prescribe exemptions in the case of non-damaging works; head 59 on bringing clarity as to which activities are licensable; head 60, which is about introducing an integrated licensing system to replace the multiple approval systems for the conduct of archaeological works, that is, section 26 licences, ministerial consents and ministerial directions for approved road schemes; head 68, which emphasises the importance of research and the promotion of knowledge; and head 70, which provides a statutory basis for the code of practice for archaeology and placing a general obligation on public authorities to have regard to historic heritage in the exercise of their functions.<\/p><p> In addition, TII notes the requirement to report \"finds of prescribed monuments\" in head 8, and considers that a structured system of reporting should be established, which does not become an administrative burden.  TII is of the opinion that there may be a need for secondary legislation to allow for the full implementation of Part 7 licences, which relates to heads 60 to 65.<\/p><p> Finally, regarding inventories, head 66, it is important that all relevant data sets are made available in accordance with open data policies.  As the National Monuments Service moves towards completion of a draft Bill, it has agreed to explore with TII how the Bill is anticipated to work in practice.  I will endeavour to answer any questions that the committee may have.  If I cannot provide a comprehensive answer today, I will provide a response as soon as practicable.  That concludes my opening statement.  I thank members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Swan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643846400,"counter":801,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Swan.

Archaeology is something that sounds dusty and old, but I agree with Dr. Greene's point that it is important to our everyday lives.

An Taisce has made three specific requests.  One relates to the Valletta Convention, which it was stated has been adopted.  It would be helpful if the witnesses could explain in more practical terms what specifically would be the benefit of incorporating the Valletta Convention into the proposed new legislation.<\/p> <p>  An Taisce specifically seeks a reinstatement of the monuments advisory council.

There were parallel conventions on landscape and architectural heritage.  The Granada Convention on architectural heritage in 1985 was very effectively transmitted into Irish law in 1999 and incorporated into the 2000 planning Act.  Despite having adopted the 1992 Valletta Convention in 1997, we have not adopted its key provisions.  Like a lot of international conventions, the Valletta Convention is simply named for the place where, in this case, the final signatory meeting took place.  It takes its name from the remarkable, historic, fortified city of Valletta in Malta.  The convention expanded on previous archaeological conventions in putting new emphasis on the overall context of setting up monuments.  I have a copy of the convention here.  In particular, Article 1 iii makes specific reference to defining the architectural heritage as not just structures and features themselves but their context, whether situated on land or under water.  The wider context is the land or physical setting of the monument.  Article 5 iii sets out the principle of the environmental impact assessment process and states that it should involve full consideration of archaeological sites and settings.<\/p> <p>  An Taisce is one of the many prescribed consultee bodies for archaeology under the planning legislation.  I have had oversight of that function for quite a long time.  When we get applications of a particular sensitivity, we call in local members, people with expertise, academics and others in particular on more complex projects like road schemes.  What we found is that over the years there has been a systemic failure to consider the wider landscape setting and context of a monument or the relationship of monuments and features to their being part of a wider complex, like Tara and Rathcroghan, which I cited in our submission.  There was in fact a significant court judgment on this about 30 years ago concerning a dump on the sensitive area of the megalithic complex at Carrowmore in County Sligo.  The court judgment concerned the impact on the setting of the archaeological monuments in the landscape.  The court recognised that it was not just the archaeological features that were of significance - the structure that could be clearly seen on the ground &ndash; but the wider context and setting.  That has been increasingly recognised in the archaeological world.<\/p><p>As an article in the magazine, <i>Archaeology Ireland<\/i>, showed, the drought in 2018, when we had that low rainfall period, dramatically revealed through drone footage and aerial photographs previously unknown sites, and showed that many isolated archaeological sites and features were in fact part of larger complexes surrounding them.  This recognition of the setting of complexes that relate to each other, and the setting of monuments, needs to be properly addressed and incorporated into legislation.  Looking at planning applications, there is this unwritten rule about 20 m, and there is an emphasis on test trenching and examining the individual site, but not enough consideration is being given to the setting and context of the site.  That applies to all categories of development, whether these are big infrastructure or the building of a farm shed structure near a ringfort, where the landscape setting is simply not being properly addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Lumley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643846400,"counter":805,"content":"<p>The second question-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#E00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1643846400,"counter":806,"content":"<p>The advisory council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#E00300","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643846400,"counter":807,"content":"<p>The cut and thrust of that would be, and what we are attempting to do is very important, checks and balances.  We use the phrase \"cultural ombudsman\".  I looked into it a little more.  Currently, there are seven wings or divisions of the Ombudsman covering the Garda, Defence Forces, the press, financial services, etc.  I noted that we have An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, which \"enquires into complaints from the public where it is alleged that public bodies may have failed to comply with the Official Languages Act 2003.\"  One option is to go down the road of an ombudsman, such as an teanga Gaelach has.  In many ways, the culture and heritage of Ireland is built on two pillars.  There is the language, which is for discourse, but also contains within it sagas, stories and legends and is the vehicle for the oral tradition.  In respect of monuments, for the people who spoke this language and told these stories, etc., these are the buildings and places they lived in.  These are the two pillars of Irish culture.  As Dr. Greene said, Ireland is built on its cultural uniqueness.  That is why we are a republic.  As such, if there is a Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, quite rightly looking after Gaeilge, where is its correlation?  There should be a court of appeal of either an ombudsman or an advisory council.

The hinterlands people stood in at the time did not have the political boundaries we have now, but different political boundaries.  Much of that is to be discovered.

The model in the North would probably be much better.  It would be useful for the committee if a piece of work was done and circulated.  Maybe the Oireachtas Library and Research Service could be asked about how different advisory councils work in different jurisdictions.  That might be able to feed into the work in preparation for this. <\/p> <p>  I welcome the quote from the Heritage Council's study that 34% of the State's identified archaeological monuments, and there are so many more as we have seen, have been destroyed.  I have not read the report, but does it have a list, or examples, of the destruction and where it is?  I know of some but, again, it would be useful if that report was circulated.  If it does not have a list, will the representatives provide us with examples of this destruction?<\/p> <p>  On foot of that, would the representatives accept that the vast majority of people who are owners, holders or protectors of national monuments in fact care for and protect them, given that we have 130,000 or so of such monuments?

Looking at the defences that can be used, ignorance is one of them.  Do the witnesses agree, and this is relevant to the archaeologists, local authorities and the representatives here today, that a lot more needs to be done by the State to identify these sites, whether it is through Google Maps, a cue card or some type of signage, which states that this a national monument and cannot be interfered with, or whatever warning sign?<\/p> <p>  The Supreme Court judgment in the Moore Street case was mentioned and the finding that the Minister can dictate the full extent of the historical landscape.

They obviously had to make their way along these back alleys and laneways, that are still there, which were very fraught with danger.  They had no idea what they were going to run into.  That would be a good example of a historical landscape, just like a battlefield, such as the one at Aughrim, where all the various forces were aligned and who moved where.  On the Moore Street site the Deputy specifically raised, the interconnectivity between the GPO and Moore Street is part of the battlefield landscape and to exclude the laneways means asking how the hell they got from A to B, or A to C in this case, B being the laneways.

As the register is to be updated, let us start with the updated register and seek to identify where the monuments are and on whose land they are situated.  The Land Registry Office could then issue to the landowners a short and concise note informing them that they have a ringfort or a megalithic tomb on their land, telling them a little about it, that it is a legally protected structure and what they should do if they propose to sell the land.  There have been examples of where land was sold and the new owner has pleaded that he or she did not know anything about the structure.  Everybody who has a monument on his or her land needs to be notified of its existence and given information about it.  Where a ringfort is demolished, there are subterranean features and objects within the trenches that enjoy their own legal protection under the National Monuments Acts.  A preservation order placed on the land where the monument once stood removes the motivation, people are aware of its existence, they know what it is, that it may not be damaged and that if damaged there will be no gain in it.  In doing this, the destruction of monuments would reduce to such a level we would never have to discuss the issue again.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#E01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Clinton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643846400,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Clinton.

It is much appreciated.  This is important legislation, which I broadly support.  It seeks to provide legal protections for newly discovered archaeological sites, to establish a single register of monuments, to provide a clear statutory basis for the Commissioner of Public Works or relevant local authorities to manage monuments and to establish a clear basis for the Minister for the local authority for legal title and ownership for the guardianship of monuments.  As currently drafted, the legislation allows for things to fall between two stools and for ambiguity.  This is important, encompassing legislation.<\/p> <p>  I come from a very archaeologically rich city, Waterford.  I understand the need to protect, record, report and display our rich archaeological heritage.  There are fantastic examples of this in my own city.  The Medieval Museum encases undercrofts within a modern structure, but this was done in such a sensitive way by the local authority that it has future-proofed the security of that for many generations to come.  However, a balance has always to be struck.  In many cases, there is a perceived lack of a pragmatic approach, in particular, to buildings, whereby the demands that are placed on the owners of a property in terms of, as mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, the costs involved are such that they result in buildings becoming vacant, derelict and ruins, rather than a pragmatic approach to saving a building with some modification that allows it to be preserved for future generations.  I would welcome the views of An Taisce with regard to that balance of demands.  Unfortunately, at times because the view is taken that it must be done in a such a strict manner, the costs are so prohibitive that ultimately it results in the loss of the building for future generations.  <\/p> <p>  I am sure the witnesses are familiar with section 57 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which allows for the owner or occupier of a protected structure to apply to the planning authority for a declaration as to the type of works it considers would or would not materially affect the character of the structure or any element of it.  There are considerable delays within local authorities with regard to applications that are made under section 57.  Is there benefit in exploring the possibility of a suitably qualified person, such as a graded conservation architect, being permitted to sign-off on works in consultation with the conservation architect within the local authority in order to speed up the process?  I am not suggesting that anything should be discarded but that we seek to streamline the process in the context of body of work currently under way in regard to dereliction and vacancy and bringing buildings back into productive use.

As he rightly said, Waterford city has set a national example in the care of its heritage, the management of archaeology, The Viking Triangle and in the development of the city as a major cultural centre.  An impressive number of beautiful museums have been developed in Waterford, which tell the story from prehistoric material to the Vikings, the Anglo-Normans and, moving into the 18th century, the specialist collections of silver and clocks.  It is a model that other European cities far larger than Waterford could not remotely match.<\/p> <p>  In our detailed submission, we have highlighted the challenges that arise for a landowner with a ruinous masonry structure, such as the remnant of a medieval castle, where mortar is exposed to wind and weathering and the building of the ruin may often be just part of the original structure, the survival of which in many cases represents quite a challenge for the landowner or property owner.

I was a member of the Heritage Council for a number of years.  The resourcing of local authority conservation officers is important.  Having employed in all of the local authority areas a well-informed conservation officer employed who can deal promptly with property owners, architects and others doing building works on protected structures is very important.  That resolves issues.  A great deal can be done by way of discussion that can avoid delays in the planning process.  The Senator's suggestion that the determination as to whether work can or cannot be done on a building without going through the process of section 57 determinations is a useful one.  Section 57 is a very useful part of the legislation.  It means that a determination can be issued that works such as re-roofing or other structural repairs can be carried out without the requirement to go through the planning process.

If we can capture those monuments and sites, from a development point of view, those may be considered as constraints we are trying to avoid in the course of the design of our cities.

I want to direct all my questions to Dr. Clinton.  I welcome all our guests.  I read all the submissions and they are excellent.  I have got a very positive vibe frorm them.  I soldiered with Dr. Clinton on an issue related to Carrickmines Castle a long time ago, therefore, I know of his work and expertise in this area.  I want to pick out a number of questions, technically, posed in An Taisce&rsquo;s collective submission.  How can it be appropriate for a Minister - it ties in with what he was about to say - who has granted an excavation licence on strict archeological conditions to be the authority that can subsequently issue the destruction order for the same monument, in direct contravention of the terms of the original licence?  That is taken word for word from the An Taisce's submission.  It is an important point.  I have serious concerns about the powers of a Minister with responsibility for heritage or any other Minister.  I want to clearly state I am not directing that comment at the current Minister as we have a really good committed Minister on the job at the moment, but we do not know who will be coming down the line.  I say it in a measured way.  I have thought about it.  I pay tribute to the current Minister and I do not doubt his commitment.  An Taisce's submission goes on to state: \"How can it be acceptable that there is no cultural-heritage court of appeal or [cultural] ombudsman to adjudicate on the fate of disputed sites and monuments off note?\"  That is a good point and one on which I will ask the committee to consider making a strong recommendation.  The submission also comments on the value of having the input of an appropriate and qualified advisory council.  That is an excellent idea and one I would fully support.<\/p> <p>  We all know about the Valletta Convention and I will not go into the detail of it.  We know its importance and significance.  I would suggest an acknowledgement in the Long Title of the Bill with respect to the Valletta Convention would cover us.  I would like to hear Dr. Clinton's view on that.  I think it is an important aspect.  <\/p> <p>  An Taisce, in its submission, also raised a concern about archaeologists working in the private sector and conflicts of interest with respect to developers, etc, and that is a very valid one.<\/p><p>First, they are not in a position to rule in favour or against their paymaster.  If one is an archaeologist employed by a massive developer that wants to carry out some destruction, there is a conflict of interest.  I am not saying all developers do or seek to do that.  I am just saying there are cases where it happens.  The witnesses say that a National Monuments Service and National Museum of Ireland-employed or accredited archaeologist answering to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is important.  <\/p><p> In summary, the Valletta Convention is critically important.  Regarding reactivating the monuments advisory council, the witnesses make three good sharp and concise asks, which I acknowledge.  I am directing my questions to An Taisce because I know its vast experience in this area.  This relates specifically to issues it posed in its submission to us today.  I thank everybody who made submissions.

We are very fortunate to have a very interested and committed Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage at this point in time.  It is such a relief.  In my tenure, I think I have fielded against seven Ministers.  Theoretically, the Minister with responsibility for heritage, however it is designated at the time, has this brief and responsibility but the differences between the seven were notable.  Right now, we have a good Minister.  We are all afraid of what is coming next.  One hopes for the best.<\/p> <p>  I think we covered the Valletta convention well.  It is a great agreement.  I have been reading it for years.  When Ireland ratified, I had been waiting for the opportunity.  We have been waiting for the Bill to finally arrive.  I was amazed when I read the heads.  The convention is there, which is excellent, but where is its friend?  Where is the Valletta Convention?  Anyone who reads it will see how good it is.  It addresses points raised by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh earlier about landscape and the context, as Mr. Lumley said.  Dr. Greene referenced the dry summer.  Suddenly one realises that the monument over there and this one here are actually connected but it takes a lot of detailed study, analysis and expert input.

If one does not know the answer to the question, one just says \"not my period\" but within the joke, there is the truth.<\/p> <p>  I would like to think I know a lot about certain aspects of archaeology but I do not know that much about things like wedge tombs.  I certainly would not be qualified to give a lecture on one.  Therefore, we must draw on as many experts as possible.  If experts are out there, we should use them.  We certainly saw that when the Irish economy was under threat.  The late lamented former Minister, Brian Lenihan, consulted and availed of the expertise of anyone he thought had a valuable input that could come to the rescue of the State.  We have all these serious archaeologists in the universities etc. outside of the public service.  We must draw on their knowledge otherwise what are we doing - ignoring it?

I imagine An Taisce runs into the same difficulties when it comes to national monuments.  One example was in regard to a building which is part of our industrial heritage, which Ireland does not have lot of, and that is the Player Wills building in Dublin 8.  The first line that came from developers was that it is not an important building, it is not architecturally significant and it did not need to be put on the record of protected structures.  Of course, the developer paid for a developer's report and the developer&rsquo;s report came back and said that, no, it had no architectural significance.  It was very difficult for me to push the local authority to do its own conservation report on it when the developer was not letting the local authority onto the site.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to problems and issues like that with regard to national monuments, what are the suggestions of An Taisce?  How could this Bill be amended so it is almost taken out of the hands of a local authority, for example, if it does not want to add anything because it sees it is impacting on an infrastructure project, or if the developer does not want to act?  How could this Bill be strengthened so that places that should go on the record do go on the record?<\/p> <p>  Does the Local Authority Archaeologists Network think the local authorities are sufficiently supported and staffed to take on the amount of current work in terms of national monuments or heritage protection?<\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that.  There is a lot in those questions but if I have some further time, the Chair can come back to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#J00600","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643846400,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I will give a brief starter, although Dr. Johnson would be able to answer on much of what the Senator raised.

Dr. Johnson has covered the resources and the committee has a wide remit on planning issues, water management and everything that goes through here.  Are there sufficient resources at local authority level and at planning level, etc.?  Dr. Johnson said that seven local authorities have an archaeological officer.  How is that decision made?  Is it relative?  Does it make it easier to get an archaeological officer if the county is well-endowed with archaeological sites or is it a chief executive&rsquo;s decision based on staffing levels?  How did these seven local authorities get lucky enough to have archaeological officers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#L01300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643846400,"counter":915,"content":"<p>In the case of my local authority, Dublin City Council, the first city archaeologist was appointed in the early 1990s and that was a result of the Woodquay excavations and public outcry on same.  It was copper-fastened then by the Valletta Convention and the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994 that followed.  That provided a platform and the councillors and executives understood the need to have professional and in-house archaeological advice within the organisation.  Since 2018, we have two officers working in Dublin City Council.  It is a big development area as well and we are engaged in different types of archaeological advice and activities within that local authority.<\/p> <p>  Cork is another city that has had long-standing archaeological advice and expertise.  I do not know the exact ins and outs of how that came about to be honest.  Mayo County Council has five archaeologists working for it at present and their appointment came about through the road's schemes.  It was a peculiar and unusual arrangement but it is lucky to have a team of five archaeologists and they work in different areas of the local authority.<\/p><p>Some of them carry out archaeologically licensed activities on behalf of the local authority and others have engaged in planning and other internal advice and project management.  In Limerick, one is based in the roads office.  To answer the question, it is currently at the discretion of each local authority and its chief executive, depending on staffing levels.<\/p><p> There would be a good argument for a full suite of heritage professionals to work alongside conservation officers, who are supported in the Bill, and the heritage officers, who are supported by the Heritage Council, and to have local authority archaeological expertise to advise on planning and development.  In local authorities where there are local authority archaeologists in place, the National Monuments Service often leaves the planning to us, for the most part.  It would be quite a busy role given that we also carry out advice for local authority development.  The planning authorities are also sometimes the developer.  We are also sometimes a heritage resource manager.  We have accrued new roles in some cases, such as the community monument fund, which we have been delighted to see in place for the past two years.

The two UNESCO world heritage sites we have, Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and Great Skellig, would come under archaeological protection.  There is an obligation when signing the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, which designates world heritage sites, that there be a periodically reviewed management plan for world heritage sites which meets certain standards.  There was a consultation process for the Skelligs world heritage site process and we weighed a submission on that within the past year.  Those standards are progressively being developed.<\/p> <p>  One of the big challenges in world heritage sites is managing visitor numbers.  If one thinks of places such as Machu Picchu in Peru, the big challenge for world heritage sites is that the visitor pressure can have an adverse impact on the site and affect the integrity and wear and tear on the site.  That is a major consideration for the management of world heritage sites.  There is a parallel regime.<\/p> <p>  The real question we need to ask about world heritage sites in Ireland is why we have been such laggards in advancing additional designations.  There is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland and we have our two sites.  Other European countries have been progressively advancing nominations.  While there are many candidates and there have been consultation processes going on for the past 20 years that I can remember, there just does not seem to be the will to push them.  World heritage sites have moved from the original concept of having a single, very clearly defined site, such as Stonehenge, to having groups of monuments of a particular type in a wider geographical area.  It has been argued, for instance, that the key Irish early Christian monastic sites could be designated as a group.  It has been very disappointing that we have not seen any advance in further world heritage site nominations by Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Lumley"},{"type":"speech","time":1643846400,"counter":919,"content":"<p>A series of hill forts at Kilranelagh in Wicklow has been recommended to me as being potentially at the UNESCO level.

There is an interrelationship.  To build anything on top of any of them would be ridiculous.  To put it in context, there are only approximately 100 hill forts known in Ireland, at the last count.  Dr. Greene might tell me if that is right.  For seven out of 100 to be in a neat little cluster is astonishing.  Some of them, such as the one in Baltinglass itself, are spectacular.

I am pleased to talk about this.  It also ties in with the whole question of monument protection and questions that were asked earlier by Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and Cian O'Callaghan.  There have already been opportunities to make people aware of the registers that are in existence and I spoke about those in my statement in 2018, with all the publicity about new sites, crop marks and that sort of thing.  We tend to have to wait for those opportunities for us to be in the news to promote these things.  We know from these particular cases that when we have the opportunity to tell members of the public to look at this wonderful stuff and show them how we report it and where they can find information about it, they react.  They go, report more and explore their landscapes, as we saw in recent years during the pandemic.  This is incredibly important.  It ties into what was said earlier about raising awareness of archaeological sites for their protection in the landscape.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we let landowners know what is on their lands.  It is very easy to say ignorance is not a defence when it comes to destruction and damage, and that is absolutely the case, but in some cases it is a fact that the landowners do not know what they have.  I have been listening to these discussions and the urban landscape has been to the fore.  However, a considerable amount of our archaeological record is in the rural landscape and not all landowners are aware of what they have on their land or what it means.  One way to raise awareness of the register and awareness of our archaeology, as I mentioned in our suggestions, is to have archaeologists embedded in the community, be they in local authorities or be they regional community archaeologists.  Such archeologists would engage with people and can proactively go out into the landscape and engage with landscape stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sharon Greene"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643846400,"counter":924,"content":"<p>The question around Part 7 is interesting.

The advisory council provision was a key part of the National Monuments Act 1930.

We pointed out that there is a very effective advisory council regime applying in Northern Ireland.  There is an opportunity now with this legislation to match what is being done in Northern Ireland, to look at what is being done in other jurisdictions, to revive that concept of independent oversight and to consider a wider potential number of nominating bodies including for example, the Local Authority Archaeologists Network.

We can then bring that into our suitability assessment criteria and our quality procurement procedures.  That will allow us to reinforce and strengthen them in terms of ensuring that we get very highly qualified people to do the work.  I want to stress that the level of qualification and professionalism in the industry is fantastic.<\/p> <p>  Another key provision is the ability of the National Monuments Service and the Minister to take into possession the records of companies which went into liquidation.  During the crash, several archaeological companies went into liquidation and there was no mechanism by which the archaeological and archival records of those companies could be taken in.

I studied the latter in first year and my father was in the National Museum.  There have been a wide range of influences on my life that have made me interested in this area.<\/p> <p>  In terms of rural Ireland in particular, I understand a lot in terms of where the finds are and where they should be because the logainmneacha, the placenames, tell the story.  They point to the facts.  Sometimes farmers will claim ignorance whereas the name of the field will suggest exactly what is in that field although the specifics of it may have been lost in the fog of time, so we need to be careful.  People might not know exactly what is on their land and there are out-of-the-blue finds, with no history behind them.  That is why it is important that we understand our language or our heritage, although one does not have to have Irish to understand it.  It is written and informed by superstitions.  Why is it that they are called ring forts?  Why did generation after generation not go near them?  They understood the value of the history and they built up superstitions around it.  The superstition was that ring forts were fairy forts and anyone who touched them would have bad luck.  There are other superstitions related to burial grounds and so on.  This is not just relevant to this country but to every country in the world.<\/p> <p>  It is important when we are putting the register together to make sure it is not just are register of monuments and their location.  We must also include the context because that is the key.  This is true of the hill forts in Wicklow or of Newgrange, for example.  I remember going to Newgrange as a child.  I only visited it once because my parents were more interested in Knowth and Dowth.  I remember, before there was any excavation, going into a tunnel there, even though we were not supposed to.  We saw a dog coming out of it.  We were only kids and could fit in and health and safety issues were not a concern in those days.  It was not designated, there was no signage, there was nothing.  Now, thankfully, the State has invested money in it but the State does not have the money to invest in 130,000 sites so what do we do?  How do we prioritise?  We are drawing up legislation to provide protection but how do we go beyond that?  How do we give the State the power, through this legislation, to provide that protection?  How do we provide encouragement to the State to do more than just list monuments on a register, to go beyond that?  Some of the monuments are underground and they should be left there.  We do not have the archaeologists to dig them up and we do not want to do so either.  <\/p> <p>  I mentioned Google Maps earlier and signage is important.  However, signage does not have to mean huge monstrosities.  I attended a presentation a few years ago on the QR code card and that is all that is needed.  If we put a QR code on every site, then when people want to find out about it, they can scan the code.  They can be directed to a website, with audio and visuals, containing information on that site and links to other sites.  That would be a lot cheaper than putting up a brass plaque.  Sometimes that is a concern of local authorities.<\/p> <p>  We have an opportunity, when drafting this legislation, to be imaginative.  We must imagine using today's technologies for our benefit.  That feeds into TII's concerns about the register of finds becoming an administrative burden.  Nobody wants this to be an administrative burden.<\/p><p>There has to be some type of administration and it is hoped that type of approach may help those such as TII, in order that there is not a delay when there is a find and we have the wherewithal to address it in a way in which a decision is made early enough on whether it is to be protected <i>in situ <\/i>or whatever and if a road, railway or cycle track needs to be protected <i>in situ<\/i>, that we quickly then find our way around it or find an alternative together, as often should have been the case.<br\/><br\/>The local authorities were concerned in their presentation about the burial grounds.  There is a mention on page 33 of the legislation that the Minister could &quot;vest in local authorities similar burial grounds the status of which was not finally resolved under the 19th century legislation&quot;.  Local authority archaeology officers were already concerned about additional work on them without additional resources.

They are all useful to have and protect, but have we signed up to other conventions or not incorporated them properly or are there others to which we have not signed up?  There was mention of the Granada Convention among a number of others when we were in the Moore Street advisory committee.

The Deputy quite rightly highlighted some other ones which are a major issue, especially in conflict zones such as Afghanistan where there is major pillage and theft of artefacts which then appear on the international antiquities market.<\/p> <p>  Indeed, we have some of those concerns in Ireland, where sheela na gigs and early grave slabs were being stolen from sites and there was stuff going to the US that was certainly a concern.

What we should look at in Ireland as a developed country - whether through the Paris Agreement on climate action, the UN Convention on Biodiversity and these cultural heritage conventions through the United Nations or the Council of Europe - is to take leadership in the most active implementation of those conventions.

In addition to that, we did test excavations on a number of sites along the route previously and, subsequently, directions for registration numbers were included.  Those were excavated as part of the scheme.  There was a huge body of work in this one scheme.  Some 101 sites came from that body of work along that scheme.

As my colleague, Mr. Lumley, said, if that henge was found on the top of Tara Hill it would have been hailed and glorified as another aspect of the Tara complex.

Through the sagas, we know there was a processional route from the Hill of Skryne down to the valley and up to the tomb complex on the Hill of Tara, much of which cusps on the relevant brow overlooking the valley.  What would one expect to find in the valley but a ritual temple site?  This was an astonishing discovery and could have been reconstructed easily.  It was in a natural dell.  Seriously large post holes were found where the beams could have been recreated.  If one is looking for parallels, it was covered by the current legislation to renovate and restore it, as per the words of the Act.  It could have been done just as was done in Knowth.

They relate to something Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked earlier.  Many monuments have no signage and we do not know where they are.  In a way, that offers them some protection until something goes wrong.  We do not attract heavy footfall to them, we do not need landscape management plans and there is no great demand for car parking.  How can we protect that kind of hidden nature of some of those sites if we were to provide signage and information and perhaps attract footfall?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#R01200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643846400,"counter":993,"content":"<p>I might comment on that.  This harks back to what Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh was saying earlier.  As we have identified, there are many thousands of sites throughout the country.  We cannot practically provide a sign for all of them, even if it is a small one with a QR code, given a QR code leads to a website someone has to manage, upload information to and so on, so it is not necessarily a practical answer.  Moreover, we do not want people to end up with the impression that no signage means no protection.  We need people to understand that all our archaeological heritage is protected at some level, and some archaeological and heritage sites are more readily recognised as such.  We all know what Newgrange looks like and we gravitate towards using examples of monuments such as tombs and so on that people can readily recognise, but some sites are not recognisable to people who do not already have an interest or who are not familiar with the locality.<\/p> <p>  I recognise the work being done throughout the country through schemes such as the Adopt a Monument scheme that was mentioned earlier and the Irish Walled Towns Network, as well as work done by the Heritage Council and local authority community heritage grants.  Many communities are taking this on themselves, getting funding and expert advice and putting signs on monuments in their localities.  Of course, the OPW also provides a certain degree of interpretative information at national monument sites.  We need to clarify, because it is not always clear to people, that not every monument that stands above the ground is a national monument.  National monuments are in the care of the State or a local authority.  Most of our monuments are just recorded monuments and are protected under the legislation as such.  In the vast majority of cases, they do not have signs.  It is more important that we, on a more general level, raise awareness and knowledge of the types of sites in our landscape and promote an appreciation of what they are, what they mean and how we should treat them.  We should not just worry about, for example, a farmer deciding a bump in his field has been a pain for too long and he is going to plough it out.  The same is true of places that are open to the public where people walk over ramparts and force a path that causes erosion, or where people are involved in hobbies such as mountain-biking, scramblers and so on, which also cause inadvertent damage to monuments.  What we need is a campaign of public education on this front.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#R01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sharon Greene"},{"type":"speech","time":1643846400,"counter":994,"content":"<p>Will Parts 8 and 9 provide for that or do we need to be stronger on it?

We should not just wait for the public to say they have found something to be identified or that they are interested in.  We need people who can go into the landscape, meet landowners and educate them.  As I said earlier, it is important that we inform landowners about what they own, which is allowed for, and tie that information to the property in order that if someone buys a property, he or she will know what is there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022020300002#R01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sharon Greene"},{"type":"speech","time":1643846400,"counter":996,"content":"<p>I am not seeking hundreds of thousands of people to be trampling over sites, but ours is now an open society and head 9 relates to the establishment of a register.  If that register becomes available and a site is registered as attracting 130,000 visitors a year, whether there is a sign on it or not, the public will be entitled to know there is something there.  The site will then get an archaeologist, a person with a metal detector or just somebody who decides he or she cannot go to Newgrange, given an appointment is needed to get in there, so he or she will visit another one, without understanding the delicate nature of some of these monuments because they have not been looked after and are exposed.  Traipsing over a monument that has not had the care and love of archaeologists or whomever can damage it.<\/p> <p>  Once a monument is included on a register, it raises another question, namely, how to protect it even if it is not in State hands.  In the case of a farmer who owns lands on which there are a number of sites, the farmer will look after them, so we can just leave them there.  Farmers do not have the money to look after them but nature will look after them on their behalf.  If, all of a sudden, the monuments are included on a register, we will get people traipsing all over private land, and we have seen cases of farmers kicking up about that because of liabilities and so on.  Those who own a private property will argue the State is taking on a duty of care to the site or of protection for the landowner given the site will have been identified.

If someone is unlucky enough to have one of these monuments on his or her land, it is reasonable that there would be a grant system because the OPW will not be able to deal with it.  Facilitating the protection of monuments on private land is being totally overlooked.

In TII we are doing quite a bit of work making our information available on digital heritage collections.  In terms of bringing the past to life and making it accessible to people, there are many opportunities we can use online, including social media, story maps and videos.  One interesting area, which we have been discussing with the National Monuments Service, is our greenway projects, through which we bring people through the landscape, and bringing people towards monuments and places of interest.  Last year we were involved in the Athlone cycleway.  Its route is right beside Athlone Abbey.  It is great route for cyclists to go through.
