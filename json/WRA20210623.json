The EU&rsquo;s participation in the recent G7 discussions, where additional commitments on the provision of vaccines globally was agreed, bears witness to that.<\/p>  <p>  International Trade is a competence of the EU under the Treaties.  In exercising that competence at the World Trade Organisation or WTO, the European Commission engages with Member States, including Ireland, through a variety of Committee and Working Parties\/Groups, including on intellectual property, or IP.<\/p>  <p>  South Africa and India amended their original proposal for a waiver by broadening the scope; it now covers all COVID-19 related health products and technologies for prevention, treatment, and containment of the disease and provides that the waiver shall be in force for 3 years and that only the WTO General Council in a consensus decision could determine the date of termination of the waiver.  <\/p>  <p>  On the 4th of June, the EU submitted a proposal to the WTO General Council, which proposes that WTO Members could agree on a global trade initiative for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics encompassing the three components of (i) trade facilitation and disciplines on export restrictions; (ii) concrete actions to expand production and ensure supply of vaccines at affordable prices to low and middle income countries during the pandemic and (iii) clarification and facilitation of TRIPS Agreement flexibilities relating to compulsory licenses.  <\/p>  <p>  Production capacity is a key issue here and, again at the G7 earlier this month, the EU Commission announced &euro;1b in funding for the building of production capacity in Africa, which will create long-term production capacity in Africa.

Specifically, the TRIPS Agreement allows compulsory licensing which is when a government permits an entity to produce the patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner.<\/p>  <p>  The EU also believes that voluntary licensing and the dissemination of technology and know-how is the more effective way of quickly scaling up manufacturing globally.<\/p>  <p>  The EU considers that the COVAX Facility, the international initiative to ensure global supply and access to COVID-19 vaccines, is the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has also submitted a proposal for a Declaration to the WTO TRIPS Council, which seeks to clarify how the existing TRIPS flexibilities could be more effective than a waiver.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the WTO discussions on how the intellectual property protections flexibilities for COVID-19 vaccines can help to resolve the crisis and contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Safety","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[33750\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if there is a review of furniture fire regulations being planned; and if so, the context of the review.","asker":"1549","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>In the area of furniture fire safety, there are no harmonised EU standards.

Provisional application is a standard mechanism provided for in the EU&rsquo;s Free Trade Agreements.  This means that those areas where the EU has full competence may be applied immediately once the Agreement has been voted for by Council and the European Parliament. It is an important mechanism that allows consumers and companies to benefit from a trade agreement at an early stage, as the completion of national ratification procedures across all 27 Member States can take several years.  <\/p>  <p>  The positive impact of the provisional application of the Agreement has been plain to see with goods exports to Canada increased from EUR 953 million in 2016 to more than EUR 1.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 78 per cent, while services exports grew from EUR 1.6 billion in 2016 to more than EUR 2.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 44 per cent. <\/p>  <p>Looking further at the tangible benefits of this Agreement, my Department has recently released the results of an independent study of the potential economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland from the European Union&rsquo;s Free Trade Agreements with Canada as well as South Korea, Mexico and Japan. The study, released on 28 April, encompasses state of the art quantitative modelling and qualitative analysis, including a comprehensive programme of stakeholder engagement with business and agriculture representatives and found that these four EU FTAs are forecast to have a positive effect on trade, GDP and national income in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The full coming into force of the Agreement once ratified across all Member States, will see the implementation of the Investment Chapter of the Agreement including the resolution of disputes between investors and states, should they arise.  All international trade agreements have dispute resolution arrangements.  Where such agreements cover (i) trade in both goods and services and (ii) investment rules and protections, then there must be a dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments.  The EU&rsquo;s new approach to investment protection is the Investment Court System (ICS) which is contained in CETA and replaces the old Investor-State Dispute Settlement or ISDS mechanism.  I have set out for the House, on many occasions previously, the improvements ICS represents over the older ISDS.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that CETA reaffirms the EU and Canada&rsquo;s right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, the environment or consumer protection. And while CETA does not prevent a party pursuing a claim through domestic courts, the ICS element of CETA is specifically designed to provide an arbitration alternative to either EU investors in Canada or Canadian investors in the EU. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the \"locally-based cultural industries and artists\" highlighted by the Deputy, Canada and the EU are both signatories of the UNESCO Convention of Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions and this is explicitly \"affirmed\" in CETA, including the \"right to preserve, develop and implement their cultural policies, to support their cultural industries for the purpose of strengthening the diversity of cultural expressions and to preserve their cultural identity, including through the use of regulatory measures and financial support\". Importantly, Article 7.7 of CETA explicitly provides that: \"Noting in this Agreement applies to subsidies or government support with respect to audio-visual services for the European Union and to cultural industries for Canada.\"  In this context, my Department sees no issues arising under the terms of CETA that would impact Ireland's entitlement to support locally-based cultural industries and artists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Workplace Relations Commission","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[33717\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the estimated cost of employing one additional Workplace Relations Commission inspector.","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[33718\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the estimated cost of employing ten additional Workplace Relations Commission inspectors.","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":23,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.<\/p><p>The WRC carries out inspections of employer records with a view to determining compliance with employment rights legislation.<\/p><p>The full year cost of recruiting an executive officer inspector for the Workplace Relations Commission would be approximately &euro;61,341.<\/p><p>This is based on the calculation of staff costs as set out in the Public Spending Code.

We don&rsquo;t want to jeopardise jobs by placing a cost and\/or admin burden on business without working through all of the implications and potential solutions. That is why we undertook a full public consultation, reviewed international best practice, and formed an interdepartmental group &ndash; to ensure that all views and issues were properly considered in the development of the scheme.  Research in this area has shown that where companies have a sick pay scheme in place it leads to safer workplace environments and reduces presenteeism. <\/p><p>  The scheme will be designed to take an incremental approach with enhancements coming over a number of years. This is to give employers, particularly employers who may have had to close or been negatively impacted due to Covid-19 restrictions, an opportunity to adjust to costs and the administrative burden of the scheme. However, in line with statutory sick pay schemes throughout the European Union, the intention of the scheme is that employers will cover the cost of an initial period where one of their employees is unable to work due to illness or injury. <\/p><p>The rate of 70% of an employee's wage, subject to a daily threshold of &euro;110, is designed to ensure that employees receive an appropriate level of financial compensation if they are unable to attend work due to illness. It is higher than the equivalent rate  in Northern Ireland, which,  in my view is inadequate. <\/p><p>It is my intention that the scheme will be in place for 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC03500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC03400"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[33775\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC03500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will issue guidelines to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as a matter of urgency to have regard to the policy against the importation of fracked gas published on 18 May 2021.","asker":"1605","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>The Policy Statement on the Importation of Fracked Gas was notified to An Bord Plean&aacute;la following its approval by Government on and publication 18 May 2021.\u00a0   Section 34 of the Planning &amp;amp; Development Act requires An Bord Plean&aacute;la (or any planning authority) to consider the proper planning and sustainable development of an area with regard being had to relevant Government policies such as the Policy Statement on the Importation of Fracked Gas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC03700"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[33635\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300076#WRC03800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the reason the Decarbonisation Pathways for Ireland by a company (details supplied) is not being published.","asker":"1468","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill sets out our national economy-wide climate targets for 2030 and 2050, and the process for setting carbon budgets and sectorial emissions ceilings.

It was introduced as an emergency income support for eligible employees where the employer&rsquo;s business activities were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 66,600 employers received a subsidy under the TWSS with payments of &euro;2.8 billion paid out to a total of 664,500 workers. The scheme operated until 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020.<\/p><p>Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the operation of the EWSS, which is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.<\/p><p>To date, EWSS payments of over &euro;3.521 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;575 million have been granted to over 50,000 employers in respect of over 583,000 employees.<\/p><p>While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, position of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS.<\/p><p>The objective of scheme is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times.<\/p><p>I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 1st June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021.<\/p><p>With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy. It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of December 2021.<\/p><p>As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).<\/p><p>For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%. There are no changes in respect of the qualification criteria for EWSS eligibility for the childcare sector.<\/p><p>The Government has approved the extension of the EWSS for Q4 2021, however, it is considered too early as yet to prescribe the precise operational parameters of the scheme that should apply for that quarter. Decisions in that regard will be taken closer to the time, possibly around the end of August\/early September, with the benefit of more up-to-date information on a number of variables, including the overall epidemiological situation, progress made in reopening all sectors of the economy, the vaccine efficacy, as well as the operation of the EWSS during the early parts of Q3. As such, no decisions have yet been taken on any changes to the scheme for Q4 2021.<\/p><p>It is important that, as the recovery gains further momentum, supports are further recalibrated in the longer-term interests of businesses that are in receipt of those supports and in the interests of the wider body of taxpayers. As such and as already signalled, for Q4, consideration will be given to a future change to EWSS which will require an employer contribution towards employee wages. As with all firms that will benefit from the scheme in the months ahead, businesses in the childcare sector also would be subject to the impact of this potential change.<\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions in relation to the amount of funding allocated to the EWSS generally and for specific childcare sub-sectors, the position is that it is a demand led scheme and as such the cost is driven by the number of employers and employees supported by the scheme. This was also the case for its predecessor, the TWSS. My Department develops cost estimates to inform the Government in good time in advance of any specific decisions being made in respect of the scheme. The process involves liaison and cooperation, as appropriate, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and with the Department of Social Protection. <\/p><p>However, due to the fact that EWSS operates as a demand led scheme, a particular amount of funding is not allocated to any specific sector, including the childcare sector.

The key components of the fiscal rules are a 3 per cent of GDP threshold for the headline (General Government) deficit, a 60 per cent debt-to-GDP threshold, a balanced budget after adjusting for the economic cycle (measured by the structural balance) and the expenditure benchmark. As the AHBs are classified in the General Government sector, all AHBs revenue and expenditure fall under the scope of the EU fiscal rules framework. <\/p>  <p>  The normal operation of the EU fiscal rules has been suspended since March 2020, when the so-called General Escape Clause (GEC) of the SGP was activated.

While the activation of the GEC means the regular fiscal requirements have been temporarily suspended, it must be noted that the Pact itself has not been suspended or revoked but remains in place, providing an important anchor for fiscal policy over the medium-term.

In 2020, PUP was taxed at year end rather than in the normal real-time manner due to the urgent requirement to get payments to people as quickly as possible. For PAYE employees, where tax liabilities remain for 2020 after all tax credits and entitlements are allocated, the amount due can be collected, interest free, over four years from 1 January 2022 by reducing their tax credits. <\/p>  <p>  The situation for self-employed workers is different in that the tax due on PUP payments received in 2020 is accounted for by completing the usual self-assessed tax return by 31 October 2021 and paying the amount due (17 November 2021 if filing and paying via ROS). In situations where a self-assessed taxpayer cannot pay the tax due it may be possible to avail of the Debt Warehousing Scheme or a suitable phased payment arrangement. Further information on the Debt Warehousing Scheme is available on the Revenue website.<\/p>  <p>  The continuation of the PUP into 2021 has re-established the practice of operating PAYE in the normal (real-time) manner for such payments. However, people receiving PUP payments in 2021 will only pay tax when they return to work. The tax due is collected over the remaining pay periods in 2021 by reducing the person&rsquo;s tax credits. For self-employed people, with no income taxed under PAYE, the tax due on PUP payments received in 2021 will not fall due until October 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue further advise me that the person in question is self-employed and is also in receipt of an occupational pension. The tax due on the PUP payments received in 2021 is being collected by reducing the tax credits allocated to his occupational pension. The tax due on the PUP payments received in 2020 should be included in his 2020 tax return. If he is unable to pay the amount due, Revenue has assured me that it will engage with him regarding the situation.

From 5 July, if the public health situation allows, organised indoor events can recommence, permitting a maximum of 50 attendees at the majority of venues and 100 in larger venues. Currently 100 people can attend an organised outdoor event for the majority of venues. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has agreed that pilot events will take place in June and July, depending on the epidemiological situation at the time and subject to the roll out of the vaccination programme. My Department has worked with the Arts Council and a number of stakeholder engagement structures are in place to support the development and delivery of those pilot events. The first event took place in the Iveagh Gardens on the 10th of June in collaboration with the National Concert Hall and further events will take place across the course of the summer.

In 2021, the Government allocated &euro;130m to the Arts Council which is an increase of 62% over the amount initially allocated for 2020. The Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003. The Arts Council's support is by way of grants under a range of categories including bursary, strategic funding, project awards and touring and dissemination awards.\u00a0 The Arts Council announced details of its investment plans last February and this included a range of initiatives aimed at supporting artists and arts organisation through the crisis. <\/p>  <p>  I allocated &euro;50 million to a suite of measures to assist the live performance sector.\u00a0 As part of that funding, I announced the allocations for the &euro;25m Live Performance Support\u00a0Scheme (LPSS 2021).\u00a0 I was delighted to be in a position to fund 237 successful applications under this scheme, the details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.\u00a0 These grants will help support employment and well-being opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.<\/p>  <p>  I have also made an allocation of &euro;14m available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew,\u00a0that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.\u00a0Under the scheme, self-employed businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio\u00a0equipment suppliers operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector\u00a0are eligible to apply.

For example, local authorities now have the benefit of standard layouts for new build social housing, as well as standard specifications and guideline costs. These supports give local authorities clear parameters within which to design and develop new social housing construction projects and reduce the issues that will arise with the approval assessments. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding these improvements, I am still keen to see more take-up of the single-stage process for suitable social housing projects and particularly by local authorities who have not taken this opportunity to date.

This work is progressing well and with sections of the toolkit (a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum, the SPHE Junior Cycle Short Course and Senior Cycle SPHE Framework). <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of the online Toolkit, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum as recommended in the NCCA Report has begun, with an initial focus on Junior Cycle. The review of the current Junior Cycle SPHE course has been completed and will be considered by the NCCA Council in June. This review contains a brief which will inform the work of the subject development groups in formulating an updated Junior Cycle SPHE specification, which will begin in September. A draft of the updated Junior Cycle SPHE specification will be available for public consultation in Q1 of 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Excluding the cost of staff, the NCCA has spent &euro;65,000 on the review of RSE and on the follow-on curriculum-related actions that were set out in the 2019 report. <\/p>  <p>  Based on the NCCA&rsquo;s \u00a02021 Plan of Work, there will be an additional spend of approximately \u00a0&euro;50,000 this year which is related to our ongoing work on the RSE Toolkits and the work on updating Junior Cycle SPHE.<\/p>  <p>  The current estimated cost for 2022 is approximately &euro;50,000. This will support ongoing work on the Junior Cycle SPHE specification, the online toolkits for primary and post-primary schools, engagement with stakeholders, work with schools, research, consultation, and work with NCCA structures.<\/p>  <p>  It is more difficult to estimate costs beyond 2022 as work on the new primary SPHE\/RSE curriculum and work on senior cycle SPHE\/RSE will take place in the context of the wider redevelopment of the primary curriculum and the redevelopments at senior cycle.<\/p>  <p>  My Department promotes the quality of teaching and learning through the provision of continuing professional development (CPD) and supports for teachers and principals.

payment for fuel allowance.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>The Fuel Allowance is a household based\u00a0payment of &euro;28.00 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;784 each year), paid\u00a0from October to April, to 370,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;300 million in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.\u00a0 The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.\u00a0 It is not intended to meet those costs in full.\u00a0 Only one allowance is paid per household.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;195 million in 2021.\u00a0 This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Taking account of the fact that the fuel allowance is a household based payment and that qualification is not just based on receipt of a qualifying payment but on a number of other complex qualifying criteria such as household composition, it is not possible for my Department to provide an accurate\u00a0projection of the potential cost of including carer's allowance as a qualifying payment for the allowance.<\/p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.\u00a0 In addition to the Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer's Allowance schemes, carers receive further support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual Carer's Support Grant in respect of each person for whom they care.\u00a0 In Budget 2021 I was delighted to announce an increase to the Carer's Support Grant by &euro;150 to &euro;1,850.\u00a0 This will benefit over 130,000 carers.\u00a0 Carers in receipt of an increase for a qualified child on their claim also benefit from the Budget 2021 increase to the qualified child rate, by &euro;5 in the case of a child aged 12 or over and by &euro;2 for a child aged up to 12.<\/p>  <p>  Fuel Allowance is a household-based payment, and a Carer will very often live with and be caring for a person\u00a0in receipt of\u00a0a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.\u00a0 Income from full rate Carer's Allowance is disregarded from the fuel means test\u00a0if the carer is providing full time care and attention to the Fuel Allowance applicant,\u00a0his\/her qualified spouse \/ civil partner or cohabitant or qualified child(ren). <\/p>  <p>  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, s\/he can keep\u00a0his\/her main social protection payment\u00a0in addition to receiving\u00a0the half-rate Carer's Allowance.\u00a0\u00a0S\/he can also receive an extra half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if\u00a0s\/he cares for more than one person.\u00a0 It should also be noted that the payment of half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for Fuel Allowance.\u00a0 If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, then s\/he is deemed to have satisfied the means test and Fuel Allowance is payable, subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied. \u00a0If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance then\u00a0s\/he will have to\u00a0satisfy\u00a0a means test in order to qualify for Fuel Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  The maximum rates of Carer's Allowance for those aged under 66, at &euro;219 (&euro;257 for carers aged 66 or over) where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 (&euro;385.50 for carers aged 66 or over) where there are two or more carees, is significantly higher than that for most schemes administered by my Department.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.\u00a0 At present the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance allows for an income disregard of &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.\u00a0 In the case of a single carer, that person may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, or retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100. <\/p>  <p>  Carers can also engage in employment, self-employment, training or education courses outside the home for not more than 18.5 hours a week.<\/p>  <p>  Any proposal to amend the criteria for receiving Fuel Allowance, to include Carer&rsquo;s Allowance as a qualifying payment, would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300082#WRJ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social

A key focus for Government has been addressing the impacts on the mental health of all our population, including young people. <\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to mental health was again underlined in Budget 2021 which saw an increase of &euro;50 million, thus bringing total HSE funding for mental health this year to over &euro;1.1 billion. This does not take account of additional funding allocated to mental health in other areas of the health system or through other Departments such as Justice, Education and Social Protection. <\/p><p>The new funding allocated this year will allow for implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of the widely agreed policy <i>Sharing the Vision<\/i>. It will, for example, fund over 150 new staff in community mental health services (including 29 posts for CAMHS), bereavement counselling, employment supports and crisis resolution teams. Work is progressing in each of these areas. <\/p><p>While there is no doubt that Covid-19 has posed significant challenges, including isolation, bereavement, anxiety and loss of income and work for many, we do not yet fully understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health and subsequent demand on services.  I am acutely aware of how difficult the pandemic has been for young people. Developing enhanced supports for them as requirements evolve remains a priority.  Extensive work has been undertaken to date and this will continue. The Department of Health and the Department of Education has, for example, with assistance from the HSE, produced a mental health support leaflet for young people which has been circulated to around 4,000 schools. This was also made available online for download by those working with young people. It signposted a wide range of mental health services, whether those provided direct by the HSE or by agencies on its behalf, for young people and their parents. Details of these, and more, are also available on www.yourmentalhealth.ie. <\/p><p>I recently had a very positive meeting with Minister Foley and NEPS where we reviewed the range of mental health and psycho-social supports in place for young people and how these might be enhanced. This included guidance counsellors and NEPS in schools, and the well established links for schools to access HSE Primary Care psychology, the specialist CAMHS service, or the many organisations that provide mental health supports for the Executive. <\/p><p>Since the pandemic started, mental health services have responded rapidly, continuing to deliver supports for young people in the safest possible way throughout the country. The HSE has a range of proactive responses for any rise in mental health service needs, including online and other telehealth psychosocial supports. The HSE Psychosocial Framework, published in January 2021, builds on a range of supports introduced last year in response to Covid. The Framework provides a cohesive, coordinated, consistent and collaborative whole-of-population approach to the provision of mental health services and supports across five key levels, ranging from mental health promotion to specialist supports. <\/p><p>Digital mental health initiatives were rapidly enhanced to enable services to meet not only current demand, but new and emerging need. It has enabled us to continue providing much needed supports, including digital responses where  traditional face-to-face service delivery was not possible.  <\/p><p>These include one-to-one counselling and group and peer supports delivered, for example, through MyMind, Turn2Me and Silvercloud. MyMind provides free online counselling, in 15 languages, to people in communities nationwide and is delivering approximately 4,000 counselling and psychotherapy sessions each month.<\/p><p>Jigsaw, which provides prevention and early intervention services to young people,  has 13 sites nationally and offers online supports to young people in all communities across the country. It will open a new service in Tipperary next month, which will include a blended approach of face to face supports and online services.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, the Taoiseach announced additional funding for mental health for proposed cross-governmental and inter-agency initiatives to meet evolving demands for mental health arising from Covid,  including those relating to young people. This will cover, for example, promoting positive mental health, increasing awareness of the wide range of supports available, and improving signposting to these service and supports. The Department of Health is at present progressing the details of this new initiative, including consultation with other relevant stakeholders in the health and education sectors.<\/p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that I, along with the Government as a whole, remain fully committed to enhancing the provision of mental health services and counselling supports for young people nationally, and that I will keep this matter under close review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300083#WRK04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300083#WRK04100"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[25896\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300083#WRK04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on whether assistant psychologists should be paid for their work; if the HSE will be requested to ensure that any posts advertised in the future will be adequately remunerated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>&ldquo;As this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE.

The  Panel provided\u00a0immediate real-time learnings and recommendations in  light of the expected ongoing impact of COVID-19 over the subsequent  12-18 months. The Panel makes a substantial package of recommendations which also reflect that systematic reform in the way  nursing home care, and health and social care for older persons care  more broadly, is delivered and financed.\u00a0An interagency Implementation Oversight Team and a stakeholder reference group has been established to support the continued implementation of these recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  While preliminary scoping work\u00a0 on the establishment of a commission\u00a0to examine care and supports for older people\u00a0has commenced, the ongoing priority focus in 2021 is ensuring the continued implementation of the recommendations of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel. Many of the short and medium term recommendations have already been implemented. <\/p>  <p>  The  significant examination undertaken by the Expert Panel provides important learning and a framework for enhancing older persons services  both in the short and long-term and this work is progressing.\u00a0The longer-term strategic reform recommendations of the Panel will  transition into, as needed, specific multi-annual programmes of work  with the necessary governance structures, with some of the  recommendations, as appropriate, given continued examination in the context of a commission.\u00a0It is currently envisaged that the  scoping work for a such a commission will be significantly progressed  this year in order that it may be established in 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300083#WRK04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Maternity Hospital","counter":441,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300083#WRK04700"},{"type":"question","counter":442,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[25898\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300083#WRK04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the governance structure of the new national maternity hospital at the St. Vincent's hospital site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":443,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to the development of the new National Maternity Hospital (NMH) planned for the St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital Campus at Elm Park, as set out in the Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on the capital project, with planning permission for the hospital secured in 2017 and, in 2018, the awarding of contract for substantial enabling works.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The ownership and governance arrangements are more complex.

Harm, Supporting Recovery, sets out government policy on drug and alcohol use for the period 2017 to 2025. The strategy provides an integrated public health approach to drug and alcohol use, focused on reducing the harms for individuals, families and communities and promoting rehabilitation and recovery.  The strategy is a dynamic strategy and contains 50 actions which are to be delivered over the period 2017-2020.<\/p>  <p>  Progress reports are prepared on the activity carried out under the 50 actions contained in the action plan.  The 2020 progress report is being finalised and will be released shortly.  Progress and Planned Activity reports for the periods 2018 and 2019 are available.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Department has commenced a mid-term review of the actions in the strategy, in consultation with stakeholders.  The review provides an opportunity to reflect on progress in implementing the strategy to date, progress achieved under the action plan 20217-2020, to identify any new issues that have arisen including the impact of Covid-19 and to consider the development of new actions to address emerging needs and challenges. <\/p>  <p>  The National Oversight Committee gives leadership and direction to support the strategy. The committee has membership from statutory, voluntary and community sector and is chaired by me as Minister for State. The committee has received regular updates on the mid-term review and a draft report was presented to a special meeting of the committee on 18 June for its consideration.  <\/p>  <p>  The review when finalised will be brought to Government for approval. Publication of the review will follow soon thereafter.  This will include progress on all the actions in the Strategy, including those referenced by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to working with all stakeholders to ensure that the national drugs strategy is relevant and appropriate to address the societal challenges arising from the use of drugs, especially for children and young people and for those at greatest risk of harm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300084#WRN05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":513,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300085#WRS00200"},{"type":"question","counter":514,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[26006\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300085#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if clarification will be provided on a series of matters regarding the recent advertisement of seven unpaid assistant psychologists roles for HSE services (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":515,"content":"<p>&ldquo;As this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE.

No vaccine will be used until Market authorisation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is obtained and any authorised vaccine will be subject to ongoing monitoring in Ireland by the Health Product Regulatory Authority (HPRA).<\/p>  <p>  The delivery of vaccines under APAs that the Commission has negotiated on behalf of Member States are predicated upon a CMA being obtained from the Commission (on the basis of a positive recommendation being awarded by the EMA).<\/p>  <p>  The awarding of a CMA provides a high level of assurance that a vaccine has undergone rigorous testing and has met the requirements of the independent regulatory process as regards demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has opted into an APA with CureVac and the EMA has started a rolling review of the CureVac COVID-19 Vaccine but it\u00a0has not been awarded a CMA to date.<\/p>  <p>  For more information on COVID-19 Vaccines in development, please see the EMA website for more information:<\/p>  <p>www.ema.europa.eu\/en\/human-regulatory\/overview\/public-health-threats\/coronavirus-disease-covid-19\/treatments-vaccines-covid-19<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300085#WRS02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300085#WRS02600"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[26036\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300085#WRS02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if developments have taken place with regard to the broadening of the eligibility criteria for the long-term illness card with a view to extending the category of illnesses that would be deemed eligible for application for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":539,"content":"<p>The Long Term Illness Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended).\u00a0Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The conditions covered are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.

In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death.

The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed.\u00a0<\/p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and\u00a0my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).\u00a0<\/p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:<\/p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;<\/p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;<\/p><p>- improving transparency and fairness.<\/p><p>Further details on the updated allocation strategy are available here: <\/p><p>www.gov.ie\/en\/press-release\/93f8f-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-irelands-vaccination-prioritisation-list\/\u00a0<\/p><p>You may wish to note that vaccine registration for those aged 35 to 39 is now open.\u00a0<\/p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE.

Both the German payments and the Irish ex-gratia payments made to the survivors are exempt from tax, including DIRT and are not reckonable as means for the purpose of Social Welfare payments.  The rate of payment is related to the survivors' level of thalidomide related injury.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the initial lump-sum and monthly payments for life, the supports provided to each Irish survivor include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of mean, provision of appliances, artificial limbs, equipment, housing adaptations and access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services.

It is open to any Irish person to apply to the Foundation for assessment of their disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that their injury is attributable to thalidomide will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government, commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300086#WRT03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300086#WRT03200"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[26112\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300086#WRT03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if consideration has been given to lifting the ongoing restrictions on the receipt of sacraments for sixth class pupils; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":598,"content":"<p>There has been considerable progress in reducing infection levels since the peak of the wave of infection in late 2020\/early 2021 because of the widespread adherence by the public to the public health measures in place, and this progress has been sustained during recent phases of reopening in April and May.

Improving the licensing situation is a key priority for me, Minister of State Pippa Hackett who has responsibility for forestry and the Department and no effort is being spared to achieve this. We need to maintain an intense focus on achieving this.\u00a0 Some early progress is being made with licences up 23% year-on-year and I fully expect this figure to increase as the year goes on, accepting that last year was especially low in terms of output.<\/p>  <p>  Delays in forestry licensing arose because of a very significant change in procedures in relation to Appropriate Assessment as a result of European Court of Justice judgements and subsequent interpretation by the Irish courts and the Forestry Appeals Committee.\u00a0 Every effort has been made to address this situation with additional inspectorate, ecology and administrative resources recruited, along with training and guidance for both Departmental staff and registered foresters.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The complexity of introducing a completely new assessment procedure inevitably took time to take effect and this has affected output. Having said that, there have been recent gains in productivity, with the 1,594 licences issued to date this year representing a 23% increase on the same period last year.\u00a0 As regards felling, a volume of just over 3.1 million cubic metres has issued so far this year, which is a 58% increase on the same period last year and represents 76% of the COFORD Roundwood Forecast which predicts a potential harvest of 4.1 million cubic metres in 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While we moving in the right direction, we are more than aware of the impact of the backlog on the sector and, in order to improve the functioning and delivery of the licensing process, Minister Hackett, launched Project Woodland in February. This puts in place a framework consisting of a Project Board and four Working Groups, chaired by independent chairs and with outside stakeholders as members, which aims at resolving the backlog and introducing more efficient and effective processes. The process improvement exercise will examine, among other things, whether resources may be deployed more effectively and an organisational review of\u00a0 forestry teams within the Department will consider\u00a0 the structure, roles and responsibilities of these teams relative to outputs sought.<\/p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, I remain hopeful that the framework now in place under Project Woodland will address our current difficulties and will result in a licensing system which meets the needs of forest owners and new applicants and the forestry sector as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300087#WRU02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":644,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300087#WRU02300"},{"type":"question","counter":645,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[33683\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300087#WRU02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the percentage of fish landing and quotas both in weight and value that Irish fishing boats derive from Ireland's exclusive economic zone territorial waters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":646,"content":"<p>Under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), official landing statistics are reported by Member States by ICES division, rather than by Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and most ICES divisions straddle more than one EEZ area.\u00a0 However, landings are also reported by ICES rectangles - these are smaller sub-divisions of the sea area used for statistical analysis.\u00a0 While reports by ICES rectangles are not official landing declarations, they can be used to provide a reasonable estimate of the EEZ from which these landings were caught.<\/p><p>The attached\u00a0figures compiled by the Marine Institute set out the average estimated weight and average approximate value of landings by Irish vessels\u00a0as a proportion of the total weight and value of landings from the Irish EEZ for the periods 2011 to 2015 and 2015 to 2019.<\/p><p>The Irish fleet catches fish inside and outside the Irish\u00a0EEZ.\u00a0 On average, approximately, one third of the Irish fleet's total catch comes from outside the Irish EEZ.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) will, unfortunately, have an impact on our fishing industry.

Working Group 1 is tasked with looking at the backlog. This Group has\u00a0examined in detail the cases on hand and is producing specific recommendations for improving output. which will be brought to the Project Board for consideration.\u00a0 Working Group 4 is concentrating on licensing process improvement. A business analyst has commenced work on an end-to-end process review.\u00a0 In addition, proposals for a pre-application process and a planning grant\u00a0 are under development\u00a0 and will be submitted to the Project Board shortly. The Group is also actively considering how best to conduct a regulatory review of the licensing system.<\/p>  <p>  Communication is another important aspect of Project Woodland and Working Group 3 is working on a new Customer Charter for forestry, and the development of a communication strategy.\u00a0 A review of the organisational structure of the forestry division within the Department will also be carried out and the roles and interaction with COFORD, Teagasc and Coillte will be examined.<\/p>  <p>  Working Group 2 is also developing a public engagement strategy as part of the development of the new Forest Strategy. It is envisaged that all stakeholders in the forestry sector as well as the general public will be included in this process, and this should help identify both opportunities and barriers to afforestation.\u00a0 Furthermore, Irish Rural Link has been commissioned by Minister Hackett to conduct a study to determine the level \u00a0and type of engagement of communities with forestry and to make recommendations for the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Forestry Policy group is meeting later this week at which a full update on progress to date will be provided to all stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  Minister Hackett's\u00a0response to the Committee&rsquo;s report also included the Department&rsquo;s position on other issues raised, specifically questions on Ash Dieback disease and Dutch Elm disease. The Department has since presented to the Committee on its plans for licence delivery for the rest of the year and we will continue to engage with the Committee on its implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300087#WRU05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Regulations","counter":670,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300087#WRU05400"},{"type":"question","counter":671,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[33926\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300087#WRU05500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the way in which he addresses Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under European Council Regulation (EC) No. 1\/2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":672,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine\u00a0takes its responsibilities in the matter of\u00a0animal welfare\u00a0very seriously and exercises close oversight, and deploys considerable resources to the area of\u00a0animal welfare\u00a0in general, including in respect of\u00a0animals\u00a0being transported. <\/p>  <p>  Under EU Regulation 1\/2005, exporters must submit journey logs and other documentation to the\u00a0 Department for advance assessment by an Official Veterinarian, which is supported by further official controls on the day of travel, including identity checks for all animals, and confirmation of transporter authorisation by Department officials.
