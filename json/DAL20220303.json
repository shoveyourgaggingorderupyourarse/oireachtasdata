This is one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years and it will provide a framework to develop a much-improved network for the future.  I expect to receive a final report on the review by the end of the year.  I believe this is the first time such a review has been conducted on an all-island basis.  As such, it will consider the potential of rail from a different perspective than reviews of the past.  This all-island perspective will allow us to consider afresh issues such as rail connectivity to the north west, in addition to the potential for high- or higher-speed rail between the island's major cities.<\/p>  <p>  I am a firm believer in the potential of rail to contribute to economic and social development across the island of Ireland, provide faster and more frequent connectivity, connect communities and help us reach our climate goals.  I do not think I am alone in that belief.  I understand that just over 7,000 responses were received during the recent public consultation on the review.  This is a very large response by comparison with responses to similar public engagements.  All the responses are being considered and will inform the development of the overall review and offer a genuine insight into the views on, and expectations and hopes for, rail of interested stakeholders across the island.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Canney knows, this review started by examining high-speed connectivity between Dublin, Belfast and Cork, but the remit has broadened.  It broadened first and foremost to include the issue of connectivity to the north west.  I have a particular interest in what I regard to be underutilised lines or sections of lines that could be inserted into the network to make better use of it as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  Rail freight is another aspect that is critical to the wider review.  Initially, there was a very narrow focus - on high-speed rail between cities but there is now a much broader remit.  That will provide a useful direction in a variety of ways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300003#A00600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1646298000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  Let me develop the point he made about high-speed connectivity between cities.  I am concerned about the west and the absence of a connection between Galway and Mayo, in addition to the break in the line between Claremorris and Athenry, which means we do not have connectivity between the likes of Westport, Ballina, Galway, Limerick and Cork.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the potential of rail freight and alluded to the potential to open up rail freight lines along the western corridor.  With the potential for offshore energy generation and all that will play out in that regard, it is important to have the infrastructure in place to exploit the potential to create jobs in the regions.  As the Minister knows, the north west is an area in decline and has been designated as such by the EU.  Therefore, it is important to create the infrastructure necessary to build our jobs potential for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300003#A00700","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1646298000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The Deputy's knowledge of the area is far better than mine but I am not too sure that I would characterise the part of the country in question as being in decline.

The section from Athenry to Claremorris has to be seen as part of a longer whole.  In my view, the western rail corridor starts in Waterford, strangely enough.  The line is completely underutilised, particularly from Waterford to Limerick.  The lines from Limerick to Ennis and from Ennis to Galway have seen a revival and a return of passenger services, but not to the extent that would see the full use of the existing assets.  The really interesting question concerns the completion of the western corridor, running from Ballina right down the west coast to the south east.

Water is scarce in other parts of the world.  We have some of the best workers and high-quality precision-manufacturing capability.  Even if the plant in Oranmore is not advanced, I am sure alternative options will be available.<\/p> <p>I am sure alternative options will come forward.  I am aware that in a low-carbon world, having a low-carbon transport system and an infrastructure to back that up is part of the deal.  In that regard, I agree with the Deputy.

This follows extensive engagement by Coast Guard management with volunteers in Doolin, culminating in my appointment of Mr. Kieran Mulvey as mediator.  Mr. Mulvey&rsquo;s report made a number of recommendations in respect of the service in Doolin.  I can advise that the Coast Guard is currently fully engaged in the process of rebuilding the Doolin unit, guided by the recommendations outlined in Mr. Mulvey&rsquo;s report which was issued on 10 December 2021.  The serving Doolin volunteers were advised by letter on 16 December 2021 that the previous unit had been stood down on a permanent basis, with all volunteer memberships terminated.  Mr. Mulvey advised that the Coast Guard and my Department should move with immediate effect to reconstitute the Doolin unit and to reinstate those members of the unit who management in the Coast Guard believe can work and operate together in a collegiate and co-operative manner.  The report advised that the reconstituted unit should be given sufficient time to develop a culture between them of mutual respect and trust.

The current spike in energy prices arises from the global recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic in conjunction with current international tensions and supply constraint issues.  It is being witnessed across the European Union as well as many other regions.  In order to mitigate the impact of fuel price increases for hauliers, the diesel rebate scheme offers a partial excise refund to qualifying operators.<\/p> <p>In light of the challenges arising from Brexit and the uncertainty facing the sector, in budget 2020 the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.32, VAT inclusive, was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cent per litre in recognition of the vital role of the haulage sector to the economy.  In addition, businesses that are registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs such as road diesel and other motoring costs.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I met with the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, on 10 December 2021 and again on 10 February 2022 to discuss the spike in fuel prices for hauliers and the need for the sector to make progress towards decarbonisation.  Although no way forward was agreed at those meetings, discussions on these issues are ongoing at official level. <\/p> <p> Similarly, the driver shortage is not a problem confined just to Ireland.  It has been a growing issue across Europe and globally for several years.  It is a multifaceted issue with a range of contributing factors, including the pandemic, which has clearly had a significant impact on many sectors.<\/p> <p> In 2019, my Department established the national logistics and supply chain skills group, the key objective of which is to support the promotion of careers, skills development and sustainable employment in the logistics and supply chain sector.

It will inform the development of the railway sector on the island of Ireland over the coming decades.  The review will consider the potential scope for improved rail services along various existing and potential future corridors of the network, and that scope will also include the potential afforded by disused and closed lines such as the Kingscourt line.<\/p>  <p>  Separately the Deputy will be aware of the work under way by the National Transport Authority in its review of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  The draft review is recommending the development of a rail line to Navan by 2042.  I understand that this rail line will utilise the old Kingscourt line over a short distance to connect the proposed Navan central station and a proposed Navan north station. <\/p>  <p>  More generally, I can assure Deputies that as well as looking at issues relating to inter-urban and inter-regional rail connectivity and the potential for high and higher speeds, the rail review will also consider improved connectivity to the north west and the Border region.<\/p>  <p>  I have already stated my belief in the potential of rail.  It is essential that we identify current constraints in the rail sector, then balance decarbonisation priorities, economic growth and rural connectivity objectives to achieve a strategy which allows rail to fulfil its potential as a resilient and sustainable mode of transport and generator of economic growth for people across Ireland.  The strategic rail review will assist in and inform this debate, including I hope, on the reopening of the Kingscourt line, and I look forward to the completion of the review later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300006#D01700","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister very much.

It is bringing no economic benefit whatsoever to the west of Ireland and to my constituency.<\/p>  <p>  What we simply need to do here is to make a decision.  Every report that has been published over the past decade has concluded that there is no economic case to be made for the reopening of any rail service on that line.  The Minister's Department arrived at the same conclusions.  Irish Rail published a report last July outlining its rail freight strategy for the next 20 years to the year 2040 and there was not one single word about the western rail corridor.  The Minister referred the most recent WRC report to JASPERS, the Joint Assistance to Support Projects in European Regions partnership body, and the most respected think tank when it comes to the economics of developing transport infrastructure, and its conclusion, quite simply, was that: \"... there is no evidence of specific transport or social constraints, nor of clear objectives that any investment in this corridor is required to meet.\"<\/p>  <p>  I ask that the Minister finally make a decision to build a railway with a greenway alongside it or to build a greenway.

The Navan rail link, north and west of Dublin, has been assessed as part of the draft greater Dublin area strategy and I agree with the assessment that the case has been made and that it will be included once the greater Dublin area, GDA, strategy becomes fully legal in our plans.  It will take time.  In respect of the constraints, there is not a lack of ambition or urgency here but there is one reality we have to face.<\/p> <p>There are already approximately &euro;70 billion worth of projects within the existing transport projects in the planning process and we have a &euro;35 billion budget for this decade.  That is a real constraint and difficulty.  However, it does not undermine the case for that line to Navan.  If that proceeds, it raises the question of whether one could go further.  Could one go from Navan along the old route towards Kingscourt?  One could even consider, if one was massively ambitious, that this was an original line up through Monaghan, Omagh, Strabane and into Derry.  Part of the strategic rail review recognises that the north west of the island has been neglected in terms of transport connectivity and in that really big long-term context it makes sense.  However, it is much more challenging because that rail line has not been used for a significant period.  There is quite a lot of quarrying, industrial and other activity in that part of the country and perhaps we could look at whether that would be a way of reopening the line, holding the reservation, getting trains back and then seeing if passenger services can follow on.<\/p> <p> When it comes to the north west and the western rail corridor, as Deputy Cannon said it could potentially run up to Sligo or Enniskillen.  Again, that is a very long-term prospect.  Once one goes north of Claremorris, the line is not extant.  Everyone is agreed that the section north towards Collooney and Sligo is highly unlikely in the immediate future to be considered for rail services.  I believe there is broad agreement that it should be a greenway, except I am not certain whether Mayo County Council, Galway County Council and Sligo County Council are in agreement as to how and where that route should be devised and designed.  From my perspective, that is one of the biggest obstacles to providing a greenway in that area.  The section from Claremorris to Athenry is a different issue.  From Claremorris one can join onto the existing rail network towards Ballina or Westport.  There is a strategic question in a much wider national context which the original rail reviews did not look at in that section of line.  If one looks at it in a narrow context, is there is a demand for commuting from Claremorris or Tuam into Galway on rail?  The answer is clearly \"No\", as Joint Assistance to Support Projects in the European Regions, JASPERS, said.  However, is it potentially a part of a strategic western rail corridor which extends all the way from Ballina down the west coast through Limerick towards Waterford?  That is a different question which neither JASPERS nor anybody else has asked yet and which the strategic rail review is now looking at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300006#D02100","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646300400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to invite the Minister to walk the stretch of rail line with me from Navan to Kingscourt, although perhaps not in its entirety.

We must have a vision of reopening that as a rail line to Kingscourt because the potential it has to open the Border region is huge.

It has no, and will have no, demand for rail freight to any great extent for the foreseeable future, if ever.  The EY-DKM report drew the same conclusion.

We have a real challenge in that the number of Cavan and Monaghan people commuting to Dublin is very significant and they are coming into a city that is not going to have the same road capacity.  When we introduce the BusConnects scheme, all the cars commuting from long distances as well as vans and trucks will be meeting a Dublin road network that is at capacity and restricted in terms of access.  The remote working that will occur post the pandemic may help in that regard.  It may help towns and villages in Cavan and Monaghan see a big revival.  What my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, is doing with the new hubs is an opportunity to rethink the way we work and commute.  Rail can provide a massively useful component in that.  It would help us meet our climate targets as well as address commuting.<\/p>  <p>  However, I return to the fact that there is a constraint here, which is capital.  Even if we do for the next decade what we do in this decade, the existing projects will eat up all that money.  Every part of the country is looking at rail projects.  There are also rural bus projects that we have to fund, and the Connecting Ireland plan is the most significant and important investment we have to prioritise.  There is a challenge, therefore, in how we prioritise or how we do it, but I would not rule it out.  I would go further in terms of reallocating more of our roads funding towards public transport that might help us overcome some of that difficulty, but that is something we have to agree on politically and that will be a challenge, as the Deputy knows.<\/p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy O'Rourke regarding the Navan rail line, it is now very much in train as part of the series of projects that we will fund over the period of two decades.  The route validation exercise for that route has been completed.  There are two routes.  Route A is 34 km as per the draft railway order completed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in 2011.<\/p> <p>Route B is similar to route A but with a section to the east side of Dunshaughlin.  It is in planning and is being considered.  Cost estimations for each of these route options is expected to be completed soon.  It gives a clear picture of how it fits in with the real challenge we have in meeting all of the capital we need.<\/p> <p> To come back to the north-west rail corridor and the future of freight, Deputy Cannon is right there are real challenges in Ireland because of the shorter distances and because we have developed road dependency.  We have put tens of billions of euro over the years into closing our rail freight system and opening up alternative road-based systems.  It is not a surprise the economics are challenging with regard to the shunting yards and all of the other equipment that would help make rail freight possible.  I do not believe it is completely finished, however, or that it will not be part of the solution in meeting the climate challenge and having a vibrant modern economy.  In Europe and throughout the world people are looking again at sustainable solutions.<\/p> <p> Forest products are still moved by rail.  A number of products from the north west are carried from Ballina by rail freight at present.  As Deputy Leddin said, we will reopen the Foynes line.  One of the reasons we will do so, as well as to get golfers to the Ryder Cup in a sustainable low-carbon way and benefiting the communities he mentioned with stations along the route, is that we expect new mines to be developed along the existing rail lines.  It would be insanity to ship mine ore by road.  It will go by rail.  Once we start to have some products moved by rail the economics will begin to make sense because we will cover the main line costs and the incremental costs will begin to decrease.

Many of the commuters coming into Dublin city will hit an M50 that is at capacity where no additional capacity can be provided.  It is inevitable gridlock.  The Deputy spoke about the human cost of long commuting times and being stuck in traffic as well as the environmental and economic inefficiencies of it.  I am very supportive.

I hope I am not being controversial and I mean no disrespect to anyone in Galway but Galway is probably where we have our biggest and worst problem with regard to sustainable transport.  The city has been very successful in developing but it has an unsustainable transport model that prioritises and promotes transport based on individual cars.  I do not blame or fault people who have to use their own cars but it becomes completely unsustainable when a certain level of traffic is reached.  That is where we are at in Galway.  We need to accelerate some of the sustainable transport solutions in Galway, particularly some of the active travel and BusConnects infrastructure, which would help people use the infrastructure we are discussing, and the development of the railway station at Oranmore, which we mentioned earlier.  That integrated approach is required.  Park-and-ride facilities have to be part of wider sustainable transport solutions.  We should also have bike-and-ride facilities.  There is significant potential in providing bike parking, particularly at rail and bus stations.  Particularly in light of new electric bikes, there is capacity to rethink how our cities and rural communities work.  We need to accelerate development not only of the park-and-ride facilities, but of the active travel and bus travel infrastructure that needs to go with those facilities as part of an overall solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300009#G00700","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1646301600,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I honestly fully agree with the Minister but we are beyond all of that.

Of course, park-and-ride facilities are only one feature.  Cycling, light rail, using Oranmore and Athenry and increasing the frequency of trains are all also features.  The most frustrating thing is that Galway is a city destined to grow.  We cannot destroy its natural beauty.  Thanks be to God, we have a beautiful city.  However, we have certainly messed up the planning and we continue to do so.  We do not have a city architect or an overall master plan for the city that is a plan for the common good.

In this context, one initiative taken since the Department of Rural and Community Development's introduction of a local improvement scheme is the provision by my Department of ring-fenced funding for the community involvement scheme.  This scheme is designed to provide for the repair of more lightly trafficked public rural roads, which tend to be considered only towards the end of road authorities&rsquo; annual roadworks programmes.  Under this scheme, &euro;29 million approximately was paid to local authorities over 2020 and 2021 and this year's grants include funding of a further &euro;15.2 million for the community involvement scheme.  All available grant funding for 2022 has been allocated.  There was an increased allocation recognising that new investment in our local roads is important for safety and for rural connectivity.

At the same time, I know many laneways and local roads along which ten or 12 families live.  These are people of all age groups and people who, thankfully, have come back to live in their local communities.  In many of those areas we have the social infrastructure in place, be it schools, sporting facilities or whatever.  I now have queries from people who want to move back to rural Ireland.  They want to go back to live in their home places and they ask me whether there is any chance that the roads along which they have their sites will be brought up to an acceptable and appropriate standard.  These people pay their taxes, as do people living in urban areas, who have good roads and road surfaces, footpaths and public lighting.

That means we have to fund the new Connecting Ireland rural public transport system, which will be of huge benefit and help people in rural Ireland.  That is why we increased the funding for local roads and made sure we maintained the funding for public road maintenance.  If we let that go, it costs a lot more to bring it back.

I have an interest in seeing progress on this project also.  Emmet Road is a really important project for development, particularly in the cost-rental sector in Ireland.  The plan for a local authority-led financing structure is a key element in the long-term delivery of cost rental and one that could be replicated elsewhere.  A dedicated Dublin City Council project manager and project team are working on the development and have confirmed it is a key deliverable in the council's housing programme.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the concerns of the local residents who have been constructively engaging regarding the development at the site.  I had a very good virtual meeting with them last December.  I am aware of how rigorous the design process for such a large and important site can be and appreciate the work done to date, but, just like Deputies Joan Collins and &Oacute; Broin, the Government wants to see this move on.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that the council has advised that the concept design was presented to councillors on Tuesday, the day before yesterday, and to the Inchicore Regeneration Consultative Forum yesterday.  Although the designs are not finalised, current plans propose a mixed-tenure development of 548 homes, which represents an increase.  I welcome that because we need to maximise the use of the site by providing really good homes.  Of the 548 homes, 75% will be cost rental and 25% will be social.<\/p>  <p>  This design will be presented to the public during phase 3 of the consultation process.  The Deputies and all other representatives from the area will pay close attention to it.  The process will run from 8 March to 31 March.  The concept design includes the site layout, approximate unit numbers and mix, the number of stories and standard layout.  Therefore, it is a very important process.  I want this to be the last one and to move on from here.<\/p>  <p>  The council has advised that, following this consultation, some further refinements, including improved design efficiencies and the consideration of consultation feedback, will be required before the full design stage can be reached.  This will enable the design team to complete the environmental impact assessment report, update the cost plan and consequently submit a full planning application.  I expect that by the end of 2022.  That is what I want to happen, and I am strongly encouraging Dublin City Council to meet the target of proceeding to planning by the end of 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Delivery after planning is outside our remit but there are other things we can do.  In this regard, I must refer in particular to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question.  As with the principle of cost rental, rents will depend on the overall cost of delivery.  This development already benefits from utilising State land in a prime city-centre location, but funding support from my Department will also help to reduce the ultimate rents paid by tenants.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Joan Collins will know, in December 2020 my Department and I approved &euro;18.75 million, in principle, for the cost-rental homes under the scheme.  That was under the serviced sites fund.  Under Housing for All, we have brought in the affordable housing fund, which provides a lot more flexibility, particularly in areas where there are acute issues with affordability.  While we allowed a subvention of up to &euro;50,000 per unit under the serviced sites fund, the Department now allows one of up to &euro;100,000.  In one respect, the delay talked about may benefit the overall delivery at the site and have a benefit in respect of the cost.<\/p>  <p>  I have revised the criteria and provided more flexibility and funding support to appropriate affordable housing projects, including high-density developments.  The council has indicated it is going to resubmit the application to me.  It is working on a new funding application based on the increased numbers for the site.  I welcome that and hope all Deputies will welcome the increase in the number of homes.  There are to be 548 homes for families in the area, 75% of which will be cost rental and 25% of which will be social.<\/p> <p>I cannot imagine anyone will have a difficulty with that.  We want to get the design right and I am going to provide increased funding for that.  I will come back in if there are additional questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300017#P01800","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646307000,"counter":214,"content":"<p>As the Minister will know, this is a project that has strong cross-party support.

The Minister's Department recently published the report into a review of the four-stage process, particularly for mixed tenure projects.  The difficulty is that there is nothing in that document that suggests, for example, that there will be any acceleration of that approval process for this project.  I urge the Minister, particularly in respect of recommendation 8 of that report on the single decision-maker, to use the St. Michael's estate site as a pilot to test run a single point of decision-making to speed it up.  We cannot have a two- to four-year approval, tendering and procurement process, which is currently how long it is taking in large projects such as this elsewhere in the country.  I also urge the Minister to look the finances again.

We do not know how long it will take for the planning application to be approved or not.  I urge the Minister to push the council as much as possible to get its act together.  Not only is a full-time Dublin City Council project manager working on it, but one of the top and longest-established design teams in the country is working on it.  It should be delivered much more quickly.  I am delighted to hear about the &euro;100,000 but costs are going up all the time.

Yesterday, we received a WhatsApp message about events being held Richmond Barracks during the month of March.  Three different webinars are to take place.  That is good news.  However, like the other Deputies, I think the project needs to be accelerated, with a proper timeline set out for delivery.  After all, the community has been waiting for decades for this to happen.

It states that it would be preferable, but there will be greater co-ordination.  I invite the Minister to meet the Deputies involved with this issue and the relevant officials from the Department.  Some of us may have helpful suggestions that could be piloted in this project to accelerate it.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of rents, Dublin City Council is currently saying that the rents could be &euro;1,300 plus, even with the affordable housing fund.  The term of the loan is too short.  I know that the European Investment Bank, EIB, only provides that term, but with the Enniskerry Road project, the Minister was able to restructure the loan through the Housing Finance Agency, HFA.  While it is possible to get the rents at this location down to &euro;700, &euro;800 and &euro;900 for one-, two- and three-bedroom properties, that requires both &euro;100,000 from the serviced sites fund or affordable housing fund and much longer maturities.

The point about keeping the rents at a level where the community is sustainable, so those who were educated and reared around St. Michael's estate can continue to live there at an affordable rate, is an important one.

The planning stage is separate.  That unit is being established.  In response to the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I can state that it will be a three-stage process.  I believe that St. Michael's is such a significant site that I am absolutely open to looking at how we can ensure that the project is expedited.  I will certainly arrange a meeting with interested Deputies, who are either from the constituency or are spokespersons, such as Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others.  Perhaps Deputy Cian O'Callaghan will be interested.  I will arrange that meeting at the appropriate time.  I think we need to let the public consultation happen.  I suggest that we do that.  The Deputy's question is very timely, because the consultation is happening between 8 and 31 March.  I have no interest in delaying this project.  I want to see it done.  In response to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, I believe in cost rental.  That is why one of the first things I did when I took office was to work on the affordable housing legislation with colleagues to get it enacted to ensure that we have a national cost-rental scheme that is underpinned by legislation.  We have cost-rental tenants in place in homes in counties Dublin and Kildare.  There will be hundreds more this year.  We are not just talking about a concept.<\/p>  <p>  To deal with cost, the term of the loan and so on, the HFA may have a role to play.  While the EIB has its role, we will explore that with some of the bigger sites without complicating or delaying project further.  There have been no delays to the project from our side.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned that I am sketching out the timeframe.  I do not know what will happen in planning.  I do not know whether there will be objections to the project, whether there will be judicial reviews or whether people will go to court over it.  I do not know any of that, because it is independent of me.  I hope there will not be delays.  The way the council is approaching this project on a plan-led basis is correct.  People can see the detail of what we will be proposing to build there.  It is important to take the feedback from residents now.  I want the council to submit the planning application by the end of this year.  I can assure Deputy Joan Collins that I am encouraging Dublin City Council in a very positive way to make sure that that timeline is hit. I cannot say who is going to object to or make observations on the application.  I hope that it receives a fair wind through the planning process and is granted permission.  We already know that in advance of that, the council will be submitting proposals to me and the Department in relation to funding.  We can work that through in advance of planning permission being granted.  I am expecting a new application from Dublin City Council under the affordable housing fund.  I have not received it yet.  The council is working through it on the basis of knowing how many units are going to be on the site.  I expect and hope that the Deputies here will support the increased number of homes there.  We will deliver 578 homes there, 75% of which will be cost rental and 25% of which will be social housing.<\/p> <p>I hope they will encourage residents and work with them to make sure it gets through planning quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300018#Q01000","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Construction Industry","time":1646307600,"counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300019#R00150"},{"type":"question","time":1646307600,"counter":225,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[12050\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300019#R00200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his Department&rsquo;s response to a report by an organisation (details supplied).","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1646307600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>As I am sure the Minister is aware, the Irish Green Building Council, IGBC, launched an important report last November on foot of research it commissioned from University College Dublin on how to deliver the increased number of homes and other construction projects that will be built in the future in a way that allows us to meet our legally binding emissions reduction targets.

I would like to hear more information from the Minister of State as to how exactly that bit of the carbon emissions reduction targets will be met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300019#R00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646307600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>It might be worth pursuing this report at the Oireachtas joint committee.

There is also the sustainable products initiative, which will widen the scope of the eco-design directive to all products.  It will introduce requirements relating to durability, reusability, hazardous chemicals, energy and resource efficiency, carbon and environmental footprints, and recyclable content while also ensuring the performance and safety of products.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, is working on the circular economy and green procurement.  It would be worthwhile to try to tease out in more detail all of those combined elements at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I again refer to older buildings, such as 20th century buildings, many of which, unfortunately, are being demolished in Dublin.

There will also be a role for legislation here.  For example, a shift from high-carbon cement to low-carbon cement, which actually cost the same price to produce in the marketplace currently, will not happen unless it is required under law through a phase-out of higher-carbon cement.  Likewise, the shift from cement, steel and glass to more sustainable materials will require significant State intervention.  I understand Enterprise Ireland and the construction sector working group of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are working on these issues but, given the urgency and the fact the EPA believes we will not meet the targets for this year, the sooner we have that exchange at the Oireachtas committee and start to engage in the kind of solutions that we all agree are required, the better for everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300019#R00700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646307600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I agree wholeheartedly.

The proportion of energy prices covered by taxation is falling, but we need to look at excise and see if we might do something there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300021#T00500","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1646308800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>As this is my final Leaders' Questions, I will ask about something that is important to me and on which I have worked for many years.  It relates to women's health.  First, I acknowledge Vicky Phelan and wish her the very best from the floor of the D&aacute;il, and I hope all Members share that with me.  I also acknowledge and thank Ms Lorraine Walsh, Mr. Stephen Teap and Mr. John Wall for their support and the work we have done over the past number of years.  They certainly have had the biggest impact on me politically, more so than probably anyone else.  It is four years since Vicky won her High Court case in April 2018, when she bravely refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement.<\/p> <p>We all know what happened with regard to CervicalCheck as a result of that.  Huge progress has been made, and I acknowledge that.<\/p> <p> We need to move on, however, in respect of a range of issues, such as a review of legislation on abortion to look at policy and the real problems with a lack of access for women and safe access zones.  We also need to look at the national maternity hospital to make sure it is publicly owned and controlled.  Nothing else is acceptable.  When the CervicalCheck tribunal was established in 2020, I stated that it was not acceptable.  I predicted that more than 200 cases would go to the High Court.  There are now more than 300 cases before it.  To date, it has received only 19 claims.  For me the concerns were never addressed.  It is never too late to do the right thing.  This is shameful and wrong, and it should be looked at.  Most of all, we have the final progress report of Dr. Scally on the recommendations of his scoping inquiry into the CervicalCheck screening programme.  There are four outstanding actions.  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline the status of these?<\/p> <p> The issue that really concerns me is the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019.  To be fair, the T&aacute;naiste has history on this.  It was published in December 2019 and debated in the D&aacute;il but has been stuck on Committee Stage ever since.  We need to get the Bill over the line because it would provide for mandatory open disclosure and ensure patients' voices are heard.  This is about ensuring that people have an absolute right to know information about their healthcare and that hospitals, screening providers and doctors do not keep information from them.  This has been going on for way too long.  I ask, on behalf of Vicky and everyone else, that we address this as soon as possible and finally get it over the line.  It is a dear request for me.  I want to see this legislation get over the line.  It is a big component of the recommendations in the Scally report.<\/p> <p> Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure the national maternity hospital is publicly owned and controlled?  Will he provide a status report on the remaining recommendations in the Scally report?  Most of all, and most importantly, will he indicate to the House that the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 will be enacted and brought into operation very quickly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300021#T00600","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646309400,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Deputy Kelly on the role has played in recent years as leader of the Labour Party and as a Minister in a previous Government.  Some people will say that the Labour Party has struggled to overcome its period in government.  Quite frankly, however, it has a lot to be proud of when it comes to the period it spent in government between 2011 to 2016, which was a very difficult time.  In the early part of that Government's term, as the Deputy will recall, I was the senior Minister in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and he was Minister of State.  While we did not always agree, we did get on and we managed to get a lot of things done.  I particularly remember integrated ticketing, as we called it at the time but which we now call the Leap card.  It had gone on for years and years.  It was one of the projects the Deputy was given responsibility for.  He really banged heads together.  Sometimes being a bit brash is not necessarily a bad thing in politics.  It required weekly meetings and it got done within months.  Another area for which the Deputy had responsibility was taxis.  It was very difficult and an area that people ran away from.  He managed to make some very important reforms that were good for passengers and consumers and for people who drive taxis.  I want to recognise all of that on this occasion.  They may seem like small things but they had not been fixed for a very long time.  They were finally fixed because, by and large, Deputy Kelly is the kind of politician who gets things done.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, Deputy Kelly has taken a particular interest in issues regarding women's health, whether the eight amendment or CervicalCheck.  He has been a very strong advocate for Vicky Phelan and a number of women who were affected by that debacle.  I have seen their social media messages today, and they are very complimentary of the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Scally report, significant progress has been made in implementing its recommendations.  The most recent progress report was published by the Department of Health just yesterday.  It shows that as of the end of 2021 four out of the 170 actions remain to be completed.  The Minister for Health has asked Dr. Scally to conduct a final progress review of the implementation plan.  That is now under way.<\/p>  <p>  Something that is of real importance, and the Deputy mentioned it, is the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019.  The latter includes a mandatory requirement for open disclosure where a serious incident occurs.  The Bill will also bring private hospitals within the remit of the Health Act.  It also contains provisions to protect clinical audit.  It was introduced in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 12 December 2019.  It has passed Second Stage and needs to move to Committee Stage.  I am informed it could go to Committee Stage as early as next week, but it will certainly do so in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300022#U00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1646309400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his kind words.

I absolutely feel that in honour of Vicky Phelan and many other people, including Ruth Morrissey, who was treated very badly by the State, we need to ensure that the Bill completes its passage this term.

Some 1 million refugees have left the country and thousands of civilians have been killed.  Cities, homes and healthcare facilities have been bombed to smithereens.  Seven days after the Russian tanks began to roll across the border, Ukraine remains unconquered and the capital is holding out.  Amid the horror of Putin's war two key positives shine out, namely, the resistance of the Ukrainian people and the Russian anti-war movement.  Again and again, history has shown that people power holds they key to ending war and dictatorship.  The Ceausescus were overthrown not by NATO but by a mass uprising of the Romanian people.  The other Stalinist dictatorships were not ended by tanks but by the masses.  The beginning of the end of the First World War were the strikes and protests on the streets of Russia that overthrew the tsar and put capitalism into the dock.<\/p>  <p>  Next week, the Irish State will send representatives to Versailles for an informal European Council hosted by President Macron.  The question of building a European military machine is expected to dominate proceedings.  President Macron's views are well known on this.  He has said that we will not protect Europeans if we do not decide to have a true European army.  I suspect he will make this point more forcefully next week.  This week, the T&aacute;naiste told RT&Eacute; news he thinks Ireland needs to go deeper on the question of European military co-operation.  He said it needs to increase military spending and expressed a wish to open up a debate on such issues.<\/p>  <p>  The socialist left looks forward to engaging with the T&aacute;naiste and others in this debate.  In that context, I will make a number of points in the time remaining to me.  My first overarching point is that the history of Europe shows that dividing the continent into armed camps does not lead to peace.  If the T&aacute;naiste goes to Versailles next week, he should take a trip out to the green fields of France and he will see what I mean.  Ireland won her independence by way of a struggle against a great imperial power in the 20th century.  Ireland should not now align with the ruling classes of France, Germany and elsewhere that are seeking to make Europe a military power in the 21st century.<\/p> <p>We oppose any major increase in Ireland's military spending.  One of the three options in the recent Defence Forces report was to increase the military spend from &euro;1 billion a year to &euro;3 billion.  We think that the vast bulk of that money should be spent on housing, health, childcare and the like and that the majority of people in this country would agree with us on that.  We are in favour of spending to end the scourge of low pay in our Defence Forces.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I again call on all people, especially young people, to come out onto the streets to say \"No\" to war and to show solidarity with and to encourage the two key forces that hold the key to progress here, the brave anti-war protestors on the streets of Russia and, crucially, the heroic ordinary people of Ukraine in their resistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300022#U00500","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646310000,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I echo and agree with the Deputy's remarks on at least two accounts.  The first is that we all admire the bravery of the Ukrainian Government and the Ukrainian people who are resisting this attack and this attempt to take over and occupy their country.  Even with regard to a city like Kharkiv, which is near the Russian border, in which most people are Russian speakers and in which there is, in many ways, a dual identity, Putin has made a big mistake.  If anything, he has cemented and strengthened the Ukrainian national identity.  Russian speakers and people who perhaps feel a little Russian and a little Ukrainian are feeling more Ukrainian today and are pushing back in that city against the Russian invasion.  To me, that says that Ukrainians and Russians alike want to live in a democracy and are willing to fight for that, as they are now doing.  I have immense admiration for those Russians who are attending protests in St. Petersburg, Moscow and other cities to say that this is not being done in their name.  It is a very brave person who protests on Nevsky Prospect in St. Petersburg or in Red Square.  We need to recognise that and offer them our solidarity and support.<\/p>  <p>  One thing we need to do, which we have not done enough of in recent years, is to start defending our system a bit more.  Our system is the system of the west.  It is based on liberal democracy, the rule of law, the social market economy and multilateralism in international affairs.  It is not a perfect system.  I know that.  We have lots of problems but nobody is trying to climb over walls or climbing into dinghies to get into China, Russia, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, Iran or any of those places.  We need to recognise the fact that we are very fortunate to live in a social market economy and a liberal democracy.  We are fortunate to be part of organisations like the European Union and the United Nations.  If anything, this attack on Ukraine should be a wake-up call for all of us to be willing to defend our system because a system worth building is worth defending.  If the European Union was worth building, it is worth defending.  If our independence was worth securing, it is also worth defending.<\/p>  <p>  Like Deputy Barry, I do not agree that we should increase defence spending up to &euro;3 billion.  That would be too much.  There are other priorities and other demands.  However, I do think we need to increase defence spending.  We need to pay our military personnel more.  We need better equipment.  We need to be able to guard our own seas.  We need radar over our own airspace.  The assumption that we have made for 70 years is that nobody would attack us because we are a country that is neutral militarily.  Ukraine was neutral militarily.  It was not part of any military alliance.  It was attacked because it was politically part of the west, or at least wanted to be.  We make the assumption that, even if we are attacked, the British and the Americans will come and save us anyway.  I am not sure that is the kind of assumption a sovereign country like ours should make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300023#V00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1646310000,"counter":266,"content":"<p>This debate in under way and will continue over the coming weeks and months.  We look forward to participating fully in that debate.  Part of the debate has to be the question of the links European governments had with the Putin regime and its supporters, including the blind eye that was turned in this country.  Some &euro;118 billion worth of wealth was sloshing through the IFSC from Russian entities between 2005 and 2017, dirty money laundered by oligarchs etc.  Why was a blind eye turned to this within a 15-minute walk of Leinster House?  Did the Government and Government Ministers really think this was just pensioner savings or communion money that was being kept in the IFSC?  We would argue that, in reality, the only consistent opponent of Putin and Russian gangster oligarch capitalism down through the years has been the socialist left.  This is part of the debate.  We look forward to engaging in that debate.  We are confident that our ideas will echo strongly among ordinary Irish people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300023#V00300","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1646310000,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Far too many people in the west, including many western European governments, turned a blind eye to President Putin for too long.  We saw that after the Crimea crisis.  That sent a message to him that the west was weak and I would say he started making his plans around about then to take the rest of Ukraine.  However, it is not just about governments or government ministers.  Anyone who has expressed pro-Putin sentiments or who has been an apologist for Putin now has questions to answer.  There are a lot of them in Ireland, some in this House, and many outside of this House.  They should now be held to account for statements they made in the past that were soft on the Russian regime and for being apologists for Putin in any way.  Quite a number of them would consider themselves to be part of the socialist left.  I do not mean Deputy Barry but I can identify quite a number of people who would consider themselves to be socialists or part of the socialist left who have appeared on Russia Today, who have been apologists for Putin and who have consistently made statements that are supportive of that regime and that man.

I applaud what we have done in waiving visa restrictions and allowing Ukrainian people to come here and avail of employment at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  I will raise an issue with the T&aacute;naiste that was raised with me.  It relates to some vacant property, particularly holiday homes, that people might be of a mind to make available to Ukrainian people.  These people are wondering whether it is possible for them to do so without creating tenancy rights or whether they can provide short-term letting arrangements.  Perhaps the Government could take a look at this because we have a difficulty with regard to how we are going to accommodate a significant number of Ukrainian refugees.<\/p>  <p>  I will go on to talk about the agriculture and food industry, which has been an indigenous champion of this economy for many years.  It is the bulwark of our rural economy and the basis for regional regeneration.  My concerns are building.  I am reflecting concerns I am hearing that our climate policy appears to be muddled with regard to where we are going with agriculture.  It would not be a far stretch to say that potentially there is some confrontation building in public opinion between the agricultural sector and the needs of climate change.<\/p>  <p>  As we are well aware, we have a commodities crisis at the moment, not least because Russia and Ukraine produce almost 30% of the world's wheat, 8% of the world's grain and 60% of the world's sunflower oil between them.  All of this is going to feed into primary producer prices and the retail supply prices.  As the T&aacute;naiste will know, there is also a significant issue in respect of fertiliser.  Russia is by far the largest manufacturer of fertiliser and sanctions are now driving up a price that has already increased by 300% year to date.  This will have an effect on productivity and on output and will certainly have an effect on pricing.  The farming sector has been raising this issue for some time but little regard has been had to the matter.  The increase in prices for energy in May the Government has committed to and the increase in the price of fossil fuels will also put extreme pressure on this sector.<\/p>  <p>  I also highlight to the T&aacute;naiste some issues affecting forestry.  Despite the work the Government has done, we are still way behind in processing licences.  Almost 70% of licences that are being processed are licences for Coillte, in other words for the State sector, at the expense of looking after rural and regional farmers who have invested in forestry.<\/p>  <p>  I will also bring up the issue of wind energy.  We know that a regulatory maritime institution will not be developed for another two years but there is a process ongoing at the moment with regard to an onshore wind development near the south-east coast within 5 km of the shore.  No regard seems to have been given to developing this project offshore, as has been done in Scotland.  As a Deputy from the south east, I will be in the vanguard in objecting to onshore wind in the UNESCO site in County Waterford.  We need to look at developing that facility offshore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300023#V00500","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1646310600,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet the six main farming organisations in Government Buildings.  We organised the meeting as a regular round table to talk about Brexit, Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform and climate action.  As the Deputy can imagine and as is often the case, events overtake us.  Most of the meeting was about Ukraine, the cost of inputs, the rising cost of fuel and fertiliser, and how that will impact food prices and farm incomes.  This afternoon at 2 o'clock the Taoiseach will chair a special meeting of Ministers.  We will consider three matters.  First is the humanitarian response and how we can assist Ukrainians who come to Ireland and more importantly how can we assist the millions of Ukrainians who will not come to Ireland but will be refugees in other parts of Europe.  Second is sanctions and the political response.  Can we do more to show our support for Ukraine and our opposition to the Russian Federation and Belarus?  Third is how we can deal with the economic impact of another economic shock so soon after the last one.  How will we help households with rising bills?  How can we help farmers with rising input costs?  How can we help the business sector?  There is only so much that Government can do, but there are things that Government can do.  We will consider them this afternoon and I look forward to reporting back to the D&aacute;il next week if I have the opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  I got a really good note from Minister of State, Senator Hackett, on forestry licensing the other day.

While I am certainly not against it, we need a reappraisal of it.  As far as I am aware, the Government has not revised the policy on increases to fossil fuel prices in May.  That would be a very retrograde step for inflation.  I believe the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, will not be developed for two years or longer.  We have still not discussed where we are going with a wind port in this country.  We need to designate wind ports and Rosslare is the obvious one.  There are clear benefits to housing in Dublin by reducing some of the capacity in Dublin Port.

It is a good Bill, and while there are difficulties with it, that is part of the process of amendments and review.  This is a special day and we are, I hope, turning a corner.  The Bill will give legal underpinning to excavations that will be carried out forensically, with expertise and in accordance with international standards, for the first time ever.  I hope that, as we shine that spotlight, we will shine it also on the society and the narrative that allowed that to happen.  We are not standing here today as a result of a proactive Department - although I am not finding issue with the Department - or because society has grown up and we realise we really should do these things.  Rather, we are doing this because of Catherine Corless.  It is like &ldquo;in the beginning was Catherine Corless&rdquo;.  In this case, in the beginning was Catherine Corless in 2012.  She has shown perseverance against all odds.  I have read her book.  What stood out for me, among many aspects, was her description of going into the county council building to carry out her research and how, in modern times, she was supervised, with the door locked.  We were still locking doors in modern times and supervising anyone who dared to ask questions.  She wrote an article for a local newspaper.  We know all this because it has been said many times but it is important to reiterate it because without her and her persistence, we would be nowhere.  She published her extraordinary and poignant article, entitled &ldquo;The Home&rdquo;, in the <i>Journal of the Old Tuam Society<\/i>in 2012, detailing the poor living conditions.<\/p><p>I am conscious of time and I want to get through quite a lot, so Catherine might forgive me, given what she has done is all on record.  Between 2011 and 2013, at her own expense, she obtained 798 death records for children who had died in Tuam but for whom there were no burial records.  There were no burial records in an institution that was owned and run by the county council and operated by the sisters.  It was a religious institution with no burial records.  There was also help from local media, the <i>Galway City Tribune<\/i>, when an article by Denise McNamara entitled &ldquo;Campaign to recognise 800 dead Tuam babies&rdquo; was published on 13 February.  It was a good article, but there was a casualness in the way it was presented.  The real figure was 798.  It is awful that we could be so casual about whether the figure was 798 or 800.  Nevertheless, I pay tribute to the <i>Galway City Tribune<\/i>for its work and also to <i>The Irish Mail on Sunday<\/i>.<\/p><p>After that, a commission of inquiry was announced in 2014 and set up in February 2015.<\/p> <p>Later that year, the commission began field investigations on the site of the memorial garden.  There was a little memorial garden to add - I will not say &quot;insult&quot; - another layer on top of what was hidden underground.  The commission used a non-invasive geophysical study.  Interestingly, this was followed by a series of test excavations in 2016 and 2017 to ground &quot;truth anomalies&quot; that had been identified by remote sensing.  The truth anomalies were not just in the ground, of course.  It is amazing that that term is being used.<br\/><br\/>On 3 March 2017, the commission of investigation released a press statement detailing that, in the course of the test excavations, significant quantities of juvenile human remains have been located in underground chambers that were associated with a structure potentially related to the historic treatment of sewage waste.  As a result of this discovery, the commission asked the relevant State authorities to take responsibility for the appropriate treatment of the remains.  Clearly, the commission asked the Government to take responsibility.<br\/><br\/>The special investigation team that was set up subsequently noted that the then Minister, Ms Katherine Zappone, took &quot;a leading role in attempting to deal with the discovery of juvenile human remains in a sewage facility in Tuam.&quot;  I am quoting the technical group's report.  It continued:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe government agencies that were consulted in the process of compiling this report facilitated the [expert group] ...  However, no agency, Department or organisation acknowledged a role in coordinating any future work at the Tuam site.  This poses clear problems; while the [expert technical group] acknowledges the lack of precedent for the situation and the site this issue, as a priority, should be resolved as effectively and timely as possible. <\/blockquote> <p>Of course, that did not happen.  We are now in 2022.  Ms Zappone set up this team.  Parallel with that, the commission of investigation, following its work on the site, published its report, which was eventually published on 15 March as an interim report.  It makes many interesting comments.<br\/><br\/>Galway County Council had a legal responsibility to keep a record of burials.  It is important to remember that this is the very county council that had its meetings in the mother and baby home.  Members and staff &quot;must have known something about the manner of burial&quot;, which was inappropriate.  This report is dated 15 March and was published in April.  I am being specific because I believe there were seven or eight interim reports, but few of them were published on time.  The second-last one was not published at all.  In the end, I believe it was the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, who was responsible for getting it published along with this report.  Imagine the message that was being sent to Catherine Corless, the survivors and the various groups connected to Tuam, Bessborough and everywhere else.<br\/><br\/>Ms Zappone did her work and the report was published quickly, listing five options.  When the Minister replies, he might say whether we are choosing the fourth option, the fifth option or a combination. The fifth option was for a full excavation.<br\/><br\/>I am only giving a bare outline of what has led us to this legislation.  Along with all of these reports, we had Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report, dated 12 April 2018, on human rights.  We also had the inaugural meeting of the collaborative forum in July 2018 but whose report has never been published.  That is some accountability and transparency.  Only the recommendations have been published, and then only after pressure was applied.  The commission of investigation's report was given to the Government on 30 October 2020.  I am losing track of time; I am unsure as to whether the Minister was in office then.  Significantly and unacceptably, the report was not published.  The first time we heard about its publication was in a leak to a Sunday newspaper.  As part of that leak, an interview with the Taoiseach commented on the contents even though no one had seen it.  There was an investigation into that leak but there has been no outcome.  There was then the webinar with the survivors.  They did not get copies of the 3,000-page report.  For anyone who is listening, I have copies of the report in my office &ndash; I thank the Minister for them &ndash; and I give them out regularly.  This document in my hand is just part of that report.  I will not say that I have read every word but I have read the majority of it and I keep reverting to it.<br\/><br\/>The general scheme of the Bill was finally published in December 2019.  It was unacceptable.  Coming from a Government that people were trying to trust, it caused outrage and upset once again.  An Oireachtas committee considered the heads.  Covid interfered with the timeliness of that but the committee published a good report, which I have read, with 65 recommendations.  After the publication of the Bill's general scheme, six UN special rapporteurs and two chair-rapporteurs highlighted serious issues.  I mention all of this to outline what has brought us to this point where we have changed the heads of the Bill into legislation that I hope puts survivors at the centre.<br\/><br\/>Along with all of that serious stuff, we have constant commentary and it is important to mention these comments.  I have mentioned the help provided by newspapers.  I will now mention a very unhelpful comment from Ms Terry Prone in her capacity as public relations officer, PRO, for the nuns.  She was asked to comment on the Tuam discovery.  She wrote:<\/p><blockquote>\tYour letter was sent on to me by the Provincial of the Irish Bon Secours congregation with instructions that I should help you.  I'm not sure how I can.  Let me explain.  When the &quot;O My God &ndash; mass grave in West of Ireland&quot; broke in an English-owned paper (the Mail) it surprised the hell out of everybody, not least the Sisters of Bon Secours in Ireland, none of whom had ever worked in Tuam and most of whom had never heard of it. <\/blockquote> <p>She went on to say:<\/p><blockquote>\tIf you come here, you'll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried, and a local police force [this is presumably the Garda] casting their eyes to heaven [interesting that they were to heaven] and saying &quot;Yeah, a few bones were found &ndash; but this was an area where Famine victims were buried.  So? <\/blockquote> <p>That was the comment from the Bon Secours nuns through Ms Terry Prone.<br\/><br\/>On the positive side, documentaries from RT&Eacute; and the international media were pushing and supporting people on the ground, as well as this and previous Governments, to do something.  I was only elected in 2016 and Catherine Corless started her work in 2012.  That means we have gone through three Governments.  I have mixed up how many taoisigh we have had in that time and I do not know how many Ministers have sat where the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is sitting now, ostensibly trying to do his best.  In light of the bare outline I have given, the Minister can see how difficult it is on the ground for people who have suffered.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the legislation and its positive elements but I have a number of concerns.  The Minister has taken on some &ndash; I do not know whether it is most, so he might help me with that &ndash; of the recommendations of the cross-party committee.  I welcome the inclusion of an advisory board.  The Minister spoke about relatives being on it.  He used the plural &quot;relatives&quot; in his speech but it is singular in the legislation, in that there will only be one person from each group.  He might clarify this issue.<br\/><br\/>There is an obligation to provide documents, which is essential.  It applies to public bodies, but will the Minister clarify whether it applies to nuns and all other relevant bodies?  A large amount of documentation is with the nuns.<br\/><br\/>I will use a few seconds to say that I have the greatest of respect for nuns.  Some of them have done a great job.  When I talk about the nuns, I also talk about the county council, the politicians, the solicitors and the judges that were all in this system.  In particular, the manager of Galway County Council took an extraordinary role.  Actually, he did not &ndash; he took the role that was given to him under law, and he did it well.  When someone got pregnant for the second time, the county manager decided where her fate lay and so on.  The council then held its meetings.  As such, I am not singling out nuns.<\/p> <p>Neither am I agreeing with various comments from our former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, who said they did not come in the middle of the night.  What happened here was far more subtle or not so subtle, where a system of coercion to back up the system was used and never analysed by the commission of investigation.  Let us go back to the legislation.  Will the Minister clarify who that applies to and what analysis has been done in that regard?<\/p> <p> There are a number of escape routes that trouble me deeply in section 8(3).  In determining whether there can be making of an order under section 7(1), the establishment of the office of director of authorised intervention, a number of criteria are set out.  I understand some of them.  Will the Minister clarify what is meant or what he envisages as coming under \"public health\", for example?  There is also \"the need to respect the views of the relatives of persons buried in the land\".  I understand it was a matter discussed by the committee but the term \"relatives\" is not defined anywhere in the legislation.  That particular use of the word \"relatives\" is not defined.<\/p> <p> There is also mention of the \"archaeological features (if any) of the land\", and there must of course be a balancing exercise in this respect, though it should not be an escape route.  The most worrying term, however, is that the process shall consider \"the social and economic interests of the State\".  This escape route is extremely worrying for me and I would really like the Minister to address that for me.  I hope it will also be addressed when we deal with the amendments.<\/p> <p> I note the committee and its Chairman welcomed the lifting of restrictions on the coroner.  I can see that too.  However, I am not sure how the person appointed overall and the coroner will work together.  The way I read the legislation, the coroner will be brought in if the person in charge decides there are suspicious circumstances or questions relating to the causes of the circumstances of the death.  Is it only at that point that the coroner comes in?  I am not clear myself on this and perhaps I am misreading it.  When the restrictions are lifted from the coroner, will the person appointed to oversee the scene call in the coroner if necessary?  There is also the question of the appeals system and the adjudicator, as well as the independence of that adjudicator.<\/p> <p> I will wind up by saying the documents I have in front of me comprise a slight amount of the number of documents I have read.  I cannot imagine how difficult it is for affected people - those who were in mother and baby homes, albeit not industrial schools - to try to come to come to terms with just the bare outline of what I have discussed.  What we need, and what the Minister brings, to a certain extent, is openness and accountability in the system.  With the help of the committee and the various actions from outside actors, there has been a change.<\/p> <p> It strikes me as ironic that the compensation built into the scheme, and there must be compensation, will perhaps in some cases exceed what survivors might get in due course under the redress scheme.  It is really ironic when we think about it.  This is the cost of child abuse and our failure to act.  I can give an example, going back to the religious orders, which need to make contributions.  There was an inability of different Governments to analyse and give figures.  The original forecast for the redress scheme for those who went to industrial schools, as indicated by the Comptroller and Auditor General, was &euro;250 million but it ended up costing &euro;1.25 billion.  I do not say this to argue that cost is an element but rather the opposite; we end up spending billions of euro because we fail to do it right initially.  We failed to do it right with the redress board for those involved with Magdalen laundries and with Caranua, that terrible name meaning \"new friend\" when it was really the old enemy.<\/p> <p> As I am over my time, I will finish on that.  I hope the amendments to the Bill will make the process more accountable and put people at its centre.  I hope it is a turning point. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300028#DD00300","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646314200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies for their very detailed and serious consideration of this legislation, which deals with potentially one of the most difficult matters we will see in this session of the Oireachtas.  As the Deputies have said, the legislation is technical and detailed, but when we get back to the essence of what we are doing, it is law that provides for the removal of the remains of infants from a septic tank where they were placed inappropriately.  Words almost fail us sometimes when we speak about the magnitude of the awfulness evident at this site.  I thank Deputies for their detailed consideration of the Bill and acknowledgement of the significant progress made by it.  I thank the Chairman and members of the Oireachtas joint committee for their sustained engagement in helping to bring about these improvements.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, I thank the former residents and family of infants who died or survivors from Tuam and many of the other institutions who have engaged with me so often for as long as I have been in this role.  It is speaking with them and understanding their experiences and perspectives that has inspired me to make changes in this legislation.  I also thank the team in my Department that has worked so hard to make these very significant changes as well.<\/p>  <p>  As I said yesterday, on a number of occasions we have taken on board directly the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee, and on many other occasions we have taken on board the spirit of recommendations and have made significant changes.  I am cognisant that this is complex legislation and there has been criticism of the difficulty in reading or comprehending it.  While we have put forward a plain English version as well, we are dealing with immensely complex matters, particularly in terms of the DNA identification programme, which requires strong legislative protection because of the privacy rights invoked whenever anything with DNA is done.  We should also note that the level to which we shall intervene at this site is a level not previously provided for in Irish law.  That is why the inserted section stating that the intervention must be to international standards is so important.  I hope that demonstrates we are doing absolutely everything we can to investigate these sites.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about the report and we see the fifth option being taken, that is, the most extensive element of intervention.  I have said that and I know it is a matter discussed by Ms Catherine Corless.  Will the agency just look at the tank?  No, it will be able to look at the entire site in Tuam and undertake truthing.  If there are \"anomalies\" in other parts of the site, those elements will be excavated as well.  We are not bringing forward the legislation and putting the focus on this just to do half the job.  I want to make the point again that anywhere there are suspected burials on the site will be excavated.<\/p>  <p>  I am very grateful to Dr. Niamh McCullagh for her engagement with my Department, particularly on the question of forensic investigation.  She had much engagement with my officials on the international standards and how to take the practice of forensic archaeology and express it in legislation.  Her assistance has been highly beneficial and has led to the strengthening of the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  A significant number of matters were raised in the debate today and yesterday and I will try to address a number of them now.<\/p> <p>On Committee Stage we will have the opportunity to address more.  Many Deputies raised the 20 m issue and the issue of land access yesterday.  Hopefully I can provide some degree of clarity on this point.  The legislation is trying to bring some element of balance between the absolute importance of carrying out an intervention and the rights of homeowners in certain situations.  The legislation provides for the director to acquire temporary rights of access to land.  It provides for reasonable compensation and a requirement to restore land to its original condition after the intervention has taken place.  Under the general scheme, the provision was that the Government could not make an order in respect of land on which there was one or more residential dwelling and a director could not seek access to land in residential use where the access would encroach more than 2 m beyond the boundary of the land.  That was a significant limitation.  If there was a suspected burial on a site, and if there was residential land on it, the entire site was basically excluded from the ambit of the Bill.  Many people raised concerns about that.  In response to the recommendations, we have significantly limited that.  Now if there is residential land on a site where there is proposed to be an intervention, that intervention can still take place.  What we are saying is that the intervention cannot come nearer than 20 m from the residential site.  That is to ensure that the very intimate area of a residential home is not being excavated.  Particularly on sites where religious land has been sold and there are large residential developments as well as land that can be investigated, the presence of the residential homes does not remove the entire site from the ambit of the legislation.  That is the first point on residential land.<\/p> <p> Specifically in the case of Tuam, the main site is in public ownership.  We are talking about the memorial garden, the playground and the car park.  That part of the site is all in public ownership.  This residential restriction in terms of the 20 m rule does not apply.  I want to make that very clear.  The 20 m rule will not in any way interfere in Tuam.  As anyone who has been at the Tuam memorial garden knows, it backs immediately onto privately-owned gardens.  This legislation allows for an intervention 2 m into privately-owned land if that is necessary to secure the site.  There is this very large wall in Tuam looming over where we know the tank is.  There may have to be an intervention there to secure the site to make sure the excavation can fully take place.  There is no limitation on intervention in public land.  Where land is residential, there can now be an intervention but not within 20 m of the residential home.  Where the principal burial site is in public land there can be an intervention of up to 2 m in privately owned land around it in order to secure the site.  I hope that gives some clarity.  I see this as a significant improvement.  It was a very legitimate critique that was made of the first Bill and I believe we are implementing and addressing the recommendations coming from the pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS.<\/p> <p> Deputy Canney noted that this does have an impact on homes and people; in Tuam, they are people who may well have helped to keep that site over the years and ensure that at least the memorial garden was respected.  We will engage with that in terms of making sure there is proper consultation where a site is adjacent to privately owned land.  We recognise that.  I will come back to the advisory board.  It does have a member of the local authority and that can help in terms of ensuring that the views of people in the area who may not be relatives or family members are brought into discussions.<\/p> <p> On the link between the coroner and the director of the agency, Deputy Cairns asked why we need this legislation.  That has been asked in the past.  The coroner is an independent public office.  Coroners have a general duty to hold an inquest if they are of the opinion that a death or deaths may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner or happened suddenly and from unknown cause.  The Bill places no restriction on the jurisdiction of the coroner.  The exclusion of the right of the coroner to intervene in certain circumstances - the circumstances were limited but there was an exclusion there in the original draft - has been removed.  I recognise that this has been welcomed.  The Coroners Act 1962 only makes limited provision in respect of the exhumation and removal of a body.  It provides for the Minister for Justice to order an exhumation at the request of the coroner if the coroner is informed by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a death or deaths may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner.<\/p> <p> As we know, the commission's final report on this speaks to issues that were raised yesterday by a number of Deputies in respect of investigations.  The commission's final report was shared with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It considered the report and determined that there was insufficient information available to commence a criminal investigation. However, subsequently, in April of last year, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issued an appeal to anyone with information about crimes at mother and baby institutions to make contact with it in order that such crimes could be investigated where possible.  A number of survivors I have spoken to have engaged with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and those investigations are with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p> Coming back to the point Deputy Connolly was making about the degree of excavation, in 2018 the Government decided that a full forensic-standard excavation, recovery and, if possible, identification of remains across the full available site in Tuam was the most appropriate response.  The Government was at that time advised that there was no legal basis to undertake that degree of work and therefore that legislation - the legislation we are bringing forward now - was required.  This legislation is designed to complement the Coroners Act 1962 by providing a mechanism for guaranteed intervention at the Tuam site.  That is important.  This legislation guarantees that there will be intervention in the Tuam site.  It guarantees that intervention at, I believe, a much higher standard than the Coroners Act provides for at the moment, in this idea that it has to be at international forensic standard.  That is not stated anywhere in existing Irish law.  As the Acting Chair, Deputy Funchion, knows from the concerns raised by family members, they were worried this would not be done in a proper way, that it would just be a removal.  That cannot happen now because of what we have written into this law.<\/p> <p> The Bill does not place any restriction on the jurisdiction of the coroner and will not remove the obligation on the coroner to hold an inquest where such an inquest is required under the 1962 Act and, importantly, where remains show evidence of violent or unnatural death.  The director overseeing the intervention must immediately inform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner within whose district the remains were recovered.  There is a clear obligation if the director becomes aware of violent or unnatural death to inform the coroner and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will talk about the work the director has to do in respect of each set of remains.  In that event, the director has to comply with any directions given to him or her by the coroner or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p> A new provision is added in section 36 whereby the director is required to prepare and publish a report documenting the circumstances of the discovery of the human remains, the forensic excavation and recovery of those human remains and the outcome of post-recovery analysis including, if possible, information on the circumstances and cause of death.  The director will have to provide an examination of each set of remains that has been recovered from the site and provide information, if it is possible to glean it from those remains, about the cause of death.  That will be a publicly available document which can be provided to the coroner.  Should the coroner decide to hold an investigation, that can be an incredibly valuable document in terms of any work the coroner does up to and including an inquest.  <\/p> <p> There is nothing in the legislation that restricts the coroner entering the site at any stage.  The director is not prohibited under the legislation from sharing evidence or data that may be requested of the director by the coroner.<\/p> <p> The membership of the advisory board will include a chairperson, who will be a person who either has been a coroner in this State or has demonstrated expertise in coronial matters.  This person may be from this State or outside it.  He or she must be someone with expertise in this area and who perhaps has been involved in a similar type of excavation and recovery elsewhere.  The board will include two members who have scientific expertise, again to ensure there is forensic and scientific advice being provided at all times.  That was an issue of concern to family members.  The membership will also include someone who is a member of staff of the local authority in which the principal burial site is located, an individual who considers that he or she is a family member of a deceased person believed to be buried at the site and a person who is a former resident of the institution.  If there is no one alive who was formerly resident, there will be two members who are family members of the deceased.  Those two roles are interchangeable but they ensure that there will be two people on the advisory board representing either former residents or family members of those who died in the relevant institution.<\/p> <p> Consultation with the advisory board is required at intervals but there are a number of key decision points at which the director must consult the advisory board, namely, when making arrangements for the forensic excavation, the conducting of post-recovery analysis of remains, providing updates to relatives, stakeholders and the public, and in decisions relating to the continuation or reviewing of an identification programme.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies raised the issue of the substantive reasons for intervention or, potentially, of using memorialisation if it is regarded as more appropriate.  Under the Bill, the Government may make an order where it is satisfied that manifestly inappropriate burials have taken place on lands associated with an institution.  An institution is broadly defined as being a current or former residential facility where a public body has or had a relevant role.  In determining whether burials were manifestly inappropriate, consideration is given to the available evidence, as set out under a number of criteria.  They include whether the remains are uncoffined, if they are buried in a manner that would not have complied with the burial grounds regulations at the applicable time, if they are buried in a way that would not reasonably be considered to provide a dignified internment, or if they are buried collectively and in a manner or location that is repugnant to common decency and would reasonably have been considered so at the time of burial.  The Bill gives the Government the power to intervene in these circumstances.  In making a decision to intervene, it must balance the need for such intervention in a situation where something is manifestly inappropriate with our societal belief in the sanctity of a burial site and the preference to avoid disturbing remains following burial.  That is a difficult and complex issue.  There is a collective agreement on the Tuam site but, as I know from my engagement with survivors of other institutions, there are differing views as to whether there should be an intervention or proper memorialisation.  I recognise that these are difficult points to balance.<\/p> <p> I will talk briefly about the question of family members who can participate the programme.  I have expanded the provisions in this regard from the initial proposal that only first-order relatives, that is, parents, children, siblings and half-siblings, should be included.  We are now including grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nieces and nephews.  The key reason we have not included cousins is a technical issue to do with the share of DNA.  First-order relatives share 50% of DNA with a person who is interred at the sites and second-order relatives share 25%.  When we get to third-order relatives, however, the common DNA is only 12.5%, which gives a dramatically lesser chance of getting successful matches.  We have engaged with experts as to where we have the best chance of achieving identifications.  In terms of the information campaign, third-order relatives will of course have the opportunity to engage with family members who are higher-order relatives and ask them to participate.  That is important because there are large communities impacted by this.  That is why the information campaign is significant in terms of getting greater engagement as early as possible.  The Bill provides for the possibility of future testing, under ministerial regulations, where there are scientific developments.  There may be a better chance of making identifications in the future because of improvements in technology.  It is important to highlight that.<\/p> <p> Deputies referred to a number of sites other than Tuam, principally the Bessborough and Sean Ross Abbey homes.  The commission of investigation concluded it is likely that some of the children who died at Bessborough are buried in the grounds but it was unable to find any physical or documentary evidence of such burials.  I have met with the group representing Bessborough survivors on a number of occasions and, in 2021, I made submissions to both An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Cork County Council in respect of a planning application that covered the area identified as the potential burial site as well as land adjacent to it.  In both cases, those planning applications were rejected.  There are differing views among Bessborough survivors, although there is a strong view towards memorialisation.  I will meet with the Cork survivors group in the near future as part of the Government's ongoing work on Bessborough.  I will speak a little more about memorialisation presently.<\/p> <p> Deputy Martin Browne is not here today but he had questions yesterday about the situation regarding the Sean Ross Abbey home.  The commission's final report included details of a forensic archaeological investigation it commissioned in respect of concerns about how the identified burial site there may have been impacted by drainage works.  The archaeological survey found that the burial grounds had not been impacted by any utilities or drainage work and noted that coffins or evidence of coffins were located with 84% of the remains that were found there.  I am aware of ongoing concerns from survivors, whom I have met, regarding another site outside the main burial site.  I have engaged with them on providing some support in terms of additional work that might be done to gain certainty regarding that adjacent site.  I will meet with the group in the near future to discuss that further.  We continue to engage with relevant groups about relevant sites.<\/p> <p> There were several queries about final arrangements for identified and unidentified remains.  The Bill provides that a director will make final arrangements for human remains as soon as practicable after a familial link has been established or an identification programme has been concluded.  There was concern during pre-legislative scrutiny that remains might stay with the director for a long period even if they had been identified.  There is now a much clearer obligation on the director to provide remains once they have been matched.  Where a familial match has been made, the director will, at the request of family members, either return the remains to them or make arrangements in line with their wishes.  Where a familial link has not been established or an identification programme is not undertaken, the director will make arrangements having regard to the stated wishes of persons who believe they have family members buried at the site.  That is a key element of the Bill.  Where remains are not identified, the director will make the final decision but it will be done in consultation with the advisory board and with wider family groups.  In the case of Tuam, it is likely that there will be both identified and unidentified remains, which means both of these contexts probably will arise.<\/p> <p> Regarding memorialisation and the protection of these sites around the country, a working group has been set up between my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which is looking at that issue as well as other issues to do with how local authorities can support survivors.  That is provided for in the action plan.  The group is looking to provide best practice guidelines on ongoing engagement and liaison support for former residents, support groups and local authorities.  I have engaged directly with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to seek additional central guidance on the importance of local authorities providing specific protections for any burial sites that may be linked to former mother and baby home or county home institutions.<\/p> <p>The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is preparing a circular intended to assist local communities in participating in the local development plan process and encouraging local authorities to incorporate appropriate policies on burial sites into development plans.  It is intended that this circular will be issued in quarter 1 of this year.  That is an important step in allowing local authorities to provide for the protection of sites within their functional areas.<\/p> <p> Deputy Connolly asked about the ability to get information and the reference to \"public body\".  In the definition section, the term \"information source\" refers to a person who is the holder, controller or processor of information.  That is a very wide definition and we believe it covers public institutions but also private ones, such as those remarked upon by the Deputy.  We believe that is covered.<\/p> <p> On the issue of the adjudicator, an adjudicator is a body set up to review a decision of a director not to allow somebody to participate in the DNA identification process or review a decision of a director that a familial link has not been established by the DNA process.  Under the original legislation, the director appointed the adjudicator.  The adjudicator was appointed by the person he was making the adjudication upon.  That is not appropriate so the adjudicator will now be appointed by me and be separate from the director.  Those are the two key roles the adjudicator will undertake.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputies for their engagement on this legislation.  It is incredibly important that we advance this, recognising, as Deputy Connolly outlined in great detail, the long time that relatives and former residents of the Tuam home have waited to see a resolution for the site, to have the remains of children recovered, to have all efforts made to identify them and to return their remains to family members so they can receive a dignified burial.  That is what we are seeking to do in this legislation.  We will continue to work to develop it and I will continue to engage with Deputies on Committee Stage, listening and always seeking to improve the legislation, conscious that survivors are waiting for us to pass it so action may take place.  It is incumbent on us all, after such a long period, to achieve this finally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300030#FF00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646316000,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Committee Report on Key Issues Affecting the Traveller Community: Statements","time":1646316000,"counter":330,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300033#JJ00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1646316000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, as he cannot attend.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcomhchoiste as an tuarasc&aacute;il th&aacute;bhachtach.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on the important report on key issues affecting the Traveller community.  I thank the committee members and its Chair, Senator Eileen Flynn, for their comprehensive report, which raises many key issues and also makes several important recommendations that will involve work across several Departments.  The Minister had good engagement with the committee in November and is aware that it consulted Traveller and Roma groups widely, in addition to Departments and other interested stakeholders.<\/p><p>I am aware that many committee members have been engaged in work to support the Traveller and Roma communities over many years.  We all agree that Travellers and Roma have long suffered from negative stereotypes and discrimination.  The Government is committed to ensuring full equality of opportunity for Travellers and Roma and removing barriers to their full and equal participation in Irish life.<\/p><p>As Members will be aware, the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS, provides a framework for action on Traveller and Roma issues.It represents a whole-of-government approach and brings Departments and agencies together with representatives of Traveller and Roma communities to focus on key issues in a structured way.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, chairs the NTRIS steering committee, whose next meeting is scheduled for the end of March.  The programme for Government commits to a review of the strategy and the Minister is committed to working with stakeholders to review what has been achieved and develop new approaches, as necessary, with a particular focus on implementation and measurement.  The objectives of all our equality strategies remain largely relevant.  The key challenge is to ensure better delivery.<\/p><p>The issue of intersectionality also needs to be addressed more coherently.  We know, for instance, that the issues facing Traveller women and girls are different from those facing Traveller men and boys.  In this context, we need to see how the successor strategy to the national strategy for women and girls can work in tandem with NTRlS's successor strategy to focus on particular issues for Traveller women and girls.  The strategy committee's role will be pivotal in developing the consultation process and the content for the successor strategy.  The successor strategy will not represent change for the sake of change.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will listen carefully to stakeholders to ascertain what they advise.  The advice provided by Traveller and Roma organisations will directly shape the scope and focus of the next strategy.  The recommendations contained in the report of the special Oireachtas committee will also inform the next iteration of NTRIS.  The support of all Departments will be crucial in ensuring the successor strategy will have a more outcomes-focused approach.<\/p><p>I reiterate the Government's commitment to supporting action to ensure that Travellers and Roma can participate equally and fully in Irish society.  While there have been some improvements, more remains to be done.  Again, on behalf of the Minister, I thank the committee for its report.<\/p><p>The Chair will know that both of us have worked with the Traveller community in our constituencies for many years.  Based on my having read the summary recommendations of the report, I commend the committee's Chairman, Senator Flynn, and its members on what is a really comprehensive report with a targeted and focused set of actions to be implemented.  In a speech I made following the issuing of the No End in Site report of the Ombudsman for Children's Office, I said that among Traveller families I know in my community and my Traveller friends, it is accepted that little, if anything, will ever change.  Now and then, there is a breakthrough when we celebrate someone going to third level education but these events are rare.  In that regard, it is critical that we address the findings of the report at a whole-of-government level and right across the Houses of the Oireachtas and work with all partner agencies and the Traveller and Roma communities to achieve the transformation.  I feel very strongly about it.<\/p><p>We see persistent discrimination, including at political level when there is intervention in housing allocations.  We see Traveller families, particularly young Travellers, hiding themselves from view rather than celebrating their heritage and culture.  As Minister of State with responsibility for heritage, I worked with the Heritage Council to develop the post of an intercultural heritage officer whose job would be to work with the Traveller and Roma communities.  We saw some really positive outcomes of that during Heritage Week last year.  I really feel that part of the process will involve focusing on celebrating Traveller culture, heritage and music.  In many ways, the Traveller community saved a lot of Irish traditional music through the oral tradition and language and its really deep traditions.  From this perspective, we need to tackle collectively the discrimination that takes place at every level in society.  The outcomes for young Travellers have not changed all that much in 20 years in this country.  We see this in housing, educational attainment and mental health.<\/p> <p> Report after report has recommended the way forward in the context of how we try to address this matter.  I feel that very little is changing in a real sense.  The Government is deeply committed to trying to resolve these issues.  People across this House are deeply committed to trying to resolve it with the Traveller community.<\/p> <p> I welcome the report.  I thank Senator Flynn and the members of the committee for the work that they put into it.  I hope that we can constructively work together to try to address the discrimination and the life outcomes for the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300033#JJ00400","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646316600,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for taking the time out to allow me to address the House.  I thank Deputies for the opportunity and for allowing me to be here on what is a historical day.  I welcome my little girl, Billie, who is in the Gallery.  Just before I came into the Chamber, one of the ushers told me that I should remember that I am not here for nothing and that I am here because I deserve to be here.  I thought that was a lovely comment for him to make when I was coming in.<\/p>  <p>  I want to start by speaking about the report.  That is more important than me being invited to speak in the Chamber today.  It is about the report.  I thank Deputies for inviting me to address the House today on what I hope will be a life-changing report for many Travellers.  The final report of the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community is the work of many.  Most importantly, however, the report was inspired by contributions from Travellers.  National and local Traveller organisations and activists dedicated ourselves to many battles on the future for the Traveller community to ensure it has more equality of opportunity in Irish society.<\/p>  <p>  I was elected Chairperson of the joint committee on 19 November 2020.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was elected vice chairman.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v again for all of his hard work and determination in working with us in the Traveller community over many years.  The committee was built on the important work of the previous committee, chaired by former Senator Colette Kelleher.  The committee made 84 recommendations in four areas, namely: health, including physical and mental health; education, particularly second and third level education; employment; and accommodation.  If the recommendations in this report are implemented, and I believe they must be, the committee and all of us in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad will be part of ensuring a better future for Travellers.  That is something for us to be very proud of.<\/p>  <p>  Before I speak any further on the report, I would like to formally welcome to the Gallery representatives from the Irish Network Against Racism, the Irish Traveller Movement, AkiDwA, Pavee Point, the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, the Muslim Sisters of &Eacute;ire, the Amal Women's Association, the National Traveller Mental Health Network, Exchange House and the National Traveller Women's Forum.  I believe that civil society organisations play a key role in society.  I thank the organisations represented for their work and for being here today.  I also thank my husband, Liam Whyte, and my friend, Damien Peelo, for being in the Gallery to support me in giving this speech today.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, the joint committee's report includes 84 recommendations on four critical areas.  The vast majority of the recommendations are not new.  They just have not been implemented.  We are looking for inclusive education and delivered health services, particularly in relation to mental health.  We have all seen that the authorities have not provided appropriate Traveller accommodation.  Oversight structures must be put in place and implemented to ensure that safe and culturally appropriate accommodation is provided for Travellers and families.  We have been asking for these consistently.  As the Minister of State said, over the years there have been many reports that highlighted the challenges that Travellers face in these areas, including the Oireachtas report.  We are still here today discussing the recommendations.  I cannot say enough in this speech how important and key the implementation of recommendations is.  At the time of the launch of the report, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and I said that nothing will change unless the recommendations are implemented.  Most importantly, a lack of action will mean the loss of hope for many Travellers and generations to come.<\/p>  <p>  I almost hesitate to mention some of the recommendations because they are all very important.  Still, some provide structure for change and will finally bring Travellers the services and support that we deserve as a community.  We must establish a national Traveller accommodation authority to oversee the development and implementation of Traveller accommodation policy.  The current system, whereby local authorities provide accommodation for Travellers, too often has not worked for Travellers.  Time and time again, we see local authorities underspend on their allocated funding for the Traveller community.  Between 2018 and 2019, there was an underspend of more than &euro;72 million in local authorities in funding for Traveller accommodation.  Yet the needs of Travellers regarding accommodation remain as serious as ever.  Who will be held to account for families who are living in overcrowded or unsafe accommodation or who are homeless?  The call for a national Traveller accommodation authority has been made many times over the years.  The call was also made by the Traveller accommodation expert review group in 2019.  The Minister committed to it then.  Now, it is time to see it through.<\/p>  <p>  What I will say next is the most important part of this whole speech, and it must be listened to and heard in this House.  Young Travellers within the Traveller community are dying by suicide every day.  There must be a stand-alone national Traveller mental health strategy with a ring-fenced budget.  There must be a clear timeline of implementation and delivery for it.  We need a Traveller mental health steering group that is run in partnership with stakeholders and, most importantly, with Travellers.  The recommendation that a national Traveller mental health strategy should be developed and implemented is not new.  The Government promised a national Traveller mental health strategy in the programme for Government.  Only a stand-alone strategy will turn the tide on the Traveller mental health crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I was delighted and proud last year to see the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018 be passed by the D&aacute;il thanks to my colleague, Deputy Pringle.  I thank the former Senator Colette Kelleher and my Civil Engagement Group colleagues for bringing it through the Seanad.  That Bill is now on Committee Stage.  The Bill must be implemented as soon as possible.  Not only must it be implemented, but it must be representative of the Traveller community.  It must be implemented in our Irish education system as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The fourth important recommendation of the report is to ensure that we continue to move forward the commitments and the recommendations that the Houses of the Oireachtas made through the committee established to oversee the issues faced by Travellers.  This includes monitoring implementation and recommendations, and delivering a follow-up strategy to the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, as well as looking at other areas that impact on Travellers' lives.  We cannot just live in hope that things will get better for the Traveller community.  We have to implement the recommendations that are already there.<\/p>  <p>  When I was thinking about what I would say today, I thought of the great John Hume, who spoke gracefully of the vital importance of people working together for a better future.  I am a strong believer in solidarity and allyship.  I base my activism around it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300034#KK00200","nonspeaker":"Senator Eileen Flynn"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646317200,"counter":334,"content":"<p>When John Hume accepted the Nobel Peace Prize, he said:<\/p><p>This is what we want as Travellers.  This is what we all want in Irish society.  We cannot continue to deny opportunities to people within communities and we cannot deny opportunities to the Traveller community because that has been done for generations.  Now it is time for us all to move forward together.  We have to let bygones be bygones and we need to move forward together.  All of us in both Houses must take responsibility for ensuring the recommendations become action.\r\n\r\nPeople who know me on a personal level will be aware that I come from a family of wheeling and dealing, if you like, at markets and so on.  We would always ask, &quot;Would you put your name to it?&quot; if we were about to buy or do something.  My question to every Deputy present in this House is: will they put their names to this report?  Will they put their names to these 84 recommendations, or even just to the four I spoke about today in this House?  The work is not over; it is just beginning.  Let us build on that.  It is as great as all of our dreams allow.  We all have the answers; it is about implementation.  \r\n\r\nTravellers play an equal part of Irish society.

Let us be part of that better change by making sure Travellers have a better future.  We in the Traveller community do not have the power; the Government has it.

I also wish to thank the members of the Travelling community in Dublin, Cork and Galway for welcoming us into their communities and homes and being so generous with their time.  I welcome our visitors in the Public Gallery.<\/p>  <p>  This report contains 84 recommendations across the areas of health, education, housing and employment.  The Acting Chairman is probably happy to know that I do not have time to speak to all those sections, but my colleagues will touch on some of the recommendations later.  There are 18 recommendations relating to housing.  Recommendations 68 to 71, inclusive, highlight the need for a national audit of living conditions and safety concerns on all Traveller-specific sites.  These must be addressed.  On one of my visits, Deputy Joan Collins and I met a man who invited us into his home.  When we went in, the man had to advise us where to stand because the floors were ready to give way.  The windows were rattling.  There was mould and damp all over his home.  The sockets were burnt out.  Would any of the Members present live in those conditions?  The man told us all he wanted was somewhere safe to which he could bring his grandchildren.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 74 suggests that a national Traveller accommodation body should be established to oversee Traveller accommodation policy.  Traveller organisations have been calling for this for years.  The committee heard from many witnesses who spoke about discrimination faced by the Traveller community in trying to access housing.  There is no doubt that is why they are over-represented in the homeless figures.  The State has an appalling history in delivering culturally appropriate accommodation for Travellers.  We have seen council budgets go unspent even though there was an obvious need for accommodation.  Local authorities must do much more to deliver on this.<\/p>  <p>  In the section on education, recommendations 22 and 23 point to the need for the restoration of Traveller funding in the context of education.  That funding was cut in 2011 and 2012.  The report recommends that targeted resources be made available for Traveller children in mainstream education.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, needs to make sure the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018 is enacted.  We require a national Traveller education strategy, as suggested in recommendation 24 and 32.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to implement this report.  It cannot sit on a shelf, gathering dust like all other reports.  The Government has a duty of care to the Traveller community across all Departments.

The report found that nearly 80% of Travellers surveyed in south Dublin stated either they or someone in their family had suffered from depression.  This compares with just 8% of the general population.  The report identified the factors impacting negatively on Traveller mental health as loneliness, discrimination, drug addiction, family break-up, children's mental health and financial hardships.  Why do I mention that?  It is 2022 and the findings of the report before the House show that very little has changed since 2019.  I acknowledge the work of the Oireachtas committee in producing the report.  In particular, I thank the Chairman, Senator Flynn, my colleagues Deputies Ellis and Mitchell, and the Vice Chairman, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.<\/p>  <p>  The report outlines there is a crisis in mental health in the Traveller community.  I note that 90% of Travellers agreed that mental health problems were common in their community, with suicide being the cause of 11% of Traveller deaths.  I will repeat that.  Suicide is the cause of 11% of Traveller deaths.  That is seven times higher than the rate among the general population.  While we can all get lost in statistics, behind each one of those percentages there is a man, woman or child with hopes, dreams and aspirations just like anybody else.  As Senator Flynn stated, we need a national strategy for Traveller mental health and we need to have all the underpinning requirements in that strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The report outlines the causes and conditions affecting mental health within the Traveller community.  Travellers experience racism and exclusion daily.  Deficient and substandard living conditions such as those referred to by Deputy Mitchell, as well as precarious accommodation and homelessness, have a severe detrimental impact on mental health.  Lower educational outcomes have a damaging impact on employment opportunities, while chronic unemployment then leads to negative consequences on mental health.<\/p>  <p>  In my previous role, which involved working with people from marginalised communities, I had a lot of engagement with Exchange House.  It delivers mental health supports in a culturally appropriate way to the Traveller community.  One of the recommendations of the report is that increased funding should be provided for the delivery of peer-led Traveller-specific mental health supports through the Traveller primary healthcare team.  I know the work the Traveller primary healthcare team does in my area.  It is one of the unsung groups that were not recognised during Covid.  It was at the forefront, going into the Traveller community to deliver healthcare and advice, including in respect of Covid, and it needs to be recognised for that. <\/p>  <p>  We also need projects in local areas to provide timely interventions in the context of poor Traveller mental health.<\/p> <p>Early intervention is key.  We need to have things in place for young Traveller men and women in respect of suicide prevention, as has been mentioned.  I am a bit like Senator Flynn, as I am a wheeler dealer and she has my word that I will be putting my name to this report.  I congratulate her and all of our colleagues again on such a fabulous report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300035#LL00400","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646317800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I will start by thanking Senator Flynn and all of the members on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community for both their hard work and for this very important report.  I would also like to acknowledge the fact the Government gave time to Senator Flynn to speak with us today.  I hope this is not the last time that she speaks on this issue on behalf of the Government.  If she got to speak on its behalf more often, Traveller public policy would be in a much better place.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the hard work of all of the organisations: Traveller, equality and anti-racist groups in the Gallery because if it were not for their work, many of the issues that we are talking about today would not be in the public arena at all.  I hope the Government acknowledges and continues to fund them and to increase their funding.<\/p>  <p>  As my party&rsquo;s housing spokesperson, I want to clearly say that I put my name to every single one of the 18 recommendations specifically relating to accommodation in the report, and in doing so I put the name of our party.  They are eminently sensible, most of them are not new and they should be implemented as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  There is a problem, however, because many years ago the Government commissioned a report on Traveller accommodation.  Professor Michelle Norris undertook the study on behalf of the Housing Agency and it was published in 2017.  That led to the formation of another group, the expert group on Traveller accommodation in 2018, and almost three years ago it made 32 separate recommendations to Government to tackle the very issues that this report, which we are discussing today, identifies.  The overwhelming majority of those recommendations have not been implemented.  There is no point in us sitting here today calling for the implementation of the recommendations of the new report when the outstanding recommendations in its predecessor remain on the shelf.  In fact, some of the most substantive recommendations of that report are not even in the pipeline.  We have to deal with Part 8 planning applications and with section 183 land transfers and ensure that Traveller accommodation programmes have a statutory binding implementation plan.  We need an agency above the local authorities and independent of Government to ensure that where local authorities and Government are in dereliction of their plans, then responsibility for implementation of those plans is transferred to that agency to ensure their full implementation.<\/p>  <p>  In the few seconds I have left I want to speak briefly about the spending on Traveller accommodation.  I acknowledge that under the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, for two years in a row the Traveller accommodation budget has been spent in full.  That is new, is welcome and deserves credit.  The problem is that the budget is too small and the money that is being spent is not tackling the core issues.  If one looks at the most recent figures of the Department, a tiny number of new units of Traveller-specific accommodation have been delivered while a large number of local authorities are still spending nothing on either upgrading existing facilities or on providing new facilities.  We do not, therefore, just need the legislative policy changes but we need a commitment from Government to dramatically increase the funding for the direct provision of culturally appropriate Traveller accommodation.  If the Government does that, it will have willing partners and supporters on these sides of the benches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300036#MM00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646317800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Lahart who I believe is a sharing with Deputy Leddin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300036#MM00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1646317800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak today.  I congratulate Senator Flynn not only on her contribution to the report but on her contribution to the Seanad.<\/p>  <p>  In no particular order, I was struck by a number of things.  I served as a county councillor on South Dublin County Council along with Deputies Ward and &Oacute; Broin, although I was there before either of them.  As such I was very fortunate to work under one of the most exemplary public servants on this issue and other issues, the late Joe Horan, who was chief executive of that council and transformed it in so many ways.  The reason I think of him was that one of the points raised here was about public bodies doing more in regard to the employment of Travellers.  The late Mr. Horan led the way on that.  It was not just in respect of Travellers but those with disabilities also.  He always did more than was required of him under law as a chief executive in employing percentages of both in the council.  They were visible and worked in County Hall in Tallaght.  There is a beautiful park, Se&aacute;n Keating Garden, adjacent to Rathfarnham Castle commemorating the life of this artist who was quite active in painting on behalf of the State and left an artistic legacy behind him, particularly in places like Ballyroan church and in other areas.  All of the masonry work carried out in Se&aacute;n Keating Garden, which I would invite anybody who is passing Rathfarnham Castle to visit, was carried out by members of the Traveller community who were employed by South Dublin County Council.  South Dublin County Council is unique in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  There are, to the best of my knowledge, no Travellers employed in the Houses of the Oireachtas but I could be wrong.  One could go far to find Travellers employed in any Government Department.  If Joe Horan could do it in South Dublin County Council, there is no reason every chief executive of every local authority in this country could not do it.  That is a challenge and something I will sign up to.  It is one of the points that has been made.<\/p>  <p>  On living conditions, there is a particular Traveller accommodation in my constituency which I visited just before the Covid-19 pandemic.  It has one of the best views of Dublin and is on the foothills of the Dublin Mountains.  There are ten homes there but only five of them were occupied at the time that I visited for reasons beyond my understanding.  The people who live in that accommodation are denied that view of Dublin Bay, Dublin city, the Pigeon House and all of the other sites one can see because of the fortress wall built around it.  For the ten or 15 minutes I was there, I must say that I felt quite claustrophobic.  I asked our director of housing in South Dublin County Council, another very good man, would he not consider creating some kind of visual gaps in this wall so that when people walk out of the front door in the morning, they are not just looking at masonry but have a wider view to take in.<\/p>  <p>  Many people are going to dwell on particular points in the report but I just want to make a point about different local authorities carrying out and fulfilling their responsibilities.  In South Dublin County Council, since I was elected in 1999, all of the councillors - it was a 26 member body then - tended to stick together and support each other when it came to the provision of Traveller accommodation and as a result there was a good and balanced spread of Traveller accommodation in each and every electoral ward in the county.  We tended to spend the budget that was given to us.  That was not and is not the same in adjacent counties.  One of the scandals that was referred to earlier, but obviously it is changing, is of local authorities not spending the allocated amount they given for Traveller accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  One of the things I would like noted is that a local authority cannot do this by itself but it can assist settled residential communities by providing a framework and structure for both of these communities to meet because they never meet and yet their children meet and play together in school and do all of the things children do in school.  The adult communities, however, never meet and there is a real fear, bias and stereotyping that prevents them from meeting.  It is only through meeting and communicating that those stereotypes and biases will be broken down.<\/p>  <p>  I remember bringing this to a service we have in south Dublin, South Dublin County Mediation Service, as a particular issue had arisen, and the service was very enthusiastic about playing a particular role and getting involved in this.<\/p>  <p>  I see Deputy Leddin has arrived and I was speaking as though all of the time was mine.  My apologies to my colleague for that.  There are things I wanted to say around the mental health piece and so on but the point I wish to finish on is the Joe Horan piece.  If we had more chief executives in charge of county councils like the late Joe Horan, Travellers would be in a much better position as would society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300036#MM00400","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1646318400,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lahart.  First, I welcome the chairperson of the committee, Senator Flynn, to the House.  She is an activist, a fighter for human rights and a role model not just for the Traveller community but for all society.  I welcome the visitors in the Visitors Gallery.  Senator Flynn spoke very eloquently.  I was watching the proceedings in my office and watched and heard the round of applause.  It was very well deserved.  She has produced a report that gets through to people like me, who are not of her community and who are privileged in our society.  From my reading of the report so far, and I will get through all of it, that is a fundamental success of the report.  I also commend the committee.  I understand it is a very hard-working committee.  Under Senator Flynn's guidance the committee conducted extensive research, visited sites around the country and engaged with stakeholders in the production of the report.<\/p>  <p>  From my reading of the report, I can see that Travellers have been moved to the edges of our society.  They have been physically separated and socially excluded.  They have been excluded from policy and decision making on issues that affect them.  They have been subject to persistent disadvantage and segregation.  The road to formal recognition was long, and the official recognition as an indigenous ethnic minority in 2017 was long overdue.  The progress to full inclusion and acceptance of Traveller identity and culture in this country is slow.  As Senator Flynn said, there have been numerous reports and studies produced which have highlighted the difficulties and challenges faced by the Traveller community.  Unfortunately, it is clear that these have not succeeded in improving conditions in Travellers' lives.  I believe this report, by making that point, will have an effect because Senator Flynn has captured that fundamental failure in how we have treated Travellers in this society since the foundation of the State.<\/p>  <p>  I read the executive summary.  I do not have time to go into it now, but it is incredibly compelling.  I encourage everybody to read it.  It is stark.  I could go on about the shorter life expectancy of Travellers, the suicide rates, the low educational attainment and the underspend of local authorities, at &euro;72 million, in the last decade.  This points to a fundamental failure of our society to help the Traveller community to integrate, succeed and flourish.  As I do not have any more time, I will conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300037#NN00100","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1646318400,"counter":343,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Lahart, we certainly have had members of the Traveller community working in the House, although sadly not enough.

It is great that everyone is here.  I also welcome this comprehensive report on the Traveller community.  Senator Flynn, as chairperson of the committee, has done a marvellous job in the committee.  She has been outstanding.  In addition, the members of the committee have been very good across the board.  The commitment to make this report possible has been massive and everybody has had a major input into it.  I thank all those who made submissions to the committee.  We had a very broad range of submissions from across the community, local authorities, Departments and groups and organisations as diverse as sporting organisations, the Prison Service, community activists and medical organisations and, most important, the Traveller organisations and their community.<\/p>  <p>  The voice of Travellers is rarely heard and rarely given a platform to express Travellers' concerns.  This committee has given members of the Traveller community a great opportunity to have a voice and to have a part in what is being produced.  The number of Traveller organisations that actively engaged with the committee is impressive.  They gave us a great insight into the difficulties that the community faces each day.  They were articulate in explaining their concerns and outlining what needs to be done for their community.<\/p>  <p>  This report follows other reports from previous years.  There are recommendations and observations in this report that are not necessarily new.  They have appeared in previous reports but were never acted on.  That is a real concern.  Good work has been done previously, but we found in our discussions with Traveller groups that the concerns they expressed in previous years still pertain today.  My hope is that the recommendations in this report will be fully implemented and followed up.<\/p>  <p>  We witnessed at first hand many of the issues in the different areas.  We visited various sites, such as Carrowbrowne in Galway, Spring Lane in Cork and St. Margaret's and Labre Park in Dublin.  I am more familiar with St. Margaret's and the halting site in St. Joseph's Park in Finglas.  The concerns I have seen in the halting sites in my constituency of Dublin North-West mirror the concerns throughout the country.  On occasions, it was very depressing to see some of the conditions and the problems facing the Traveller community.  We have to admit as a society that discrimination still exists.  It is common for many Traveller families and individuals to encounter discrimination daily.  That is totally unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  There are 84 recommendations in this report.  It is up to us as public representatives and members of the Traveller community and of the community to push these recommendations and force the Government to act.  This is a very worthwhile report and I hope we get full support across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300037#NN00300","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speech","time":1646318400,"counter":345,"content":"<p>First, I thank and commend Senator Flynn, in her capacity as chairperson of the Joint Committee on Key Issues Affecting the Traveller Community, all the members of the committee and the wider participants on creating this vital report that so starkly presents not only the inequalities but also the structural violence faced by Irish Travellers.  I also acknowledge the ferocity in the call in the report to act on the 84 recommendations.  The Social Democrats will absolutely put our name to it.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that I will not be able to talk about all the elements of the report in five minutes.  As somebody who is passionate about education, I am particularly focused on that aspect.  However, I will briefly mention some of the statistics relating to health, mental health, suicide rates and housing inequalities that I believe encapsulate the structural violence that is faced every day by members of the Traveller community.  Life expectancy in the Traveller community is 15.1 years shorter for men and 11.5 years shorter for women than it is among the wider public.  The infant mortality rate for Traveller children is 3.6 times the rate for the general population.  Irish Traveller mothers are by far the most over-represented group who suffer perinatal deaths.  Despite this, there is little specific mention of this in the national maternity strategy and no mention of it in the national maternity strategy implementation plan.<\/p>  <p>  Some 90% of Travellers agreed that mental health problems were common in their community, and suicide is the cause of 11% of Traveller deaths, which is six times higher than is the case in the general population.  The report of the Ombudsman for Children, \"No End in Site\", highlighted the deplorable living conditions in one halting site, where there were approximately 140 people using toilets and washing facilities designed for 40 people, leading to stress, tension and, inevitably at times, conflict.  Today, it is even more disheartening, but not surprising, that a statement issued by the Council of Europe's European Commission against Racism and Intolerance states that there has been no major improvement in the living conditions of Travellers over the past three years.  The pandemic has encapsulated and placed a spotlight on many worrying inequalities, and in the intersectionality of that we see the oppression once more of the Traveller community.  It is very clear that this comes down to a form of structural violence, a system if not designed for but certainly apathetic to the plight of people in the Traveller community, and which for generations forced oppression on that community.<\/p>  <p>  I often speak in this Chamber about participation in, and access to, education.<\/p> <p>There are those who will never know how easy their journey through the formal education system has been and there are those who face so many barriers to participation that they are essentially pushed out.  Those who are pushed out are made to believe they are the problem and not that the system has failed them.  I often speak about the postcode lottery and how stark the differences are between wealthy areas and low-income areas.  That pales in comparison to the attrition rates for Travellers in education due to a system designed to oppress.  The 2016 census, the most recent census we have, showed that 13% of Travellers attained higher secondary level or more compared to more than 70% in the more general population.  A total of 17.7% of Traveller children have no education in comparison to 1.4% of the general population.<\/p> <p> In 2016 only 167 Irish Travellers had the opportunity to avail of a third level qualification.  As someone who has availed of access programmes I know in a small way what it is like to be considered a target group because of presupposed disadvantage.  I acknowledge how exceptional these 167 students are and the others who have gone through the journey since 2016.  They should absolutely not be the exception to the rule as is the case.  Everyone should have the chance to succeed and progress in our education system.  We cannot be satisfied with a few succeeding against the odds.  We have to change the very system itself.<\/p> <p> Given these facts, it always riles me when there is talk about the education system being a meritocracy.  As it stands, it has the main aim of reproducing and reinforcing existing inequalities.  The reality of these statistics demonstrates a culture in the State of low expectations for Traveller students.  Pavee Point has stated that funding for Traveller education supports were cut by 86.6% between 2008 and 2013, compared to a 4.3% cut in overall Government spending.  Much of this reduction was made in the name of mainstreaming without carefully monitoring the situation to ensure the same educational outcomes and interventions, with additional support if and when needed.<\/p> <p> There is a consistent idea that if we treat everyone the same despite their differences, this somehow represents true equality.  This is absolutely false.  It sets many people up to fail.  There is no inevitability that Traveller life, health, educational and employment outcomes should be so starkly contrasted to those in the wider population.  We can and must act to change this.  As Senator Flynn stated in the foreword of the report, recognising differences while being treated equally is what is being asked.  The 84 recommendations of the report need to be implemented.  Otherwise it will become inevitable by design and by will that the continued repression and structural violence faced by the Traveller community will continue.  The Social Democrats absolutely put our name to the 84 recommendations in the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300037#NN00400","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646319000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the opportunity to discuss the report.  It is particularly timely and fitting that it is discussed in the week we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the declaration of Traveller ethnicity.  It was extremely important, symbolically and otherwise, in the history of the State to officially recognise the contribution Travellers have made to our society.<\/p>  <p>  The report lays out in stark terms what we all knew before we read it, which is that there is a persistent and systemic problem in how the State treats an ethnic community within the State.  I agree with Deputy Leddin.  It is a report that deserves to be read because it gives a window and insight into the lived experiences of Travelling people in our society.  It is something we should acknowledge and face up to.<\/p>  <p>  Members will know that before I arrived in Leinster House, I was a primary school teacher.  Members might not know that in the primary school history curriculum for senior class groups there is a strand on continuity and change over time.  It has a suggested unit dealing with nomadism.  When I was putting together a unit of work on it for my sixth class group I could find any amount of material on African peoples who are nomadic and any amount of information on indigenous peoples in Australia who are still nomadic.  Throughout all of the textbooks available to me I could find one paragraph that dealt with the Travelling community in Ireland.  How must it feel as a child from the Travelling community in our classrooms to experience this level of invisibility in our society?  Try as I might, I could not find a good quality resource that I could bring to my sixth class to teach them about an ethnic group that exists in our own country.  In this regard I very much welcome the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill, to which Senator Flynn made reference.  The inclusion of Traveller culture and history in the school curriculum would have a huge positive effect.  Travellers would feel seen in our classrooms.  It would help us to celebrate in a positive way the contribution Travellers have made to our culture.<\/p>  <p>  I will take a slightly different approach because the Chair and members of the committee are present and they know the report in-depth with a detail that I do not have.  I want to apply the lens of the sustainable development goals to this area and the committee's report.  We wear the nice shiny badge and it looks very well on the lapel.  Often we think the sustainable development goals are something that happen overseas and far away from us.  We might have an idea of the 17 goals but I do not know how often we dig down into the sub-targets beneath the goals.  I propose to do this in the time I have.<\/p>  <p>  Goal No. 1, which calls for no hunger, sets out a target addressing poverty.  I do not for a moment suggest that every child who turned up in my classroom hungry in the morning came from the Travelling community.  This is absolutely not the case.  Often the backgrounds of the children who turned up hungry would surprise people.  We know there is an issue with poverty rates in our Travelling community.  This needs to be addressed.  I do not think we are meeting this sustainable development goal in our State.<\/p>  <p>  Goal No. 3 is about good health and well-being.  The report sets this out in the clearest terms, as Deputy Gannon stated.  We know that life expectancy for men in the Travelling community is 15.1 years shorter and for women it is 11 and a half years shorter than for people in the settled community.  We know about the infant mortality rate.  It is 3.6 times higher in the Travelling community then it is in the settled community.  This is completely unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  We also know there is a mental health crisis in the Travelling community.  We know that suicide is the cause of 11% of Traveller deaths.  We know where it comes from.  We know Travellers live in a society where racism is ingrained and, worse, is accepted.  This should not be the case.  I can absolutely understand the pressure.  I know it is particularly young men in the Travelling community who take their own lives.  There are also wider health implications.  Mortality rates for cancer, cardiovascular disease and others causes of death are also significantly higher.  I do not believe we have vindicated this goal in the State.<\/p>  <p>  As for the goal on quality education, Senator Flynn serves on the education committee with me.  The report states Travellers have severely worse education outcomes than the general population with lower retention and completion rates.  We know education is the key to unlocking so much in our society.  It tackles all of the other things.  It tackles mental health issues.  It tackles persistent poverty rates.  It allows people to reach places they may not otherwise reach.<\/p>  <p>  Goal No. 6 is to ensure clean water and sanitation.  Recently I heard Senator Flynn speak on radio about wearing white socks to the school.  I thought about the temporary halting site on the Green Road, which is about half a mile from where I grew up.  I thought about the level of sanitation available there.  I thought about the difficulty for mothers to send their children to school clean.  When the children do not turn up to the school clean, what do they face?  How does that make them feel when they arrive?  That such a developed country does not meet these standards of sanitation and clean water for a section of our population is an indictment.<\/p>  <p>  Goal No. 8 is about decent work and economic growth.  With regard to labour market participation, the report found that just over 80% of Travellers in the labour force were unemployed.  A total of 43% of travellers reported discrimination when seeking employment, while only 17% of the public stated they would employ a Traveller.  This very much goes to what the Ceann Comhairle spoke about and the responsibility that rests on all of us.<\/p>  <p>  Goal No. 10 to be achieved by 2030 is to reduce inequalities by empowering and promoting the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, economic or other status.<\/p> <p>Senator Flynn said that, as she came in here, one of the ushers told her she very much deserved to be here on her own merit.  I have seen how she has contributed on the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and how, with that lens and lived understanding, she has informed the work of the committee.  We see how the representation of diverse communities adds to these Houses of the Oireachtas.  I commend Senator Flynn on the excellent work she and all members of the committee have undertaken.  As Deputy Leddin said, it is a report that richly deserves to be read and which provides insight into a community that has so far been poorly represented in our democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300038#OO00200","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646319600,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh very much for those words of wisdom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300039#PP00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1646319600,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I welcome Senator Flynn and commend her, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and all other members of the committee on their important work.  I am delighted to get a chance to talk about this report on the key issues facing the Traveller community.  I will quickly commend all of those who work in the Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group who have been on the ground working with vulnerable families and individuals, providing food parcels, personal protective equipment and support throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Just before the pandemic, Councillor Breda Hanaphy and I, along with Colette from the Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group, went around and visited the Traveller sites in Dublin 15, the Dublin West area.  I challenge any Minister to visit these sites and see the conditions people are living in.  To say they are appalling would be an understatement.  For a Traveller community, \"temporary\" means 20 years or more.  I will focus on one site I visited, located at St. Brigid's Lawn, which is ten minutes away from my house.  There is a litany of issues there, including emergency health and safety issues and other long-term issues.  St. Brigid's Lawn is on Porterstown Road in Clonsilla.  It has been 30 years since the residents were moved from a site on Grove Road in Blanchardstown, which is ironically now the site of the head offices of Fingal County Council.  Following long and difficult negotiations, a limited number of issues have been addressed but others have not.  The day units are nothing short of a disgrace.  The overcrowding on this site leaves it a Carrickmines tragedy waiting to happen.  <\/p>  <p>  These families live in St. Brigid's Lawn, which is covered in the Kellystown local area plan.  In the coming years, 1,000 new houses and apartments are to be built along with schools, community facilities and sports facilities.  I tried to use the local area plan, and Councillor Hanaphy tried to use the county development plan, to ensure that, when Kellystown is being developed, the existing extended family currently living in St. Brigid's Lawn, who are exceptionally well-integrated into the community, would be given the opportunity to continue to rear their families in their home area.  How many extra bays will be allocated to St. Brigid's Lawn?  One.  They are being given a space the size of a couple of car-parking spaces in a development of more than 1,000 units.  <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to address the issue of educational attainment in the Traveller community.  Over my years working in the school completion programme and Youthreach, I have seen the desire of so many from the Traveller community to stay in education but the hurdles they face are absolutely immense.  One of the cruellest cuts made during the austerity, which still gets to me, was the complete removal of every single visiting teacher for Travellers.  The whole scheme was completely abandoned.  Along with other measures such as the 37% cut to the school completion programme, of which I was part, this had an absolutely devastating impact on Travellers' involvement in education.  It again showed how quickly the Travelling community is kicked aside.<\/p>  <p>  I endorse the call for a national Traveller mental health strategy.  The figures for suicide among the Travelling community are absolutely beyond comprehension.  Some 56% of Travellers reported poor physical and mental health as opposed to 24% of the rest of the population.  Some 67% of men and 59% of women reported that their mental health was not good for one or more days in the past 30 days.  It is clear that this report comes at a very important time but it is just another in a litany of reports.

I thank the Senator very much for the report.  It was very interesting to work with her.  Well done to her.  I was very interested in what Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh was saying about the curriculum in the schools.  The report is a really useful tool.  It is a rich collection of statistics all in the one place.  They jump at you because the statistics on all of these areas, employment, housing, health and education, really speak for themselves and explain, without requiring you to wonder about it, that there is absolutely systemic discrimination against Travellers in all aspects of our lives.  What Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh said about trying to find a reference to nomadic people in our curriculum speaks volumes.  Our curriculum is designed by people who work in the Department of Education, which is run by whoever is in this House at a given time.  If the Deputy found it difficult to find such a reference, there is obviously a systemic problem.  It does not just fall from the sky that there is no regard for the nomadic history of the Travellers in Ireland, nor does it fall from the sky that there is a high rate of suicide among Traveller men, that there is low educational attainment in that community or that 27% of Travellers leave school before the age of 13, which is a shocking statistic in this day and age.  It might not have been 40 or 50 years ago, but it is now.  There is a reason for those things.  They have a systemic history and there is a systemic reason for them.<\/p>  <p>  I experienced this as the chairperson of the Traveller accommodation programme in Dublin City Council.  I chaired that group for four or five years.  It was like bashing your head against a brick wall because you could get the co-operation of council officials verbally and in their body language - they would say \"Yes\" to this or to that and that they would do the other - but nothing was ever achieved because, on every level on which you tried to move forward, you were blocked from making the progress you needed to make.  We visited Labre Park in Ballyfermot as part of the committee's work.  That has actually gone backwards in terms of the promises that were made.  The residents were promised regeneration more than 20 years ago.  There was a promise that 40-odd houses would be regenerated.  It is now down to approximately 15 in 2022.  The residents are hopeful that they might get 15.  The consequence of this is that the council ends up saying that Travellers actually prefer settled accommodation and do not really want Traveller-specific accommodation.  Travellers are forced to choose or accept settled accommodation because the authorities are not delivering on the promise of Traveller-specific accommodation.  It is integration almost by oppression.  It is completely the wrong approach and it will not work.  It will contribute to poor mental health, bad outcomes and a lack of confidence and self-sustainability.  <\/p>  <p>  In every aspect of the work we do in giving political leadership, we need to be very conscious of that.  Never again should we see a political leaflet used to gather support or votes in any kind of election by undermining the Traveller community in the local area.  That should never happen again but it has happened.  There should be laws in places for cases where it does happen.  The report is really important but, as the previous Deputy said, acting on it is even more important because, if we do not do that, all we are doing is perpetuating the systemic racism that exists in our society that prohibits and inhibits change from the very roots.  <\/p>  <p>  It is also very important that we recognise on a historical level the role the Traveller community has played in enriching our culture, our music, our diversity and our language.  To set that aside and say it does not matter is to be soulless and to disregard what we, as a population, are made of.  The Traveller community and its culture is a great part of that.  There needs to be an aspect to this that looks into how to preserve and promote that culture and how to give more than just lip service to that culture by saying things like Travellers are wonderful actors, singers, dancers or whatever.  Fundamentally, if we do not change the conditions under which Travellers live and really take seriously the problems in all four categories highlighted in this report, we will be failing yet again.  I sincerely hope we do not do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300039#PP00400","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1646320200,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Flynn for the leadership she is showing in driving the committee to deliver this report with its 84 recommendations.  Tuesday was the anniversary of the day we recognised Traveller ethnicity.  This has been a long struggle by the Travelling community to have their unique ethnic status recognised by the State.  We did so about five years ago.  While it was an important symbolic decision to make, very little has changed as a result of that.  We now need more than just symbolism and words.  To quote Senator Flynn, we need to put our name on it as Deputies and Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations in the report cut across many Departments.  I will be writing to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to include oversight of these recommendations.  How are we going to do this?  How are we going to put our name to it?  How are we going to keep an eye on it to ensure this work is being done?  This cuts across many committees.  I am sure other Deputies will be doing the same thing.  This affects the committees on housing, children, justice and education.  We need to make time in our workflow as the months go on to ensure we are putting our name to it.  The last thing we need to do is to allow the report to gather dust.<\/p>  <p>  I looked through some of the report's recommendations, thinking back through the work we did.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, we went to Labre Park which is in my and her constituency.  Among those in Labre Park, the sense of betrayal and of being let down by Dublin City Council and the powers that be was palpable.  Some good community work was being done and there were some great people with very clear and articulate voices in the community.  However, their simple demands for a space that was not infested with rats were not being met by Dublin City Council.<\/p>  <p>  Senator Flynn referred to a &euro;72 million budget for housing that had not been spent.  If local authorities are not spending the budget, we need to take the responsibility away from them and ensure we are delivering.  If local authorities and councillors are not delivering on Traveller accommodation, we need to find ways to do that.  One of the recommendations is a national Traveller accommodation authority to take that power to push these things through and to ensure that whoever is in charge of the Traveller accommodation committee - whoever has replaced Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith on Dublin City Council - is not running into the same roadblocks and banging their head off the same wall.  It is all well and good for us to talk about it, but behind that as we all know, large numbers of Travellers are struggling without decent accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Other Deputies have spoken about the knock-on consequences on health and mental health.  We need to find where those blocks are and get them out of the way.  If the blocks are our local authorities, then we need to get them out of the way and we need to take powers from them if that is what it takes.  It is only by recognising inequality that we can begin to address at.  Establishing a joint committee was definitely a good first step, but it is now up to the rest of us to keep pushing, to keep asking and to put our names to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300040#QQ00100","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1646320200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste agus, go h&aacute;irithe, leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Eileen Flynn as ucht na tuairisce seo at&aacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach.  I take the opportunity to congratulate Dr. Sindy Joyce who is taking up her role as lecturer at the University of Limerick.  They will be very lucky to have this outstanding academic put her particular and informed focus on Traveller, racial and ethnic studies.  No more than in any part of our community where women take their place and use their voice, we can make the future better for everyone.<\/p>  <p>  The report contains 84 recommendations, 18 of them relating to accommodation.  I would like to speak from my experience as a councillor on Kildare County Council local Traveller accommodation consultative committee, LTACC.  During my term on that committee, it was an all-women group of left-wing councillors who worked really well with the Travellers in our municipal districts.  We worked hard to spend our allocation on a particular site we were working on but we could not.  There was illness in the family, but in my experience the lack of urgency was the real illness that was deep at the heart of the official council level.  Given my experience, I wholeheartedly recommend recommendation 74 that a national Traveller accommodation authority be established to oversee Traveller accommodation policy and have an input into the Traveller accommodation programme in each local authority.  I would also like to see sanctions on local authorities that do not spend their allocation.  We need accountability.<\/p>  <p>  The D&aacute;il recognised Traveller ethnicity and we must acknowledge the nomadic aspect of their culture.  In terms of seasonal Travelling and meeting, it is beyond me how each county cannot designate an excellent facility where Travellers can come with the normal comforts of showers, electricity, bin collections, recycling etc.  If we are willing to do this for settled people, I do not see why we cannot do it for Travellers.  This was something I also put to the LTACC in Kildare County Council and he looked at me as if I had two heads.  I am ready to put my name to this report and we need to act on it.  Local authorities need to do their bit.  In my experience it is not the elected councillors who stop this but the officials at local authority level and they have to be held accountable for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300040#QQ00200","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1646320200,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I also welcome Senator Flynn and congratulate her on and her committee on the report.  I assure her that she is more than welcome and entitled to be in this House.  This is an incredibly important document and, as the committee Chair has said, we cannot let this become just another report.  We must put an end to the policies and practice that have failed the Traveller community.  That is why it is important to highlight the findings of this report and its 84 recommendations.  Among the many issues the Traveller community contends with are the scourges of discrimination, racism and exclusion.  The report outlines worse health outcomes than in the settled community, the mental health crisis being experienced, the lower education retention and completion rates and accommodation shortfalls.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding health, the committee heard that concerns over racism and discrimination underpin Travellers' lack of engagement with health services with 53% of Travellers fearing unfair treatment from healthcare providers.  That is why I support the committee's call for the national Traveller health plan to be published urgently and for an independent implementation body to be established to drive its delivery.  The Travelling community is also experiencing a mental health crisis.  A suicide rate of 11% was recorded in 2010 which is seven times higher than in the settled community.  Given the lack of engagement over fear of unfair treatment by healthcare providers, it is only right that the committee is calling for a ring-fenced health budget for the Traveller community within the HSE and for the appointment of a Department lead on Traveller health and mental health to monitor the progress, actions and initiatives across Departments.<\/p>  <p>  The report states: \"The health status of Travellers is impacted by a range of social determinants, most severely by overcrowded and substandard living conditions.\"  It also outlines instances where the State and local authorities have failed to implement the measures to assist the Traveller community in this regard.

I thank the committee for its report.  When we talk about the issues affecting the Traveller community, many people are shocked to learn of the stark realities facing it.  It is good to see the volume of statistics presented so clearly in this report.  I will refer to some of them.  Suicide is the cause of 11% of deaths in the Travelling community, which is an incredible figure.  According to information supplied to the committee by the Department of Health, the mortality rate for respiratory diseases is 7.5 times higher among male Travellers than it is in the general population and it is 5.4 times higher among female Travellers.<\/p> <p>This report also shows significant differentials in mortality from cancer, cardiovascular disease and health issues in general.  The Irish College of General Practitioners reports that, per 1,000 live births, the infant mortality rate in the general population is 3.9, whereas among Travellers it is 14.1, which is absolutely shocking and a terrible indictment of what is happening in this society.<\/p> <p> When it comes to mental health, is it any wonder the situation is so dire?  The State has in recent years undertaken a concerted effort to stop Travellers from travelling.  In 1963 we had the Commission on Itinerancy, which recommended assimilation of Travellers into the settled community.  In 1983 we had the Report of the Travelling People Review Body, which reported on the integration of Travellers into mainstream society but without properly recognising, supporting or promoting their cultural identity.  Then we had the housing Act of 1992 and the Roads Acts in the following years.  Those Acts allowed local authorities to remove Travellers from their camps at the roadside.  These are just some of the examples of the way in which the State has systematically tried to stop Travellers from travelling and to force them into housing.  This was a direct and concerted attack on Traveller culture.  Internationally, human rights abuses against minorities typically follow the same trend.  A minority is discriminated against and told they must become more like us if they are to be welcomed and included in society.  We in Aont&uacute; oppose this narrative wholeheartedly.  Travellers should be made to feel welcome and included in our country, society and democracy, and there should be no preconditions whatsoever to that inclusivity.  For years this State, through its laws and practices, has suggested that Travellers can be included in society only if they abandon their culture, and it is time we recognised that this is absolutely wrong.<\/p> <p> I have heard some fantastic speeches today, but speeches mean nothing unless there are changes in society.  I point especially to local authorities.  All the political parties represented here have influence over what is happening on local authorities throughout the country.  In recent years, I have done a lot of work looking at the funds that are spent on Traveller accommodation in each local authority around the country.  It is amazing that, at a time of housing crisis, many local authorities, year after year, have returned that funding to central government in Dublin.  I cannot understand how in a housing crisis there can be local authorities continuously returning funds to Dublin.  That has changed recently, and I had hoped that change would be positive.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has taken over that role in the Department, and the system is such that there is a central pot of money provided by the Government and local authorities can extract that money for Traveller accommodation.  However, now it is impossible, through freedom of information request or parliamentary question, to find out which local authorities are sending that money back and not drawing it down.  There is a problem with the culture on certain county and city councils where councillors do not want to engage on the topic of Traveller accommodation because they see it as divisive.  That shows cowardice on the part of some politicians who clearly want to keep their seats and feel there is an electoral cost to providing money to Traveller families for homes.  In Galway, we saw tensions build so much that some people set fire to a house that had been designated for a Traveller family.  After that incident, some of the politicians who were involved in stirring up that hatred went scrambling from that campaign pretty quickly.  It takes hatred to strike a match in that regard.  What happened was utterly shameful.  I commend Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who stood up very strongly against that hatred and stood with the Delaney family.<\/p> <p> I do not have long left to speak but I wish to remember a friend of mine, Michael McDonagh, who died recently.  Michael was a tireless advocate of Travellers' rights.  He was a founder and manager of Meath Travellers Workshop, and the contribution he made to society was huge, from helping Travellers engage with education to helping families who were struggling with life.  He was an absolute gentleman and will be sorely missed in Navan and the wider Meath area.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Nell and his children.  I know that Michael would have agreed with the key point that we need to improve the life experiences of Travellers but that we should do so in a way that does not mean they have to abandon their culture.

I welcome Senator Flynn to the House.  We look forward to seeing her here more often, I hope.  I also wish to take a moment to acknowledge, as others have, Ronnie Fay, co-director of Pavee Point, who recently passed away.  On this day last month, so many gathered to say goodbye to her.  Ronnie was a tireless advocate for the Traveller community.  Knowing her and engaging with her since I became Fine Gael spokesperson for equality was a privilege.  It was a privilege to work with her and to have the benefit of her education and the depth of her knowledge and to learn from her.  I am sorry she is not here today to see this very important report discussed in the Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  The Traveller community has been all too isolated and neglected a part of our community in our society, often purposely pushed and bullied into the sidelines in ways that cannot be tolerated.  The Traveller community has faced discrimination, racism and an inequality of opportunity that I and so many others have taken for granted entirely.  The figures in this important report speak for themselves.  Other speakers have cited them but I wish to do so also.  The figures show much shorter life expectancies among Travellers, with 11% of Traveller deaths attributed to suicide and very important and serious concerns about health services and bullying in education settings.  The latter is one of the things I find most difficult.  I demand yet again that the Department of Education come forward with a serious and integrated national Traveller education strategy that seeks to address those issues, but I will come back to that.  The figures show cuts to Traveller-specific education supports and difficulties obtaining ongoing employment outside of the community outlined in the report, with one in three Traveller households living in accommodation with no sewerage facilities and a further one in five living with no piped water source.  They are stark figures.  Water, a basic need, is just not there for one in five Traveller households.<\/p>  <p>  We have spoken a lot about ensuring that our elected representatives are just that: representative of the people across our diverse shared communities in Ireland.  However, we simply have not delivered for all the diverse communities in Ireland.  I hope that the work ongoing in the Government, particularly this report, might give impetus and momentum to that work and help to deliver change.  There have been some positive changes.  In the two months leading up to Christmas, we heard from the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, who confirmed there was a full spend by local authorities of over &euro;21 million for Traveller accommodation in 2021.  That budget has increased in 2022.  There is the requirement on local authorities to spend that money, and there are penalties for failing to do so.  This report has been a particularly poor end-of-year report for local authorities, where year after year there has been that underspend.  As other Deputies have said, that money goes back to the central allocation.  However, I wish to mention briefly D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which has worked hard to buck that trend of underspending.  That is fine to note, but that needs to be persistent and needs to be the basic standard and by no means the exception.<\/p>  <p>  A few days before this report was published, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, announced ring-fenced funding to support Travellers and the Roma community in higher education, a 50% increase on last year's funding, now totalling &euro;450,000.  I go back to my point about the Department of Education and the need to bring forward the national Traveller education strategy.  It has been in development for many years.  I know it is at the top of Pavee Point's list of priorities.  We have seen reports on children in the Traveller community in schools and how difficult it has been for them.  There is bullying and isolation.  We know there are teachers and principals who go out of their way to make children feel included, to make sure they have the services and supports they need, to try to identify, to stop and to have a zero-tolerance approach to racism and racist language in schools.  That is not, however, the universal experience of children in the Traveller community in schools, which is simply not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  There has been positive movement but we need to do more, as I said.  This is not just about funding and supports; it is about the way we do things.  It is about education in schools, educating people more broadly about racism and acknowledging that, unfortunately, it still very much exists in modern Ireland.  It is about a level of understanding and respect, which we have been lacking, to live side by side and in an integrated way with consideration and respect for all people in their communities, their identities, the rich traditions that come from the different communities and how they can only contribute to one another and add to the vibrant culture that is Ireland.<\/p> <p> I again acknowledge Senator Flynn and thank her for the work she has put into the special committee and the report.  As I walked back into Leinster House after lunch today, I met her partner and daughter.  The latter is too young to understand the impact of the work the Senator is doing, what it means and the legacy she is creating with that work and in being here.  I note the Senator's representative function for Traveller women, the Traveller community more broadly and women more broadly and what it says about inclusivity and respect for each other.  I am delighted to see her in the House.  I did not know that was going to happen and it is important that it has and that her daughter will see it in time.

It is important to say the committee pays tribute and &quot;was struck by the resilience of the Traveller community in the face of decades of deprivation, poverty and discrimination&quot; and other things besides.  Then it gives the recommendations and statistics.<\/p><p>To put it in context, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n did to some extent, in 1963, we had a Commission on Itinerancy.  All of the facts were the same.  Nothing has changed except the language.  That commission identified itinerants, as they were called, as the problem.  it appealed to charity and religious organisations to deal with and remove the problem and the cases of hostility and antipathy by strict enforcement of the law to restore public confidence.  It wanted to invoke the influence of local clergy and local religious, charitable and welfare organisations to deal with the problem.  We continue to other the problem and when we other differences rather than cherishing them, it is at a great cost to our democracy.  That is what we are asked here in three languages, namely, English, Irish and Cant:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDifr&iacute;ochta&iacute; a aithint le linn caitheamh linn go cothrom.  Is &eacute; cothrom na f&eacute;inne amh&aacute;in at&aacute; uainn.<br \/><br \/>Recognising difference while being treated equally.  All we want is fairness. <\/blockquote>  <p>If we look from 1963 to now, which is almost 60 years, we are faced with the same range of problems.  We have to ask ourselves as public representatives what is going on.  We deplore what is happening in local authority but most of us were in local authorities.  I echo what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said.  I spent five years on a Traveller accommodation committee.  It was the worst experience of my life.  I did not go back on it.  I did my best during those five years but it was extremely difficult to cope with the duplicitous language and the failure to act.  Traveller representatives on the committee were not free to speak because they were utterly dependent on the local authority.  I would never go back to that position.<\/p><p>We have failed to comply with our legal obligations.  We talk about sanctions but we have done all of this already.  All the city and county managers have powers to act.  We should not be in a position where accommodation is not being rolled out.  <\/p><p>I am not sure how much more time I can wheedle but as long as I can go on, I will.  The four areas were health, education, housing and economy.  There were contributions from Galway from the Galway Traveller Movement and Bounce Back Recycling.  It is apparent that there are positive solutions to all of this.  Let us stop dealing with something as a problem.  Let us cherish the differences and go forward.<\/p><p>I agree with all of the recommendations but one that sticks out, besides the accommodation, is the one in relation to mainstreaming this in our education system.  That could be easily done.  To echo the words of my colleague, I wish we were here to celebrate the implementation of that declaration.  I have exhausted the Ceann Comhairle's patience.

I welcome Senator Flynn and thank her for being here and for chairing the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community, which was established in September 2020 to complete the work initiated by the previous joint committee, in which Collete Kelleher played a major role.  We looked at four areas: physical health, mental health and suicide rates, in respect of which there are 21 recommendations; school completion rates and educational attainment, particularly at second and third level, compared with the settled community, which includes 23 recommendations; labour market participation, having regard to the unemployment rate of 80% among Travellers, containing 22 recommendations; and access to housing and accommodation, including Traveller-specific accommodation, in the context of the significantly higher homelessness rate among Travellers compared with the settled population, which included 18 recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  Over the years there have been numerous reports which sit on shelves gathering dust on various areas, particularly the Traveller community.  We want to see this report implemented.  That will be the test of this debate.  Any public representative - including local councillors, to whom we should bring this - by agreeing to this is behoved to implement it in a positive way and to at all times support the Traveller community through the recommendations of the report.  That would mean all of us playing a positive role around the Traveller community and not undermining said recommendations.<\/p> <p>This is the first time we have seen Cant, the language of the Traveller community, used in a report.  That is important, and a milestone from that point of view.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned that there were four areas.  Some of these recommendations could have been implemented by now.  I refer, for example, to the recommendations on health.  Recommendation 6 states, &quot;The National Traveller Health Action Plan should be published as a matter of urgency and an independent implementation body, with ring-fenced budgets to drive delivery and implementation, should be established&quot;.  Has that been done? Is it in train?  I ask the Minister of State to respond on this point.<br\/><br\/>Recommendation 22, on education, is a call to: &quot;Restore the dedicated funding to Traveller Education cut in the 2011, 2012 period in full and ring fence it to provide supplementary educational support for members of the Traveller Community where they would benefit from same.&quot;  Has that been done?  It is very simple.  This report was published five months ago.  Has that measure been put in place or set in train?  Perhaps the Minister of State could comment on this as well.<br\/><br\/>Recommendation 47 relates to employment and states: <\/p><blockquote>\tThere should be formal positive action measures for recruiting Travellers to the public sector.  These programmes need to be led, and funded, from central government.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, should be the lead department as it fits within [its] remit. <\/blockquote> <p>Has that been done?  It is something that is simple and straightforward and that we could implement quickly.  Will the Minister of State also comment on this point?<br\/><br\/>Recommendation 74, on housing, states, &quot;A National Traveller Accommodation Authority should be established to oversee the development and implementation of Traveller accommodation policy&quot;.  Has that been done?  Is it in train?  Can a report be brought to us on this aspect?  Equally, recommendation 81, also on housing, states: &quot;Cena should be funded to advise social housing landlords on the design, location and management of Traveller-specific accommodation projects.&quot;  Cena is a housing body that can play a leading role in respect of Traveller housing accommodation.<br\/><br\/>Those of us on the committee visited several sites in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  When I visited the site at Spring Lane with my colleagues, it was appalling to see people having to live in the conditions they were in.  On the other hand, when we walked into those people's homes, we were welcomed and the pride in and running of those homes was brilliant.  That is not being patronising, recognising the conditions they were living in.  It behoves this Government and this D&aacute;il to ensure that the areas and the homes where members of the Traveller community are living are up to standard.  I mention the National Traveller Women's Forum, which sent an email concerning this debate.  I thank the organisation for doing that.<br\/><br\/>President Higgins was at National University of Ireland Galway to mark Traveller Ethnicity Day on Tuesday.  A report on the occasion stated: &quot;On a day when the long and sometimes difficult journey of travellers was being honoured, he said it was vital that society would never be slow to point to what has yet to be achieved.&quot;  I will conclude on this point.  I ask the D&aacute;il to implement these recommendations.We should perhaps get a report on the progress of the implementation of all these recommendations.  We could invite the relevant Ministers in, maybe every eight months, to update us on how they stand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300042#SS00600","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646322000,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Joan Collins for that sound advice.

I commend Senator Flynn on the work she has done.  Her election as our Chair sent an important message.  It was also an important decision for the committee because of the way that she chaired our meetings.  I take this opportunity to thank her for that.  I also acknowledge Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who is passionate about this issue, and I know other Members will agree with me on this point.<\/p>  <p>  The findings in the report are stark.  The lack of progress on the key issues affecting the Traveller community suggests there is merit in the idea that there should be a permanent Oireachtas committee on this matter that could oversee the Government's work more regularly.  In the absence of such a committee, the responsibility falls on right across the board.  It falls on the members of the Government, on the Ministers, on the Chairs of each of the committees, on each of us as members of the Houses and on the chief executives and members of the local authorities.  I refer in particular to the recommendation that Part 8 powers be removed from local authority members.  There is a clear warning here.  Members of local authorities moan about powers being removed from them.  In that context, here is a warning to them to take brave decisions on Traveller accommodation in their communities and then powers will not be removed.  It is important that we take action in this regard, such as examining the provision of traveller accommodation.  It is welcome that the allocation in this area was fully spent last year.  That had to do with structural changes as well, which have enabled local authorities to access funding year-round.  Small adjustments like that can deliver real change.<\/p>  <p>  The mental health issue is probably the one that strikes me the most.  Suicide rates among males in the Traveller community are six times higher than among their counterparts in the general population.  This is not specifically referenced in material in front of me, but I refer to the level of addiction as a result of mental health issues, and we know that those issues are connected in many ways.  I have spoken to the Minister of State with special responsibility in this area, Deputy Peter Burke, to tell him that it is important that we implement every one of the recommendations regarding mental health.<\/p>  <p>  We talk about Ireland being a republic and about treating all the children of the nation equally, in the broadest sense of the word.  There is no more blatant and brazen form of discrimination in this country than that to which the people in the Traveller community are subjected.  It is discussed in open conversation, with no embarrassment.  It is utterly unacceptable and, inevitably, it impacts every part of policy delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300043#TT00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1646322000,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McAuliffe.  Before I call Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and then the Minister of State to respond, I also want to make some remarks.  I apologise to Senator Flynn for not being here when the debate started a little earlier than was scheduled.  I also thank her, and former Senator Colette Kelleher before her, for the outstanding work they have done.  The statistics published in this report cast a shadow of shame on our State and on our society.  There is no escaping that reality.<\/p><p>I have had discussions on this with Senator Flynn, and we have agreed that we will have an implementation group established in Leinster House.  The Clerk of the D&aacute;il has already engaged with the Secretaries General of relevant Departments to ensure that we can have ongoing engagement to monitor the implementation of the 84 recommendations which have been brought before us.  In addition, we have agreed, and I have given my personal undertaking, that we will re-establish and continue the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis until the work of the special committees currently being established to examine surrogacy and autism have completed their work.  After that, we will formally re-establish the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community as an ongoing standing committee of these Houses.<\/p><p>Having commenced this work in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il and seen it reach this level of progress in the Thirty-third D&aacute;il, I hope that the Thirty-fourth D&aacute;il will continue to have such a committee so that we can move these recommendations forward and not have a report gathering dust on a shelf, but rather have regular assessments of its implementation.  The idea proposed by Deputy Joan Collins, namely, that we should come in here regularly, perhaps twice a year, and debate the implementation of the recommendations of the report, is a very good one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300043#TT00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1646322000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022030300043#TT00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646322000,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I am sorry.
