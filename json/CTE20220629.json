All those attending in the committee room should continue to sanitise and wash their hands properly and often, and avail of sanitisers outside and inside the committee rooms, be respectful of other people's physical space, and practice good respiratory etiquette.  If they have any Covid-19 symptoms, no matter how mild, they should not attend in the committee room.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contacting Covid-19.  Members who wish to participate in the meeting remotely must do so from within the Leinster House complex only.<\/p> <p>  Apologies have been received for this meeting from Deputy Paul Murphy and Senator Garrett Ahearn. <\/p> <p>  We will talk today about the general scheme of the representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers Bill 2022 which aims to give effect to the directive by creating a new civil litigation mechanism in which a qualified entity may act as playing a part on behalf of consumers who have opted into a representative action against the trader in the High Court.  The Bill also creates a mechanism whereby an organisation which represents the collective interests of a consumer, may apply to the Minister to be designated a qualified entity in order to bring a representative action in Ireland or in another EU member state.  The new law is a response to recent mass consumer rights breeches by private companies.  It will allow for several cross-border qualified entities to come together to represent EU consumers where they have been harmed by the same alleged infringement which has been caused by the same trader in several member states.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased we have an opportunity to consider these matters further with the following representatives from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I welcome Ms Clare McNamara, principal officer, competition and consumer policy unit; Mr. Paul Brennan, assistant principal; and Ms Sadhbh McGrath, administrative officer. <\/p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references made to a person in evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. <\/p> <p>  The opening statements have been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration on this matter today, I invite Ms McNamara to make opening remarks on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022062900002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the committee members for the opportunity to discuss the scheme of the Bill.  As the Chair said, I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Paul Brennan and Ms Sadhbh McGrath.  We very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to the committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the scheme and to assist it in any way we can.  I intend to outline the context for introducing the scheme and then set out its main provisions after which we will look forward to hearing the member&rsquo;s views and answer questions.<\/p> <p>  This scheme transposes Directive (EU) 2020\/1828 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2020 on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers and it repeals Directive 2009\/22\/EC.  Member states have until 25 December 2022 to transpose this directive.<\/p> <p>  The 2015 Dieselgate scandal affected thousands of consumers across the EU.  This scandal, among others, highlighted gaps in consumer rights law across the EU&rsquo;s internal market.  Back then there was no tool across the EU that would have allowed consumers, in mass harm situations, to litigate and be represented in large groups by another entity.  The directive on representative actions creates such a new tool: representative action by qualified entities for groups of consumers to enforce their rights.  It is different from the US class action system.  The US class action system is a for-profit mechanism where consumers can be responsible for the costs, while the EU system is non-profit and consumers do not cover the costs.  It does not create any new consumer rights.  The directive on representative actions applies to a specific list of EU laws, 66 in total.  Actions can be brought on a domestic or cross-border basis.  A public consultation was conducted in the spring of 2021.  There were 17 responses from varied stakeholders ranging from law firms to consumer rights organisations.<\/p> <p>  The transposition of the directive on representative actions means for the first time in Irish law, a group of consumers can take an action through a qualified entity.  Traders compliant with consumer protection legislation have nothing to fear as this Bill does not impose any new obligations on them.  The scheme of the Bill under scrutiny by the committee today was approved for drafting by the Government on 22 March this year.  Given the time limitation, the Chair will excuse me for not going through the scheme provision by provision.  Instead, I will summarise as far as it is possible to do so. <\/p> <p>  The scheme contains three parts and one schedule.  In the main, the directive on representative actions is a maximum harmonisation directive giving member states little discretion as to its implementation.<\/p><p>Member states have discretion on measures such as how qualified entities are funded and whether consumers should opt in or opt out of representative actions.<\/p><p> Part 1 includes heads 1 to 4, inclusive, and deals with preliminary matters.  Heads 1 and 2 deal with standard provisions, such as the Short Title and definitions.  Head 3 permits the Minister to make regulations for the process of designating qualified entities and permits the Minister for Justice to make regulations for the process of bringing a representative action to the High Court.  Head 4 permits the Superior Courts Rules Committee to make rules of court in relation to the conduct of representative actions pursuant to Part 2 of the Act.<\/p><p> Part 2 incorporates heads 5 to 15, inclusive, and covers representative actions.  This part provides overall for representative actions which a designated qualified entity may bring and the High Court's role.<\/p><p> A qualified entity may bring a representative action to the High Court on behalf of consumers who have opted in to the action.  The Statute of Limitations periods are suspended during a representative action.  A qualified entity may seek any combination of an injunction or redress measures.  However, the action can only be taken against a trader for an alleged breach of one of the EU or national consumer protection provisions listed in Schedule 1 of the Act.<\/p><p> Qualified entities bear the costs of the representative action, not the consumers.  Any costs orders made by the court, apart from exceptional circumstances, will be made against the qualified entities.  The qualified entity must enter into pre-litigation consultation with the trader.<\/p><p> The High Court must assess the admissibility of the representative action and can dismiss manifestly unfounded cases.  The High Court must ensure there are no conflicts of interest between the qualified entity and any third-party funder.  The inclusion of qualified entities designated in another member state on the Commission's qualified entity list is proof of standing.  A court decision from another member state about the same trader for the same practice can be used as evidence.  The High Court can order either party to inform consumers about the result of the representative action and impose penalties on any party failing to comply with the court order.<\/p><p> Part 3, on qualified entities, provides the mechanism whereby organisations which have a track record in representing the collective interests of consumers, and which meet other criteria, can be designated by the Minister as qualified entities.<\/p><p> An appeals mechanism is set out and the Minister can revoke designation where it is determined that the organisation no longer meets the designating criteria.  Qualified entities can charge consumers an entry fee.  A qualified entity is also required to notify consumers about representative actions it has brought or intends to bring, and how consumers can notify the qualified entity of their wish to be represented in a representative action.<\/p><p> The Schedule lists the European Union measures and Irish measures under which a representative action may be brought against a trader for alleged infringements.<\/p><p> I am happy to discuss the provisions of the scheme in more detail and to respond to questions from members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022062900002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McNamara.

It does not preclude a body such as the CCPC but, as I say, no decisions have been taken as to the designation of any qualified entity, including any public body.  There has been no decision as regards the CCPC.<\/p> <p>  There are considerable implications involved in the possible designation of public bodies, including their enforcement role.  It would have to weigh that up in terms of the dual role they would play if one had a public body that was doing both.  We would have to make sure that the public body's role as a qualified entity does not conflict with, say, the founding legislation of the public body.

Ms McNamara can see the concern I am driving at.  It is that all the powers in the world do not make any difference if one does not have the resources to be able to enforce it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022062900002#B00500","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I absolutely take that on board.<\/p> <p>  It might help if I run through the minimum standards and criteria that a qualified entity must meet in order to be designated in the first instance.  It has to be a legal person - that is merely a legal term - with 12 months of public activity protecting consumer interests.  The articles of association have to show a legitimate interest in protecting consumer rights.  It has to be non-profit making, which is why, as I say, it does not exclude public bodies.  It cannot be subject to insolvency proceedings.  It must be independent and not influenced by traders.  It has to publish on its website how it complies with those criteria.<\/p> <p>  The sequencing is a good question.  If it were, for example, to be the CCPC, that falls under the remit of the Minister who would be doing the designation in the first place.  The resourcing of the CCPC would have to be taken into account in terms of making the designation and a case would have to be made to ensure that the body is adequately resourced.<\/p> <p>  Going back to one of the Deputy's original questions, there is absolutely no limit in this legislation on the number of qualified entities that can be designated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022062900002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare McNamara"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>That is great.

Another example I would give would be the required degree of similarity of individual cases and the minimum number of consumers impacted by an action in order to be admitted as litigated in a representative action.

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Vurm and his colleagues to the committee meeting today and we look forward to the dialogue on all things Europe, international and geopolitical in this challenging time.  The most important thing for this committee, and it is certainly the focus of our committee, is to continue with engagement.  Yesterday I met the Dutch ambassador and I met the Ukrainian ambassador at the weekend.  This committee is very keen to keep all lines of communication open.  We are absolutely delighted Mr. Vurm is here today to keep that conversation going.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member partaking by Microsoft Teams, prior to making a contribution to the meeting, that they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.<\/p> <p>  I on Mr. Filip Vurm to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022062900002#C00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.  Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very much for inviting me to this committee session.  It is a great honour and pleasure for me to be here and to be able to present the priorities of the Czech Presidency for the second semester this year.  I convey apologies on behalf of the ambassador, H.E. Petr Kyn&scaron;tetr, for not being able to attend this meeting due to urgent travel to the Czech Republic.<\/p> <p>  In 1996 when the Czech President, V&aacute;clav Havel, considered the future of our Continent in his speech at the Charlemagne prize ceremonial entitled, \"Europe as a Task\", he stressed that the tasks ahead of Europe deserved careful and thorough reflection.  In the international context of the time, particularly favourable to western democracies, Havel called on Europeans to rediscover their conscience and to take responsibility for global environmental, social and economic challenges.  He did not want Europe to reclaim the position of a &ldquo;global head of orchestra&rdquo; and to impose its cultural values on the rest of the world.  What he had in mind was rather to inspire and to lead by example.<\/p> <p>  The brutal war and aggression beyond the eastern borders of our community has clearly shown us we will have to find the courage to re-evaluate many of our current approaches and premises.  We, therefore, perceive the Havel slogan &ldquo;Europe as a Task&rdquo;, chosen by the Czech Republic as the motto of its Presidency of the Council of the EU in 2022, not only as an opportunity to reflect together, but above all, as a call for accountability and determined action based on our values.  If we want to live up to the expectations of this historical moment, our triple challenge is to rethink, rebuild and repower Europe.<\/p> <p>  On 14 December 2021, the General Affairs Council endorsed the trio programme of three consecutive presidencies: France, Czech Republic and Sweden.  The trio programme was developed at a time when the major challenge for the EU was the post-pandemic recovery.  It has, therefore, been focused on protecting citizens and freedoms; developing the European economic model; building a climate-neutral, green, fair and social Europe; and promoting Europe's interest and values in the world.<\/p> <p>  The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has brought forward the necessity of a fundamental reassessment of the EU priorities and significantly influenced the preparation of the Czech Presidency's priorities.  The Czech Presidency will address urgent security issues by carrying on with the originally identified files such as the green and digital transition of the EU economy.<\/p><p> The political priorities of the Czech Presidency are divided into five cross-sectoral flagship areas, aiming to respond to crime challenges as well as pursuing the EU's long-term objectives.  The first is to manage the refugee crisis and the post-war recovery of Ukraine.  The Czech Presidency will support the EU&rsquo;s efforts to defend Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity by using all instruments and programmes offered by the EU, including the strengthening of sanctions.  It will also promote EU solidarity, efficiency and flexibility in managing the migration-related issues and it will support Ukraine on its European pass after receiving candidate status.  It will also contribute to Ukraine's economic recovery and stability.  The second relates to energy security.  The Czech Presidency will focus on reducing energy dependency on authoritarian regimes, such as Russia; diversifying resources through the REPowerEU energy plan; and mitigating the negative social and economic impacts on high energy prices.  The third is the reinforcement of European defence capabilities, including cybersecurity.  The Czech Presidency will promote the security and defence co-operation with NATO, implementing the strategic compass, enhancing better intra-EU co-operation and strengthening the EU's industrial strategies in strategic areas.  Strategic resilience of the European economy is the forth area of focus.  The Czech Presidency will focus on reducing dependence on hostile regimes, strengthen self-sufficiency and deepen the internal market of democratic states.  It will also focus on accelerating digitalisation and adapting free market rules to these developments.  The fifth is the resilience of democratic institutions.  The Czech Presidency will focus on safeguarding values of democracy and the rule of law, media freedom, transparency, open dialogue with citizens, including the follow up to the Conference on the Future of Europe, in online and offline spaces.<\/p><p> I thank the members for their attention and I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022062900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Filip Vurm","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Vurm.

Obviously, in a presentation, you cannot touch on everything.  There are two overarching issues that concern most European citizens right now.  One is the changed security situation in Europe, with the unlawful and horrific invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.  The second issue is, in part a consequence of that, the cost-of-living crisis faced by European citizens.  In terms of the Czechian stewardship of the European Council for the next six months, what specific measures does Mr. Vurm see can be promoted or developed to address a common approach to reducing the cost of living for citizens?  Are there any measures that would strengthen people's confidence in the European Union acting in consort, as it did so effectively on vaccines, for example?  Are there any common measures that can be taken to reduce the cost of living in terms of energy, food security, or any other matter like that?<\/p> <p>  A further question is in relation to the security situation in Europe.  Obviously, Ireland is a neutral country.  There is a council meeting of NATO today and I understand all European Heads of State and Heads of State will be attending the fringes of that meeting, if not the formal part of it.

I will start with the first one.  An appropriate mix of instruments which will reduce and mitigate the negative social and economic impact of high prices should be implemented.

This is something which was quite successful in the past in purchasing vaccines.  This is one of the tools that can be used in dealing with the high energy prices.

This is something which might help to mitigate the crisis.<\/p> <p>  In terms of security, as I mentioned in my speech, we will focus on enhanced co-operation between the EU and NATO.  Most of the EU countries are members of NATO.  There are also non-EU countries that are members of NATO and that share our values.  In this area, we should focus much more on creating synergies and on what we call the concept of strategic unity with like-minded partners.  We are already seeing the impacts of the Ukrainian invasion on the architecture of Europe.  We are all aware of what happened yesterday at the NATO summit in Madrid when Turkey removed its objection to Sweden and Finland joining NATO.

Mr. Vurm has dealt with what we would see as the major issues.  Obviously, these are security concerns and the very much changed world following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  We do not know how that is going to work out.  All we know is that it is a much smaller and far more dangerous world.  There was much talk even before it, throughout the pandemic, of European or EU strategic autonomy.  We all saw the difficulties around semiconductors.  While this is something we need and is required, we do not want the EU to become protectionist <i>per se<\/i>.<\/p><p>Mr. Vurm answered a question on what we all want to see as regards dealing with the cost-of-living crisis, particularly where it crosses over with the energy crisis, that is, the idea of the EU doing what Deputy Howlin said it did well during the pandemic which is to block buy and make sure we have the supply line of fuel and the storage.  We need to emphasise that the European block needs to move to renewables as quickly as it can for multiple reasons.  I ask Mr. Vurm's for his views on that.<\/p><p>We have been dealing with the issue of accession.  We had a trip to Georgia in the last while.  It did not get great news from its point of view but it has a roadmap to follow no more than Ukraine and Moldova do.  It is going to be a long and arduous road.  Some of that is made long as well by the rule of law issues within Europe.  I ask Mr. Vurm for his opinion on that.  Where does he see these issues from the Presidency's point of view?  We have to get our own house in order while maintaining the balance and co-operation that has been shown to be useful.  Some of it is the outworkings of the Conference on the Future of Europe and the convention.  Some of it has been caught up in the whole argument of qualified majority voting versus unanimity.  To a degree, I think this is a wrong turn.  We showed during the pandemic that we could co-operate when we all opted into something we could agree on.  As difficult as it is, we showed we are able to come together on sanctions and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022062900002#E00400","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.

We will provide it to members.  My apologies for that.<\/p> <p>  As I said, it refers to two protocols to the existing DTAs with Isle of Man and Guernsey.  Ireland signed the original agreement with the Isle of Man in 2008 and with Guernsey in 2009.  The protocols for the Isle of Man and Guernsey were signed on 18 November 2021 and 8 December 2021, respectively.<\/p> <p>  As the members will recall, arising from the OECD base erosion and profit shifting process, known as BEPS, Ireland ratified the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS in 2018.  The convention was discussed at this committee and in the D&aacute;il and was included in the Finance Act 2018.  The multilateral convention came into force for Ireland in 2019 and it has been the means for updating the majority of Ireland&rsquo;s existing double taxation agreements to make them BEPS-compliant.  Our existing agreements with Isle of Man and Guernsey were not updated by the multilateral convention but will instead be updated bilaterally to reflect the BEPS changes.  That is what the two protocols before the committee today now seek to do.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has been to the forefront in both signing and ratifying the multilateral convention and these bilateral protocols are another important step in the implementation of the OECD BEPS actions.  As for those partner jurisdictions that have not yet signed the BEPS multilateral convention, Ireland has written to them to discuss options for implementing the BEPS recommendations.  We are committed to ensuring that all our double taxation agreements meet the required prescribed standards agreed in the BEPS process.  A common feature of the protocols with both the Isle of Man and Guernsey is the incorporation of strong anti-avoidance measures and tools for tackling tax treaty abuse.  Both bilaterally-agreed protocols contain the prescribed standards to which Ireland committed during the BEPS project.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the protocol to the Isle of Man agreement, Ireland signed its agreement with Isle of Man in April 2008.  In March 2018, the Isle of Man&rsquo;s Treasury asked the Revenue Commissioners if the 2008 agreement between Ireland and Isle of Man could be updated by protocol instead of using the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS.<\/p><p>Ireland agreed to the request.  Negotiations happened in 2018 and concluded in January 2019.  That protocol was signed in November of last year and is now before the committee.  The Guernsey treaty protocol was signed in March 2009.  In June 2017, Guernsey also asked the Office of the Revenue Commissioners if the agreement could be updated by protocol.  Ireland agreed to the request and negotiations took place, beginning in 2017 and concluding in October 2018.  The protocol was signed in December of last year and is before the committee today.<\/p><p> Our network of double taxation agreements is an important aspect of our competitiveness in attracting investment and facilitating Irish business in operating internationally.  In addition, double taxation agreements are a cornerstone of our trade policy and provide greater certainty and fairness for taxpayers regarding their tax obligations in foreign jurisdictions and they are key to the prevention of double taxation.<\/p><p> The benefits of double taxation agreements are well known but concerns have been expressed that treaties may inadvertently facilitate aggressive tax planning.  These concerns were central to the BEPS project and to the multilateral convention on BEPS.  Updating our existing double taxation agreements, whether via the multilateral convention or bilaterally, helps to ensure they cannot be used for aggressive tax planning arrangements.  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the BEPS process since its inception.  We continue to engage positively at both EU and OECD level in dealing with the tax challenges that arise from the digitalisation and globalisation of the economy including through signing up to the historic two-pillared agreement at the OECD last October.  Proactively updating our treaty network to incorporate anti-BEPS measures is an example of that support.<\/p><p> It is timely that I am before the committee today because, following the approval of the Government, I published our tax treaty policy statement earlier this week.  The rationale for publishing that statement is to take stock of our existing network and formalise our broad treaty policy.  We have come from a period of expansion of the network to the point where we have treaties with the vast majority of our international trading partners.  In order to inform the treaty policy statement, I launched a public consultation in April of last year that ran until May 2021.  I received submissions from a broad range of stakeholders including business groups, practitioners, NGOs and members of the public.  These are all available on the Department of Finance website.  My officials held a series of stakeholder engagements to discuss the content of the submissions in detail and the insights we gained from those engagements were important in the drafting of the tax treaty policy statement.<\/p><p> The main thrust of the statement is that we aim to formalise the existing policy of maintaining and enhancing the network of double taxation agreements that facilitate international movement, trade and investment, including through the creation of a priority list of potential partners.  A separate dimension of the policy relates to a specific policy for least developed countries, the definition of which is taken from the UN and will evolve as the UN updates its list periodically.  One of the main features of this element of the policy statement is that Ireland will not approach least developed countries to seek a tax treaty and, where approached by least developed countries, we will be mindful of their particular and distinctive needs.<\/p><p> If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the making of these orders by the Government, I will include the orders in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by way of an amendment in the upcoming finance Bill.  This will enable Ireland to complete the necessary notifications to finalise the ratifications of both protocols.  I commend the orders to the committee.  I am happy to answer any questions the Chairman or members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#A00700","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Doherty, I welcome Nicholas and Krzysztof Lesniak, a father and son from Poland, and Will Mulholland, who is no doubt from Kilkenny.

They are very welcome to the committee.  I have a couple of questions for the Minister on the protocols in respect of both jurisdictions.  The Minister mentioned that it was requested that both be dealt with by way of protocol rather than through the multilateral convention.  Will he explain to the committee the benefits of taking this approach rather than the approach of the multilateral convention from the perspective of Guernsey and the Isle of the Man?  Will he outline the objectives of each protocol separately and the amendments that have been made in respect of the double taxation agreements as they stand?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#B00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Before I go into the nature of these protocols, I will deal with the Deputy's first question as to why these matters are being dealt with via bilateral amendment rather than through the multilateral instrument.  It is up to the Isle of Man and Guernsey to outline why they believe it is in their interest to do it in this way but Revenue and my Department considered it and the view of my officials was that, given the focus we are putting on the implementation of the BEPS process, the best way to ensure compliance with our standards was to do this through protocols negotiated bilaterally.  The recommendation of Revenue and my officials aims to deliver on the spirit of the kind of change we want to see.  We believed a bilateral negotiation was the most effective way to proceed.  It is not as clear to us as it normally would be whether the multilateral instrument would fully apply to the kinds of agreements we have with the Isle of Man and Guernsey because those agreements are quite limited.  They really only focus on individuals whereas other double taxation agreements I have presented to the Oireachtas are broader and include corporate and business information and activities.  These relate to individuals only.  Because of that, and independent of the views of the other jurisdictions, we were of the view that we should do it bilaterally to deliver against the standards we believe are appropriate for the exchange of information between individuals.<\/p> <p>  To go on to what is included in the agreements between Ireland and the Isle of Man and Guernsey, the protocols aim to put in place required minimum standards to allow us to be confident that we are adhering to the BEPS process.  The first provision, which is contained in the first article of both protocols, inserts a new preamble into the original agreements.  This preamble contains an expressed statement emphasising the role of the treaty in combating tax abuse.  The second minimum standard provides for an anti-abuse rule which denies treaty benefits in cases where obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of the arrangement or transaction entered into.  I understand that this is referred to as the principal purposes test and involves looking at what the purpose of the transaction is.  That is contained in Article 3 of our Guernsey protocol and Article 4 of the protocol with the Isle of Man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#B00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Will the Minister outline how the exchange of information will operate?

This is in line with the OECD model, which deals with the effective exchange of information on tax matters.  It sets out the minimum standards for achieving effective exchange of information with those two jurisdictions.  The way it happens is that the competent authorities, that is, the tax authorities in the Isle of Man or Guernsey, would contact our tax authority about matters of concern, or <i>vice versa<\/i>.

That is not the case at present.  There are four countries outstanding with which there is no double tax arrangement or agreement in place.  Several of the other double tax agreements are more than 40 years old and may not be fully concurrent with international norms at this time, given the changes, particularly in recent times, and the need to incorporate the OECD minimum standards and best practices aligned with the OECD BEPS project.  Given that we are quite a distance from even having double taxation agreements with several of those countries and the agreements with other countries are out of date, will the Minister update the committee on the stage he is at with the negotiations?

In terms of where we are at the moment, we now have 76 DTAs, of which 73 are in effect.  There are three that have been signed but are not yet in effect.  In terms of our priority for further agreements, it is Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia.  We do not yet have DTAs with Colombia or Costa Rica, which have now joined the OECD.  Our priorities are to conclude agreements with G20 countries.  In terms of what that sequencing will look like, our first priority is G20 countries, namely, Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia.  After that, we will move to developing tax treaties with OECD member countries as well as EU accession countries.  Following that, we will move on to how we update existing treaties.<\/p> <p>  In terms of where we are with bringing our agreements in line with the OECD process, much of that has happened through the enactment of the multilateral instrument to which I referred in my opening statement.

It may be a challenge to get this through the US Congress, for instance.  We can speculate on whether it will go through but that will be up to those at that level.  It has always been the view of the Government that this needs to be done at global level.  Has that view changed or evolved recently?  Is it still the view of the Government that all parties that are signed up to the process need to implement it and, if that is not the case, then we should not be a party to this?  There is an emerging view that, for example, pillar 2 will be transposed through a directive at European level.  Does the Minister believe pillar 2 should take effect in Europe regardless what other parties, such as America, decide to do?  That would be a very different view from the one we have.

At a time when the world is changing rapidly and other European countries are seeking a presence in Taiwan, and our colleagues in the European Union have trade offices in that country, we have not really established a trade office there, even though Taiwan has a population of 24 million.  The previous discussion we had about the DTA with Taiwan indicated that we would use the UK model of wording to have that agreement, but it has never been brought to conclusion.  Given the shift in world politics and the global economy, and observing the one China policy and the actions taken by our European partners, is it not time for us to complete that taxation agreement and to move quickly to reopen our offices in Taiwan to a far greater degree in order that the trade between both countries can be supported more directly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#E00600","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his long-standing interest in this matter.

At present, my Department is consulting with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to examine whether an agreement, with equivalent effect to a DTA with Taiwan, might be concluded in a manner consistent with our foreign policy.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman will be aware, an amendment was made to section 826 of the Taxes Consolidation Act in the Finance Act 2015 to allow for agreements to be made with non-governmental entities such as Taiwan.  This has paved the way legally to conclude an agreement with Taiwan.  Discussions between officials, including those from Revenue and the Department of Foreign Affairs, on next steps are ongoing, but there are not at present any formal negotiations between Irish officials and representatives of Taiwan.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is correct to point out that IDA Ireland had an office in Taiwan.

To resurrect that arrangement or proposal would not take from the urgency of completing the G20 list.  I again say to the Minister that there is a strong connection between Taiwan and Ireland.  Taiwan is a market of 24 million people and is anxious to play its part on the world stage.  We know why it has been hampered in doing that.  This type of arrangement does not fly in the face of any political position.  Our European partners are actively promoting trade in Taiwan and actively reaching agreements.

A key issue that is still unresolved is how such an agreement could be concluded and signed.  I will be very open with the Chairman, because he has raised this matter with me regularly, that one of the things we have done in our tax treaty framework is to state who we want to do when.  We are putting the focus on three other G20 states.  The issue regarding how the treaty could be signed is a substantive issue.

I had not got my facts at that time and I said I would come back to the Minister on it.  The gentleman who rings me, Liam, explained there is a particular cohort of people who are on the State contributory pension who may have, in his case, a pension from the local brewery.  There is an exemption of up to &euro;36,000 for married people or those in civil partnership.  It is up to &euro;18,000 for single or widowed people.  The levels were higher than that but were then reduced.  Since it has been reduced, even a small increase in the pension will drive Liam over the limit.  I am sure there are just a small number of pensioners in that category.<\/p><p>I hope in the context of the budget that increasing the exemption might be looked at to take these people out of the bracket where they pay tax, thereby allowing them to benefit from the small increases they would get either from the State pension or their work pension.  It is a small amount of money for the Government but a big amount of money for this group of people.  It would make a difference to them.  It is worthwhile considering all of these issues.

I had hoped it would be reasonable in the context of the framework and the process but it appears it is driving those waiting for a resolution into a never-ending legal process.  This is not what was asked for.  Given the length of time that people have waited, the number of agents who have since passed away and the lesser number that remain, if there was good faith on the side of AIB and EBS it would be resolved.  It shows a culture in the bank again that seems to want to push groups such as this to the limit in the process.

They do not want to get to the end of the tracker mortgage issue.  It is not quite finished as yet.  The regulator should be given teeth to deal with this and to give more information to the public on what is going on in the banking system.  Consumer protection should be separated from the Central Bank so it is more independent and visibly on the side of the consumer.  The committee will return to it.<\/p> <p>  The regulator was soft on the bank and soft on how the tracker mortgage issue was dealt with.  I recall the previous regulator sitting at a meeting telling us the number of tracker mortgages involved was approximately 4,000.  On that particular day in 2017 I adjourned the meeting and asked the regulator to go back and check his figures.  He came back with a similar figure.  We know now that figure was wrong because it has grown to 41,000.  To say the banks behaved badly is to put it mildly.  The banks have behaved badly.  They have been scurrilous towards their customers.  It is time to look at the regulation and the regulator.  The regulator should be seen to be actively involved in responding to the various complaints made.  This is what brings me to the conclusion that consumer protection should be completely independent of the Central Bank.  I am expressing my own view on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#F00500","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I concur with what the Chair has said on this.  Although the role of the Central Bank in the tracker mortgage scandal concluded a while ago we know the scandal is not over.  The committee, working collectively with all its members, has done a good bit of work on trying to shed a light on this and pushing those organs of the State that also failed customers in this regard.  When people turned to the Financial Services Ombudsman at the early stages all the cases were rejected.  We have to remember this.  The Central Bank's comment, even today, is that it cannot get involved in individual issues.  It was only through the perseverance of individuals that the issue was pursued and the Financial Services Ombudsman found in favour of them.  It was fought all the way through.<\/p> <p>  I have not had an opportunity to raise this issue with the Minister.  We are shocked and appalled at what went on in the banking sector.  We are shocked and genuinely feel for people who are victims of the tracker mortgage scandals, particularly those who lost their houses.  Many lost more than money.  They were severely impacted in terms of their mental health.  Permanent TSB, a bank of which the Minister is a major shareholder, recently fought a case brought to the Ombudsman.  I know the individual who took the case.  The individual relayed to me very clearly that the bank fought him tooth and nail.  He won his case.  Permanent TSB has confirmed to me in recent weeks that up to 200 individuals will have to be dealt with in the same way.  I do not think that will be the end of the story.<\/p> <p>  The banks have set up a culture board and all the rest.  When we have banks still fighting consumers in 2022, years after the investigation and examination by the Central Bank concluded, I argue strongly it is not a customer-centric approach.  We cannot have a David versus Goliath approach.  That is not fair.  The case I am speaking about took years.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the avalanche of paperwork involved.  Permanent TSB has a legal team.  The individual had to deal with all of the correspondence and respond to it.  If, at any time, had he buckled and said it was not worth it or not enough, up to 200 individuals would not know they were also victims of the tracker mortgage scandal.<\/p><p>In the middle of all that, the Central Bank did not spot this or step in.  Therefore, we must improve consumer protection.  There is a real need to look at where consumer protection lies.  We must examine the legislation to allow the Central Bank to step into the shoes of victims, whether those of businesses in respect of the insurance they had for Covid-19 or of individuals impacted in respect of issues such as the tracker mortgage examinations.  We have not given the Central Bank the powers to do that.  As we are coming out the other side of this, I am mindful that there are, as I believe, still hundreds, if not thousands of cases, to be processed.  Some of those may end up in the courts.  In that context, we must state that the fines are not the end of this matter.  The Garda will undertake its piece.  Information in this regard has been provided to the force and it will be up to the Garda to deal with that aspect.  <\/p><p> As politicians, we must examine this 15-year period where regulations were continually breached.  How do we now improve the situation to ensure it never happens again?  If representatives of the banking sector come knocking on the Minister&rsquo;s door, which they are likely to do because there is a campaign by the sector to get him to allow the banks to pay bonuses and to breach the &euro;500,000 pay limit, he should tell them to sling their hook.  AIB was breaching regulations until eight weeks ago.  It is amazing that this was happening.  <\/p><p> The committee has heard from all the CEOs.  They have apologised.  They have told us they are now customer-centric and all the rest of it.  Then we see the facts.  This type of practice was going on until eight weeks ago in AIB.  Equally, Permanent TSB is fighting these customers.  We never see these aspects.  If this individual had not come to me, I would not have known what was happening.  This is not the approach we want in the banking sector.  We must reach a point in the banking sector in this State where we are able to draw a line under what happened.  We will only be able to draw such a line, however, when we have dealt with all these issues and they are behind us.  We need to reach the point where our banking sector is doing what it should be doing, which is lending to individuals and making a return for shareholders, while also meeting the needs of ordinary people, businesses and the economy.  This situation has dogged the banking sector for so long, but it is its fault.  The banks are continuing to breach the regulations and continuing to act in the way they have.  I fear this committee will be dealing with these issues for quite a while to come.  <\/p><p> That was a longer contribution than I expected to make, but this situation has not been dealt with.  The change we needed in the sector has not happened.  If that change has not happened after 41,000 people had money taken from their accounts, family homes were taken and hundreds of millions of euro had to be forced to be paid back, as well as compensation to these victims, then I do not know what it is going to take.  The Minister has a role here as the shareholder in some of these banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#F00600","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>The Deputy knows, though, that part of the limitation I have as a shareholder is that I cannot get involved in commercial decisions.

The Deputy knows that as a shareholder I cannot and do not get involved in commercial decisions.  All that being said, what happened with the tracker mortgage issue was an absolute scandal.  I used that word when the scale of harm involved for so many became apparent, not just to those families and people affected but to this committee and to me.  The scale of what happened was a scandal.  It was wrong that the issue developed in the first place.  How the matter was dealt with and how the banks dealt with the regulator was also something that I believed at the time was unacceptable.<\/p> <p>  I have three points to make about it.  First, I believe that the scale of fines imposed on AIB in this regard shows the seriousness with which the matter has been dealt with by the Central Bank.  Between the fine, redress and compensation from AIB and from EBS, the total cost has been over &euro;300 million.  A large share of that &euro;300 million has been accounted for by customers getting their money back in the first place.  Nonetheless, I believe the fine imposed shows the seriousness with which the Central Bank has dealt with this issue.  Second, the strong view I convey to the committee is that if we separate consumer protection from the financial regulator, then we will undermine consumer protection in the long run, because the most effective way of dealing with consumer protection is by having it done through the financial regulator for the banking sector.

I refer to the findings of the Central Bank, particularly those concerning recent years, in respect of AIB having failed to apply the principle of stop the harm and having continued to pursue individuals.  Legal notices were issued for the repossession of those people's homes, despite the tracker mortgage examination finding that these individuals were within its scope.

I received various reasons as to why it was not possible.  I do not accept those reasons.  Almost every small business in the country has the convenience of an ATM machine.  When one asks what it is there for, one is told that it is for convenience of customers.  When the ATM was removed from Leinster House, it was done on the grounds that money was not being made or was being lost, that the administration had changed or that the banks were no longer doing it.  Whatever way the banks are operating, given the relationship between the banks and the Oireachtas in recent the past number of years, if I were them, I would make some effort to restore the ATM machine in question.  It was a snub to remove it at the time it was done, during the lockdown, and to base the condition for its removal on the fact that it was used very little.  I find that difficult enough to believe, because of the representations I have received from Oireachtas Members and staff in particular.  I ask that the matter be raised again as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise other issues on which the committee has engaged before, including the transfer of accounts between banks.  I do not want answers today, particularly if the they are not available, but I will insist on written answers.  The transfer to other financial institutions was found to be cumbersome.  It was allegedly a simple provision, which not everyone agrees with.  It was not simple or easy; it proved difficult for many people.  I would have thought that an electronic transfer between the outgoing banks and the incoming banks would have been simple to organise, on a national basis, and that it would have alleviated considerable anxiety and worry for customers and been of great benefit.<\/p> <p>  In the course of what I have heard from constituents in recent times, I have noticed that some long-standing customers had overdrafts, which were sometimes used, but that no provision was made for these to remain in place after the transfer.  Instead, there was a provision for credit cards.  Of course, we all know the difference between the two.  One entails an interest rate of whatever the nominal interest rate is and the other entails a fairly hefty rate.  I ask that the banks come back to the committee with a view to resolving the issue of equal treatment on the transfer of business interests.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of issues relating to the people who have lost out.  Deputy Doherty referred to the individuals who lost out and lost their homes.  I am sure that all Members of the Houses have done their level best to make sure that did not happen.  They have lost some.  We possibly lost some.  We held and still hold some.  The fact of the matter is that it is very easy for a lending institution to come along and tell someone that he or she is in debt and has broken the agreement and that his or her loan is no longer sustainable, but the Irish people rescued the banking system here.  The Government, on behalf of the Irish people, rescued and paid for the banking system.  The banks did not lose anything, except their good name or whatever kind of name they had at the time.  We have not gone away and nor are we likely to.<\/p> <p>  I pay tribute to the lending institutions that have dealt sympathetically with customers.  I cast a wary eye on those that did not.  We will need to continue to monitor the situation.  I do not want an immediate response, unless somebody decides to give an administrative response, but I want a response in writing within the next two to three weeks, before the D&aacute;il goes into recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#H00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":193,"content":"<p>We will definitely get back to the Deputy on those matters.

I am grateful for the invitation extended to Mesh Ireland to discuss the issues relating to vaginal mesh implants.  Mesh Ireland is an all-island group with 150 members.  Two members join me today, Amanda Jackson and Margaret Bolger.  The motto of our group is \"For mesh injured, by mesh injured.\"  We firmly believe that patient representatives must be the injured themselves, an approach not currently embraced by the HSE mesh pathways.  The previous Minister for Health did not meaningfully engage with the Mesh Ireland campaign.  I have represented Mesh Ireland at the 2018 to 2020 UK Cumberlege review and to governments in the North and Scotland.  I have communicated in previous correspondence to the committee on my mesh advocacy activities regarding solutions to the non-availability of full and safe mesh removal surgeries in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Mesh injury is a global scandal, the legacy of more than two decades of implanting mesh.  Statistics convey the incidence of implantation and mesh injury.  The HSE has not supplied its data.  In NHS England alone, approximately 100,000 women had mesh implanted from 2008 to 2017.  A former Chief Medical Officer for England estimated the mesh injury rate at 15-20%.  The Irish State has no figures.  The two groups here today represent 750 members.  In recent years, Scotland and Quebec have introduced mesh removal costs reimbursement legislation, policies and funding for their injured.  In the USA, justice departments have reached multi-state settlements with mesh manufacturers for actions based on endangering patients through deceptive marketing.  The respective sums are $188.6 million, $344 million and $60 million.<\/p> <p>  In contrast, a different wind is blowing here in Ireland, where mesh-injured patients are being obliged to finance their own full and safe removal of mesh implants.  The local mood remains anchored in talking up partial removals of the implants as the best alternative.  It is not the case that the low-volume HSE data of attempted full removals evidence the risk to patient safety.  HSE surgeons may be coming under pressure to demonstrate skills to have a go at a full removal, whether they have the skill set and expertise or not.  Mesh removal skills are a special skill set.  It is a perfect storm scenario, which should be resolved by stepping up access to the treatment abroad scheme, not restricting it.<\/p> <p>  I will address the reasons full and safe removal is the best option.  When polypropylene mesh implants are inserted, our internal tissues form scar tissue over the implant.  It is the scar tissue which encases the implants and holds them in place.  The incontinence tapes or slings are on average 22 cm long.  The prolapse meshes are much larger than slings.  They can run from the front of the pelvis to the rectal area, causing both urinary and bowel incontinence or retention when problems arise.  I can best describe them as having the size of a ladies' panty liner with long strips going off at the sides.  Some have six strips.  Some are additionally secured internally by additional metal fasteners and staples.  Their position in our bodies and the scar tissue surrounding them poses surgical challenges in removing them.<\/p> <p>  Partial removals, the default solution for two decades, are not the answer.  If a woman has pain from mesh in her groin, removing the easily accessible few centimetres of mesh from under the bladder pipe will not ease that pain.  Eventually surgeons have no access to the remainder implants, due to dense scar tissue.  They simply cannot get in at the mesh.  These women have only non-surgical treatment options open.<\/p> <p>  On access and funding, the principles of autonomy and informed consent tell us that women have a right to have the option of full and safe removal of their implants on the public healthcare system.  Yet, for HSE healthcare patients the treatment abroad scheme is illusory.  It is a catch-22.  The patients must exhaust the treatment abroad scheme pathway to prove they tried the available routes but the system is stacked against them.  First, the HSE&rsquo;s official position is that these surgeries are available in Ireland.  We dispute this.  This unequivocal and bold statement is a hurdle which our women alone cannot dismantle.  Second, the HSE surgical community is deeply attached to partial removals which are its historical comfort zone.  In our view, patients who reject the HSE surgical preferences will only receive minimalistic, lip-service support when they ask HSE consultants to provide necessary documentation to support their application for the public healthcare treatment abroad scheme.<\/p> <p>  Two women did travel to the USA with HSE consultant-authored letters of support.  However, what differentiates these two cases from others is that these patients funded their surgeries through private healthcare and their own financial means.  It is here that a two-tier system emerges.  Private patients are passported through.  HSE-reliant patients are kettled in local HSE pathways.  Patient choice should not be determined by a medical community which dilutes its support for the identical medical procedure with the identical surgeon based on the financial means of the patients.  HSE patients are currently experiencing a mindset akin to \"like it or lump it\", \"partial removals or nothing.\"  They deserve to be treated with respect.<\/p> <p>  The procedural mechanisms provide a slam dunk for rejecting applications related to full removal surgeries abroad.  Weakly worded letters stating \"patient feels she would benefit from this surgery\" contrast starkly with letters supplied to private patients which embrace their choice of a more experienced surgeon abroad.  Notwithstanding the letter, the HSE&rsquo;s official position that there is not just one but many surgeons who perform this operation locally means that the treatment abroad scheme pathway is a fool's errand.  The door was never really open.  The HSE conducts an automated appeal.  Rejection follows.  The door is bolted from the inside.<\/p><p> Our women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, concepts which underpin a fair and equal society.  We have found that the State has a gap in its services.  Currently, it is a David-and-Goliath battle - a war of attrition.  Our women deserve access to full and safe removal operations performed by surgeons of their choice.  In the hands of the right surgeon, this is an established surgical procedure which only lasts for a few hours.  It is affordable to the State, and this pathway is the choice of many.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary McLaughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I will speak on behalf of Terri Martin.  I thank the committee for inviting members of Mesh Survivors Ireland to speak here today.  I also thank Amanda and Terri.  This is the opening statement of Terri Martin, advocate for Mesh Survivors Ireland of mesh-injured patients.  I thank the joint committee for inviting Margaret, Louise and me to appear as representatives for the Mesh Survivors Ireland group and Mary and her representatives on behalf of the Mesh Ireland group, to collaborate on the much-needed aftercare and supports that are required to assist in our daily living needs following these life-limiting medical procedures.<\/p> <p>  As members are aware, our journey in respect of the specialist aftercare relating to this medical injury began here in Leinster House in late 2017.  Much has been discussed and achieved since then.  Following all the delays relating to the global pandemic, the lifting of the unprecedented restrictions relating to it means that we can now have an honest and open discussion on all the suggested recommendations contained in the Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s 2018 report and the HSE&rsquo;s implementation plan for mesh injury.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted for the majority of people.  However, mesh-injured patients will never have the opportunity to enjoy the same quality of life again.  We are extremely grateful for the support that the Government has given us to date, for our issues being heard and for all the background work that has been done in terms of the review of this horrific infliction.  As recipients of this failed procedure, we are saddened to report that although there have been learning reports, CMO reports, implementation plans and advisory committees, nothing has changed.  We still live with the after-effects of mesh injury limiting our quality of life.  As a result, it is easier to try to navigate the necessary means that can be accessed through committee members, the powers that be, in easing this life-limiting health scandal for all involved as an optimistic view to improve our daily living needs and in assisting us to break free from the detrimental consequences and effects that were inflicted upon us with no informed consent.  It is now widely known that there are minimal complete removal options of surgery for these surgical tapes here in Ireland, with no success or complication credentials as requested annually.<\/p> <p>  The following interventions are spread across Departments.  They are necessary interventions that will make an exceptional difference to injured lives.  The first is the issuing of medical cards to all recognised mesh-injured patients from previous pathways and Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, registration to assist with medical costs, diagnostic need, medications, primary care, GP visits, and acute services, such as haematology, diabetic screening, optometry and dental care, required as a result of the associated side effects of mesh.<\/p> <p>  The second intervention is patient transfer.  Although we are grateful for the designated two mesh centres in Cork and Dublin, they are not realistic or feasible for the majority of those in need of their services.  Therefore, patient transfer is vital in order that we can avail of the CMO's recommendations.  Those injured by mesh are subjected to very invasive, painful examinations and cannot be asked to travel such distances on public transport, which is rarely accessible in many cases, and suffer unconditionally following the process.<\/p> <p>  The third intervention relates to accountability and an apology for mesh injury from our HSE and the Department of Health because there were many warnings regarding the safety of these products from the Food and Drug Administration Authority.  Although they came in through Europe&rsquo;s decentralisation system, they still ended up implanted in our bodies in national public hospitals run and funded by HSE and the Department.<\/p> <p>  The fourth intervention relates to patient advocates.  The latter need to be included with the stakeholders in the decision-making relating to the upcoming steering committee on mesh injury.  These patients hold the most valuable insight into the side effects endured following these failed procedures and the actions needed to prevent these horrific situations happening again.<\/p> <p>  The fifth intervention involves honest communication with all advocate mesh groups by the stakeholders.  Such communication needs to be forthcoming and transparent in order for this whole nightmare to end.  Trust needs to be re-established in order to rebuild confidence among those who promised \"First, do no harm\".  Trust has completely broken down in light of all the gaslighting, ignorance and disrespect.<\/p> <p>  From the Woman&rsquo;s Health action plan, dates are required for when the agreed compassionate engagement from December 2018 in lieu of an independent enquiry into mesh injury are going to take place.  We also need information on the form of protocol that is to be used for this review.  Dr. Gabriel Scally&rsquo;s review into the other women&rsquo;s health scandal involving CervicalCheck raised many identical issues, and its findings resonate closely with mesh-injured ladies and their constant battle for justice.<\/p> <p>  When will the translabial scanner be available for use at the Dublin and Cork mesh centres?  Previous correspondence from Government indicates that it has been available since 1 September 2021.  This is not the case.  There is an anxious waiting list of mesh-injured ladies awaiting life-changing answers as to what damage their mesh is causing internally so as to direct future intervention to ease their plight.  These vital diagnostic machines came at great public cost and it would be a shame to leave unused such wonderful non-invasive investigatory tools in mapping the mesh placement internally.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the CMO's report, an update is required as to the treatment suggestions in aftercare and the efficiency and effectiveness of the budget allocated.

The available range of treatments is important to the witnesses.  It seems to me that there is an option for a partial removal or a full removal, with pain management being available for cases where that is not possible.  It seems from both opening statements that a full removal is not really an option in this State.  Many women have to travel abroad, but the treatment abroad scheme is not effective and barriers are being put in their way.  I ask the witnesses to explain again what those barriers are.  That is important.  The HSE's opening statement mentions that the scheme is working effectively, yet the experience of the witnesses is that it is not working.  The HSE talks about the two centres of the national mesh complication service in Dublin and Cork being up and running to treat patients.  The translabial scan is obviously important.  Is it the experience of the witnesses that the scanning equipment is operational in both Cork and Dublin?  Is it only available in one or is it only partially available?

He would not write a letter addressed to my consultant initially and then he implied in it that I had self-referred.  The treatment abroad scheme said that treatment was not available because the patient had self-referred.  Subsequently, I was told by the Ombudsman, who took up the case after I was referred, that my consultant should not have said there was no doctor in Ireland available to do it.  The consultant is an assistant professor and I had been with him for three years.  It was just very difficult.  The Ombudsman caseworker told me she was not getting answers from the HSE when she asked if a similar treatment was available here in Ireland.  She did not get an answer back.

I understand there are two types of mesh in implants, namely, retropubic tape, TVT, and transobturator tape, TVT-O.  The latter is the far more difficult type.  It is implanted close to the obturator nerve in the groin area.  I understand that, in Ireland, gynaecologists implant the TVT-O mesh whereas, in Britain, a gynaecologist is accompanied by an orthopaedic surgeon because of the complexity.  There is obviously some discrepancy if, a few hundred miles across the Irish Sea, they believe two surgeons with different expertise and skill sets are required.  In Ireland we do not see that yet.  An eminent professor in Ireland, whom I will not name, has said that what is implanted in most medical cases should be capable of removal.

You cannot get at those two pieces of tape.  If I had a 30 cm tape, I would have 10 cm in my groin on one side, 10 cm through the middle and 10 cm in the groin on the other side.  Ms Kelly and I have been abroad and had those tapes removed.  It leaves a large surgical scar on each side of the groin and that is why it is very important to go to someone who knows what they are doing, because there are a lot of tendons and muscle there, so if that is got wrong, women can lose the power in their legs.

Again, this is something the committee can follow up on.<\/p> <p>  I probably should have made a confession at the start that I have had a mesh implant.  I have had cancer.  The witnesses spoke about an informed decision.  I had to make that decision when all the scandals had broken a number of years ago, particularly about women.  I had that long conversation with surgeons about whether it was right for me.  I was reading and hearing about the horrific injuries caused by these devices.  I am one of the lucky ones but having gone through it, I am conscious of the fact that we need to do more for those failed by the system.  <\/p> <p>  I made a commitment at the start of the meeting that the committee would follow through on this.  We will have our next meeting with the HSE but we also said that when we resume in September, we will look again at this.  I give a commitment on behalf of the committee that we will follow up on many of the issues raised by the witnesses.  Members have made suggestions about what we should do in a review and report on this.  I give a commitment on behalf of the committee that we will not stop at today's meeting.  Let us look at today's meeting as the start of a conversation and let us hope that those who clearly need supports will find them and that we can clear away some of the barriers.  <\/p> <p>  The Cumberlege report was mentioned.  It would be a good starting point.  I am conscious that it is a different jurisdiction but for any jurisdiction looking at this issue, and I am thinking about Ireland, the recommendations in the report would be a good starting point for anyone trying to address the issue.  It is not about reinventing the wheel.  It is about addressing some of the harm that has been done to women and men through the use of these mesh devices.  The report has a series of recommendations, many of which would be hard to disagree with.<\/p><p>It recommends a safety commissioner that would be independent, with statutory responsibility, and which would champion the value of listening to patients and promoting users' perspectives and so on.  It also addresses the questions of company responsibility, upskilling of people and missing data.  Maybe the committee could look at the report and other ways of helping the women represented by today's delegations so they can have a pathway to recovery and care.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, we have run out of time.

As the Chair mentioned, I am joined by Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Murphy, Ms Catherine Donohoe, and Dr. Suzanne O&rsquo;Sullivan.<\/p> <p>  Mesh is a medical product used in a range of surgical specialties, and our focus today relates to mesh used in two urogynaecological procedures for women - the treatment of stress urinary incontinence, SUI, and pelvic organ prolapse, POP.  In November 2017, following the experiences of many women who had mesh implants that were causing pain, infection or other complications, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, requested the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, to review the clinical issues involved.  In July 2018, the HSE paused the use of vaginal mesh implants for the treatment of SUI and POP.<\/p> <p>  The CMO&rsquo;s report, The Use of Uro-gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures, was published in November 2018.  The report gave a comprehensive history of vaginal mesh implants and their purpose, and detailed the problems experienced by some women, which led to the pause in use of such implants.  The report contained 19 recommendations covering two broad areas: responding to the needs of women experiencing vaginal mesh implant complications and consideration of how clinical practice in the use of vaginal mesh might operate should the pause be lifted.  To date, 11 recommendations have been completed, five are ongoing and three are no longer deemed clinically appropriate to progress.  The five ongoing recommendations are prospective clinical recommendations and will be implemented if vaginal mesh implants are used again in the future.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the work done to meet the needs of women and people affected by problems with mesh implants.  In order to initially identify and assist the patients who needed support, assessments or had questions about their care or experience, a dedicated page on the HSE website was created with detailed patient information and guidance.  The information was promoted in news reports and on social media, and it was ensured that the page was easy to access on search engines.  Each hospital group identified specific contact details for its patients, and these were provided on the HSE site.  Communications from approximately 70 women were received, and all of the women who made contact were offered appointments either at the time or subsequently.<\/p> <p>  A new national mesh complications service was established, with a centre in Cork and in Dublin, that has the option to refer people for specialist care abroad if needed.  The HSE put in place a three-tiered response to mesh complications to ensure that women always have a pathway of care.  First, women experiencing post-mesh complications are advised to contact either their GP or the consultant who inserted the implant, for a clinical assessment.  Next, if specialist care is needed, they can then be referred to the national mesh complications service.  This service is delivered across two centres and provides expert specialist care to women requiring mesh removal.<\/p> <p>  The mesh complications service has a multidisciplinary team in place with a range of medical specialties involved.  The two hospitals providing this complications service are recognised urogynaecology centres with subspecialist expertise.  These centres have extensive experience in dealing with complex pelvic-floor problems, including mesh complications.  An additional HSE investment of &euro;1.3 million was provided specifically for this service in 2021.  The consultants involved in the care of patients with mesh complications have specialist and subspecialist training, most of which was done abroad in the UK, US and Australia.  In addition to this, an internationally renowned subspecialist training programme in urogynaecology has been established in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The national mesh complications service, which is a HSE public service, does not make a distinction between women who had a vaginal mesh implanted in a private or public facility.  Information on how to access the national mesh complications service is published on the dedicated HSE web page, and is available from all acute hospitals, GPs and patient representative groups.<\/p> <p>  Both centres have full diagnostics services available, including translabial scanning.  In November 2021, a consultant urogynaecologist from the UK led a translabial and transvaginal teaching day and clinic in the urogynaecology department in Cork.  Feedback obtained from the women who attended the clinic was positive.  There is an identified lead consultant within each centre for this service.  To date, the centre in Cork has seen approximately 40 patients and currently has no waiting list.  It has a designated mesh clinic that is held every six weeks.  The centre in Dublin has seen approximately 69 patients and has a waiting list of 16.  We anticipate that all patients will be seen by October 2022.<\/p> <p>  The third tier of the pathway is the availability of treatment abroad.  For some patients who have defined clinical complexities, access to treatment abroad gives an additional pathway when the level of complexity requires it.  An application for treatment abroad can be supported by the HSE national mesh complication service.  The care of a patient reverts to the referring consultant upon return to Ireland, through whom all follow-up care is organised.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude by once again acknowledging the difficult experience of the significant number of women who have and are suffering serious complications from the use of vaginal mesh implants.  The HSE hopes that the significant investment made in developing the dedicated services to support women will have a positive impact and outcome for people affected.  We take this opportunity to encourage people who may be suffering with mesh complications to contact their GP or the HSE for care and support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Kidd"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I am conscious Dr. O'Sullivan said that she was only available until 11.30 a.m. and it is now nearly 11.20 a.m.  Do members want to ask Dr. O'Sullivan about the mesh centres?

Our machine was bought and during 2021 it was set up in a dedicated space and clinic in November and Dr. Ranee Thakar, a very well-known and world-class urogynaecologist from the UK came over and we scanned nine patients from around the country.  Four consultants came from Dublin also attended to learn from this training day and clinical day.  The machine is there.  We have a dedicated consultant whose appointment is imminent and who will continue with that service.  It is important to say that translabial scanning can be helpful but it is by no means the be-all and end-all of assessing patients.  Often, it is actually not necessary because we can see clinically, without needing a scanner, where the issue is.  If there is a problem, for example, with vaginal mesh erosion into the vagina, we do not always need a translabial scan.

We have worked very hard to set up what we believe to be very good and holistic services, with an aim to be as holistic as possible in the approach to treating the women.  This is a very complex situation and it is not a case of one fix answering all problems.  We have got two consultant urologists who work as part of our network disability team.  We have three subspecialty consultant urogynaecologists and a fourth to be appointed.  We have extra physiotherapists and nurse specialists who have been appointed as a result of the investment from the national women and infants health programme into our services in terms of dealing with these patients and trying to address the problem.<\/p> <p>  This is not a new problem.  As a urogynaecologist, I know that we have been using mesh for 20 years in order to treat problems for patients and dealing with complications as they arise.  Any surgeon knows there is no intervention that is risk-free or completely safe.  That is across the board, no matter how minor the intervention is.  However, we have worked really hard in the context of seeking and being able to provide a holistic approach, including in the context of pain support, psychology support, psychiatric support, where required, physiotherapy and surgical interventions.  When we carry out procedures and look after patients with seriously complex issues and undertake surgery, there is always a minimum of two consultants on hand.  Usually, there are three or four present for the more difficult and complicated cases.

We also have a huge cohort of patients who have other issues, for example, relating to recurrent urinary tract infections who also happen to have had a tape or a mesh in the past but those issues may or may not be directly related to their tape.  Those patients have always been attending our services and it is only since we set up these services that we have a separate coding for patients with very direct, clear mesh-related complications.  I suppose they are not hugely surprising because we have not done any operations in the last four years so we are dealing with women who had surgery prior to the implementation of the pause.

There is no doubt there have been problems caused as a result of these operations.  There is no doubt about that whatsoever.  Again, our door is always open.  We prioritise any patient who is referred with a problem related to mesh.  We get them into our system as quickly as we possibly can.  We prioritise them over other patients and it is a big issue for us because with Covid our waiting lists have really grown but we have dedicated time, we have a dedicated multidisciplinary team, we discuss all the complicated patients and we schedule surgery because some of these operations can be very big.  They can last for several hours and we must put aside at least half a day, and often a day, aside to do the really complicated surgical mesh removals when required.  Again, I can speak for our service in Cork.  We are absolutely cognisant of the issue.  We aim to do our very best by the women who come to us.  We prioritise referrals.  We see them as quickly as possible.  We offer them a large range of interventions.<\/p> <p>  One of the questions that arises relates to total mesh removal.  One of the problems is that when we see people, we look at their issues and try to look at causative factors and what is going to make them better.  Often total mesh removal, from my clinical perspective or that of our multidisciplinary clinical perspective, may not be, we feel, in the best interests of the patient.  It is a difficult dilemma to be trying to say there are other solutions to issues that may or may not be related to the mesh and that we look at trying interventions like physiotherapy, pain management, etc.  We definitely will remove the mesh when we are convinced it is the absolute root cause of problems and when we are confident that doing so is going make the woman better.  The difficulty or concern is often that full mesh removal can make things an awful lot worse and leave the woman much worse off afterwards.<\/p><p>We have looked after women who have come from abroad, including from the UK, after total mesh removal who have had very significant problems and who were really harmed and had dreadful complications as a result of surgery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062900002#M01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Why did these women go abroad?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062900002#N00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I honestly do not know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062900002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Was there medical evidence or support available for or against their going abroad?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062900002#N00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I do not understand the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062900002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":395,"content":"<p>Did they have medical advice before going abroad as to what they might do in those circumstances?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062900002#N00600","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I do not know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062900002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I have a last question.

One of the problems is some women want the mesh to be completely removed.  If, as a clinician, I am fairly confident that doing so may not make their problem any better and has a high chance of making it an awful lot worse, leaving the woman in a much more devastating situation, I am left with a great ethical dilemma.  I cannot recommend major and potentially mutilating surgery that I do not believe is in the interests of the patient.  I just cannot do that.  I have to be honest with women.  It is not pushback.  We are here to do our best and to try to help our patients and make them better.  We have options to do that.  As I have said, we offer many different things, including mesh removal where that is absolutely the right thing for the patient.  However, it is very difficult when a patient believes total removal of the mesh is a panacea.  As I have said, it is difficult when someone tries to push me into doing an operation I genuinely believe may be harmful and in no way good for a woman.  I do not mean to push back but I can only be honest about what I believe will help somebody and what I can do to make that person better.  Usually, we do not start with total mesh removal as the first step in dealing with issues, whether bladder problems, urinary tract infections, pain or difficulty with intercourse.  The variety of symptoms and problems is absolutely enormous.  There are, therefore, many options to deal with the issues and to make the woman better.  There is no one quick-fix solution.  That is where we have to be very careful.

It is not a one-size-fits-all product by a long shot.  There are tapes for incontinence, which can go in two different places.  There are different challenges associated with removal depending on the type of tape.  The mesh that is used for vaginal prolapse is different.  It has a larger surface area, which results in challenges for full removal.  There may be a sequela of scar tissue formation and real issues with vaginal and sexual function after full mesh removal surgery.  If mesh is in the wrong place, it must be removed.  If it is in the bladder or has come through the vaginal skin, there is no doubt it must be removed.

We should look at the issues and at the possible causes excluding mesh, because there can be other causes.  We have had several patients referred to us with what were thought to be mesh complications which were actually totally unrelated.  We have operated on patients for whom the mesh was not the problem at all and for whom previous procedures had caused the problems.  It is a very large area.  It is not simple and straightforward.  These are complicated procedures and solutions.  As I have said, we aim to treat women as holistically as possible and to look at every aspect of their care, including their physical care, their sexual care, their pelvic floor care and care of their mental health.

I suggest that the first thing the HSE needs to do, notwithstanding Mr. Kidd's opening statement about the implementation of the CMO's report and the supports and services he says are available, is that the HSE needs to examine that in the first instance, because women obviously have a different view which needs to be listened to.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask questions about the different treatment options and the clinical, so perhaps I can come to Dr. Murphy.

A surgeon or specialist will have to decide, from his or her perspective, what is best and safe.  However, the women obviously have their own choice and view.  It seems to me that either there is a bias within the system towards partial removal, on the one hand, which might be based on the fact that clinicians see it as the best option, or there is a lack of skills and expertise in performing full removals in this State.  Which is it?  Is there are lack of expertise in being able to perform full removals?  Is that one of the reasons there seems to be - I will not say \"push\" but a view - from clinicians that a partial removal is best?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022062900002#O01200","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":443,"content":"<p>When describing options for complications of procedures, one has to give all of them, including conservative, interventional and so on.  The types of procedures that can be done after a complication are, covering or division of the mesh, partial or full excision and complete removal.  They are all options, if one reads any of the papers.  With regard to pain, there is good evidence to say that if there is no mesh abnormality found, in that the mesh is not extruding and it is not in the wrong place, in fact, removal of the mesh can even have persistence of pain in up to 42% of people.  It can depend on the presenting complaint and the best option.  I would not say it is the fact the expertise is not there but it is along the lines that we know that anywhere between 15% and 20% of people can have further complications after removal of mesh.

The HSE is saying it fully supports that and will support her through the reimbursement scheme or the treatment abroad scheme.  However, this is what one of the women said today in her opening statement, and I will address to Mr. Kidd and Dr. Murphy.  She wrote that, &quot;for HSE healthcare patients the treatment abroad scheme is illusory&quot; and that &quot;the system is stacked against them&quot;.  In the view of Mesh Ireland, &quot;patients who reject the HSE surgical preferences will only receive ... lip-service support when they ask HSE consultants to provide necessary documentation to support their application for the public healthcare treatment abroad scheme&quot; and that the approach is &quot;like it or lump it&quot; and &quot;partial removals or nothing&quot;.  I will read the last paragraph of the statement, which is important:<\/p> <blockquote> \t...the HSE&rsquo;s official position that there is not just one but many surgeons who perform this operation locally means that the treatment abroad scheme pathway is a fool's errand.

N&iacute; raibh dr&aacute;ma scr&iacute;ofa agam riamh ach an oiread.<\/p><p>Bh&iacute; an sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir Cl&iacute;odhna N&iacute; Anluain ag lorg ban scr&iacute;bhneoir le Gaeilge.  Luaim &eacute; seo mar go dtaispe&aacute;nann s&eacute; an tsl&iacute; a oibr&iacute;onn an ch&oacute;ras sin do scr&iacute;bhneoir agus go l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; an t&aacute;bhacht agus an tionchar at&aacute; ag institi&uacute;id&iacute; cos&uacute;il le hAmharclann de h&Iacute;de ar n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&oacute; leibh&eacute;al amh&aacute;in.  Is m&oacute;r an trua agus an scannal &eacute; nach bhfuil an comp&aacute;ntas sin ann a thuilleadh agus nach bhfuil aon amharclann Ghaeilge againn sa chathair.  Bh&iacute;odh &eacute;ileamh ar na dr&aacute;ma&iacute;.<br\/><br\/>Is &eacute; an rud a tharla i mo ch&aacute;s pearsanta n&aacute; gur chuir m&eacute; an dr&aacute;ma seo le ch&eacute;ile.  N&iacute;or sh&iacute;l m&eacute; go raibh s&eacute; r&oacute;-iontach, ach bh&iacute; s&eacute; ar si&uacute;l sa Ph&eacute;ac&oacute;g ar feadh seachtaine.  Bh&iacute; lucht f&eacute;achana an-mhaith i gceist an t-am ar fad agus bh&iacute; suim ag Gaeilgeoir&iacute; na cathrach teacht chuig na dr&aacute;ma&iacute; sin i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath, n&iacute; gach aon seachtain, ach bh&iacute;odh siad ar si&uacute;l ar feadh s&eacute;as&uacute;r seachtaine, n&oacute; bh&iacute;odh dh&aacute; sh&eacute;as&uacute;r bheaga ag an amharclann in aghaidh na bliana.  Tharla s&eacute; sin agus spreag sin m&eacute; chun dul ar aghaidh ag scr&iacute;obh i nGaeilge.  Chuir s&eacute; ionadh orm freisin gur chuir na scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute; Gaeilge eile agus an pobal Gaeilge sa chathair f&aacute;ilte romham mar scr&iacute;bhneoir B&eacute;arla.  Mhothaigh m&eacute; go raibh m&eacute; i measc mo threabh f&eacute;in agus sa bhaile agus gur thuig an pobal sin na tagairt&iacute; a bh&iacute; &aacute; nd&eacute;anamh agam.  N&iacute;orbh gh&aacute; dom aon rud a mh&iacute;ni&uacute; mar gur thuig siad nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag g&aacute;ire faoi <i>Peig<\/i>.  N&iacute; raibh m&eacute; ag g&aacute;ire faoi <i>Peig<\/i>ach faoina leith&eacute;id.  Thuig siad na tagairt&iacute; ar fad a rinne m&eacute; don bh&eacute;aloideas agus do na leabhair a bh&iacute; l&eacute;ite againn agus mar sin de.<br\/><br\/>Lean m&eacute; ar aghaidh ag scr&iacute;obh.  Scr&iacute;obh m&eacute; dr&aacute;ma eile ansin mar gur iarr duine &eacute;igin orm - foilsitheoir nach bhfuil ann a thuilleadh ach an oiread, Caoilfhionn Nic Ph&aacute;id&iacute;n &oacute; Chois Life - an mbainfinn triail as &uacute;rsc&eacute;al a scr&iacute;obh.  Rinne m&eacute; &eacute; sin in 2004, <i>D&uacute;nmhar&uacute; sa Daingean<\/i>, agus s&iacute;lim gurbh fh&iacute;or a r&aacute; gur chuir s&eacute; sin t&uacute;s leis an saghas faisin at&aacute; ann chun &uacute;rsc&eacute;al bleachtaireachta a scr&iacute;obh i nGaeilge san aois seo.<br\/><br\/>Chun rud eile a lua m&aacute;s f&eacute;idir liom, n&iacute;or scr&iacute;obh mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann ficsean i nGaeilge san fhichi&uacute; haois.  Scr&iacute;obhadh b'fh&eacute;idir 300 &uacute;rsc&eacute;al i nGaeilge san fhichi&uacute; haois - n&iacute;l m&eacute; cinnte amach is amach faoin bhfigi&uacute;r sin - ach orthu sin bh&iacute; thart f&aacute; dheich d&iacute;obh si&uacute;d scr&iacute;ofa ag mn&aacute;.

Is cine&aacute;l bestseller a bh&iacute; i gceist i <i>D&uacute;nmhar&uacute; sa Daingean<\/i>, aisteach go leor, toisc go bhfuair s&eacute; bolscaireacht.  B'fh&eacute;idir nach bolscaireacht an focal ceart ach fuair s&eacute; l&eacute;irmheasanna sna me&aacute;in chearta, is &eacute; sin, na me&aacute;in Bh&eacute;arla, toisc go raibh saghas aitheantais orm cheana f&eacute;in mar scr&iacute;bhneoir.<br\/><br\/>T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach sna leabhair i nGaeilge go dtabharfar aitheantas d&oacute;ibh agus go gcl&uacute;d&oacute;far iad sna me&aacute;in Bh&eacute;arla agus n&iacute; tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin den chuid is m&oacute; de.  N&iacute; fhaigheann Gaeilgeoir&iacute; amach - n&iacute;l m&oacute;r&aacute;n d&iacute;obh ann - go bhfuil leabhar ann mura bhfuil l&eacute;irmheas san <i>The Irish Times<\/i>n&oacute; ar &ldquo;Arena&rdquo; le Se&aacute;n Rocks n&oacute; ar rud mar sin, go h&aacute;irithe, nuair a smaoin&iacute;tear ar an bpobal ar a raibh Tadhg Mac Dhonnag&aacute;in ag caint faoi, is &eacute; sin, na daoine at&aacute; lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht agus na daoine a bhfuil go leor Gaeilge acu le go bhf&eacute;adfaid&iacute;s leabhar simpl&iacute; a l&eacute;amh.

T&aacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; seo sna hollscoileanna le 20 bliain anuas sa scr&iacute;bhneoireacht chruthaitheach, &aacute;it a bhfuil MAs n&oacute; PhDs ann.

Our guests, witnesses and those joining us in the Gallery are all very welcome today.  I have received apologies from Deputies Fitzpatrick and Munster and Senator Cassells.<\/p> <p>  I welcome our guests.  We have representatives from Rethink Ireland, the FAI, UEFA and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, to discuss social outcome contracts in Irish sport.  As I outlined, this meeting has been convened in committee room 1 with representatives from those organisations, whom I sincerely and warmly welcome on behalf of the committee.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Liam McGroarty, strategy manager with UEFA, is very welcome.  From the FAI, I welcome Mr. David Courell, chief operating officer, and Mr. Ger McDermott, director of grassroots football.  I also welcome Rethink Ireland's chief executive officer, Ms Deirdre Mortell, who is joined by her colleague, Mr. Mario Vottero, who joins us via Microsoft Teams.  Finally, I welcome UNESCO chair manager, Ms Catherine Carty.  I think we have included everybody.  Our guests are very welcome.<\/p> <p>  We are getting used to doing things in person again, which is great.  Some of our colleagues may join us from their offices via Microsoft Teams so witnesses may see some people on the screens or some may be here in person.  We have a speaking rota and, obviously, the D&aacute;il and Seanad are sitting so people will come and go.  It is no disrespect to the witnesses or their presentations; it is just how things happen in Leinster House.  Everything happens back-to-back.  The witnesses should not take any offence when people leave or anything like that; it is probably because another meeting is happening.  As I said, people will come in during the meeting as well so pass no remarks, as they say in Cavan.<\/p> <p>  I have a little bit of housekeeping to go through around Covid-19 and stuff like so I ask everyone to bear with me.  The format of the meeting today is that I will invite all of our witnesses to deliver their opening statements, which are limited to three minutes.  These will be followed by questions from my committee colleagues.  As witnesses are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on its website.  To limit the risk of the spread of Covid-19, the service encourages all Members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks in crowded settings on the campus.<\/p> <p>  Before I ask our witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I will explain some limitations regarding parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or of those who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  There are also witnesses who may be giving evidence remotely from outside the parliamentary precincts, however, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.

T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm seans a bheith agam labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  UEFA has engaged academics, econometricians and industry experts to quantify in financial terms the value of amateur football in more than 40 countries.  The UEFA social return on investment, SROI, model assesses 30 different social, health and education outcomes by gender, age and frequency of participation.  To date, the model has been freely shared with other sports, including Irish rugby, Finnish basketball, football and floorball, and European badminton.  It has received endorsements from the UN, WHO, the Council of Europe and the EU as the best evaluation tool in sport today.<\/p> <p>  Being able to quantify in financial terms the impact of physical activity in a very granular way means it is possible to put values on very specific outcomes for specific cohorts of people.  It opens the door for private investors to invest in social outcomes.  This financial instrument is called a social outcome contract, SOC.  Since 2019, the European Investment Bank, EIB, has been investing in SOCs.  Upon assessing the UEFA SROI model, the EIB has committed to testing the feasibility of a SOC in sport in two member nations.<\/p> <p>  A SOC is the reverse of grant funding that is awarded based on outputs written in a grant application and scored by a committee or individual.  A SOC begins with identifying a social issue that needs an innovative solution.  Funding is secured from the private sector.  If the desired outcomes are achieved, only then does the public sector pay the agreed rate.  The private investor bears all the risk.  There has been significant investment in sport at national and local level over recent decades, but the same hard-to-reach target groups remain inactive.  Most sports are designed from a sporting perspective, with athlete development and competition structures receiving the bulk of human and financial investment at local and national levels.<\/p> <p>  Sport, by default, delivers on many social outcomes.  However, it is not common to see sport designed specifically with social outcomes as the primary objective and the primary focus of funding or investment.  It is more difficult for clubs from disadvantaged areas to access grant funding.  A SOC provides the expertise and opportunities to address this deficit.  I will give an example.  Bright Star Boxing Academy in the UK was formed in 2016.  It was staffed by three volunteers and affected 80 children.  In 2020, it benefited from a SOC, receiving &pound;150,000 of capital to deliver on four social outcomes.  Today, it has 13 full-time employees, operates four sites and affects more than 400 children.  It has a turnover of more than &pound;500,000 and it generates profits.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, the national sports policy rightly divides sport into competitive and recreational sport.  The policy speaks about deepening evidence and knowledge on the value of <\/p> <p>sport.  It expresses the intention to develop investment evaluation models tailored to the Irish context and to collaborate beyond the sporting sector.  The values that underpin its vision are that funding needs to be based on outcomes, and monitoring and evaluation is critical to that.  Achieving the ambitions of the policy will require estimated funding of &euro;220 million annually by 2027, which is double what was provided in 2017.  A multi-annual funding commitment is advised and the policy also recognises the need to secure additional private investment.<\/p> <p>  SOCs are completely in line with the sports policy.  Three developments can attest to this alignment.  First, the FAI and the IRFU have applied the world's best social impact tool in sport in this country.  Second, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has committed to collaborate with sport and pay for social outcomes in two local authorities on a pilot basis.  Third, Rethink Ireland can generate the private investment to set up a pilot SOC in sport today.<\/p> <p>  To finish, I will describe in concrete terms what a SOC in sport could look like.  The annual cost of treating type 2 diabetes in this country is &euro;6,600 per adult.  Science shows there is a 50% reduction in the disease in people who are physically active.  Let us say there are 20 adults in a community who have been assessed by their GP as being prediabetic.  If a qualified coach is contracted to provide six hours of sport per week for these people, 66% of them will not become diabetic, which will save the State &euro;30,000 per year.  The coach will earn &euro;10,000 that he or she did not get before and the club will receive money for renting its facilities.  The State will save at least &euro;10,000 as a consequence of the provision of this single health benefit for a tiny group that is currently under-represented in sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam McGroarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGroarty for his insightful contribution.

Growing evidence of the powerful impact of sport-based investment makes sport a core development tool, an enabler of the UN's sustainable development goals and a strong proposition for enabling societies to build back better after the Covid-19 crisis.  Investment outcomes are evidenced from data built from the bottom up, that is, from local implementation in grassroots sport.  Thanks to innovative financing strategies, outcomes data can now create scalable, inter-sectoral and inter-agency funding opportunities, stimulating real opportunities at the grassroots level.<\/p> <p>  Through its new global alliance, Fit for Life, UNESCO is creating innovative opportunities for newcomers to realise this full investment potential.  Fit for Life is a world-class international consortium that researches the impact of sport participation while growing its data bank of research.  It delivers robust SROI data to create low-risk, outcomes-based investment opportunities to scale up funding in this area.  Central to the Fit for Life programme are SOCs, which offer potential partners, such as development banks, an effective, measurable framework to build capacity and promote sustainable development.<\/p> <p>  SOCs represent a powerful new vision for sport investment and a win-win-win proposition for investors.  SOC data accurately predict the multi-sectoral cost savings of a sports-based implementation. This risk-averse approach allows governments and investors to pay only for outcomes recorded and verified independently.  Early adopters, including governments, development banks and philanthropic organisations, are already tapping into this market, piloting proof-of-concept SOCs, building local data and preparing to scale up their investment.  The most advanced of UNESCO's SOC projects is a partnership with the Development Bank of Latin America, CAF.  UEFA's chair at Munster Technological University, MTU, is collaborating with CAF on this pilot initiative.  This SOC targets the priority areas of disability, equal access and inclusion in physical activity.<\/p><p>Ireland is well-positioned to become a champion in outcomes-based investments in sport for development by partnering with UNESCO and Fit for Life.  UNESCO and Fit for Life invite interested investors to support project development and scale up and pilot their own social outcomes contracts.  Contracts are flexible and developed based on critical outcomes relevant to the ministries overseeing sport, health, finance, education, inclusion and many other areas.<\/p><p> Ireland's national sports policy core values align entirely with this outcomes-based investment approach.  Both are evidence-led and outcomes-focused.  Both prioritise monitoring, evaluation and accountability, promote inclusion and seek to foster collaboration within and beyond the sports sector.  Partnering with Fit for Life is an ideal way for Ireland to advance national objectives using a win-win-win investment approach at the cutting edge of sport for development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Carty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":654,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Carty.

We bring together philanthropy raised from multinational and indigenous companies, private donors, families and anywhere else we can think of, together with Government funds, to tackle Ireland's critical social and environmental issues.  We do that through providing grants and, critically, capacity-building supports to non-profit organisations, some of which are charities and some of which are not, at grassroots level around Ireland where they have developed an innovation that tackles a critical social or environmental issue.  We have raised &euro;85 million in the last seven years to do that.  We have backed over 300 projects to grow in scale across the country.  We have a significant track record as Rethink Ireland in public-private partnerships.<\/p> <p>  We are also a trusted partner of the Government, having been established by it - although we are independent.  We are a non-profit and a charity ourselves.  Our Government funding tends to come - through the Dormant Accounts Fund - from the Department of Rural and Community Development, with which we work very closely.  We also work with other Departments, however.  Really, we see our role as supporting Departments to solve their policy implementation challenges where backing innovation at grassroots level can help do so.<\/p> <p>  In 2021, the European Investment Bank, EIB, advisory hub agreed to fund a social outcomes contract feasibility study with the Government.  The client is the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, with Rethink Ireland facilitating this.  The main purpose is to assess the potential for the take-up of social outcomes contracts in Ireland.  It is divided into two phases.  Phase 1 is complete, which is an overview and assessment, and phase 2 is just about to start, which is an outline for a specific pilot project, which is why we are here to talk to the committee today.  We can learn so much from other countries.  What I mean by that is we do not have to invent this wheel.  As an example, there have been 227 social outcomes contracts in the world that have raised more than &euro;500 million.  We are currently finalising that pilot.  We know there is limited public-private collaboration in this country and this has the potential to unleash it.<\/p> <p>  Most importantly, what can we do?  We have experience in Rethink Ireland in supporting social innovation in sports.  We are a partner on the feasibility study and a trusted partner of both Government and philanthropy.  The kinds of outcomes we can look forward to are improved health and wellness physically, improved self-image and confidence emotionally, and participation, friendships and community and civic engagement in terms of social outcomes, all of which we need to see much more.  If we keep doing the same things, we are going to get the same results.  This is an opportunity to break out and try something different based on international learning and the capacity we have across these organisations in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Mortell"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mortell.

It has a real impact on different individuals in communities and their well-being, as well as playing a social justice role with social outcomes contracts.  For instance, we had the campaign to stamp out racism in sport, which is very good.<\/p> <p>  In terms of measurements and metrics, how are social outcomes monitored?  I have a fear about the smaller clubs.  How do they get a look in?  Is there a mechanism or do the witnesses' organisations have experts to go through the system with the people who are involved?

The first part was about the measurements and metrics we use.  We follow the UN sustainable development goals, SDGs, and the indicators developed by the UN on the goals relating to sport.  We follow a very standardised approach.  There are approximately 30 different metrics.  The academics and econometricians who sit behind the model are the best in the world in terms of the best way to do this.  It is not easy because most econometricians look for causality - if one does A then B happens.  That is very had to prove so they have come up with a method of doing that, which we have shared with UNESCO, the World Health Organization, the UN and so on.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second point, which was really good, was about small clubs that might be run by volunteers and how they measure their impact.  They barely have time to make registrations up for players etc.  We have cascaded this model right down to a club level.  In Finland, 600 clubs are using this system.  The data is pulled from the national system.  For all the athletes who are on national systems in Finland, that data is pulled through application programming interfaces, APIs, so that when a club secretary logs on, all the players and coaches from that club are already in the system.  They can add in new elements like the cost of electricity or of a physiotherapist, or if there is an over-45s walking group or an over-60s football group.  They can add additional elements.<\/p> <p>  The idea is that the tool is designed for local use.  Today in Ireland, local football clubs are using it.  A local sports partnership, LSP, is starting to use it, as are rugby clubs.  It is absolutely right that it has to be used at the local level.  They are the people who deliver the outcomes and they are the ones who should be the recipients of the investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam McGroarty"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGroarty.

Mr. McGroarty referred to Big Society Capital, which is the main funder of social outcomes contracts in the UK.  It comes out of the Government although it is independent.  It is similar to Rethink Ireland.  It has had 22 social outcomes contracts in the past ten years that generated &euro;1.418 billion in value.  The benefit to cost ratio was 10:1.  This means that every pound spent by the UK commissioners to generate social value generated &pound;10 worth of value.  This is how the economics or cost-benefit analysis works.<\/p> <p>  To take it down to the grassroots, what Rethink Ireland does is manage the contracts between all of the various stakeholders, including the Government funder that only pays if the outcome is achieved, the investors who put in the money upfront and take the risk, the delivery partner, which could be a football club, sports club or athletics club that does the hard work, and an independent verifier.  It is not as though a football club just states it has achieved the outcome.  There is an independent verifier, trusted by all parties, to state that the football club did so, which the investors, the Government and ourselves believe.  The independent verifier stating this means the outcomes are met and the Government should pay.  If the outcomes are not met, the Government does not have to pay.  This is the risk the investors take.<\/p> <p>  The problem it solves for Government is that it is very difficult for to invest in the future because budgets are annual in nature.

There is a different clientele with different connections and networks.  A social outcomes contract would go into O'Devaney Gardens to see what it could effect very quickly in terms of increasing physical activity for various segments in society.  They might look at men aged over 60 and decide they want to make sure they are physically more active than they are at present.  The social outcomes contract operates best in an under-represented area because there is more return for the investor.  The traditional grant system is not as effective in such an area because it does not have the wherewithal to make the grant application or the support services.  This is why it would be effective in such an area.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the question on the FAI and the IRFU applying the best model, UEFA designed the model over the past four years using many academics and a huge amount of literature from around the world.  The FAI took all of this data.  We got all of the information on health metrics, education metrics and unemployment.  We applied these to the generic model, as was done in rugby.

I thank the Deputy for the questions.  Concerning his comment on the sports capital programme, there is an analogy here with where the development banks' programming was at several years ago.  They are very interested stakeholders in the SOC model.  Development banks and their initial funding model used to focus on infrastructural development in developing countries, but that has now changed and broadened.  Those development banks now recognise the need to change how they finance initiatives.  They want to go more into a programming space, given the developments in recent years.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the sports capital programme, which has been extremely successful and changed the availability of facilities across the country, a diversity of input into the programming component would also be very welcome.  We hear this a great deal from the marginalised population groups.  While the infrastructure may be in place for access to sport, those groups have specifically stated that the barriers they experience are often not overcome by the addition of infrastructural developments.  Therefore, linking into the social outcomes would be a strong addition to the sports capital programme.  Returning to the example of the development banks, and the context where they used to invest just in the capital aspect of projects, those institutions are now investing in programmes alongside capital investment to address things like equality, diversity, marginalisation, human rights and all those areas.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to the Deputy&rsquo;s mention of gambling, one of the issues regarding the social outcome contracts and the link Mr. McGroarty mentioned to the sustainable development goals and indicators is that integrity, good governance, better governance and new standards in sport are all part and parcel of the delivery of the social outcome contract.  In essence, therefore, the initiative should hopefully elevate all aspects of sports from participation to inclusion, but also the governance and integrity side.  Even from volunteers' point of view, contact with and reach into that domain will change how people perceive their responsibilities and roles in sport and, hopefully, make it possible to address the gambling issue through that route.<\/p> <p>  On the national sports policy, there is mention in the current action plan from 2022 to 2024 of the role of MTU&rsquo;s UNESCO chair as a critical stakeholder in reflecting the importance of international work in measuring the contribution of sport to the UN's sustainable development goals.  It assigns responsibility, alongside the Department, to MTU's UNESCO chair and demonstrates interest in this two-year period alongside that.  As Mr. McGroarty said, the SOCs are entirely aligned with the UN sustainable development agenda, which in turn is entirely aligned with a human rights-based approach that is designed to touch on marginalised population groups and how they may access and experience sport nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#E01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Carty"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":684,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Griffin finished?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#E01400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":685,"content":"<p>Yes<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#E01500","speaker":"1581"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":686,"content":"<p>We try to give people as much time as they need.

It will be the clubs that would apply through some sort of process that it is hoped Rethink Ireland or another body would run, and they would be either awarded that money directly or potentially via LSPs to deliver on the ground.

UEFA is very heavily involved in that example as is UNESCO.  It is paralympics sport we are working through to deliver the sporting opportunities and they will be across a range of sports in that context.  The partnership is broader than that.<\/p> <p>  On the point about the ethics, there is some guidance established internationally.  We do a lot of work with the WHO.  Ms Mortell alluded to it, but one can establish broad criteria such as no work with arms and tobacco companies, which would typically be WHO's main standard.  Those types of standards can be put in place for anything that operates in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I also mentioned the Fit for Life initiative that UNESCO is using to promote this approach internationally.  By becoming a part of that initiative, Ireland has the opportunity to garner the expertise from other SOCs that are operational around the world, leverage that expertise and contribute to it.  As was mentioned previously, there is a lot of Irish contribution into the development internationally.  Learning from others, being a part of a global movement in this area and garnering the expertise are on the table.<\/p> <p>  There is also linking to initiatives.  We mentioned inter-agency collaboration and cross-departmental collaboration.  There are projects we are examining at present in terms of their capacity to deliver on this, and perhaps beyond grassroots sport to physical activity opportunities to be active.  We are currently developing a project looking at people with enduring mental illness, particularly schizophrenia bipolar condition.  We know from some pilot work that was conducted that the readmission rates to hospital for people engaging even in small amounts of physical activity show quite a return on investment for that type of activity.  We are looking across the range from getting people active to various different types of sport engagement for this type of thing.  By getting on board this initiative and this novel financial instrument, which is taking a hold internationally, we can benefit from that expertise and bring that to hold in Ireland to address some of the challenges we have had over the years in sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Carty"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I want to follow up on something Deputy Andrews asked.

It is good to see representatives from Rethinking Ireland here as well.  When we talk about sport in Ireland, we look at all the positives at local level.  We are fortunate.  We have GAA pitches, we have had a successful sports capital programme down the decades, and the physical structure is quite good compared with different countries.  We are playing catch-up with countries like France which invests &euro;40 billion of Government and private funding in its sports facilities.<\/p><p>I would like to get the witnesses' thought on access.  Invariably, when a club leads on an application, there are criteria in the application saying the facilities will be used within the community and accessed by all the community, but in some instances that does not happen.  I do not mean sports facilities <i>per se<\/i>.  I am talking about schools as well.  Every new primary or secondary school built now has a gymnasium.  What percentage of them are closed at 3 p.m.or 4 p.m.?  What sort of forward thinking has gone into the area of physical activity, nutrition and the curriculum, especially in light of the new leaving certificate programme where physical education is on the curriculum in many schools on a pilot basis?  That eventually will be rolled out nationally.  Since Covid, primary school children are in the yard much more during break time and even class time in some instances.  The value of physical education has never been more accepted as an important factor in a child's development, not just in a sporting sense.<\/p><p>The first thing to accept is we need more investment.  Even though we have a good standard and infrastructure to an extent, we can go further, especially when we look at a lot of municipal facilities in the North.  If you go to a GAA tournament or cross the Border from Lifford into Strabane, there are many communal sports facilities there.  Whether it is athletics, soccer, Gaelic games or rugby, there is a sharing of facilities.  How will this model incorporate that vision and take access into consideration, including access for all sports to shared facilities, as well as gender and age inclusivity?<\/p><p>I recently hit the half century.  Senator Blaney and I used to kick lumps out of each other on a football pitch between Glenree and Whitestrand.  When we hit the ripe old age of 30 or the early 30s, we all gave up sport.  We talk about health, longevity and people's improving health standards.  How many people have been active sportspeople and eventually get to a stage where they are not active anymore?<\/p><p>How does the model look at access, age and gender inclusivity or is it left to the clubs?  Is it hands-off?  Is it just a mechanism, a construct and a way of attracting private investment?  Is it just looking at those criteria, or is part of the model about encouraging access and inclusivity?  No doubt Ms Carty and Ms Mortell's organisations would be into that in terms of their philosophy.

I was always glad I was playing on Senator Blaney's team, as opposed to Deputy McHugh's team that kept kicking lumps out of people.<\/p> <p>  We have the same evidence about the facility.  A little boy or girl in Moscow competes with 80,000 other boys and girls for a place on the football pitch.  A little boy or girl in Mayo competes with 1,200.  We have analysed the football facilities across Europe and we punch above our weight.  The investment by the State in facilities has been fantastic.  Facilities are not the big challenge.  At the heart of it, as Deputy Mythen and the Chair mentioned, is that at the club level we are reliant on volunteers.  An SOC allows us to professionalise a workforce that will support volunteers to do more and better.<\/p><p>That is one point on access.<\/p><p> The second point is on the Bright Star Boxing Academy in England.  Their biggest learning was that the boxing club was not close enough to the kid who needed it.  The way we have designed our facilities today is that they are often outside of the town.  A developer will have bought the inner city area and built a block of flats.  Now, the elderly and young people who live there cannot access a facility because it is two or three miles away.  The under-represented people will not go looking for that physical activity.  We have to bring it to them.  The biggest investment by the boxing club was in buses.  They were able to bus the children from the disadvantaged areas and make sure they got to the boxing club.  Access is about more people who are a bit more professional and who can administer, promote and encourage physical activity for lifelong engagement.  As the Deputy said, the way sport is designed today is we want to get the best people as quickly as possible and everybody else does the best they can.  We need to design it for our elderly people.  We are becoming more elderly.  We are living healthier lives for longer.  We need that physical activity.  The second point is about buses.<\/p><p> On the other piece about data and evidence, and the national sports policy speaks about this, we are not capturing enough data and evidence to say what is impactful and makes more people be physically active.  We have to be better at how we capture data by using better technology and social media to track who is using our facilities.  There are a great number of facilities today that are lying empty for most of the hours in the day when the elderly could be using them.  Schools could open their grounds on the weekends, and so on.  That point is around data and usage.  Monitoring insights on that would be good too.  Perhaps Ms Carty might like to speak on the inclusion piece.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr.  Liam McGroarty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":708,"content":"<p>On the inclusion piece, there have been gradients in participation in Ireland over the years.  There has been some improvement in that, but it is by no means at a level we would like.  We are in the process of concluding a project with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, where we had discussions with a wide range of marginalised population groups on their access to sport in Ireland.  We are not at the stage where that access is anywhere near where it needs to be across disability, ethnic minorities, Traveller populations, low-income groups and a range of population groups who experience marginalisation.  There is a lot of work to be done in that.<\/p> <p>  There is a human capacity gap here.  Mr. McGroarty mentioned professionalising the workforce.  We would welcome that as well.  There is a new policy due out, it is hoped imminently, on education for sustainable development.  That approach, which aligns with the SDG indicators Mr. McGroarty mentioned, and given the SOC is built around that data, will change how those working in the sector in Ireland can embrace inclusion.  At the moment, much of the work we do to ensure the workforce, or even the volunteers, can work with marginalised populations is based on a cohort of people in that sector who have not really dealt in their pre-vocational training with working with marginalised populations.  The approach of education for sustainable development, which is a new policy emerging from the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will address this.<\/p> <p>  We have also developed a programme that is free and available for volunteers and sports clubs around the community to address this competence within the staff and volunteers who work with them.  It is called TRUST: Sport as it should be - fun, fair, clean, safe, equitable and accessible.  That is available to support those staff who want to know how they can include someone with a disability or how they can ensure their sport offer is available throughout the life course at all levels.  That is something we want to do.<\/p> <p>  The Fit for Life programme, which I mentioned, is by UNESCO, is about health, sport and education partnerships.  Again, that brings together the expertise that is needed to address these inequalities.  Inequality is at the forefront of that development.  It is one of the main principles of the sustainable development agenda, which means leaving no one behind.  It is a case of building that capacity and that we cannot really say we are developing if we are continuing to leave people behind and leaving people out of the loop.  It is a policy priority of that agenda globally that has been embraced on the international level and, indeed, in the Irish national policy that seeks to address inclusion gradients and access gradients.  It is one that needs work, but addressing that capacity within those who emerge from programmes and courses that equip people to work in the sports sector is where we need to fill that so that we no longer retrofit inclusion and rather arm people with the competence to deal with it.<\/p> <p>  People going into work in the sports sector sometimes tell us they do not feel confident or competent to include beyond what was traditionally a mainstream population.  They feel a little lost.  It is a matter of building that competence and confidence to enable people, everyone from a volunteer to someone emerging from a university programme, to be competent and to feel happy to work with these population groups.  When they do that, it is a positive experience.  It impacts positively on the organisation, on the individual and on the families of people who have disabilities or others who feel themselves marginalised.  As Mr. McGroarty said, reaching out to those communities is something that came through strongly from the work we did with IHREC recently on the TRUST project.  They are not going to come to you.  Sports clubs throughout the country say they are open for everyone, but until the perception is there among these population groups that they are genuinely open for everyone and have something to offer, they will not rock up to their sports offer on a Saturday morning and expect to be included.  They need to go to where these people are and invite them.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is social values and social outcome.  The social component of that sport engagement is critically important for this population group.  It is what enables them to integrate into their communities and to feel involved and welcome.  They need to be involved and welcome at all levels, not just as a player or participant, but in making decisions within the club, being on the board and getting involved at all levels.  They are some of the outcomes that can be built into this.  The impact of that extends from their involvement in sports participation into their willingness to engage with education, with the rest of their community, with the workforce and with other aspects.  It has a huge multiplier effect.  That is the value of that social outcome.<\/p> <p>  The Fit for Life initiative and engagement with that will help to bring those tools to the grassroots organisations and to the policy level in Ireland to enable us to look at how best to mobilise this nationally.  That would be a good way to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Carty"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":709,"content":"<p>I feel we are all going to be leaving this meeting with a Donegal accent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#H00400","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":710,"content":"<p>You could have a worse one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#H00500","speaker":"1633"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":711,"content":"<p>Exactly, you could have a Cork accent.

Many of the investors are social investors who genuinely care about the outcomes, and there is philanthropic funding as well.  There is a mixture of funding.  At the end of the day, because new money is being offered for new outcomes for people who currently do not get those outcomes through the sports sector, you will have an easier conscience with the private investor making a bit of money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam McGroarty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I have two answers to that.  In the first one, and I am sort of repeating what Mr. McGroarty just said, is it ethical that people do not have access at the moment?  I would turn the question round.  That would be my first answer.  On the second, looking at inclusion in sports and at social outcomes, it has been very difficult to target funding there in a way that is effective and impactful in Ireland.<\/p><p>There are a couple of reasons.  One of them is that sport is not a charitable objective and therefore the deployment of philanthropy, in particular, into sport at local level has been limited.  I do not want to say there are no cases where this has happened.  Of course, we all know where there are cases.   However, if we look at other countries, the scale of deployment of philanthropy into sport at club level is nowhere compared to a number of other countries.  The way we see it, this is another tool in the toolbox of how to get finance into inclusive sports at local level.  Whether they are marginalised communities, people who do not typically participate in sports or whatever other type of marginalised group it is, we need more tools in our toolbox and this is one of them.<\/p><p> There is no guarantee that this would happen, but what has happened a number of times in other countries is that for pilots in particular, it is social investors rather than commercials who come to the table.  An example would be from the UK, where it has often been existing foundations that have endowments and are investing their endowments anyway for a return in order to make grants out of those endowments.  They are looking for that 5% or 10% or whatever it is that year, so why would they not divert that from some kind of an asset fund into a social investment?  They are still getting the investment, but they are putting their mission on the line.  There are times when that kind of diversion is quite effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Mortell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I am very conscious of time as I am running out of it.

We can then look at the health sector and cost of treating osteoporosis.  The intervention we put in place, the contact we put in place with the private investor, the rate of returns and so on, will be much less than the cost to the State.

If a group with a very high-level, excellent, multipurpose, multisport project, which is trying to cater for many different needs across gender, ability etc., is begging for scraps, it may have to scale that project way down.

The social outcome contract, SOC, is bringing in new investment for the purpose of developing the grassroots so that there is a much wider base and it is affecting more people.  That will have an effect on high performance at a later stage and will increase performances.  However, that is not the goal.  The primary goal is that more people will be able to access sport in a way that will affect their health, education and employment outcomes.  It will affect them on a much different level.  It is new investment specifically for that outcome.  The sports club is then designed to do that, as opposed to just doing it by default, and it is measured to do that.

The format of the meeting is such that I will invite opening statements of no more than three minutes from our witnesses, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  As witnesses are probably aware, the committee will publish their opening statements on its website following today's meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before I invite witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I will explain some of the limitations relating to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references they make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses who are giving evidence remotely from outside the parliamentary precincts may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if they make potentially defamatory remarks, they will be directed to discontinue.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I propose that we proceed with the opening statements in the following order.

I am delighted to be here.  For the record, I am here in my capacity as an independent academic researcher reporting on research I have done that facilitates the voice of hospitality workers.  I am not affiliated to, or funded by, any hospitality employer, body or trade union.  I am simply here to report on the lived experience of hospitality workers through their own testimonies.  My motives are, first, to give voice to hospitality workers and, second, to provoke a conversation that will lead to positive change.  If there is one message I would leave with the committee in its search for answers regarding labour shortages, it is to find a way to give silenced hospitality workers a voice because they have a unique and critical perspective on what is wrong and how to make it right.<\/p> <p>  I will outline a couple of statistics.  Some 68% of hospitality workers are paid less than the current living wage, 33% of them disagreed that the hours they work are acceptable, 62% do not get a Sunday premium, and 33% do not receive bank holiday pay.  Those statistics are from F&aacute;ilte Ireland's own research.  We are at a tipping point, if members will pardon the pun.  We have had problems with hospitality conditions for years.  Now that there is a labour shortage we have the attention of hospitality employers.  I have listened very carefully to the contribution of hospitality employers and employers from the vintners' sector.  While I agree with much of what they say, some of it is short-term, fracture-filling quick fixes.  There are some things I have concerns about, such as permits to bring in non-EU workers or labour, or proposals to increase the tourism marketing fund.<\/p><p>While these may address short-term labour shortages, they will only contribute to the problem in the long term.<\/p><p> One of the research projects I am writing up is an in-depth exploration of why some hospitality workers chose to remain in the sector during  the pandemic and why others chose to leave.  Of the people with whom I spoke, approximately two thirds chose to stay while one third chose to leave.  Of the ones who stayed, one third moved to different employers.  The research consisted of an online survey, audio files and in-depth interviews.  One of the questions asked was if the person was in front of a Government task force, what would he or she state were the challenges from his or her perspective.  Here are a few of the challenges: being overworked and overwhelmed; working hours versus actual hours worked; post-pandemic insecurity of employment; having to compensate for untrained new recruits; bad behaviour from customers; and inflation.  The participants were also asked for recommendations.  The list of recommendations in my submission is really the answer to labour shortages.  This is from actual hospitality workers.  The recommendations include raising awareness and addressing bullying; giving staff sufficient rest; giving workers a voice; allowing wage progression; training managers; giving people additional benefits; and fair treatment and equality .  The list goes on and is published in my brief.  There are so many things that need to change.  Hospitality workers know what these things are and how to change them but nobody is listening.  Until we address those issues, we will not find a long-term solution to the labour shortage.  Of the people with whom I spoke, only one had a job that met the features of decent work as per the International Labour Organization and this person does not work in Ireland.  Most people will tell you that things have got worse post pandemic.  If people left, it was a decision of the head rather than the heart.<\/p><p> Another piece of research I am doing is a case study of good practice.  This involves a hotel that is claiming to offer a different and better employee proposition.  The emerging findings look really good.  If they are as good as they say they are, it will be an example of how you can treat people with dignity and respect, give them good working conditions and still make a very good profit.  A colleague of mine, Maureen Maloney, and final-year students at NUI Galway produced a project on the lived experience of hospitality and retail workers.  Six in ten agree with the statement \"My work schedule is changed at short notice\" while three in ten disagree with the statement \"I receive adequate time for breaks at work\".  Six in ten got no sick pay if they were off work sick and three in ten said they had experienced or observed workplace abuse.<\/p><p> In 2019, I carried out an in-depth study of the working conditions of hospitality workers.  The results were pretty depressing.  This was pre pandemic.  If anything, things have got worse since then.  The survey I designed in 2019 has since been replicated all over the world in ten different countries so there will be a database of working conditions from all over the world on which we can all draw.<\/p><p> To summarise, my recommendations arising from empirical research including acting on the excellent recommendations of workers contributing to research, having an overarching national body monitoring and enforcing standards and providing CERT-type training and a Q mark of good practice, promoting ethical leadership, a targeted Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, inspection campaign and investing in training over marketing.  Going into secondary schools and marketing hospitality as a great place to work is clearly not true and the money should be invested in making it a great place to work.  One of the last two recommendations involves having proper apprenticeships.  I am very much in favour of apprenticeships but they must include education on employment rights, how to protect yourself if something bad happens and resilience.<\/p><p> My final recommendation involves creating a platform for worker voice.  I urge members to use their influence to address the problems in hospitality that were here long before the pandemic in terms of working conditions, employee voice and low pay.  If we clean up the industry, and people who work there want to stay there, we can make it a place where they can stay and feel valued.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Curran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":747,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Curran for a very passionate presentation.

It is great to have such an independent voice here speaking on behalf of the sector and through lived experience.  You cannot argue with or beat that narrative, so I thank Dr. Curran.  I thank the committee for inviting us here today to discuss the issues around recruitment in the hospitality sector.<\/p> <p>  As a trade union that organises workers in the hospitality and tourism sector, Unite has been concerned for a number of years about the low standards facing workers in the sector.  We carried out a survey in 2020, the findings of which correlate with two other surveys, one by Dr. Curran and another by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, that revealed unacceptable levels of low pay, poor working conditions and a general lack respect in the sector for hospitality workers.  This disrespect has, unfortunately, been highlighted by ill-informed commentary by employers' representatives who rather than address the low pay in the sector attempt to deflect to a disingenuous claim about social welfare rates, in respect of which Ireland is lowest in its EU peer group.  In Unite's survey, 77.2% of respondents said that low pay was the biggest problem in the sector.  In the recent research by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, 62% of respondents said better basic pay would make the sector more attractive to them.<\/p> <p>  Our concerns about the standards in the sector were also raised during our union&rsquo;s campaign to stop tip theft.  The fact that workers need to rely on tips from customers in the first place is indicative of wages not being sufficient for people to live on.  The fact that some employers would confiscate those tips speaks to the levels of exploitation and disrespect that some workers face in the sector.<\/p> <p>  Unite believes that the crisis in recruitment in the sector has been exaggerated in some quarters in order to undermine conditions even further for workers and to resist wages increases in the face of rising inflation.  In fact, the Nevin Economic Research Institute has challenged these claims by simply monitoring job websites where hundreds of positions were being filled in under two weeks.  Notwithstanding this, we believe that low wages and precarious working conditions had an adverse effect on recruitment and retention in the sector for a number of years before the pandemic. <\/p> <p>  The gap between wages and living costs has been rising for decades.  It is unrealistic and unsustainable for people to physically exist while working in low-paid sectors.  In the first quarter of 2022, average rent in Ireland was at &euro;1,567 per month.  On the minimum wages that are on offer in the hospitality sector, someone would need to work 37.3 hours each week just to cover rent.  We should not take for granted the living arrangements of workers.  It is not the case that all workers have other supports, including family, or are sharing living costs with others. Full-time pay should be adequate for people to live independently.  Hourly rates need to reflect the living wage.  If it do not then it is in fact a non-living wage.  <\/p> <p>  Low pay rates also have a negative impact on recruitment from other EU countries.  Instead of increasing wages, employer groups are lobbying for work permits from outside the EU in order to pay minimum wages to economic migrants.  This is a race to the bottom that has the effect of shrinking the local economy.  Ireland has one of the cheapest labour costs in the EU.  Average hourly costs, including wages and employers' contributions, are lower in Ireland than any of our EU peer group.  While we have seen considerable State intervention in the sector over the years with tax reliefs, Government supports and the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, during Covid, we have not seen that trickle down to workers' pay.<\/p> <p>  While low pay is a major factor in recruitment and retention, we highlight the following as other contributing factors.  First, perceptions about the sector and who works in the sector are often misleading.  It is viewed by many employers and media commentators as low-skilled, temporary and seasonal and a job for students or younger people.  This is often used as an excuse for low wages and short-term hours and contracts.  The majority of workers in the sector are full time.  Ireland has high levels of educational achievement.  This raises job expectations that often cannot be matched in the sector.  Unite believes that all workers are skilled and that there are no unskilled workers.<\/p> <p>  Second, structural changes in the sector as a result of automation, particularly at the service end will erase and are already erasing job roles such as hotel receptionists.  This can make the sector unattractive to anyone looking for a long-term career path.<\/p> <p>  Third, the participation of women in the economy is vital.  Barriers must be removed in order that they can access the labour market on an equal footing.  The first step should be to address the gender pay gap and make it a thing of the past.  Access to affordable childcare and travel will also have a positive impact on the availability of people to participate in the labour market.<\/p> <p>  The fundamental problem in the sector is low pay.  Increasing wages, including premium and Sunday rates, will have a positive effect on recruitment as well as the local economy.  Conditions for workers in the sector need to be improved to ensure rights across the board to adequate breaks and rest periods, sick pay, holiday pay and full compliance with all other statutory rights for workers.<\/p><p>In addition to the above, what we believe will fundamentally change the position for workers in the sector is the establishment of full statutory collective bargaining rights and access rights for trade unions.  The absence of collective bargaining and trade union access has an adverse effect on all workers, especially those in precarious and low-paid employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rob Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly.

On behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the 800,000 workers we represent across the island of Ireland, I thank the Chair and the committee for the opportunity to speak to this topic.  My remarks today are supplemented by our briefing document submitted to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Data for the tourism and hospitality sector indicates it is characterised by low wages, increased part-time work and precariousness, and along with qualitative research and Workplace Relations Commission reports, we can add bad employment practices, breaches of employment law, exploitation and mistreatment to that list.  These facts alone make this sector a challenge for anyone considering applying to work within it, and if we add limited career pathways and progression, to us the reasons for the difficulties facing employers are self-evident.<\/p> <p>  Current labour force statistics indicate a growth in employment and a shift towards jobs with on-average higher wages but a recent Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, paper suggests shortages in this sector were not as previously indicated at 40,000, with employment during summer 2021 merely 1% below 2019 figures and the first quarter of 2022 figures indicating a reduction of just 3% during a time when the sector did not fully reopen until after the third week.<\/p> <p>  Improving the realities of working in the sector should be prioritised over perception abroad, where decent conditions, well-paid workers and good career prospects will result in better outcomes for workers and for business.  Instead, the sector seems fixated on low productivity, low value and low wages, resulting in it being the lowest paid out of 13 sectors with over half of the workers classed as low-paid, with the entire sector only accounting for 1.8% of gross value added to the Irish economy and one in 12 employees.  That is according to a NERI blog from last September.<\/p> <p>  In the past two years the sector has taken significant State support in taxpayers' money for business grants and employee subsidies and it continues to enjoy reduced VAT rates, the benefits of which are enjoyed by neither workers nor consumers.  There is acknowledgement of \"record levels of funding for the tourism sector\" by the Government in 2022 but there seems to be a lack of connection between the working environment and difficulties in recruitment and retention.  It is therefore illogical to allow State money to continue to subsidise and bolster businesses that ignore State employment legislation by evidence of breaches, disengage from the State's JLC system and effectively veto its operation, and employ workers on low wages and precarious contracts, thus forcing workers to rely on State subsidies in the form of HAP and other social welfare benefits rather than on earnings.<\/p> <p>  Congress believes employers who receive State subsidies and public moneys should, at a minimum, adhere to all employment legislation, engage in State collective bargaining structures and provide decent and sustainable employment terms and conditions.  At a recent hearing of this committee, Congress noted the industry comment made to \"convince school leavers that a viable career path exists in the pub sector\" and that \"students will go on to hold senior well-paid positions within the trade\".  We suggest that rather than trying to convince students of a viable career, the sector should provide clear data as evidence that bears out that the sector highly values employees through improved wages and terms and conditions and opportunities are created to attain lengthy well-paid careers in the industry.<\/p> <p>  This committee should therefore act on the following key recommendations to this end.  It should seek to strengthen the joint labour committee, JLC, system.  There is a clear urgency to rectify the legislation governing the JLC system, which has enabled employers to effectively veto the functioning of these committees, thus preventing engagement, negotiation and progress.  The committee should support calls to amend this legislation, which will afford all stakeholders the opportunity to negotiate best employment practice, prohibit competition on wages and thus prevent a race to the bottom in terms of employment conditions and employee welfare.  Past experience of the JLC system proves that it worked for employers, employees and the reputation and outcomes for the sector.  As a labour-intensive sector, the solution to these problems is not to seek new markets for low-paid employees but quite simply to improve the conditions for those providing the services, as all the evidence suggests.<\/p> <p>  We also recommend expanding the provision of apprenticeships.  The range of regulated apprenticeships should be expanded to provide ongoing development, decent levels of pay and clear career progression, which may help to eradicate the sector's current reputation as one of low wages and precariousness.  The sector should guarantee delivery of decent working conditions and pay commensurate with such qualifications, including the most recent addition, the bar manager degree apprenticeship.<\/p> <p>  We also recommend the improvement of legislative oversight.  The committee should explore all issues of non-compliance with employment legislation in the sector and ensure the hospitality sector is prioritised for inspection, the commitments already made regarding increasing the number of labour inspectors in the Towards 2016 national agreement are delivered and that the WRC increases the number and expands the remit of unannounced labour inspections.  That would no doubt inform further recommendations for action.<\/p> <p>  We also recommend improving wages in the sector.  It is particularly important for Ireland to increase wage floors, as the better option of negotiating wages across sectors is neither available through widespread collective bargaining nor through co-ordinated sectoral bargaining systems such as JLCs.  Given the cost-of-living crisis, the committee should press for a shorter implementation of the living wage, representing 66% of the median wage, which was the calculation for the national minimum wage back in 2000.  As noted in the briefing document, a significant increase in the minimum wage would have the effect of reducing employer costs, such as recruitment, retention and lost productivity costs, thereby also reducing pressure on prices.  Such increases aligned with consumer spending will help to protect enterprises through increased productivity.<\/p> <p>  Economic commentators have reiterated that increased wages will not fuel inflation further and therefore increasing wages will alleviate the danger of workers slipping further into poverty, help to address gender inequality and reduce the gender pay gap.  Inflation has skyrocketed, with the result that the cost of living has soared for all workers, but it has produced particular difficulties for those workers on low and minimum wages, making it much more difficult for them to make ends meet.<\/p> <p>  We also recommend that the committee supports the inclusion of all social partners in the implementation of the EU directive on minimum wages and collective bargaining because, as we know, wider collective bargaining coverage has a positive impact on wages and terms and conditions and produces excellent labour market outcomes.<\/p> <p>  Our final recommendation relates to inclusion of stakeholder engagement.  Congress and affiliates representing workers across the sector should be included as members in all sectoral stakeholder forums, such as the hospitality and tourism forum, F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s careers oversight group and any other such forums which may be established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Dunne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":752,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and members of the committee for the invitation, which we appreciate.  I will be reasonably brief.  In SIPTU we continue to represent workers in the hospitality sector.  Since the attack on the JLC for hospitality workers in the case of John Grace Fried Chicken Limited and Others <i>v<\/i>. Catering JLC in 2011, we have continuously sought the reintroduction of the JLC to protect the workers in the industry.  In 2012, under the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act, provision was made to reinstate the JLC for hospitality but, unfortunately, this has not progressed.<br\/><br\/>I will echo some of the statistics already shared.  Currently, 68% of those working in hospitality are paid under &euro;12 per hour, with 16% paid less than &euro;10 per hour.  Furthermore, staff have complained about not getting proper breaks and being on call when not required to work.  There are 62% of workers who do not receive a Sunday premium and 33% do not get any additional payments or additional holidays when working on a public holiday.  These statistics are supported by Bord F&aacute;ilte's own report from March this year.<br\/><br\/>The industry has bottomed out, with thousands of workers leaving the hospitality sector to take up employment elsewhere.  The issue is not only about recruitment; it is also about the retention of employees currently in employment.  What is the answer?  The employer bodies would have us believe that the solution, echoed every day now, is to provide thousands of additional visas for migrant workers.  They are also looking to increase beyond the current 20 hours the hours of work that foreign students coming to our country are allowed to work.<br\/><br\/>In October 2020, the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland conducted a survey by interviewing over 1,000 undocumented migrants in Ireland regarding employment rights.  The survey found that more than 25% of migrants who have lived here for five years or more were still not in receipt of the minimum wage.  Earlier this year Ireland was encouraged to join the EU employers sanction directive, which stops employers recruiting and ill-treating migrant workers, according to a report published on 11 January 2022.  Whether we want to accept it or not, we have a culture in Ireland which is recognised for certain levels of exploitation.  Therefore, we must ensure all workers are protected in their employment.  We totally agree that not every employer is a bad employer but ,unfortunately, experience to date indicates some will take advantage.  We are out of sync with our EU counterparts in hospitality on pay and conditions, as I indicated previously.<br\/><br\/>Never before was an employment regulation order and a JLC needed more in hospitality.<\/p><p>This would bring about the minimum pay and conditions of employment that all workers should work under.  Since the collapse of the JLC, the industry has been struggling to retain and engage new employees.  The answer is neither bringing in thousands of vulnerable workers into the culture of exploitation we have here in Ireland nor expecting foreign students to work beyond 20 hours per week.  The only solution is to put in place a floor on pay and conditions and make the hospitality sector attractive again for new entrants and those who are presently in employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Hynes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":754,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hynes for that bit of straight-talking towards the end.

I am proud of the union and happy to be associated with it.  We all know it.  The statistics are there.  Some 68% of staff in this industry are paid less than the minimum wage.  We are aware of the conditions.  The pandemic highlighted a lot of stuff.  For years, it was brushed under the carpet.  It is coming out now.  People have left the industry in their droves and have discovered there is more money out there to be earned.  I had an example of a sous chef.  The main chef left and he was put in charge.  He was working until 4 a.m.  His relationship with his partner was almost gone; he could not see her.  He had to order all the stuff in.  It was accepted that he did all that without any extra pay.  We are aware of the conditions there.<\/p> <p>  One of my party's answers - we would be definitely in favour of it - is collective bargaining.  That is the main issue here in the country.  We have had great trade union work along the whole way, from James Connolly and others.  The unions are still fighting the same fight which should not have to happen.  We should recognise that people have a right to association.  They have a right to join a union.  They have a right to be represented.  That does not really happen in the hospitality sector.  What is the most important recommendation our guests would propose to the Government in terms of legislation regarding workers' rights in this sector and what needs to be done to improve enforcement of workers' rights legislation with this industry?  Obviously, the JLC is a major issue, as is the veto that the employers have at present, which, as far as I am concerned, is totally wrong because you should be able to sit down and work out your conditions.  People have to live.  A living wage would benefit the country immensely.  I do not know why people do not see that.  Maybe those two questions would make a start.

That is absolutely key.  It is key for trade unions to have a right to access to speak to workers and to recruit workers in the sector.  It is a historical fact that trade unions have played a key role in combating inequality in our society and across the world.  That is a fact.  One of the things blocking us in Ireland - President Higgins referred to this not so long ago - is that we do not have decent trade union legislation on a par with that of our European neighbours.  We lag far behind.  The Industrial Relations Act 1990 has played a key role in blocking trade unions from access to workplaces and to collective bargaining.  They are the most important things from our perspective in terms of what we are talking about here today.  It is important to note, as some have referred to, that there are lobby groups looking to recruit from outside the EU to basically exploit migrant workers and lower the expectations in the sector for workers.  We need to note and be really aware of the fact that those workers will have to pay the same rents that Mr. Kelly referred to earlier and live in the same conditions that we live in on low pay.  It is not a sustainable answer.  In fact, it is the opposite.  It is more than a race to the bottom.  It is a race to social catastrophe.  That collective bargaining piece is the key issue for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Rhona McCord"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":758,"content":"<p>For me, breach of employment rights is one thing; abuse is a whole other level.  My bigger concern would be ill-treatment, the levels of bullying and harassment, and the lack of employee voice.  On the employment rights side, many hospitality workers do not know what their rights are.  We need an information campaign.  This is why I said that with apprenticeships we need to teach workers and prospective workers what their rights are.  If employment rights are breached, hospitality workers do not go looking for help.  They do not know that the WRC exists.  If they did, they would be too intimidated to go there.  I am all for collective bargaining but most hospitality workers are not members of a trade union.  In the absence of collective bargaining, we need to find another way for workers to have a voice.  Nobody is listening to them and they have so many positive things to say that would be of benefit to the industry, to customers and to everybody, but nobody is listening.  For me, the big issue is voice.  We need to find a way to tap in to the voice of hospitality workers who care about the industry, who want to stay and who are passionate about it.  When I ask workers what they like most about working in hospitality, the number one answer is \"people.\"  These are \"people\" people.  They love their colleagues.  They love working with customers.  The number two answer is the satisfaction of delivering good service and the number three answer is the buzz and the variety of the work they do.  They want to stay.  The industry needs to make it attractive for them to stay and to address the issues that have been there for decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Curran"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":759,"content":"<p>Not to cut across Deputy Mythen, can I tease that out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#O00700","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":760,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#O00800","speaker":"1621"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":761,"content":"<p>Dr. Curran said a significant amount of those workers are not members of unions.

When we had the JLC in hospitality, there was an onus on the employer to put up in the canteen what one's legal entitlements were, what was agreed under the JLC, and what was agreed with the unions and the employers' bodies through government and the court.  It was a way in which employees could see the minimum terms and conditions in their employment, but it has not appeared on a canteen wall since 2011.  As has been pointed out, it has gone beyond the race to the bottom.<\/p> <p>  Through SIPTU - it has been echoed here strongly with all the unions - and Congress, one of the strongest ways we can make sure that workers are protected, including migrant workers who will come into the country, whether through visas or any other way, is by putting in place the mechanism and framework of a JLC and starting those talks now.  It is a decade since it was vetoed.  The timing could never be more right.  In doing this, it will not only protect workers in the industry; it will also protect the employment.<\/p> <p>  I would like to make another point that Mr. Shevlin and I were talking about outside before we came in.  When we in SIPTU go in to negotiate a pay increase, one of the things that an employer will say to us is that if he or she gives us 4% or 5%, he or she is putting himself or herself at a disadvantage to the employer down the road.  This will put a floor in place to protect all employments.

It always strikes me when we talk about hospitality workers that there is a public perception they are all young, mostly students and working part-time.  There is an idea they are only working in the industry to supplement some other lifestyle, such as a student who needs to make extra money.  It is obvious, however, that this is not the case.  I worked in the hospitality sector for a long time and loved it, despite all the issues the witnesses have outlined today.  I had both great employers and brutal employers.  However, the public perception to which I referred certainly remains.  One hears it in the discussions on radio shows, together with a somewhat dismissive attitude that these are only temporary, seasonal workers who will move on quickly.  In fact, we are talking about people's livelihoods.  There are people who go to college to study to work in the sector and they are not just doing it on a part-time, <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  This is their career and livelihood.<\/p><p>Is that mistaken perception potentially causing some of the issues in terms of getting buy-in politically?  Is there a need to shift perceptions about the people who work in the sector?  I worked with students for a long time and there is a tendency towards a dismissive attitude to the effect that the work is not permanent and they will get out of the industry eventually.  Will the witnesses comment on whether this type of perception is an issue?<\/p><p>I have a lot of questions but will confine myself to one more.  If there is time, I will come in again.  Legislation will be debated in the Seanad this evening that deals with the treatment of tips.  I know Mr. Shevlin is doing a lot of work on the campaign on tipping in Galway.  Does he have any thoughts on the Bill, whether good, bad or otherwise, and what we should be doing in this regard?  It is Government legislation but it is not being opposed by anybody in the Opposition.  I would like to hear his thoughts on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#P00200","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":767,"content":"<p>In terms of perceptions of the sector, we hear a lot that employment in it is only transient, involves only students and so on.  Way back, 20-odd years ago, when we had proper certification and apprenticeship schemes, there was proper career progression and a career path.  Mr. Hynes and Mr. Kelly might say more about this.  The question is which issue came first.  Did the destruction of the sector come first in that students were encouraged to join the industry and thereby make it a transient sector?  That question has to be asked.  There still are a lot of people in the sector who rely on it for their wages.  We talked about the figures for the people paying rent and all the rest of it.  We know the real situation.<\/p> <p>  Changing the perception of the sector probably is something we need to do.  However, it should not be a case of dismissing it on the basis that it only involves students, even if that were the case.  Anyone undertaking these jobs should be paid correctly, no matter who they are.  Students and others who might only stay for a year or two should still get proper pay and conditions and be treated correctly.  We have to let the sector become what it was in the past, that is, an industry in which people can have a career with decent progression and can imagine themselves staying and being available to avail of reskilling and upskilling for 20 or 30 years.  However, that is not what the employers want.  They want low wages and low value in terms of what they have to pay out and worker conditions.  It is important we stick to trying to improve the conditions and changing the perception such that, regardless of who is in the sector, they are all doing a job, no matter what that job is, they should be properly paid for it and there should be opportunities for people to stay in the sector.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to Mr. Shevlin to respond to the question on tipping as he has more information on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Dunne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":768,"content":"<p>I was talking recently to somebody who works in hospitality.  I asked him why he remains in sector, where all the workers have gone and whether 40,000 of them really have just left all of a sudden.  He is a comical sort of fellow and he told me they are like freed slaves.  The Covid crisis took the chains off them because, before that, they did not realise what other kinds of jobs are out there and that they could receive better treatment from other employers.  They have taken up those other jobs and they are not going back to hospitality.<\/p> <p>  Another thing this man mentioned, as also referred to by Dr. Curran, Mr. Kelly and Ms Dunne, is the situation regarding the JLC.  It is about giving workers a voice.  Why do they not have a voice and why will they not talk to a union?  The simple reason is the fear they have that their shifts and hours will be changed and that they could experience harassment.  There are all sorts of measures an employer can take, as some of them do every day in this country, to discourage employees from joining a union.  To address that, the first thing the hospitality sector should be doing is allowing access for workers to Unite, SIPTU and all the unions that are invested in this issue.  That is the first thing that should be done, even without a JLC.  The employers should say they have a problem getting staff.  They are going around all these groups and forums on how to get tourists into the country and encourage people to take staycations and all the rest, but they are not looking at the elephant in the room, which is that they do not have the staff to cook a dinner for customers or serve them a beer.  They are still thinking about putting a service charge on a pint of beer.  That is the level of thinking that is going on and it has to stop.<\/p> <p>  Campaigns on tipping by ONE Galway and Unite have given workers wings and have been followed up by political support such as the Bill brought forward by Senator Gavan.  That kind of support shows people in the sector that legislation produced by the Oireachtas can change their lives within the workplace.  It also shows employers there is an awakening within the hospitality sector and they will finally have to draw the curtains on the current situation and recognise they can no longer have it their own way because that is killing the industry.  Every day in the D&aacute;il Chamber, there are divisive opinions on different issues but Members have to come to some agreement.  We all know how they do it.  They sit in the Chamber and argue all day before coming up with a solution that is better for everyone in the country.  That is all we are asking in respect of the hospitality sector.  People cannot leave a blank in communications and then, all of a sudden, expect a solution.  Solutions only come from engagement across the table.<\/p> <p>  The process of legislating for the treatment of tips began with the Bill that was introduced by Senator Gavan in 2019.  That Bill was shot down.  The T&aacute;naiste has now brought in the new Bill, which is giving all the protections for tips, including electronic tips, that were sought.  It means that if my daughter starts working in a restaurant once the Bill goes through, she will benefit from the tipping policy straight away.  She will get a letter setting out the percentage of the tips to which she is entitled.  If she does not get it, she has a pathway to the WRC to address it.  That has never before been the case.  The proposal to ring-fence service charges would mean, in a place like Galway city, where it is all tips and there is no service charge, and we did the research that shows this, there could be a switch all of a sudden to a service charge and the tips the workers rely on, which could be an extra &euro;60, &euro;70 or &euro;80 a week, would now fall under a service charge.  Technically, under the legislation, those moneys would have been ring-fenced for the employer to decide what to do with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Clement Shevlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":769,"content":"<p>We must move on to ensure all members get a chance to speak.

As they are aware, we have been engaging for some time on this issue.  We invited the union representatives back because we are currently writing, and will be publishing, our report on working conditions in the industry.  We want to get as much information as we can from the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  If the Chairman is agreeable, I will ask all my questions and then get the answers from our guests.  My first question is to Mr. Hynes of SIPTU.  Will he talk us through what exactly is required to re-establish the JLC for hospitality workers?  He said people are in place and have not budged for a decade.  He also said the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act makes provision for reinstatement.  Is the issue solely the veto employers have?  If the issue is intransigence from employers, is the legislation not robust enough and are changes needed to remove that veto, or is the problem a weakness in terms of the unionisation of the sector?<\/p> <p>  I would like a response from the representatives of the three unions and from Dr. Curran to my next question.  As it stands, workers have a right to join a union but the employer does not have to recognise that union.  That amounts to lightweight legislative protection.<\/p><p>This does nothing to enhance a worker's rights.  Someone said that workers in the sector will not talk to a union.  Perhaps workers will not talk to the union because their employer does not have to recognise that union.  If the legislation is that lightweight, would the witnesses be in favour of changes that would strengthen workers' rights in that legislation but putting an onus on employers to recognise unions?<\/p><p> The other question is for Dr. Curran.  Her research shows that workers in hospitality feel that the working conditions in tourism and hospitality have grown poorer since emerging from the pandemic.  Will Dr. Curran expand on that?  All we hear about is the staff shortage.  Whether or not in reality that is the truth, we are not sure.  If it was true or a percentage of it was down to staff shortages, it would be assumed that would mean employers would offer better pay and conditions given the increase in demand for workers.  In Dr. Curran's experience, is that not the case?  Will she comment briefly on the effect inflation is having on workers in the industry and what other research needs to be carried out in the area?  If there was funding available, what would she like to see?<\/p><p> Ms Dunne mentioned the lower VAT rate enjoyed by the industry.  Is it her opinion that the sector should not get the 9% VAT rate given the ongoing issues relating to workers' rights and pay plus employers' refusal to engage with the JLC?  Are there any other supports Ms Dunne believes should or could be removed?  In her opinion, has non-compliance of employers' groups stopped the JLC in its tracks?  What changes in legislation would be required to rectify that?<\/p><p> I would be interested to hear the stance of Unite the Union on the right to join a union while the employer is not obliged to recognise that union.  I cannot believe that is actually the law of the land.  Unite mentioned absence of trade union access in the sector.  Would it recognise that failing as part of the reason workers in the sector do not have the confidence as it stands?  The employer can simply not recognise the union regardless of what the union says.  Would recognising that failing help workers?  Are statistics available regarding unionisation levels within the sector?  We know it is an issue.  We saw that in the case of The Ivy restaurant.  What can be done to address that?  Sorry for all the questions.  We are trying to get as much information as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#P00600","speaker":"1497","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":772,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Munster.  Why is it worse?  The evidence would suggest that because of labour shortages, the workers who stayed have to compensate for the absence of workers.  They have to work much harder and work longer hours.  They have to train in new recruits who might only stay a week because they are not suited to it.  Therefore, it is much harder for them.  Inflation is an issue.  Being on low wages, getting to work and back home, and finding accommodation is all adding to the stress.  Customer behaviour and expectations are a further issue.  I do not know if the Deputy has looked at the prices of hotels in Galway and Dublin recently but they have gone sky-high so customers expect much higher levels of service.  In the context of labour shortages, that places extra strain on workers.<\/p> <p>  On what other research might be done, the research I have done is very modest but I am the only one doing it.  I desperately want more research along the same lines, looking at what is wrong and how to make it right.  There is scope for research to highlight good practice because there is good practice out there.  I know it because I know employers.  I am building an alliance of well-minded, ethical employers.

Dr. Curran referred earlier to workers having a voice.  Many workers in the industry do not recognise or know about trade unions, and that it is on us.  We need to get involved in a strong campaign across the sector, letting workers know their rights and organising those workers.

Collective bargaining and JLCs would help to change the culture.  Union recognition is very important.<br\/><br\/>In terms of staff shortages and the increase in wages, it would be imagined, given the neoliberal view of economics and ideas of equilibrium, supply and demand, that wages would go up.  That is not the case.  We have seen in the first quarter that wage increases have not happened.  They are still trailing the living wage and will continue to trail that because the living wage is going up in July, so there will be a bigger gap between what they are earning and the living wage, plus there is 8% inflation.  They are just going to fall further into debt and further away from a proper wage.  It is important that, in terms of what the Government is doing about the living wage next year, we would expect it to do something quicker.  We would expect the Government to do it over a shorter period of time and look at 66% of the median wage rather than 60%, which what it is at the moment.  Those are my points regarding wages.<br\/><br\/>On knowledge of unions, I agree with what Mr. Kelly said about a campaign.  Also, if we are targeting students and targeting people to go into the sector for proper careers, when people go in on apprenticeships, why is the union not allowed to talk to the students about their rights as part of their college course?  Dr. Curran mentioned this in terms of subjects that could be included.  We do not do employment rights <i>per se <\/i>in school, and we do not necessarily do it in college either.  There is a place for that because we see increasingly across different sectors that workers are not getting their rights because they are unaware of them.  That would be useful.<br\/><br\/>On the specific question asked about removing the lower VAT rate and everything else, the most important thing is that, if the Government gives money to a company or support to an organisation or a sector, it comes with conditions that workers should be properly paid, should have decent terms and conditions, and should have a proper career progression.  It should not just be handed to the sector to do with it what it wants.  There should be conditions.  We see it not just in this sector around VAT but also in public procurement constantly where contracts are given to all kinds of contractors in all areas of work who do not treat their staff correctly, even though they are public contracts and public works.  That could easily be tightened up.  There should be very strong conditions attached to any public money we give to contractors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022062900002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Dunne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":775,"content":"<p>Ms Dunne is right.

They led on the tips campaign which has come to fruition in the shape of the Bill that we hope to progress this evening.  I respectfully encourage all members of this committee to read the detailed research of Dr. Curran because, frankly, it is shocking.  To give one statistic, three in ten employees who she interviewed agreed that they have either experienced or observed workplace abuse.  It is the kind of stuff we do not hear about often in the sector.  We hear the good-news stories and we hear stories when the sector is in crisis.  Let us be honest, the sector has come through a couple of very tough years.  At the heart of this issue are the people whose voices have not been heard except through the work done by these fantastic people before the committee.<\/p> <p>  I will be brief but I want to raise a couple of questions.  I will ask my questions in one batch to allow our guests to respond.  Will Dr. Curran expand a little on some of the survey work that was done in respect of people's experiences?  That abuse statistic was shocking but the surveys also touched on issues around schedules changing at short notice, which six out of ten respondents noted.  How does one plan a life outside work with that little power?  It is an issue of power.

We acknowledge that we are represented on the forum but it is only one of many stakeholder forums.

We have debated the JLC here and I am sure that members understand the importance of having all stakeholders at the negotiating table.<\/p> <p>  On the improvement in the living wage rate, it is a slow increase.  As I stated in my briefing paper, we want the living wage to be improved more quickly, particularly in light of inflation and to consider it in terms of 66% of the median wage rather than 60%, and over four years.

Since we last met the committee, significant progress has been made and I am glad to be able to tell members that we are gaining real momentum in delivering the project.  As committee members know, we have agreed revised targets with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and we are committed to delivering more than 102,000 premises passed by the end of January 2023.  Today we have 330,000 premises surveyed, which is 60% of the entire intervention area, and detailed designs for 313,000 premises are complete.  These activities, which are vital precursors to the main build, are continuing at pace, and are now ahead of profile.  On average we are building for between 7,000 and 10,000 premises each month with stability and predictability across the programme.<\/p> <p>  There are 182,000 premises where build works have either commenced or been completed, which we see as a leading indicator of progress and project momentum.  At the end of June, that is tomorrow, the number of premises passed will be 63,652 and there will be more than 74,000 premises where the network is fully built.  Nationally 636 broadband connection points, including 359 primary schools, have been installed.  With regard to the most remote areas in Ireland, since our last engagement with the committee, NBI has progressed our fibre build activity on six islands off Mayo and Donegal.  We will further advance island connectivity and build off Cork later this year.<\/p> <p>  Since January, we have added 300 additional workers to the project, a 25% increase, bringing total employment on the national broadband programme to more than 1,500 skilled workers.  Importantly, 98% of this additional resource has been recruited to support build works.  This includes the addition of a new build partner earlier this month, as Gaeltec Utilities Limited from Kilkenny joined us, bringing a wealth of experience in rural construction.  With the addition of a further build partner, we anticipate build being under way for more than 40% of the entire intervention area by the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  With regard to demand for services on the NBI network, we have already connected 14,200 premises, or more than 22% of the premises we have passed.  While it is still early days in the deployment, in those deployment areas where the service has been available for more than six months take-up rates have reached more than 30%.  This initial indicator of demand for the network is surpassing anything we have ever seen in Ireland when compared to commercial roll-outs and in comparison to other international projects.  We now have 56 retail service providers partnered with NBI to sell gigabit fibre products and services on the network.  NBI's commitment to excellence in customer service and our best-in-class network allow service providers to integrate with our systems at unprecedented speeds.  This is absolutely key to NBI's success as an open access wholesale provider.<\/p> <p>  The national broadband plan is addressing a digital divide between rural and urban regions.  Recent research from EY, commissioned by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, shows that an increase in high-speed broadband services will underpin significant economic, individual and societal benefits.  Key enterprise sectors such as agriculture and hospitality will see new economic opportunities opened for them, while assisting the Government in achieving balanced regional development.<\/p> <p>  As part of our regular stakeholder engagement NBI recently commissioned research that revealed seven in ten regional dwellers believe high-speed broadband could lead to higher-paid work, more than half would consider seeking new employment as a result of having access to high-speed broadband and more than 80% believe the national broadband plan would have a positive impact, improving their quality of life, helping the local economy and helping local people to start their own businesses.<\/p> <p>  I hope the progress I have outlined today will give committee members confidence that the roll-out is gaining ground.  Of course, we will continue to provide regular updates to the committee by way of the quarterly update process agreed at our session in January.  Delivering the national broadband plan is a source of great pride for our team at NBI and the extensive number of contractors involved in the project.  Not only is it ahead of its time at an EU level, it is paramount to the success of Ireland Inc.

Part of what we do in the committee is important but this is a huge project for our country.  We put out ads for the national development plan, NDP, and for Covid.  I ask that the NBI do the same.  It may already but it is important we move away from older methods.  The day we met our guests, they had a very lovely glossy booklet, which was great.  However, people are on the iPhone, the radio and television now.  the NBI needs to sell that message.  This is a transformative project that is going to take time.  I am aware the NBI is behind and we need to bring people back in again on the totality of the picture, but I am positively enthused, notwithstanding the challenges.  Maybe I am naive and in my own world-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062900002#G02100","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>The Senator could never be accused of being naive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062900002#G02200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>I just think this is a great story we need to get behind and that we all need to move to the final point.

Those investors are a mixture between telecoms expertise and individuals, such as David McCourt and Walter Scott and his family trust which have deep telecoms experience, as well as partners of theirs which have a higher risk appetite in terms of construction risk and take-up risk.  We are sitting here talking about 56 retail operators.  Three years ago it was not clear that we would get 56 retail operators.  That is great for consumers because it means that there is competition and different services in products and price.  The stage we are at today is that there is an opportunity to look to bring in like-minded long-term partners that are equally infrastructure partners who have fibre assets.  Typically those infrastructure partners come in at a stage when there is not the same risk profile around construction or take up.

The reason for not doing that was largely that the intervention area is not clean.  It is not a case of every home outside Dublin or an urban area being in the intervention area.  There are premises throughout the country involved.  Urban areas, such as some near here, including places in Clontarf, Dollymount, the airport or Dublin Port are in the intervention area.  They are extreme cases.  Even if we were to plug in, we still have to go back in to connect homes.  Coming out from areas where we have existing backhaul fibre, we are still passing premises in the intervention area.  That was a critical part of our assessment.  Beyond that, we looked at operational integration issues, including the matter of operating this network over 25 years.  It is a passive cable down which we send light.  We have to keep records of the length of the cable and of any breaks or resplicing.  We have to know that the light and connection on that cable will work over 25 years.  Future-proofing is a concern.  There are great operational challenges involved in interfacing with two passive networks as an access network.  Finally, there is the cost of renting that infrastructure compared with the cost of building one's own infrastructure and there was a significant delta in that.  We did not just say that we wanted to build our own network.  There were three sides to the evaluation.<\/p> <p>  There might be some value in looking at adjacent infill.  We engaged with Eir about that.  It is not a product that it made available.  We are looking at that, with the regulator, to see if there is value and the quantum of premises whereby it would made sense for Eir to offer as a passive product.

There are mobile black spots where there is no mobile coverage, never mind broadband.  It is critical that those black spots are covered with mobile signals.  The NBP will be critical to that because part of the challenges is that one might put a tower in a place where there is no mobile broadband, but if you cannot get backhaul, particularly if you are using wireless backhaul, there is no line of sight.  The fibre infrastructure will therefore be critical for that.<\/p> <p>  From an NBP perspective, this about building a future-proofed network.  Some of the operators, and there are 56 of those, are quite large and are bug-fixed mobile operators.  Some of them are wireless operators.  They are predominantly local wireless operators.  We are seeing in Cavan, I will take Eurona Arden as an example, is a wireless operator in the Cavan region.  Not all of its customers are served from our first deployment in Cavan.  However, it has migrated a number of hundred customers onto our network.  This has meant that its base station, or coverage area, does not change.  However, the utilisation within that coverage area has changed.  It has fewer customers on the wireless network, which has meant that the customers who are remaining on it might be outside of our deployment area today, but it has an improved broadband service.  However, it fully recognises that it will move all of its customers onto the fibre network when it comes.  As we roll out our network, there will be an improvement of broadband particularly for some of those local wireless networks because we are taking capacity off it.  It is very much committed to migrating its customers to the fibre network.

I suppose it is like asking how long a piece of string is in certain cases.  The court case is going to be heard in the next few weeks.  We hope we will have a direction of travel to enable us to move somewhere with Eir then.  I would have thought the determination and exact ruling in this case will probably not come back until September.  Therefore, in that context, I cannot be sure of the timeline.  It is not within my remit, but that is what I would think will happen.  We are hoping the direction of travel will be sufficient to allow us to stand this aspect up and to start to engage with Eir.  If we can engage with the company under the existing major infrastructure programme, MIP, we think we could accomplish this task relatively quickly.  When I say that, I mean in several months.  As we said earlier, though, if we go into a regulated access product, that process then will take between 12 and 18 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022062900002#Q01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. T.J.
