On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Vurm and his colleagues to the committee meeting today and we look forward to the dialogue on all things Europe, international and geopolitical in this challenging time.  The most important thing for this committee, and it is certainly the focus of our committee, is to continue with engagement.  Yesterday I met the Dutch ambassador and I met the Ukrainian ambassador at the weekend.  This committee is very keen to keep all lines of communication open.  We are absolutely delighted Mr. Vurm is here today to keep that conversation going.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member partaking by Microsoft Teams, prior to making a contribution to the meeting, that they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.<\/p> <p>  I on Mr. Filip Vurm to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022062900002#C00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.  Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very much for inviting me to this committee session.  It is a great honour and pleasure for me to be here and to be able to present the priorities of the Czech Presidency for the second semester this year.  I convey apologies on behalf of the ambassador, H.E. Petr Kyn&scaron;tetr, for not being able to attend this meeting due to urgent travel to the Czech Republic.<\/p> <p>  In 1996 when the Czech President, V&aacute;clav Havel, considered the future of our Continent in his speech at the Charlemagne prize ceremonial entitled, \"Europe as a Task\", he stressed that the tasks ahead of Europe deserved careful and thorough reflection.  In the international context of the time, particularly favourable to western democracies, Havel called on Europeans to rediscover their conscience and to take responsibility for global environmental, social and economic challenges.  He did not want Europe to reclaim the position of a &ldquo;global head of orchestra&rdquo; and to impose its cultural values on the rest of the world.  What he had in mind was rather to inspire and to lead by example.<\/p> <p>  The brutal war and aggression beyond the eastern borders of our community has clearly shown us we will have to find the courage to re-evaluate many of our current approaches and premises.  We, therefore, perceive the Havel slogan &ldquo;Europe as a Task&rdquo;, chosen by the Czech Republic as the motto of its Presidency of the Council of the EU in 2022, not only as an opportunity to reflect together, but above all, as a call for accountability and determined action based on our values.  If we want to live up to the expectations of this historical moment, our triple challenge is to rethink, rebuild and repower Europe.<\/p> <p>  On 14 December 2021, the General Affairs Council endorsed the trio programme of three consecutive presidencies: France, Czech Republic and Sweden.  The trio programme was developed at a time when the major challenge for the EU was the post-pandemic recovery.  It has, therefore, been focused on protecting citizens and freedoms; developing the European economic model; building a climate-neutral, green, fair and social Europe; and promoting Europe's interest and values in the world.<\/p> <p>  The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has brought forward the necessity of a fundamental reassessment of the EU priorities and significantly influenced the preparation of the Czech Presidency's priorities.  The Czech Presidency will address urgent security issues by carrying on with the originally identified files such as the green and digital transition of the EU economy.<\/p><p> The political priorities of the Czech Presidency are divided into five cross-sectoral flagship areas, aiming to respond to crime challenges as well as pursuing the EU's long-term objectives.  The first is to manage the refugee crisis and the post-war recovery of Ukraine.  The Czech Presidency will support the EU&rsquo;s efforts to defend Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity by using all instruments and programmes offered by the EU, including the strengthening of sanctions.  It will also promote EU solidarity, efficiency and flexibility in managing the migration-related issues and it will support Ukraine on its European pass after receiving candidate status.  It will also contribute to Ukraine's economic recovery and stability.  The second relates to energy security.  The Czech Presidency will focus on reducing energy dependency on authoritarian regimes, such as Russia; diversifying resources through the REPowerEU energy plan; and mitigating the negative social and economic impacts on high energy prices.  The third is the reinforcement of European defence capabilities, including cybersecurity.  The Czech Presidency will promote the security and defence co-operation with NATO, implementing the strategic compass, enhancing better intra-EU co-operation and strengthening the EU's industrial strategies in strategic areas.  Strategic resilience of the European economy is the forth area of focus.  The Czech Presidency will focus on reducing dependence on hostile regimes, strengthen self-sufficiency and deepen the internal market of democratic states.  It will also focus on accelerating digitalisation and adapting free market rules to these developments.  The fifth is the resilience of democratic institutions.  The Czech Presidency will focus on safeguarding values of democracy and the rule of law, media freedom, transparency, open dialogue with citizens, including the follow up to the Conference on the Future of Europe, in online and offline spaces.<\/p><p> I thank the members for their attention and I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022062900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Filip Vurm","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Vurm.

Obviously, in a presentation, you cannot touch on everything.  There are two overarching issues that concern most European citizens right now.  One is the changed security situation in Europe, with the unlawful and horrific invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.  The second issue is, in part a consequence of that, the cost-of-living crisis faced by European citizens.  In terms of the Czechian stewardship of the European Council for the next six months, what specific measures does Mr. Vurm see can be promoted or developed to address a common approach to reducing the cost of living for citizens?  Are there any measures that would strengthen people's confidence in the European Union acting in consort, as it did so effectively on vaccines, for example?  Are there any common measures that can be taken to reduce the cost of living in terms of energy, food security, or any other matter like that?<\/p> <p>  A further question is in relation to the security situation in Europe.  Obviously, Ireland is a neutral country.  There is a council meeting of NATO today and I understand all European Heads of State and Heads of State will be attending the fringes of that meeting, if not the formal part of it.  How does Mr. Vurm see the security architecture of the European Union being impacted by the developments and will there be any particular initiatives in that regard during the Czech Presidency? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022062900002#D00300","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  I will start with the first one.  An appropriate mix of instruments which will reduce and mitigate the negative social and economic impact of high prices should be implemented.  We have already developed some instruments during the pandemic.  One of the ideas we would like to promote is to focus much more on joint purchases.  This is something which was quite successful in the past in purchasing vaccines.  This is one of the tools that can be used in dealing with the high energy prices.  Obviously every crisis can also be a chance for the future, so we should focus much more on the competitiveness of the EU economy in general, on digitalisation, and on the implementation of new technologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022062900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Filip Vurm"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I will just come in on that question.

This is something which might help to mitigate the crisis.<\/p> <p>  In terms of security, as I mentioned in my speech, we will focus on enhanced co-operation between the EU and NATO.  Most of the EU countries are members of NATO.  There are also non-EU countries that are members of NATO and that share our values.  In this area, we should focus much more on creating synergies and on what we call the concept of strategic unity with like-minded partners.  We are already seeing the impacts of the Ukrainian invasion on the architecture of Europe.  We are all aware of what happened yesterday at the NATO summit in Madrid when Turkey removed its objection to Sweden and Finland joining NATO.  Also Denmark changed its position quite recently on the common security and defence policy.  We are already seeing quite a significant shift in the architecture of European security or, I would even say, in global security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022062900002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Filip Vurm"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Vurm and now call Deputy Haughey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022062900002#D01000","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Vurm for his presentation.

Mr. Vurm has dealt with what we would see as the major issues.  Obviously, these are security concerns and the very much changed world following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  We do not know how that is going to work out.  All we know is that it is a much smaller and far more dangerous world.  There was much talk even before it, throughout the pandemic, of European or EU strategic autonomy.  We all saw the difficulties around semiconductors.  While this is something we need and is required, we do not want the EU to become protectionist <i>per se<\/i>.<\/p><p>Mr. Vurm answered a question on what we all want to see as regards dealing with the cost-of-living crisis, particularly where it crosses over with the energy crisis, that is, the idea of the EU doing what Deputy Howlin said it did well during the pandemic which is to block buy and make sure we have the supply line of fuel and the storage.  We need to emphasise that the European block needs to move to renewables as quickly as it can for multiple reasons.  I ask Mr. Vurm's for his views on that.<\/p><p>We have been dealing with the issue of accession.  We had a trip to Georgia in the last while.  It did not get great news from its point of view but it has a roadmap to follow no more than Ukraine and Moldova do.  It is going to be a long and arduous road.  Some of that is made long as well by the rule of law issues within Europe.  I ask Mr. Vurm for his opinion on that.  Where does he see these issues from the Presidency's point of view?  We have to get our own house in order while maintaining the balance and co-operation that has been shown to be useful.  Some of it is the outworkings of the Conference on the Future of Europe and the convention.  Some of it has been caught up in the whole argument of qualified majority voting versus unanimity.  To a degree, I think this is a wrong turn.  We showed during the pandemic that we could co-operate when we all opted into something we could agree on.  As difficult as it is, we showed we are able to come together on sanctions and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022062900002#E00400","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656457200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.

We did not want to increase that divergence from core EU principles.

We will provide it to members.  My apologies for that.<\/p> <p>  As I said, it refers to two protocols to the existing DTAs with Isle of Man and Guernsey.  Ireland signed the original agreement with the Isle of Man in 2008 and with Guernsey in 2009.  The protocols for the Isle of Man and Guernsey were signed on 18 November 2021 and 8 December 2021, respectively.<\/p> <p>  As the members will recall, arising from the OECD base erosion and profit shifting process, known as BEPS, Ireland ratified the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS in 2018.  The convention was discussed at this committee and in the D&aacute;il and was included in the Finance Act 2018.  The multilateral convention came into force for Ireland in 2019 and it has been the means for updating the majority of Ireland&rsquo;s existing double taxation agreements to make them BEPS-compliant.  Our existing agreements with Isle of Man and Guernsey were not updated by the multilateral convention but will instead be updated bilaterally to reflect the BEPS changes.  That is what the two protocols before the committee today now seek to do.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has been to the forefront in both signing and ratifying the multilateral convention and these bilateral protocols are another important step in the implementation of the OECD BEPS actions.  As for those partner jurisdictions that have not yet signed the BEPS multilateral convention, Ireland has written to them to discuss options for implementing the BEPS recommendations.  We are committed to ensuring that all our double taxation agreements meet the required prescribed standards agreed in the BEPS process.  A common feature of the protocols with both the Isle of Man and Guernsey is the incorporation of strong anti-avoidance measures and tools for tackling tax treaty abuse.  Both bilaterally-agreed protocols contain the prescribed standards to which Ireland committed during the BEPS project.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the protocol to the Isle of Man agreement, Ireland signed its agreement with Isle of Man in April 2008.  In March 2018, the Isle of Man&rsquo;s Treasury asked the Revenue Commissioners if the 2008 agreement between Ireland and Isle of Man could be updated by protocol instead of using the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS.<\/p><p>Ireland agreed to the request.  Negotiations happened in 2018 and concluded in January 2019.  That protocol was signed in November of last year and is now before the committee.  The Guernsey treaty protocol was signed in March 2009.  In June 2017, Guernsey also asked the Office of the Revenue Commissioners if the agreement could be updated by protocol.  Ireland agreed to the request and negotiations took place, beginning in 2017 and concluding in October 2018.  The protocol was signed in December of last year and is before the committee today.<\/p><p> Our network of double taxation agreements is an important aspect of our competitiveness in attracting investment and facilitating Irish business in operating internationally.  In addition, double taxation agreements are a cornerstone of our trade policy and provide greater certainty and fairness for taxpayers regarding their tax obligations in foreign jurisdictions and they are key to the prevention of double taxation.<\/p><p> The benefits of double taxation agreements are well known but concerns have been expressed that treaties may inadvertently facilitate aggressive tax planning.  These concerns were central to the BEPS project and to the multilateral convention on BEPS.  Updating our existing double taxation agreements, whether via the multilateral convention or bilaterally, helps to ensure they cannot be used for aggressive tax planning arrangements.  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the BEPS process since its inception.  We continue to engage positively at both EU and OECD level in dealing with the tax challenges that arise from the digitalisation and globalisation of the economy including through signing up to the historic two-pillared agreement at the OECD last October.  Proactively updating our treaty network to incorporate anti-BEPS measures is an example of that support.<\/p><p> It is timely that I am before the committee today because, following the approval of the Government, I published our tax treaty policy statement earlier this week.  The rationale for publishing that statement is to take stock of our existing network and formalise our broad treaty policy.  We have come from a period of expansion of the network to the point where we have treaties with the vast majority of our international trading partners.  In order to inform the treaty policy statement, I launched a public consultation in April of last year that ran until May 2021.  I received submissions from a broad range of stakeholders including business groups, practitioners, NGOs and members of the public.  These are all available on the Department of Finance website.  My officials held a series of stakeholder engagements to discuss the content of the submissions in detail and the insights we gained from those engagements were important in the drafting of the tax treaty policy statement.<\/p><p> The main thrust of the statement is that we aim to formalise the existing policy of maintaining and enhancing the network of double taxation agreements that facilitate international movement, trade and investment, including through the creation of a priority list of potential partners.  A separate dimension of the policy relates to a specific policy for least developed countries, the definition of which is taken from the UN and will evolve as the UN updates its list periodically.  One of the main features of this element of the policy statement is that Ireland will not approach least developed countries to seek a tax treaty and, where approached by least developed countries, we will be mindful of their particular and distinctive needs.<\/p><p> If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the making of these orders by the Government, I will include the orders in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by way of an amendment in the upcoming finance Bill.  This will enable Ireland to complete the necessary notifications to finalise the ratifications of both protocols.  I commend the orders to the committee.  I am happy to answer any questions the Chairman or members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#A00700","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputy Doherty, I welcome Nicholas and Krzysztof Lesniak, a father and son from Poland, and Will Mulholland, who is no doubt from Kilkenny.

The Minister mentioned that it was requested that both be dealt with by way of protocol rather than through the multilateral convention.  Will he explain to the committee the benefits of taking this approach rather than the approach of the multilateral convention from the perspective of Guernsey and the Isle of the Man?  Will he outline the objectives of each protocol separately and the amendments that have been made in respect of the double taxation agreements as they stand?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#B00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Before I go into the nature of these protocols, I will deal with the Deputy's first question as to why these matters are being dealt with via bilateral amendment rather than through the multilateral instrument.  It is up to the Isle of Man and Guernsey to outline why they believe it is in their interest to do it in this way but Revenue and my Department considered it and the view of my officials was that, given the focus we are putting on the implementation of the BEPS process, the best way to ensure compliance with our standards was to do this through protocols negotiated bilaterally.  The recommendation of Revenue and my officials aims to deliver on the spirit of the kind of change we want to see.  We believed a bilateral negotiation was the most effective way to proceed.  It is not as clear to us as it normally would be whether the multilateral instrument would fully apply to the kinds of agreements we have with the Isle of Man and Guernsey because those agreements are quite limited.  They really only focus on individuals whereas other double taxation agreements I have presented to the Oireachtas are broader and include corporate and business information and activities.  These relate to individuals only.  Because of that, and independent of the views of the other jurisdictions, we were of the view that we should do it bilaterally to deliver against the standards we believe are appropriate for the exchange of information between individuals.<\/p> <p>  To go on to what is included in the agreements between Ireland and the Isle of Man and Guernsey, the protocols aim to put in place required minimum standards to allow us to be confident that we are adhering to the BEPS process.  The first provision, which is contained in the first article of both protocols, inserts a new preamble into the original agreements.  This preamble contains an expressed statement emphasising the role of the treaty in combating tax abuse.  The second minimum standard provides for an anti-abuse rule which denies treaty benefits in cases where obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of the arrangement or transaction entered into.  I understand that this is referred to as the principal purposes test and involves looking at what the purpose of the transaction is.  That is contained in Article 3 of our Guernsey protocol and Article 4 of the protocol with the Isle of Man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#B00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Will the Minister outline how the exchange of information will operate?

This is in line with the OECD model, which deals with the effective exchange of information on tax matters.  It sets out the minimum standards for achieving effective exchange of information with those two jurisdictions.  The way it happens is that the competent authorities, that is, the tax authorities in the Isle of Man or Guernsey, would contact our tax authority about matters of concern, or <i>vice versa<\/i>.

Several of the other double tax agreements are more than 40 years old and may not be fully concurrent with international norms at this time, given the changes, particularly in recent times, and the need to incorporate the OECD minimum standards and best practices aligned with the OECD BEPS project.  Given that we are quite a distance from even having double taxation agreements with several of those countries and the agreements with other countries are out of date, will the Minister update the committee on the stage he is at with the negotiations?

In terms of where we are at the moment, we now have 76 DTAs, of which 73 are in effect.  There are three that have been signed but are not yet in effect.  In terms of our priority for further agreements, it is Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia.  We do not yet have DTAs with Colombia or Costa Rica, which have now joined the OECD.  Our priorities are to conclude agreements with G20 countries.  In terms of what that sequencing will look like, our first priority is G20 countries, namely, Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia.  After that, we will move to developing tax treaties with OECD member countries as well as EU accession countries.

The Minister referred to the OECD BEPS process and pillars 1 and 2.  I am sure he will be observing the challenges that some countries, not least the United States, face in the implementation of those pillars.  It may be a challenge to get this through the US Congress, for instance.  We can speculate on whether it will go through but that will be up to those at that level.  It has always been the view of the Government that this needs to be done at global level.  Has that view changed or evolved recently?  Is it still the view of the Government that all parties that are signed up to the process need to implement it and, if that is not the case, then we should not be a party to this?  There is an emerging view that, for example, pillar 2 will be transposed through a directive at European level.  Does the Minister believe pillar 2 should take effect in Europe regardless what other parties, such as America, decide to do?  That would be a very different view from the one we have.  In fairness, I shared the same view.  It would be a different view from the one the State had a number of years ago that this needed to be dealt with not at European level but at global level.

It is possible that competitive advantage could be gained through how different countries do double taxation agreements, but that is why the OECD process matters so much.  It aims to bring everybody up to a certain standard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#D01600","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>As we all move near the same standards, is the Minister satisfied no loopholes can be exploited in the interim to benefit a European country, Ireland or a third country, regardless of location?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#D01700","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>If Revenue or I become aware of issues we believe are illegal and inappropriate, of course we will respond to them.

At a time when the world is changing rapidly and other European countries are seeking a presence in Taiwan, and our colleagues in the European Union have trade offices in that country, we have not really established a trade office there, even though Taiwan has a population of 24 million.  The previous discussion we had about the DTA with Taiwan indicated that we would use the UK model of wording to have that agreement, but it has never been brought to conclusion.  Given the shift in world politics and the global economy, and observing the one China policy and the actions taken by our European partners, is it not time for us to complete that taxation agreement and to move quickly to reopen our offices in Taiwan to a far greater degree in order that the trade between both countries can be supported more directly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#E00600","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his long-standing interest in this matter.

At present, my Department is consulting with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to examine whether an agreement, with equivalent effect to a DTA with Taiwan, might be concluded in a manner consistent with our foreign policy.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman will be aware, an amendment was made to section 826 of the Taxes Consolidation Act in the Finance Act 2015 to allow for agreements to be made with non-governmental entities such as Taiwan.  This has paved the way legally to conclude an agreement with Taiwan.  Discussions between officials, including those from Revenue and the Department of Foreign Affairs, on next steps are ongoing, but there are not at present any formal negotiations between Irish officials and representatives of Taiwan.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is correct to point out that IDA Ireland had an office in Taiwan.

To resurrect that arrangement or proposal would not take from the urgency of completing the G20 list.  I again say to the Minister that there is a strong connection between Taiwan and Ireland.  Taiwan is a market of 24 million people and is anxious to play its part on the world stage.  We know why it has been hampered in doing that.  This type of arrangement does not fly in the face of any political position.  Our European partners are actively promoting trade in Taiwan and actively reaching agreements.

A key issue that is still unresolved is how such an agreement could be concluded and signed.  I will be very open with the Chairman, because he has raised this matter with me regularly, that one of the things we have done in our tax treaty framework is to state who we want to do when.  We are putting the focus on three other G20 states.  The issue regarding how the treaty could be signed is a substantive issue.

I had not got my facts at that time and I said I would come back to the Minister on it.  The gentleman who rings me, Liam, explained there is a particular cohort of people who are on the State contributory pension who may have, in his case, a pension from the local brewery.  There is an exemption of up to &euro;36,000 for married people or those in civil partnership.  It is up to &euro;18,000 for single or widowed people.  The levels were higher than that but were then reduced.  Since it has been reduced, even a small increase in the pension will drive Liam over the limit.  I am sure there are just a small number of pensioners in that category.<\/p><p>I hope in the context of the budget that increasing the exemption might be looked at to take these people out of the bracket where they pay tax, thereby allowing them to benefit from the small increases they would get either from the State pension or their work pension.  It is a small amount of money for the Government but a big amount of money for this group of people.  It would make a difference to them.  It is worthwhile considering all of these issues.

I had hoped it would be reasonable in the context of the framework and the process but it appears it is driving those waiting for a resolution into a never-ending legal process.

Of the 41,000 tracker mortgage issues there are still 1,000 or more that are unresolved.  It would appear the banks are back to a culture where they circle the wagons and protect themselves.  They do not want to get to the end of the tracker mortgage issue.  It is not quite finished as yet.  The regulator should be given teeth to deal with this and to give more information to the public on what is going on in the banking system.  Consumer protection should be separated from the Central Bank so it is more independent and visibly on the side of the consumer.  The committee will return to it.<\/p> <p>  The regulator was soft on the bank and soft on how the tracker mortgage issue was dealt with.  I recall the previous regulator sitting at a meeting telling us the number of tracker mortgages involved was approximately 4,000.  On that particular day in 2017 I adjourned the meeting and asked the regulator to go back and check his figures.  He came back with a similar figure.  We know now that figure was wrong because it has grown to 41,000.  To say the banks behaved badly is to put it mildly.  The banks have behaved badly.  They have been scurrilous towards their customers.  It is time to look at the regulation and the regulator.  The regulator should be seen to be actively involved in responding to the various complaints made.  This is what brings me to the conclusion that consumer protection should be completely independent of the Central Bank.  I am expressing my own view on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#F00500","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I concur with what the Chair has said on this.  Although the role of the Central Bank in the tracker mortgage scandal concluded a while ago we know the scandal is not over.  The committee, working collectively with all its members, has done a good bit of work on trying to shed a light on this and pushing those organs of the State that also failed customers in this regard.  When people turned to the Financial Services Ombudsman at the early stages all the cases were rejected.  We have to remember this.  The Central Bank's comment, even today, is that it cannot get involved in individual issues.  It was only through the perseverance of individuals that the issue was pursued and the Financial Services Ombudsman found in favour of them.  It was fought all the way through.<\/p> <p>  I have not had an opportunity to raise this issue with the Minister.  We are shocked and appalled at what went on in the banking sector.  We are shocked and genuinely feel for people who are victims of the tracker mortgage scandals, particularly those who lost their houses.  Many lost more than money.  They were severely impacted in terms of their mental health.  Permanent TSB, a bank of which the Minister is a major shareholder, recently fought a case brought to the Ombudsman.  I know the individual who took the case.  The individual relayed to me very clearly that the bank fought him tooth and nail.  He won his case.  Permanent TSB has confirmed to me in recent weeks that up to 200 individuals will have to be dealt with in the same way.  I do not think that will be the end of the story.<\/p> <p>  The banks have set up a culture board and all the rest.  When we have banks still fighting consumers in 2022, years after the investigation and examination by the Central Bank concluded, I argue strongly it is not a customer-centric approach.  We cannot have a David versus Goliath approach.  That is not fair.  The case I am speaking about took years.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the avalanche of paperwork involved.  Permanent TSB has a legal team.  The individual had to deal with all of the correspondence and respond to it.  If, at any time, had he buckled and said it was not worth it or not enough, up to 200 individuals would not know they were also victims of the tracker mortgage scandal.<\/p><p>In the middle of all that, the Central Bank did not spot this or step in.  Therefore, we must improve consumer protection.  There is a real need to look at where consumer protection lies.  We must examine the legislation to allow the Central Bank to step into the shoes of victims, whether those of businesses in respect of the insurance they had for Covid-19 or of individuals impacted in respect of issues such as the tracker mortgage examinations.  We have not given the Central Bank the powers to do that.  As we are coming out the other side of this, I am mindful that there are, as I believe, still hundreds, if not thousands of cases, to be processed.  Some of those may end up in the courts.  In that context, we must state that the fines are not the end of this matter.  The Garda will undertake its piece.  Information in this regard has been provided to the force and it will be up to the Garda to deal with that aspect.  <\/p><p> As politicians, we must examine this 15-year period where regulations were continually breached.  How do we now improve the situation to ensure it never happens again?  If representatives of the banking sector come knocking on the Minister&rsquo;s door, which they are likely to do because there is a campaign by the sector to get him to allow the banks to pay bonuses and to breach the &euro;500,000 pay limit, he should tell them to sling their hook.  AIB was breaching regulations until eight weeks ago.  It is amazing that this was happening.  <\/p><p> The committee has heard from all the CEOs.  They have apologised.  They have told us they are now customer-centric and all the rest of it.  Then we see the facts.  This type of practice was going on until eight weeks ago in AIB.  Equally, Permanent TSB is fighting these customers.  We never see these aspects.  If this individual had not come to me, I would not have known what was happening.  This is not the approach we want in the banking sector.  We must reach a point in the banking sector in this State where we are able to draw a line under what happened.  We will only be able to draw such a line, however, when we have dealt with all these issues and they are behind us.  We need to reach the point where our banking sector is doing what it should be doing, which is lending to individuals and making a return for shareholders, while also meeting the needs of ordinary people, businesses and the economy.  This situation has dogged the banking sector for so long, but it is its fault.  The banks are continuing to breach the regulations and continuing to act in the way they have.  I fear this committee will be dealing with these issues for quite a while to come.  <\/p><p> That was a longer contribution than I expected to make, but this situation has not been dealt with.  The change we needed in the sector has not happened.  If that change has not happened after 41,000 people had money taken from their accounts, family homes were taken and hundreds of millions of euro had to be forced to be paid back, as well as compensation to these victims, then I do not know what it is going to take.  The Minister has a role here as the shareholder in some of these banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#F00600","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>The Deputy knows, though, that part of the limitation I have as a shareholder is that I cannot get involved in commercial decisions.

The Deputy knows that as a shareholder I cannot and do not get involved in commercial decisions.  All that being said, what happened with the tracker mortgage issue was an absolute scandal.  I used that word when the scale of harm involved for so many became apparent, not just to those families and people affected but to this committee and to me.  The scale of what happened was a scandal.  It was wrong that the issue developed in the first place.  How the matter was dealt with and how the banks dealt with the regulator was also something that I believed at the time was unacceptable.<\/p> <p>  I have three points to make about it.  First, I believe that the scale of fines imposed on AIB in this regard shows the seriousness with which the matter has been dealt with by the Central Bank.  Between the fine, redress and compensation from AIB and from EBS, the total cost has been over &euro;300 million.  A large share of that &euro;300 million has been accounted for by customers getting their money back in the first place.  Nonetheless, I believe the fine imposed shows the seriousness with which the Central Bank has dealt with this issue.  Second, the strong view I convey to the committee is that if we separate consumer protection from the financial regulator, then we will undermine consumer protection in the long run, because the most effective way of dealing with consumer protection is by having it done through the financial regulator for the banking sector.  Third, Garda investigations are underway into some of these matters.  While I know the committee will have wanted me to have moved this matter forward faster than I have, we will be bringing forward the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, legislation.  I hope to publish that next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#G00600","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>What role does the Minister have in the reappointment of the directors of AIB at the AGM?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#G00700","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I play a role in that at the AGM.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#G00800","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Is it not the case that the Minister has the majority say in respect of the appointment of directors of AIB?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#G00900","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#G01000","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Therefore, while the Minister has no role regarding the commercial decisions of the bank, these directors who have been directing AIB - not all the directors and many of them would not have served at all during the earlier stages of this period - have been found by the Central Bank to be in breach of regulations for 15 years and to have continued to do so right up until eight weeks ago.

I refer to the findings of the Central Bank, particularly those concerning recent years, in respect of AIB having failed to apply the principle of stop the harm and having continued to pursue individuals.  Legal notices were issued for the repossession of those people's homes, despite the tracker mortgage examination finding that these individuals were within its scope.  Two individuals lost their family homes as a result of this harm continuing.  In that context, then, it is appropriate to find out - and I do not know the answer here either way and I do not want to cast aspersions - whether the current directors were involved during that period.

The regulations continued to be breached up until recent times.<\/p><p> On what date will the summer economic statement be published?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#G01500","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I hope it will be next week.

I received various reasons as to why it was not possible.  I do not accept those reasons.  Almost every small business in the country has the convenience of an ATM machine.  When one asks what it is there for, one is told that it is for convenience of customers.  When the ATM was removed from Leinster House, it was done on the grounds that money was not being made or was being lost, that the administration had changed or that the banks were no longer doing it.  Whatever way the banks are operating, given the relationship between the banks and the Oireachtas in recent the past number of years, if I were them, I would make some effort to restore the ATM machine in question.  It was a snub to remove it at the time it was done, during the lockdown, and to base the condition for its removal on the fact that it was used very little.  I find that difficult enough to believe, because of the representations I have received from Oireachtas Members and staff in particular.  I ask that the matter be raised again as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise other issues on which the committee has engaged before, including the transfer of accounts between banks.  I do not want answers today, particularly if the they are not available, but I will insist on written answers.  The transfer to other financial institutions was found to be cumbersome.  It was allegedly a simple provision, which not everyone agrees with.  It was not simple or easy; it proved difficult for many people.  I would have thought that an electronic transfer between the outgoing banks and the incoming banks would have been simple to organise, on a national basis, and that it would have alleviated considerable anxiety and worry for customers and been of great benefit.<\/p> <p>  In the course of what I have heard from constituents in recent times, I have noticed that some long-standing customers had overdrafts, which were sometimes used, but that no provision was made for these to remain in place after the transfer.  Instead, there was a provision for credit cards.  Of course, we all know the difference between the two.  One entails an interest rate of whatever the nominal interest rate is and the other entails a fairly hefty rate.  I ask that the banks come back to the committee with a view to resolving the issue of equal treatment on the transfer of business interests.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of issues relating to the people who have lost out.  Deputy Doherty referred to the individuals who lost out and lost their homes.  I am sure that all Members of the Houses have done their level best to make sure that did not happen.  They have lost some.  We possibly lost some.  We held and still hold some.  The fact of the matter is that it is very easy for a lending institution to come along and tell someone that he or she is in debt and has broken the agreement and that his or her loan is no longer sustainable, but the Irish people rescued the banking system here.  The Government, on behalf of the Irish people, rescued and paid for the banking system.  The banks did not lose anything, except their good name or whatever kind of name they had at the time.  We have not gone away and nor are we likely to.<\/p> <p>  I pay tribute to the lending institutions that have dealt sympathetically with customers.  I cast a wary eye on those that did not.  We will need to continue to monitor the situation.  I do not want an immediate response, unless somebody decides to give an administrative response, but I want a response in writing within the next two to three weeks, before the D&aacute;il goes into recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022062900002#H00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1656457200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>We will definitely get back to the Deputy on those matters.

He is an extraordinary character and has done significant work in the context of understanding or giving understanding to those who are studying the law that come before him or indeed customers of banks that have been blackguarded in one way or the other.  He has always treated everyone fairly.  I do not think he was treated very well by the President of the High Court, but that is for another occasion.  I wish him well.

Is gairm at&aacute; sa scr&iacute;obh d&uacute;inne a thugann faoi i gceart agus go cr&iacute;ochn&uacute;il, agus t&aacute; ioncam t&aacute;bhachtach d&uacute;inn.

Is mar sin a th&oacute;gtar an pobal.  Mura mbeidh gach gn&eacute; den &eacute;iceach&oacute;ras ag feidhmi&uacute; go h&eacute;ifeachtach, beidh fadhbanna ann.  Is mar sin at&aacute; maidir le gn&eacute;ithe &aacute;irithe d&rsquo;&eacute;iceach&oacute;ras na Gaeilge.

T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach go dtarl&oacute;dh s&eacute; sin.  An r&eacute;iteach a fuair mo chomhlacht f&eacute;in ar an bhfadhb n&aacute; gur fh&aacute;g muid &Aacute;IS agus gur thosaigh muid ag obair le d&aacute;ileoir eile, Gill Books.

Is g&aacute; na r&oacute;lanna sin a scaradh amach &oacute;na ch&eacute;ile.

Ceann de na ruda&iacute; a bhfuil mo chomhlacht f&eacute;in tar &eacute;is b&eacute;im a chur air n&aacute; spreagadh a thabhairt do na scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute; - agus t&aacute; m&eacute; ag caint ar scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute; do ph&aacute;ist&iacute; don chuid is m&oacute; - dul amach i measc an phobail agus a bheith ar f&aacute;il oiread agus is f&eacute;idir do na scoileanna agus do chuairteanna ar leabharlanna agus f&eacute;ilte agus mar sin de.

N&iacute; hionann cumas sa Ghaeilge scr&iacute;ofa n&oacute; labhartha a bheith ag duine agus scr&iacute;bhneoir a bheith agat ach is g&aacute; ardchumas sa teanga a bheith ann mar bhunchloch.  M&aacute; th&oacute;gann t&uacute; saol an Bh&eacute;arla in &Eacute;irinn mar shampla, feicfidh t&uacute; go bhfuil an iliomad r&eacute;ims&iacute; scr&iacute;bhneoireachta &aacute; m&uacute;ineadh ag leith&eacute;id&iacute; &Aacute;ras Scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann agus is maith ann iad na c&uacute;rsa&iacute; agus ceardlanna sin le hoili&uacute;int agus spreagadh a thabhairt do scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute; i dt&uacute;s a r&eacute;ime agus le cur lena scileanna i rith a saol scr&iacute;bhneoireachta.

Mar sin, t&aacute; an scr&iacute;bhneoir ag brath ar thaca&iacute;ocht airgid &oacute; fhoins&iacute; eile.

An rud a tharla n&aacute; gur chuir comhlachta&iacute; agus scr&iacute;bhneoir&iacute; scripteanna isteach, roghna&iacute;odh c&uacute;ig cinn acu, fuair siad &euro;25,000 an ceann le forbairt a dh&eacute;anamh ar an smaoineamh, agus ansin roghna&iacute;odh dh&aacute; cheann acu a fuair, s&iacute;lim, &euro;1 milli&uacute;n an ceann.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; l&aacute;nchinnte, b'fh&eacute;idir nach raibh ann ach leath sin.  N&iacute; maoini&uacute; millteanach m&oacute;r &eacute; sin i gc&aacute;s scann&aacute;in ach fuair siad airgead ceart agus, mar a bh&iacute; &aacute; r&aacute; ag Tadhg Mac Dhonnag&aacute;in, bh&iacute; pr&oacute;iseas eagarth&oacute;ireachta ann agus pr&oacute;iseas roghnaithe agus bh&iacute; br&uacute; ann forbairt a dh&eacute;anamh ar an rud i bhfad sular th&aacute;inig s&eacute; chuig an bpointe go mbeadh siad amuigh ag scann&aacute;n&uacute;.<\/p> <p>  T&aacute; scann&aacute;in eile ann &ldquo;Arracht&rdquo; agus &ldquo;R&oacute;ise &amp;amp; Frainc&rdquo;, ceann eile at&aacute; ag teacht chun cinn go luath agus a bhfuil duaiseanna buaite aige agus mar sin de.

Ba &eacute; TG4 agus Alan Esslemont mar sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir, de r&eacute;ir mar a thuigim, a bheartaigh ar an rud seo le scann&aacute;in i nGaeilge a chur chun cinn ar leibh&eacute;il idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus go mbeid&iacute;s p&aacute;irteach i bhf&eacute;ilt&iacute; idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus ag buachaint duaiseanna idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.  D&eacute;arfadh daoine in &Eacute;irinn ansin go bhf&eacute;adfadh siad dul chuig an scann&aacute;n i nGaeilge toisc go raibh gach duine ag caint faoi.  Is &eacute; sin an rud at&aacute; tarlaithe.
