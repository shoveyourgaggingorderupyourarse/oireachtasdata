I am very conscious that this is an important and sensitive issue, and therefore I have given some consideration to my comments.<\/p><p>Senators and Deputies as well as representatives of the five parties in the Northern Executive met a cross-community group of victim campaigners in Belfast City Hall on 30 August 2021.  This was a meeting of cross-community groups and all political parties on both sides of the Border.  In July of this year, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Brandon Lewis, announced that he planned to introduce a statute of limitations banning prosecutions of Troubles-related killings and other crimes as well as all legacy inquests and civil cases before April 1998.  We met victims' groups and the North's five main political parties which, along with the Irish Government, are all opposed to these proposals.  One of the things about this issue is the great unity on the island of Ireland in regard to it, and indeed in certain quarters in the UK.  We discussed the issues and concerns.  There was a view that this was a <i>de facto<\/i>amnesty, and it is something people have major concerns with.<\/p><p>Representatives from the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the UUP and the Alliance Party, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Mark Daly, Senator Emer Currie and myself, along with Deputies Howlin, Costello and Lawless, signed a document of support stating that we totally reject the British Government's proposals for dealing with the past, including amnesties for those who committed murder, and supported the victims' campaigns and their efforts to stop the British Government's proposals.  No individual group, organisation, state forces or agents can be immune from prosecution.  Murder is murder and must be treated as such.  Investigations, prosecutions, inquests and civil actions cannot be abolished and due process must take place, which the document we signed clearly states.<\/p><p>Listening to the campaigners, the common thread throughout was that they do not want the British Government closing off or closing down their opportunity to get truth and justice for their families, neighbours and loved ones.  Subsequent to that, 35 US Congress members, including Mr. Brendan Boyle and Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick, signed a letter to the British Prime Minister calling for the UK Government to reaffirm its commitment to the Stormont House Agreement, which is critical to this debate and to these discussions, and they asked that the British Prime Minister, Mr. Boris Johnson, to scrap his proposals to ban future prosecutions in relation to the Northern Ireland Troubles.  US legislators expressed concern that the proposed legacy laws would strain the British-Irish relationship and cement widespread feelings that justice is being denied.  The US politicians went on to say that it is a serious mistake by the British Government to renege on its commitment clearly laid out under the Stormont House Agreement in the search for justice and reconciliation.<\/p><p>The British Prime Minister said that this amnesty would allow Northern Ireland to draw a line under its Troubles.  One can never draw a line under the Troubles when people to not have the right to an inquest, to take civil actions and so forth to address this issue.  It must be clear that everyone must be held to account, including military veterans as well as ex-paramilitaries.  We simply have to reject the British Government's proposal.  The pathway to truth, justice and reconciliation must not be blocked.<\/p><p>I will be asking the Minister of State to take this back to the Government.  Legal rights under European law and the Good Friday Agreement must be protected and vindicated.  The Taoiseach is exceptionally supportive of this issue.  That is encouraging and it encouraged the people we met in Belfast City Hall.  They were highly impressed by the Government and the Taoiseach's solidarity with their plight and their concerns.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach is in the United States at the moment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The campaigners have asked that the Taoiseach and Government use their influence in respect of their European colleagues and the US Government.<\/p><p>I am also calling on the Cathaoirleach to write to our counterparts in the House of Lords and ask them for their support for the campaign for justice and truth.

I wish to pass on the apologies of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is out of the country at present and unfortunately unable to attend this debate.<\/p> <p>As the Senator has outlined, the legacy of the Troubles continues to impact upon many families and communities across the island and beyond as they continue to seek truth and justice for their loved ones.  It has been the consistent position of the Government that each of those families should have access to an effective investigation and to a process of justice, regardless of the perpetrator.  The Stormont House Agreement, agreed by both Governments and the political parties of Northern Ireland after intensive negotiations in 2014, sets out a comprehensive and balanced framework based on the essential pillars of truth, justice and reconciliation.  Where the British Government is proposing significant changes to that framework, these must be discussed and agreed by both Government and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive.<\/p> <p>Only through a collective approach in line with international human rights obligations can we hope to deal with these issues comprehensively and fairly.  As the Senator will be well aware, the Government has joined with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland in a process of intensive engagement on these issues, with discussions beginning in early July which are ongoing.  Importantly, this process has engaged fully with victims representatives and civil society.  The intention is to find an agreed way forward that will allow implementing legislation to be introduced in both the UK and Ireland by the end of the autumn.  As part of this process, we are committed to working with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland to address the painful legacies of the Troubles.  We must find a way forward on these crucial issues to support wider societal recognition, build greater community confidence in policing and meet the legitimate needs of victims and survivors in Northern Ireland and across the island of Ireland.  <\/p> <p>The Government has made very clear that any approach based on a general statute of limitations that would see an end to investigations and prosecutions of Troubles-related incidents would represent a very radical departure from the Stormont House Agreement.  It is one that we cannot support.  This view is shared and has been strongly expressed by every party and victims group and by people from all communities and with a wide range of experiences.  It is for the British Government to take that response on board now.  We have cautioned it strongly against unilateral action.  <\/p> <p>I welcome the work of Senators Boyhan, Currie, An Cathaoirleach and all the other Members of this House who engaged in that meeting in Northern Ireland.  All of us working collectively from across the political spectrum get to make that point.  It is a point that needs to be made loud and clear, because whatever the intentions behind the proposal, a proposal like this will not work if it does not have the support of all of Northern Ireland.  It will undoubtedly be challenged in the courts, and if it fails, it will only add years of uncertainty and heartache for families with no gain.<\/p> <p>We have consistently said that we are ready to engage with concerns or issues in respect of the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, but any such changes must be discussed by the parties and both Governments.  The Government is also committed, as was the case at the time of the Stormont House Agreement, to fully play our part in collective efforts that will deliver for the legitimate needs of victims and survivors across both jurisdictions and for society as a whole.

Through the Stormont House Agreement, we also have a shared approach as to how to deal with that hurt in an inclusive way.  There is an onus on all of us to see real progress for victims and survivors of the Troubles across the island.  If we fail to do so, we allow grief to be deepened and that burden to be passed on to the next generation.<\/p> <p>There must be a framework for dealing with the past that meets the legitimate needs of families, that provides a real pathway to reconciliation and that, crucially, upholds other human rights obligations, including those under the European Convention on Human Rights.

It was truly a historic event given that it was the first time in the history of this island that all of the major political parties signed one document.  It was a truly historic event in that respect but it was sad that it related to a cause that should not have to be fought for.  The fact that Congressmen Boyle and Fitzpatrick, along with other members of the US Congress, signed a letter to the British Prime Minister asking the British Government not to go ahead with this legislation, that would deny justice and truth to families, shows the level of international outrage regarding this proposal.  It should be borne in mind that a UK university has analysed this legislation and 300 other amnesties given since the 1990s and has described it as \"Pinochet plus\".  It has said that it is a broader and more comprehensive amnesty than was given to the Chilean dictator, General Pinochet, and his troops who committed atrocities during his reign of terror in Chile.  I do not believe the UK Government wants to be associated with that type of historic record.  As Senator Boyhan has said, the families deserve truth and justice.

We will take two minutes each.  The issue I want to raise relates to the documentary \"Women of Honour\" broadcast on RT&Eacute;'s \"Saturday with Katie Hannon\" programme a couple of weeks ago.  It was with shock and horror that we listened to the accounts of the women involved.  They were former serving members of the Irish Defence Forces.  They spoke about horrific ordeals including sexual assaults, discrimination, rapes and many other injustices they suffered when they were serving members of the Irish Defence Forces.  These were perpetrated by other members of the Defence Forces.  It was even worse to hear how they were treated subsequently when they raised those issues with their commanding officers and tried to bring them up the line of command.  Their words fell on deaf ears.  There were too many instances to be considered one-offs or rarities.  Unfortunately, it seems to have been quite common, particularly in the early years when women first joined the Defence Forces.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As a former member, who spent 13 years in the Reserve Defence Force, I can attest to there being quite a macho culture within the organisation but I was still extremely shocked to hear what those women had been through.

What we cannot have is the Defence Forces or the Department of Defence investigating themselves.  There must be a fully independent inquiry into all the allegations and the culture in the Defence Forces, with a view to stamping out and eradicating that culture and providing closure, compensation and resolution to the victims.<\/p><p>I also take on board that these women have the full support of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and the National Women's Council of Ireland for that independent review, one where they are fully involved in choosing how it takes place.

These women detailed sexual assault and harassment from their male colleagues and supervisors in addition to a level of job discrimination against female members of the Defence Forces, especially those with children.  These are not new allegations.  Similar allegations have been made in the past.  Recently on KFM Radio, Dr. Tom Clonan detailed his experience as a whistle-blower within the Defence Forces when he released his research into sexual misconduct in 2000.  His allegations were not baseless or random but were contained within a full doctoral thesis that included in-depth interviews with more than 60 women who were soldiers, sailors and air crew.  This research was presented to the Chief of Staff 21 years ago and nothing was done.  Not only was nothing done, Dr. Clonan was treated like a pariah.<\/p> <p>One of the most concerning aspects of this story is the alleged attempt by senior personnel to quash allegations of misconduct.

One of the reasons I bring up the concept of high-speed rail is that I have been a rail user for the past seven or eight years, commuting from Dundalk to Dublin.  We have various issues with the rail infrastructure in this country.  It is good to see a renewed focus from the Government in the programme for Government and in recent statements from the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and indeed the Minister for transport in Northern Ireland, Nichola Mallon, in relation to our all-island economy and a review of our all-island railway tracks.<\/p> <p>Dublin to Belfast is about a two hour and ten minute journey, if you are going well.  There are about eight direct trains between the two major cities on this island.  For comparison, Liverpool to Manchester and Edinburgh to Glasgow are similar distances.  They have up to 30 to 40 direct trains per day.  What are the Government's plans for high-speed rail?  How ambitious are we about introducing high-speed rail on this island?  What do we see as some of the pitfalls of it?  What lessons can we learn from high-speed rail on the Continent, in China, Japan and Spain?  They have faced issues we can use and take into the report that is being launched by the Government.  I am keen to know how long the all-island report announced in April by both Ministers will take.<\/p> <p>As research and preparation for this Commencement debate, I spent the past day or so reading up on high-speed rail around the world.  There are so many benefits.  Clearly, there are environmental benefits.  High-speed rail is comfortable, safe, flexible and, most important, gets people out of cars.  It provides a safer transport alternative.  The other issue is economic viability.  The concept exists around the world that high-speed rail is a money pit but that is not the case.  It has been profitable across the Continent and in Japan, which was the birthplace of high-speed rail in the 1960s.  It creates jobs and provides a huge stimulus boost to local economies when it is being built.  That is important to bear in mind.  Naturally, there are energy savings associated with it.<\/p> <p>By way of comparison, China has 26,800 km of high-speed rail, Spain has 3,100 km, Japan, 3,041 km, France, 3,220 km, and Germany, 3,038 km.  High-speed rail provides a fast, reliable mode of transport.  If we are to be serious about our climate commitments and the targets we have set for 2030 and 2050, high-speed rail has to play a part on this island.  For me, that goes from Belfast, Dundalk, Dublin and then on to Cork.  I would like an outline from the Minister of State and the Government of our views on high-speed rail, where we see it going and what we hope to achieve with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#H00200","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address this issue in the House.<\/p> <p>The Government is committed to a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland.  As the Senator is no doubt aware, the Minister for Transport is a firm believer in the positive potential of increased and expanded sustainable transport options and the potential role for rail in that regard.  The Minister has announced the all-island strategic rail review, which will be conducted in co-operation with Northern Ireland's Department for Infrastructure.  This review will examine all aspects of interurban and inter-regional rail on the island of Ireland, including the Dublin to Belfast line.  As committed to in the New Decade, New Approach agreement, the review will consider the potential for high and higher speed rail across various corridors, including the Dublin to Belfast line, and examine how to improve regional rail connectivity.  The review will also consider the potential for rail freight on the island and examine the rail networks' connections to our international gateways, ports and airports.  Another area of particular focus for the review will be examining the potential of rail to better connect the north west with the rest of the island.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=JoeOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am informed that the review has just commenced and will be completed by this time next year.  I understand the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, Nichola Mallon, held a joint ministerial meeting with the consultants recently and both Ministers are hugely enthused about the review.<\/p><p>When completed, this review will provide the strategic backdrop to investment in our inter-urban and inter-regional rail network for the next 20 years or more and will be a hugely important piece of work.  In the coming months, there will be a public consultation process as part of the review and I encourage everyone to make their voices heard during that process.<\/p><p>The review is not the only area in which Departments North and South are co-operating.  As part of the development of the European Union's new PEACE PLUS programme, the Department of Transport, in co-operation with its northern colleagues in the Department for Infrastructure, submitted a proposal to expand and replace the existing Enterprise fleet on the Dublin to Belfast line.  This is the largest single project included within the draft PEACE PLUS programme.  Earlier this year, the Special EU Programmes Body proposed an indicative allocation of &euro;165 million towards the project, which makes up almost 18% of the entire PEACE PLUS funding available over the period to 2027.  The project will see the Enterprise fleet completely replaced and expanded and facilitate a move toward an hourly service, which I know will be welcomed by all who live along the route.<\/p><p>The final PEACE PLUS programme is yet to be approved by the European Commission.  However, I understand there is optimism that the strong support shown from both Departments and the Special EU Programmes Body should assist with the project being included in the approved programme.  The timelines of that programme mean that, if included, we should see the new and expanded fleet on the network by 2027.<\/p><p>I look forward to hearing the Senator's views on what I hope we can agree are exciting developments in the context of North-South transport infrastructure.  The longer-term framework to be established by the all-island strategic rail review provides an opportunity for us collectively to develop a vision for rail's potential on this island, while the shorter-term investment planned in the new Enterprise fleet will enable more and more people to choose sustainable options when travelling between the two largest cities on the island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#H00300","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>That is a really excellent response from the Minister of State.  I thank him for taking that to the House today.  I will point out two things.  We want to move towards an hourly service.  That is exactly what we want to do and that is why it is so important that we have the review on inter-regional rail as well.   For the Minister of State's constituency in north Dublin, the issue with the rail traffic coming from Belfast, Newry, Dundalk and Drogheda is the number of commuter trains that start in Laytown, Bettystown and Balbriggan.  The problem is early morning commuter trains.  Those commuter rails in the north Dublin and south Meath area block up the train line, which then slows down the intercity rail at the moment.  It is, therefore, also about trying to resolve that issue in the wider context of this review.  If we can resolve that, and one of the ways of doing so is through high-speed rail, it would make the issue easier for everyone involved.<\/p> <p>The final point is that this is not just about providing faster commuter times from places like Dundalk or Drogheda into Dublin.  It is about going the opposite way as well.  We have very good companies and good jobs in the north east and if we can provide high-speed rail, we can attract people from Dublin out of our cities to live in our regions.  That is the most important thing behind this whole debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#J00200","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  Again, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of Transport, I assure the Senator that the potential for high-speed rail between Belfast, Dundalk and Dublin will be fully considered as part of the strategic rail review.  As mentioned earlier, rather uniquely, this strategic rail review will be conducted on an all-island basis, in full co-operation with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive, and will provide a holistic overview of the potential of rail, not just on this particular corridor but on the island.  Importantly, it will also identify how we move our inter-urban and inter-regional rail services off fossil fuels and towards a decarbonised future, as we must, by 2050.<\/p> <p>Having recently announced Arup as the successful consultant, work has now commenced on what promises to be a very important piece of work, and particularly so for the Belfast-Dundalk-Dublin rail corridor.  The Senator should be assured that in the meantime, there will continue to be investment in the rail network on this corridor, be it through the previously referenced PEACE PLUS programme or indeed, the DART+ programme, which includes electrification of lines and services north of Dublin to Drogheda.<\/p> <p>In conclusion, it should be noted that an important element of new projects in the years to come, including any developing of the Dublin to Belfast line and services, will, of course, be the revised allocations, as will be set out in the new national development plan.

It involves electrification of the line and an upgrade to the DART network which will bring services from the city centre to Maynooth, serving places such as Ashtown, Coolmine, Castleknock, Clonsilla and Hansfield.  Capacity on the line will increase and the frequency of service will increase from six trains per hour to 12 trains per hour in each direction.  Of course, it sets Dublin up as a sustainable city for housing development and economic development.  It will also address the issue of the cost of congestion.  The monetary value of the time lost to the economy is &euro;350 million per annum and could increase to &euro;2 billion by 2033.<\/p><p>There were reports last week of potential delays to MetroLink and DART+.  I am seeking reassurance that the DART+ west project will go ahead as scheduled, that is, with capacity and frequency upgrades in 2025-27.  That is really important.<\/p><p>Progress is not always straightforward and this project will involve the closure of level crossings.  The report states that the closures are essential but it is very difficult for communities to potentially have parts of the community cut off by the closure of the level crossings or to have big infrastructure coming into the area and having an impact.  As such, it has to be handled sensitively and transparently.<\/p><p>The first public consultation was held from 26 August to 21 October last year.  That was in the middle of level 2 and level 3 restrictions.  Only one of the areas that I engage with really mobilised as a community around those proposals because awareness of them was low and, of course, members of the community could not engage with each other.  They did so under a cloud of stress.  Of all the consultations I have engaged with, this was the one about which people were most stressed about because they were not allowed to meet or to knock on doors.  The awareness generated by the leaflet was not very detailed and the devil is in the detail.  How does one mobilise a team in those circumstances?  The particular community to which I refer did so and two options were added post the consultation.  That shows the importance of two-way engagement.<\/p><p>I was hoping that the importance of two-way engagement would be taken on board as part of the second public consultation.  Unfortunately, it was launched during the summer.  It started on 27 July and was to end at the beginning of September.  The consultation period has been pushed out to 29 September but only because a lot of fuss was caused.  The people who were not as involved in previous consultations may not have known that it was likely that the closing date would be pushed out, as has been the case for other public consultations.  The Seanad is only just back from the summer recess and this is my first opportunity to raise this issue.<\/p><p>Many in the communities affected are relying on people who own businesses in the area, such as Ashtown Stables, to act on behalf of the communities.  This is a community that is just getting to grips with the changes that are being proposed but the members of the public who attended a public consultation meeting that was arranged last week were muted, so there was no facility for engagement apart from chat.  I cannot tell the Minister of State how that made people feel.  Many people in the areas cannot use the Internet to access information and they cannot meet up in the way they are used to doing.  The consultation took place during the summer holidays and now they were muted for the second extended consultation.

First, there is the Government's approval of the preliminary business case and, second, there is the submission of a railway order application in respect of DART+ west.  On the first milestone, I understand the Department of Transport has received a preliminary business case and that the preliminary business case is under review, as required by the public spending code.  For major projects such as DART+ the public spending code requires a Government decision and the Minister for Transport expects to bring the matter to the Government for its decision in the fourth quarter.  If approved by the Government, that will allow the contracts to be signed in respect of DART+ fleet and will also allow DART+ west move into the statutory planning system, subject to the completion of the necessary planning and environmental documentation.  The second impending milestone is the submission of the railway order application.  As I mentioned, that application requires the finalisation of an extensive set of documentation, including environmental impact assessment reports.  That work is ongoing.<\/p><p>In addition, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has been engaging with communities and stakeholders as part of the non-statutory public consultation process to better inform the development of DART+ west.  Issues raised during this consultation process need to be fully considered by the company and appropriately addressed.  This can take some time to complete.  Following the first non-statutory consultation process on the emerging preferred route, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann used the feedback received from citizens and public representatives to inform the design process for the preferred option, which is currently subject to another round of public consultation.  I understand particular issues have been raised as part of this round of public consultation which will require further consideration by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann before it will be ready to finalise the railway order.  I am informed that the public consultation process is continuing to the end of this month.  After that, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will reflect on the issues raised and consider an appropriate response.<\/p><p>These consultation processes have been held online as, obviously, they have had to adjust to the Covid restrictions imposed upon society over the last 18 months or so.  There are those, including the Senator, who say online consultation is no substitute for in-person events.

However, I will refer the Senator's specific point regarding the inability to interact fully on the online forums to the Minister.  Once a railway order application is made there will be further opportunities for citizens, public representatives and stakeholders to make their views known during the statutory planning process.<\/p><p>Projects such as DART+ are transformative because of the change they will introduce to our lives and I assure the Senator that this Government believes in properly and positively communicating that change to citizens and communities.

If there is a visible mute and a person is muted in a meeting where there should be engagement, that gives all the wrong messages.<\/p> <p>The cost of making a submission on the railway order is &euro;50.  If this goes through in the planning application as part of the railway order, the community has to pay &euro;50 for a submission.  That is a huge amount of money.

From engaging with people in the local community, I know exactly what happened.  It is now clear that between 19 and 24 August, following a systems failure at the Creagh water treatment plant in Gorey, contaminants entered the water and in subsequent days, significant numbers of people became ill.  We understand that there can be systems failures but the difficulty in this instance was that as the illnesses began to be reported to Irish Water and Wexford County Council and as a number of local councillors and I also began to report them, we kept being told by the relevant authorities that there was no problem, the water was safe and there was no issue.  We placed our trust in those agencies, yet, at the same time, we knew the evidence on the ground was mounting.  It was clear it was coming from the western side of town, which was serviced by the Creagh plant.  We knew from local GPs and hospitals.  Pharmacies were selling out of Imodium tablets.  We knew the stories were mounting.  It was only towards the end of August and into early September that there was finally an acknowledgement that there was a problem.  We have heard the reports about the 52 people who presented to GPs and hospitals but that does not capture the full story.  These people are family and friends.  There are people with whom I grew up and whom I know well who were seriously ill during this period, including pregnant women, a father and husband who is undergoing chemotherapy, elderly and vulnerable people who were simply coming for family dinner at various houses and people who had cramps and were vomiting and passing blood, which are the most horrible of experiences.

It is important to note these incidents have been rectified and the water supply from the two plants is now safe to drink.<\/p> <p>In its letter, the EPA stated an abject failure in management oversight, operational control and responsiveness at two public water treatment plants had allowed unsafe water to enter the public drinking water supply and endanger public health.  As the Senator quite rightly pointed out, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Government find the failures identified by the EPA unacceptable.  People's safety is paramount.  Following receipt of the letter, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, met the managing director of Irish Water as well as the chief executives of Dublin City Council and Wexford County Council at the weekend.  The Minister has requested that Irish Water immediately undertake an audit of water treatment plants throughout the country.  It will prioritise the largest 20 treatment plants, visiting each of them to ensure proper processes are in place to deal with and escalate any incident that may arise.  This is key to having public confidence in our water treatment plants.<\/p> <p>Irish Water's managing director and the local authority chief executives assured the Minister of their full co-operation and that their organisations would work together in full co-operation to put in place any urgent and necessary corrective measures.  Irish Water will work with each local authority in the coming two weeks to conduct refresher training on incident reporting for all plants throughout the country.  Where appropriate, Irish Water will put its own staff on site to ensure the continued safety of water treatment plants.<\/p> <p>Ultimately there are limitations to the current working arrangements between Irish Water and local authorities and this is impacting on the delivery of services.  One of the first initiatives the Minister advanced on taking office was to develop a Government policy paper on the steps required to transform Irish Water into a proper unified national utility.  A process is under way with the Workplace Relations Commission to deliver transformation of this service.  The Minister has also requested that Irish Water and local authorities take further steps to improve Irish Water's control of all water service plants in the immediate term pending the implementation of the agreed longer-term operational and staffing arrangements.  On 4 October, the Minister will again meet Irish Water and local authorities on this very question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#N00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, who is aware that reports will come quite soon from the HSE on the scale of the medical problems that arose in the course of this period.

He will recall that last year I thought we had a good exchange on the crisis in the childcare sector and the urgent need to address overall funding and particular funding directed to worker wages in that sector.  Currently, it costs parents &euro;186 per week per child in childcare, which is a shocking amount.  At the same time we have the worst-paid childcare workers in Europe.  It equates to the most expensive childcare and the worst-paid workers in Europe.<\/p> <p>Right now 55% of early years assistants are paid just &euro;11.91 per hour.  We can compare that with Germany, where rates vary between &euro;18 and &euro;30.  In the Netherlands, the rate is &euro;26 and, in France, it is &euro;19.  We are consistently bottom of the league when it comes to childcare.  I commend the Big Start coalition, which comprises my union, SIPTU and a host of other actors, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Association of Childhood Professionals, the National Women's Council of Ireland and others.  They have come together to address this matter.<\/p> <p>This is my sixth year before a budget standing up to demand action on childcare, particularly for front-line childcare workers.  The most recent survey from the Big Start coalition makes one thing clear, and it is something on which we disagreed last year.  The Minister told me the sector was not in crisis but it most definitely is.  The most extensive survey yet by the Big Start coalition tells us that right now the turnover rate is 40%.  We can think about the impact that is having on the quality of childcare.  A total of 44% of workers said they will not work in the sector for long and they are actively looking to leave.  Worse than that, 80% have said that unless things change in the next year, they will leave as well.  Let us make no mistake but that the sector is in crisis.  Right now, unfortunately, there are cr&egrave;ches working below the required minimum staffing ratio.  There are cr&egrave;ches that are, unfortunately, hiring staff that are not qualified.  That is the extent of the crisis happening right now.<\/p> <p>The good news, which I acknowledge, is that the Minister has been engaged in setting up what I hope will be a joint labour committee, JLC.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is crucial and the Minister mentioned that to me last year.  I want to understand something about this budget.  Some six years on from me raising this issue and ten years on from the start of that campaign, is the Government going to deliver for childcare workers and is the Minister going to ensure not only that the JLC is set up for these workers but that adequate funding is in place?  The asks are simple and I ask the Minister to confirm that the Government will meet these asks in the upcoming budget.  The ask is that we lift all childcare workers out of the range of being paid below a living wage.  That is an easy task to accomplish.  It will cost &euro;75 million.<\/p><p>At the same time, it is also imperative that the Government cuts the cost of childcare for hard-pressed parents.  The ask from SIPTU is for &euro;75 million to cut the cost of childcare by just &euro;35 per week.  That is a reasonable request in these circumstances.  I was chatting to colleagues in the Council of Europe last week and they told me how childcare operates across the rest of Europe, where the state steps in, there is a national model of childcare and the average cost to parents is as little as &euro;150 to &euro;200 per month.  We are paying that amount per week.  We urgently need action.<\/p><p>The key point is that I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that he will deliver this year.  I know he has put some of the building blocks in place but we need to see a JLC set up and we need to see childcare workers being able to negotiate their own pay and conditions, including sick pay.  The Minister should not forget that so many of these workers have to suffer the indignity of signing on every summer.  Let us bring that to an end.  We have waited too long already.  I am hoping that the Minister will give me positive news ahead of this year's budget and the negotiations the Government has had already and that the Government will deliver for childcare workers across this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#O00400","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue, which my Department is monitoring on an ongoing basis and through formal reviews.  The level of pay in the sector does not reflect the value of the work that early learning and care and school-age childcare practitioners do for children, families, society and our economy.  I am doing all that is in my power to address this issue.<\/p> <p>However, as the Senator knows, my Department is not the employer, it does not set wage rates and it does not determine working conditions for staff working in the sector.  That said, my Department has, over a number of years, provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.  These include a year-on-year increase in State funding, higher capitation payment rates for graduates working in the sector and support for school-age childcare to make it easier for providers to offer full-time and full-year employment contracts.  The most recent published data from Pobal indicate that the average hourly wage in the sector was &euro;12.45 in 2020, which was 4% higher than in the previous year.  However, I am also aware that there is considerable variation in wages in the sector, and approximately 56% of early learning and care practitioners earned less than &euro;12.30 per hour in 2020.  As we know and as the Senator referenced, many such practitioners work part-time or on temporary contracts.<\/p> <p>In order to see how we can address this, last December, working in conjunction with SIPTU and Childhood Services Ireland, which is an IBEC trade association, I began a short process in which interested parties were invited to discuss how best to address pay and conditions in the sector and how a JLC might support this.  I appointed Dr. Kevin Duffy, former chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process.  Dr. Duffy made a clear recommendation that the JLC was the way forward.  On foot of Dr. Duffy's report, I wrote to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, recommending the establishment of a JLC.  At the end of June, the Minister of State, Deputy English, signed the establishment order for a JLC for the early years sector.  I see that as a significant and welcome development.  That move has been welcomed by both employers and the trade unions in the sector.  In addition to the JLC process, and following two years of in-depth work, an expert group is due to report this November with recommendations for a new funding model which will structure investment to deliver on the objectives of affordability, quality, inclusion and sustainability.  The expert group's recommendations may offer new avenues through which the State can support service providers to improve pay and to meet the requirements of any future employment regulation order that may arise from the JLC, as well as addressing the issue of parental fees, which the Deputy focused on.<\/p> <p>We discussed the question of sick pay last year.  The best approach is the one the Government is taking in terms of a worker-wide approach to the issue of sick pay.  As the Senator knows, on 9 June this year the T&aacute;naiste announced details of the Government's plan to introduce legislation to give all workers the right to paid sick leave.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is to start next year with three days, and this is to increase to five days in 2023 and seven in 2024.

Obviously, as the Senator knows, I cannot tell him the outcomes of my engagements here today but the priority is a key one for me.  I have met the Big Start coalition.

That is how we address the issue of low pay in the sector in a way that allows for the establishment of a floor in terms of wages and decency for the very first time.  The key negotiation now for the Minister is with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance.  I put it to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth very directly that he has to deliver.  All the work he has done is significant but if the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is going to say \"Not this year, not this time\", it will be too late for the workers in question, who have already waited too long.  I am aware the Minister said addressing this is his top priority, and I believe him in respect of that, but he needs to deliver because there will be no hiding place for the workers at the front line in the sector if he does not deliver on this budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#Q00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I hope we can continue to grow the very significant amount of investment the State already puts into childcare.

Those countries that the Senator rightly makes a comparison with identified years ago, as part of their social model, the importance of childcare.  That has happened only recently in Ireland.  Therefore, we are running to catch up from a standing start.  Previous Ministers have brought us to a position where we have &euro;638 million.

I am not terribly close to her, although I know her reasonably well, but I believe she has been treated extremely badly.  Curiously enough, I was the person who introduced the amendment committing the Government to advertise government positions, so it is an unusual situation to find myself in.  I cannot think of anybody who would be better suited to the role than Katherine Zappone.  She has a very remarkable record in gay rights in Ireland, she has an international reputation and she has contacts.  Who will replace her?  I suggest to members of the Government that they look at the people who were involved in the \"Yes\" side during the marriage equality referendum campaign because they have a great deal of talent.  That they succeeded in getting the \"Yes\" idea through to the Irish people was a remarkable achievement.  I wanted to come to the House today to remark on the situation regarding Katherine Zappone and to say that she has not been treated terribly well.  We have missed a great opportunity for somebody with her talents, contacts and knowledge to represent us at the United Nations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#U00800","speaker":"1675","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>It is great to be back in the Chamber and to have our home reinstated.  I have raised this first issue on many occasions with the Leader and with colleagues in this House, which  is the maternity restrictions that still exist in our 19 maternity hospitals and units throughout the country.  I thank the Leader for taking the initiative in bringing together an all-party Oireachtas group of female Members to try to bring this matter to a resolution and to advocate on behalf of women and their partners throughout the country, who have been subjected to very cruel restrictions that are still in place while other restrictions are being lifted across the board.  We have been talking to, and liaising with, the campaign group Better Maternity Care, which is doing fantastic work in providing a voice for women and their partners throughout the country.<\/p> <p>All Members will agree that when we saw the story that came to the fore about an RT&Eacute; camera crew and staff being allowed into the Rotunda Hospital to record a television programme, while partners and fathers waited in the car park outside as their babies were being born inside, was less than satisfactory.  I would still love to find out the clinical reason why that was permitted and considered safe, yet it was not considered safe or appropriate for partners and fathers to be inside. <\/p> <p>I would welcome the Leader again using her office and the collective strength of this House to try to get a resolution to this matter.  I pose the question - who is making the decisions?  We have clear, national guidelines from the director of the HSE, Paul Reid, the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach, yet hospitals continue to exercise a considerable degree of discretion locally that, in my view, is way beyond their remit.  If additional capacity or new measures need to be put in place, then let us hear the plan because simply saying restrictions will stay in place until it suits hospitals for them not to be, is not a plan at all.<\/p> <p>The second issue I will raise is the return of workers to the office yesterday.  I wish all of them, and their employers, well, but issues are already starting to emerge around the return to the workplace.  One of these is the difficult position employers find themselves in in that they cannot ask a worker if he or she has been vaccinated because it is seen as infringing on that person's civil liberties.  That is fine, but there is a different approach to somebody who has been a close contact of someone who has Covid-19.  If you are vaccinated, you do not need to self-isolate; if you are not vaccinated, you do.  In the workplace, we do not know who should be adhering to what regulation because nobody knows the person's history, nor should they.<\/p> <p>There is a considerable grey area around how workplaces will now function with the regulations that are still in place.  Employers are finding themselves in a very difficult position, as are employees.  We promised employees we would take to a new way of working, that there would be a facility to work from home where possible and that we would put legislation in place to facilitate workers' requests for a work-from-home situation to their employers.  That is not in place yet but people are back in the workplace so there is a gap that needs to be filled by Government.  Clearer rules and regulations around how the new workplace will now work are needed to give employers and employees the certainty they very much need. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#V00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>As Members know, Ireland has set a target to achieve 70% energy generation from renewables by 2030.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->With that in mind, there was some recent news regarding the Macquarie Green Investment Group, GIG, having acquired Fuinneamh Sceirde Teoranta, the developer of a project off the west coast, namely, a proposal for a 400 MW offshore wind farm capable of generating enough energy to power the equivalent of up to 295,000 homes.  This development was recently designated as one of seven developments with relevant project status by the Department of Environment, Climate Action and Communications and it positions the Sceirde Rocks development to be in the first wave of offshore wind projects in Ireland for delivery by 2030.<\/p><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an nuacht go bhfuil togra na Cloiche Sceirde ainmnithe mar cheann de na seacht togra&iacute; le st&aacute;das &aacute;bhartha ag an Roinn Comhshaoil, Aer&aacute;ide agus Cumars&aacute;ide.

We know the importance of offshore wind capability in regard to Ireland's plans and targets for renewables.  Nevertheless, we have recently seen in the media concerns about energy security and these plans for offshore wind are for the medium to long term, although legislation on the planning process for these developments is due to come through the Houses this autumn, which is welcome.  Decisions have been made regarding peat burning and there are questions regarding the future of Moneypoint.  The Celtic interconnector with France, which aims to provide that energy security, has been progressing for some time, and there are some wonderful projects to address issues with solar and wind grid connections throughout the country.<\/p><p>I call for a debate on the issue of energy security with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and whoever else is needed.  Speculation on energy security is a concern in the context of certain projects.  Intel, for example, is considering locating a new plant in Ireland and there may be concerns regarding our capabilities to provide a consistent, constant and regular supply of energy.  We should, therefore, invite the Minister to appear before the House for a full debate on the issue as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#V00300","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I congratulate Senator Moynihan on her marriage and wish her and her husband every best wish for the future.

I felt pure joy, as well as a strong sense of pride, when I saw that three midlands towns had made it onto <i>The Irish Times<\/i>'s list of the 20 best places to live in Ireland.  Tullamore, Abbeyleix and Ballinakill were all there, on a list of only 20 that covered the entire country.  That is pretty impressive and it emphasised to me the need for us to take time every so often to recognise and celebrate what we have.  I think we know instinctively how important it is to do this.  When we are abroad or we meet people who have visited here, we are only too ready to lap up and agree with their insights into how easy it is to feel at home here, but when we are at home, we perhaps slip a little too easily into focusing on the negative.  While there are things we can and must do better, and ways in which we could and should improve, in so many ways Ireland is a wonderful place, and the midlands has much of what is best about it.<\/p><p>Accordingly, I congratulate Tullamore, Abbeyleix and Ballinakill and will now tell those who do not know much about them why they are so special.  Tullamore is a large town located in the middle of the country.  The Grand Canal runs through it and it has a harbour.  While there are still some empty premises, the town centre is busy and bustling, with pilot pedestrianisation, outdoor dining and wonderful streetscape enhancement works that brought it to life this summer.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pippa Hackett:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Ballinakill has much to offer too.  It is known as the town of the woods and has an entrancing 18th-century landscape in Heywood Gardens.  Its most unusual feature, an outdoor heated swimming pool, thrived this summer thanks to the work of the dedicated community there.  As for Abbeyleix, it is a pretty heritage town and is leading the way in the fight against climate change.  Its town centre has a fantastic NeighbourWood project while its precious amenity bog will host the community wetlands forum next week.<\/p><p>Tullamore, Ballinakill, Abbeyleix and many other towns like them are places where people feel connected and part of the community.  We need more of that and this Government is working hard to provide it.  We have a rural future policy as well as a town centres first policy.  We are connecting people with broadband and active travel infrastructure and supporting job creation through the just transition fund.  The sense of community can easily get lost in cities, as well as in isolated rural homes miles from a local village.  However, in many of our towns and villages, community is thriving.  Let us recognise, value, celebrate and nurture that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#W00200","speaker":"1661","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Moynihan agus a fear cheile nua.

It was a great day and we are very lucky to live in a lovely village where our neighbours sent us off with a street party and we were able to walk down to the venue and the pub.  I felt like I was getting married in the 1960s rather than having a big fancy wedding.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of rents, which has been a popular topic in the news today.  Before we left this House before the summer, one of the things the Government put through in the Affordable Housing Bill was linking rents to the consumer price index, CPI, which was, and still is, very welcome because, over time, that will ensure rents do not run away with themselves.  How far they ran away with themselves in Ireland has been well documented.  In a EUROSTAT report in 2020, rents in Ireland were up 61.8% whereas the European average was 14.9%.  That points to a real crisis in terms of rent in this country.  Even last year, it was up 7% outside of Dublin.  In addition, we see worrying signs that inflation is rising again because of energy costs and we will potentially have the same increase in rents we had in the rent pressure zones, which were becoming a target.<\/p> <p>I ask the Government to look at that issue again.  While linking it to the CPI is welcome, I propose a temporary rent freeze.  We in the Labour Party are calling for a three-year rent freeze.  I ask that Government colleagues consider supporting our renters' rights Bill, which is being brought before the D&aacute;il tomorrow by Deputy Bacik.  There are many very constructive points in that Bill.  I believe everybody across the board would like to see more protection being given to renters.  Small things are also included in that Bill, which will have a big impact on people's quality of life, such as being able to keep pets.  I am dealing with a case at the moment where a family has had their dog for seven years and they are being told they have to give up their pet to stay in their rental accommodation.  There are many very constructive points in the Bill that will bring rental standards in line with European norms and give people security of tenure.  I ask, therefore, that the Government allows that to go through to Second Stage and Committee Stage and works with us on bringing our rental standards in line with European norms.<\/p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise is about a creeping development that is happening.  I am sorry; I have run out of time.  I will raise the issue again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#Y00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the issue of rights of way, the deadline of which was due to expire at the end of November.

I am delighted the Cabinet, through the recommendations of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has decided to defer that.  It allows for a very stressful situation for all involved to be deferred and gives people a little bit of space to ensure the rights of way are registered, which is vitally important.<\/p> <p>The other issue I wish to raise is the current crisis that hangs over the horticultural sector in this country.

It has given the town a real boost and it has been so important for local businesses.  I wish to acknowledge the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the roll-out of the shop enhancement fund under the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Six towns in County Galway received this funding and the businesses in the towns in question - Oranmore, Oughterard, Loughrea, Headford, Glenamaddy and Ballygar - will all have the opportunity to upgrade their premises and get a significant amount of support from the local authorities.  It is a phenomenal scheme.  In County Roscommon, Athleague, Knockcroghery, Roscommon town, Ballaghaderreen and Boyle will benefit.  Behind the projects in each of those towns in the Roscommon local authority area were the Tidy Towns associations.  They all came together and put in these submissions.  It will be phenomenal.  It was really important to try to tackle the issue of vacant units in many of these towns.  That will drive investment and new retailers, people with an idea for setting up a shop in the town.<\/p> <p>There is also construction taking place in Roscommon town.

Yesterday morning, a woman and her 24-year-old son were laid to rest in County Kerry.  They were kind and gentle people taken from us by a wanton act of violence.  The tragedy comes while the terrible happenings in Kanturk, County Cork on 26 October last year, when father and brother turned on their own family and then on themselves, are still fresh in our minds.  Although the prevalence of firearms in these communities enables these vicious acts, it is all too often land or farm ownership disputes that cause them.  We need to examine critically the processes or programmes in place to educate farming families on their rights in respect of disinheritance and land ownership protection.  We need a dedicated support process for families engaged in disputes over wills.  We need to look at the role that can be played by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and his Department, as well as the Irish Farmers Association, in the provision of mental health supports in rural communities.  The increased attention being paid to mental health in recent years is of immense importance but we cannot allow it to be confined to students' unions and Twitter campaigns.  These senseless killings and suicides will only become more prevalent if the underlying issues are not addressed.  It is safe to say that in every parish in the countryside there is a family farm affected by land disputes and farmers listening to these proceedings will know someone affected.

Some of this is driven by social media, which I hope we will address in the context of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.

There are discharges of raw sewage into the bay on an ongoing basis and sometimes, it appears, there are also discharges from industrial centres.  People swim there, more often than they did a couple of years ago.  There is plenty of sea swimming happening in places in my area, such as the Forty Foot, Sandycove, Seapoint and Hawk Cliff.  People are swimming in the sea daily and when the warning comes that there is a problem, it is often too late.  It might come 24 hours after the discharge or after a water quality test shows bacteria or whatever else might be in the water.  There must be a step up on dealing with this issue.  There must be regular testing not just in the summer but throughout the year, because people are swimming in the sea all year round.  It is a wonderful opportunity for them to get out and exercise.  It is good for everybody involved.  The State, the local authorities in Dublin and the Department must set out a safe regime for them to do that, to ensure they know when they go swimming in the sea that they are swimming in water that is clean and will not make them sick.  We heard earlier today about problems with inland water, but the seawater, which should be clean and pristine, is not always so.  When it is not we need to know, and that can only happen through regular testing throughout the year.

Indeed it is very important that we see a significant rise in welfare rates.  Bear in mind that in 2009, the welfare rate was &euro;197.  It is only &euro;204 now so we certainly need to see a significant lift in rates.  <\/p><p>For the past nine years, we have had an outrageous scheme called the special assignee relief programme.  This programme subsidises the richest people in the country - the top multinationals - who can write off 30% of their PAYE tax bill to the tune of &euro;1 million earnings per year.  It is quite shocking.  It involves subsidising the richest people in this country who are being subsidised by ordinary workers and taxpayers.  It is important to raise this before the budget because, of course, we will all be voting on the budget in October.  I appeal to my colleagues on the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael benches to face up to the fact that it is an outrageous subsidy to the richest people in this State.  These are people who earn millions each year and yet they are able to write off 30% of their PAYE tax bill because this Government and successive Governments since Michael Noonan introduced the measure nine years ago thought it was a good idea.  In terms of the suffering and hardship we see across the country, there is no justification for subsidising the richest top executives in this country so let us deal with it and let us use that money to ensure decent rates of welfare for people in this State.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#AA00400","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Sometimes Members, no more than myself, leave their phones on so I remind everybody to turn their phones back on when they leave the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#BB00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>It is great to be back.  Comhghairdeas to Senators Moynihan and Ward.  Romance is clearly in the air.  I wish them a lifetime of happiness with their life partners.  It is great to be back - largely because of the vaccination programme.  More than 7 million doses have been administered.  We have led the way in Europe, it is a huge success story and I thank everybody involved in the administration of the vaccines.  There was a lot of scaremongering and criticism but everybody involved has done a tremendous job in Grangegorman in my constituency, Croke Park and DCU.  It is not just the vaccination programme.  The testing and tracing programme has been phenomenal.  Everybody with whom I have engaged has been incredibly professional but also really sensitive because it has been a hugely stressful time so we owe them a huge debt of thanks.  I would like the Leader to convey that when she meets with Paul Reid later today on behalf of the Oireachtas women's group.  I thank her for taking that initiative.<\/p> <p>I would like the Leader to raise the ongoing guidelines for primary school students if they are identified as close contacts.  Under the guidelines, if a child is a primary school student and has been in contact with somebody identified as being positive, he or she must restrict his or her movements even if he or she is not showing any symptoms.  This is resulting in a massive loss of school attendance for primary school children in my constituency and around the country.  It is hugely damaging to their academic education and their social skills.  It is creating enormous anxiety for the children, is over-medicalising this situation for very young children and is a cause of major inconvenience and stress for their parents.  I know NPHET has agreed to look at it.  We have had falling rates of infection four weeks in a row.  We were told repeatedly that schools are safe environments and our vaccination levels are at over 90% among 16-year-olds so I ask the Leader to appeal to Paul Reid and NPHET to review that and relax the restrictions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#BB00300","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>It is great to be back in the Chamber.

There is a huge backlog at present, in particular with theory tests.  The biggest issue my office has come across, over the past week in particular, is with regard to dyslexic people who want to sit a theory test.  Traditionally they have had a reader provided but this has been taken away.  This limits the ability of these boys, girls and people to get through the process.  This is a huge issue for a certain cohort of society as 10% of people are dyslexic.  Normally they have a reader to work through the theory test with them but this has been taken away.  We need to make sure the institutions of the State and semi-State bodies look at such protocols and have the ability to change them rapidly.  It is unfair and discriminatory.  It is not appropriate.  Because of it, people are being denied the opportunity to sit a driving test.  In my part of the world if people cannot pass a driving test, they do not have the ability to go anywhere or do anything.<\/p><p>This is a major issue for us as a society.  I call on the Leader to contact the RSA regarding this issue to ensure it provides readers.  I spoke to the RSA this afternoon and the service is not available today.

This has been exacerbated because of Covid-19.  It was frightening to hear him speak, in particular about the rise of emotional distress among young people in our country, the challenges they face and the realisation that much more needs to be done.  The very culture of how we deal with this is also an issue.  Considering we are such a nation of talkers, it is not spoken about half enough.  Dr. Barry spoke extensively about the need for a wider conversation about self-care, whereby we look after ourselves in our own lives, emotional resilience and how to manage our anxiety.  He also spoke about the range of anxieties faced by young people, from acute anxiety to social anxiety to general anxiety.  All of these have a very damaging impact on people's lives.<\/p><p>None of these issues gets discussed half enough, but when issues boil down to a point of self-harm, we end up speaking extensively about the need for State intervention and more support.  Last Sunday morning, I met a woman in Blackwater Park in Navan who spoke to me about the battle she had when she was trying to get mental health support for her daughter.  She had to go round the houses for people to take the issue in hand.<\/p><p>At present, there is no end to the amount of money being spent in this sphere.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, in this respect.  We need to see a change in attitude in tandem.  The most effective way to help this process is through dialogue and conversations in our schools, and not having a sense that speaking about these issues is a sign of weakness, particularly among young boys and, indeed, men.  Men's mental health is simply not spoken about enough.  I have paid tribute in the House previously to Rory O'Connor of <i>Rory's Stories<\/i>fame, who has been a huge advocate for positive mental health action in this country.<\/p><p>At the same meeting with Dr. Harry Barry, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who has responsibility in this area, addressed the range of actions being taken by the Department.  I would like to see the Minister of State come to the Chamber so these issues can be discussed and thrashed out in full.  In conjunction with the Minister, Deputy Foley, we can discuss how a very positive set of actions in school settings could be pushed, whether in classrooms or schoolyards, so those who are suffering with anxiety and emotional distress as a result of everything that is happening will know there is somewhere, and someone to whom, they can turn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021092100002#CC00200","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speech","time":1632231000,"counter":96,"content":"<p>This is our first occasion to meet for some time.

For many students even in second year it is their first time setting foot on campus.<\/p> <p>I raise the serious matter of the shortage of student accommodation.  There have been many reports about this, particularly in my area of Limerick, which has three third level institutes.  A kitchen was advertised as being suitable for student accommodation which had a bunk bed beside the cooker.  That was clearly not suitable accommodation.  There is accommodation that was once used by asylum seekers and approximately 200 yd from the front entrance of Mary Immaculate College there is a boarded-up unit.  We must think outside the box and for the long term.  Many people might have taken in students in the past but are not doing so now because of Covid-19.  It is certainly something we must consider seriously as the matter is not confined to Limerick.  The problem is across the country.<\/p> <p>I was alarmed by three phone calls I received from three businesses today.

I have spoken here many times in the past about energy security.  Without being a Cassandra, it has reached a critical stage.  Several times during the summer, our warmest months, the warning register was showing up in amber.  That means we were close enough to being at full supply and being maxed out.  It is a real worry as to whether we will have an energy supply and confidence in the winter.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was unable last week to give a categoric assurance that we would be able to meet all our energy needs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, said more or less the same thing on television at the weekend.<\/p> <p>It is time we woke up and started doing something about it.  Moneypoint power station is just across the river from me.  In the last 24 hours, Moneypoint, which is coal-fired, was putting up over 21% of the total national usage of power.  In the same period, all of the renewable energies combined, including wind, came up with 14%.  I am not knocking wind power.  It is important and last year upwards of 40% of our requirement was met by wind power but there were many days last year when wind power contributed almost nil and several days when it contributed zero to the grid.  In that context, what are we going to do?  We all know, particularly those in the Green Party, that there is a problem with fossil fuels.  I thought we had an understanding that in the interim period we would make use of the resources that are available to us.<\/p> <p>There is a project which I have mentioned here many times, namely Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG.  It proposes to import gas in liquefied form into the Shannon Estuary in County Kerry.  That project is before the planners so I will not say a whole lot about it.  I know I am running out of time but it is important that the planning process would be allowed to proceed without any interference from outside bodies, including the Government.  The promoters of the project are quite happy to accept a condition that only non-fracked gas will be used.  This is important and needs to be stressed.  They are quite happy to rule out fracked gas, which is something one cannot say about our current supply as it is coming from Russia.  Much of it is fracked gas and a lot of it is dubious.  I am speaking on behalf of the constituency I live in and which I represented at local level for 25 years but I am also speaking in the national interest.  We must be mature enough to realise that despite what is in the programme for Government, we have to be able to vary it and deal with situations that are in front of us.
