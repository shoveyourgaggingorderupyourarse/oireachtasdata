There have been over 1,800 referrals to Turas Nua since January 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The policies being pursued by Government have been effective in reducing unemployment, both nationally and in County Carlow, and I am confident that they will continue to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900056#WRA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":34,"content":"<p>Question No. 63 answered with Question No. 59.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Social Scheme Eligibility","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900056#WRA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[8109\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900056#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the means test applicable to participation on the rural social scheme will be amended (details supplied);

A key function of Embassies in countries where Ireland has a development co-operation programme is to actively monitor risk and ensure that the evolution of a country programme responds dynamically to risk environments.  Accountants, internal auditors and technical specialists at mission level work in policy teams, and frequently in coordination with partner donors and international financial institutions, to drive this dynamic risk management, underpinned by headquarters oversight including  by the Department's independent Audit and Evaluation Unit.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Irish Aid's risk management approach, Ireland's overseas development assistance is channelled through a variety of financing modalities and partners, including official, civil society and multilateral or UN partnerships.  This ensures that if problems occur, a given funding modality may be suspended to allow actions to be taken to ensure that issues arising are fully and satisfactorily addressed.  It is not the case that assistance to countries is suspended or restricted, rather the mix of modalities is adjusted in light of risk analysis in any given moment.<\/p>  <p>  In a number of countries where Ireland works, support is also given to relevant government institutions, such as the auditor general&rsquo;s offices, anti-corruption bureaux and civil society monitoring and advocacy groups, to help ensure that public monies, both Ireland's and partner governments&rsquo; are used to good effect and in accordance with both the spirit and letter of our partnership agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900060#WRE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[8219\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900060#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the measures that have been put in place following the suspension of Irish aid to Uganda in 2012; if Uganda is still subject restrictions with regard to Irish aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":231,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to ensuring that aid is spent efficiently and effectively to tackle global challenges. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a zero tolerance approach towards fraud, and has in place policies and procedures for the prevention, detection and dealing with instances of fraud, or suspected fraud.  These policies and procedures are in place in all Embassies with respect to the disbursement and expenditure of Irish Aid funds. <\/p>  <p>  The Embassy in Kampala manages the Irish Aid programme through the 2016-2020 Uganda Country Strategy.  Within this strategy Ireland is focused on social protection, HIV-AIDS, education and governance, and has programmes targeted at Uganda&rsquo;s poorest region, Karamoja. In delivering this programme through local partners, risks are identified in a proposed partner organisation as part of an initial appraisal process. The nature of these risks are assessed and if mitigation is possible, the Embassy will agree to support the organisation. Currently, the Irish Aid programme in Uganda does not use Government financial systems, but rather partners with UN agencies and NGOs in delivery. Financial and management systems assessments are periodically conducted and funding is earmarked for identified activities that are pivotal to achieving results.<\/p>  <p>  The programme in Uganda has been under close scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General due to the 2012 fraud involving the Office of the Prime Minister.  In February 2017, a delegation from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office visited Uganda, as a country level example of the Department&rsquo;s control systems and improvements in procedures for bilateral assistance, following the major fraud case in 2012.  The Department continuously reviews internal controls and risk management, and has revised and enhanced its grant management process for the Irish Aid programme, taking account the lessons learned from this fraud in 2012.  The ongoing work of our internal auditors in key partner countries includes assessment of compliance with these and all the processes in place to manage grants.<\/p>  <p>  I would point out the important role of the Uganda Auditor General, whose team had been strengthened by Irish Aid, in detecting and highlighting the fraud, as well as the fact that all Irish funds were returned to the Embassy in Uganda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900060#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900060#WRE01500"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[8257\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900060#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the contract for the Passport Express service with An Post will be renewed when the current contract expires; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>The Passport Express service provides an option for citizens to submit their passport application through the network of more than one thousand post offices across the State.

This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research.  Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.<\/p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance.  To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:  <\/p>  <p>  - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities;  <\/p>  <p>  - development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes; and  <\/p>  <p>  - ongoing communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.<\/p>  <p>  The above approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed. In this regard, the Insurance Ireland\/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.<\/p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  The CFRAM Programme focussed on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in Flood Risk Management Plans, published in May 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Ballybofey-Stranorlar was included as an AFA with the development of a Flood Relief Scheme proposed for the area.  I understand that the proposed Scheme for Ballybofey-Stranorlar is not part of the first phase of projects to be advanced from the nationwide Flood Risk Management Plans, but that the OPW and Donegal County Council will work closely to ensure that it will be commenced in the coming years and within the 10-year timeframe for the programme of investment.  Until this time, funding of &euro;157,500 was approved under the OPW's 2018 Minor Works Scheme for the removal of vegetation and trees on embankments and also for the construction of sumps\/pumping areas.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.  In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900060#WRE05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry Tax Reliefs","counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900060#WRE05400"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[7829\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900060#WRE05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans in relation to the regional film development uplift corporation tax credit introduced in the Finance Act 2018; his further plans to extend the area specific annex to the EU Commission decision C(2014) 3153; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1297","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":273,"content":"<p>Section 481 TCA 1997 provides a 32% payable credit for eligible expenditure on film production in Ireland.

The enforcement investigations are also examining whether the documentation, which customers received from lenders, was clear and what key decisions were taken by lenders, or not taken, which resulted in customers losing their tracker rate or right to a tracker rate.  In addition, the Central Bank is examining instances where lenders may have failed to have the requisite safeguards in place to ensure that they implemented the &ldquo;Stop the Harm&rdquo; principles set out within the Central Bank&rsquo;s Framework for conducting the Tracker Mortgage Examination.

Progress has been made on implementing these recommendations since the publication of the review on Budget Day last year.<\/p>  <p>   Proposed legislation was submitted before Cabinet today (19 February) for approval.  This legislation will provide for the role and responsibilities of a Chairperson of the TAC and recruitment for a Chairperson will commence immediately following enactment.  It will also clarify some aspects of the existing appeals legislation to facilitate the appeals process.<\/p>  <p>   The Appeals Commissioners and my Department are in regular contact about governance matters and corporate supports.  Work is ongoing to identify the supports required and assist the TAC in putting the necessary governance structures in place.  A new administration working group (which includes the Commissioners, and officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners) has been formed and meets regularly to address issues relating to the administration of tax appeals.<\/p>  <p>   I provided for a near doubling of the TAC budget for 2019 to facilitate the recommended staff increases and improvements to computer equipment.  The TAC have sought to increase their staff complement through recruitment as per the recommendations of the report.  A permanent head of administration at Principal Officer grade will commence work at the Commission on 27 February.  This follows a number of seconded Principal Officers from my Department who filled the role on a fixed term basis.<\/p>  <p>   A competition for Temporary Appeal Commissioners is due to be launched by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) this week.  The competition will seek to fill two positions (or full-time equivalents) with immediate effect and to establish a panel of suitable candidates should further appointments be required.  Consideration will be given to applicants with relevant experience from a range of professional backgrounds, including those with experience in Revenue or in Customs as well as those with qualifications in tax and in the legal field.<\/p>  <p>   As recommended by the review, the TAC has requested the PAS to appoint an IT specialist at the grade of Assistant Principal Officer. With the appointment of this position an ICT Liaison Group will commence meetings.  This will include officials from the TAC, Revenue and the Department of Finance, who will meet to discuss and develop specifications for a new appeal case management system, as well as other IT matters.  In the interim, work has commenced to address existing IT hardware needs within the TAC.<\/p>  <p>   The TAC have also requested the PAS to appoint four Clerical Officers.

The overall objective is to ensure that, from 2007, individuals with an adjusted income of &euro;500,000 or more (where the full restriction applied) pay an effective rate of Income Tax of approximately 20 per cent on a combination of adjusted income and ring-fenced income.  The restriction began to apply where an individual&rsquo;s adjusted income exceeded &euro;250,000 and the full restriction applied where an individual had adjusted income of &euro;500,000 or more.<\/p>  <p>  The 2010 Finance Act introduced further limitations on the use of specified reliefs, with effect from 1 January 2010.  These limitations are designed to ensure that individuals with an adjusted income level of &euro;400,000 or more (where the full restriction applies) pay an effective rate of Income Tax of approximately 30 per cent on a combination of adjusted income and ring-fenced income.  In addition, the adjusted income on which the restriction begins to apply was reduced to &euro;125,000.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's question regarding the estimated extra revenue that would be expected to accrue for each reduction in &euro;2,500 until a threshold of &euro;100,000 in the High Earners&rsquo; Restriction, I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to accurately estimate the yield from the proposed change.  Taxpayers are not required to submit a form RR1 (which is submitted by taxpayers to provide their calculation of the restriction) unless their adjusted income exceeds &euro;125,000, therefore there is no basis on which to identify those affected by lowering the threshold.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's question regarding the estimated extra revenue that would be expected to accrue for each increase of &euro;5,000 in the maximum reliefs allowed under the High Earners' Restriction, Revenue advise me that increasing the relief threshold amount would result in fewer taxpayers being subject to the restriction.  Therefore it is not expected that such a change would result in an additional yield in revenue. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's question regarding the estimated extra revenue that would be expected to accrue for each reduction of 1% in the aggregate of specified reliefs of adjusted income allowed under the high earners&rsquo; restriction, I am advised by Revenue that lowering the percentage level of specified reliefs to adjusted income to less than 20% could result in additional cases being subject to the restriction.  However, as there is no RR1 return for these cases, they are not readily identifiable and so there is no basis on which to estimate a yield associated with these changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900061#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900061#WRF02400"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[8266\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900061#WRF02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a ban on the below invoice cost selling of alcohol would result in an increase in VAT revenues; if it is within his power to cease the practice of below invoice cost selling; if it is possible through secondary legislation to cease the practice of below invoice cost selling; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>Where a retailer is in a situation of net VAT gain as a result of below cost selling, this is not a loss to the Exchequer or an additional benefit to the retailer, it is merely how VAT is charged. <\/p>  <p>  VAT is a tax on the value added to a supply, and the collection and recovery of VAT takes place at each stage of the chain of supply from manufacturing to retailer.

The number in post primary schools excluding ETBs was 25,608.  This information has been extracted from the Online Claims System (OLCS).  The Online Claims System (OLCS) is the system designed to enable schools to record all absences (substitutable and non-substitutable) for all Staff Members paid directly on the Departments payroll and to make claims for substitution. The information in relation to the 2018\/19 school year is not available.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the reasons as to why there is no substitute claim recorded by the managerial authority of the school are as follows:  <\/p>  <p>  Professional Teacher Development - In some cases the schools were closed as teachers attended in service training for the new primary curriculum. These absences are recorded as professional teacher development and as such is normally a substitutable absence but if the school is closed for the training then no substitute is employed.   <\/p>  <p>  Force Majeure\/Illness in Family - The first day of this leave absence is not substitutable.<\/p>  <p>  Self-Certified (Uncertified) Sick Leave - This leave is no longer substitutable except in smaller primary schools for multiple absences on the same day.  This does not apply at post-primary level as all self certified sick leave absences are non-substitutable.  <\/p>  <p>  Job&ndash;Sharing - If a teacher is job-sharing and goes on leave for e.g. Maternity Leave, Sick Leave their leave is entered in one block and there will only be a substitute recorded for that teacher for one week out of every two as their job-sharing partner is working the other week. <\/p>  <p>  Visiting Teachers - These teachers must have their leave recorded on OLCS but due to the nature of their posts they may not always be replaced by a substitute.<\/p>  <p>  Teachers with Regular part-time Contracts of less than 25 hour e.g. Teacher absent on maternity\/sick leave etc. with a contract of 10 hours per week. The leave is entered for the total absence but less than 5 days per week are substitutable, leaving the other days of the week displaying as no substitute used. <\/p>  <p>  Principal Release &ndash; A number of these days are covered by the Primary Principals release supply panel. Currently there are a number of temporary teachers employed who cover these absences across a number of schools.  These absences are recorded but no substitute is required. <\/p>  <p>  Supervision and Substitution - Some substitutable absences in post-primary schools are covered by teachers whom have signed up for the Supervision and Substitution Scheme which means that there will not be a claim submitted for some absences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900063#WRH04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Works Scheme Applications","counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900063#WRH04700"},{"type":"question","counter":444,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[7858\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900063#WRH04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if an application for emergency works will be considered for a school (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":445,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department is currently not in receipt of any application for emergency works funding from this school.

In the case of such projects, the cost (which also includes Facilities Management and lifecycle costs) is determined at Financial Close and payment by the Department is by way of monthly Unitary Charges over the operational period, usually 25 years.  <\/p><p>Information in respect of capital projects in the Higher Education Sector with building contracts in excess of &euro;10m and with final accounts agreed and 10% higher than the building contracts will be forwarded separately to the Deputy when the relevant information is collated and finalised. <\/p><p>Building Contracts in excess of &euro;10m<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>County<\/th><th>Roll No.<\/th><th>School\u00a0<\/th><th>Year<\/th><th>Contract Sum Incl VAT<\/th><th>Date LOA signed\/ Contract commenced<\/th><th>Final Account Agreed Sum incl VAT<\/th><th>Reason for variation: Change Orders, Conciliation etc<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Cork<\/td><td>68264R<\/td><td>Edmund Rice College, Carrigaline<\/td><td>2017<\/td><td>&euro;13,322,007.84<\/td><td>24\/03\/2016<\/td><td>&euro;14,683,207.60<\/td><td>Approved change orders<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900065#WRK05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Closures","counter":580,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900065#WRK05600"},{"type":"question","counter":581,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[8495\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900065#WRK05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a trust responsible for a school (details supplied) advising parents and staff that it plans to close the school; if it advised his Department of the decision to close the school; the action he will take for the school to remain open; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":582,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the decision making authority for a school closure belongs to the Patron of a school, and this is subject to the agreement of my Department.

These contracts are generally awarded on the basis of lowest tender.<\/p><p>For larger or more complex school building projects, where it is considered that pre-qualification of contractors is warranted, the Restricted procedure is normally used. In the Restricted procedure, there is an intermediary qualification stage during which the numbers of applicants is reduced (or restricted) to a specified amount (normally 8 - 10).  The pre-qualification process uses a combination of pass\/fail criteria and qualitative criteria to establish the tender short-list.  All criteria have minimum standards which must be met.  These contracts are then generally awarded on the basis of the lowest tender.<\/p><p>Tenders for projects being delivered under my Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;Design &amp;amp; Build&rdquo; programme are evaluated using the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) approach. This means that the criteria for the award of the contract include technical merit as well as price.  In the case of the Department&rsquo;s current Design and Build programme<i>, <\/i>Technical Merit carries a 60% weighting and Price carries a 40% weighting.  Over 150 projects have been delivered under the Department&rsquo;s Design and Build programme since it was commenced in 2008.<\/p><p>The evaluation of tenders for projects being delivered under Public Private Partnerships (PPP) arrangements has also used the MEAT approach.

Collectively these venues will be the next priority for investment in courthouse facilities outside the capital. <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that it envisages a courthouse comprising four courtrooms and related facilities (consultation rooms, custody facilities, facilities for juries and vulnerable witnesses, and legal practitioner&rsquo;s suites) as being required to meet current and future needs in Tralee and that this will require a building significantly larger than the existing courthouse on Ashe Street.  The scope for refurbishing and developing the existing courthouse on Ashe Street to provide the envisaged accommodation is extremely limited due to the nature of the building and the constrained nature of the site.<\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also advised that it is currently considering a number of options for Tralee Courthouse, including the level of extension and refurbishment achievable within the confines of the existing courthouse site; whether it would be feasible to acquire an adjacent town centre site and the degree of extension and refurbishment this would allow.  Previous efforts to acquire adjacent sites on Ashe Street have not been successful as the sites could not be acquired at a price that represented value for money. <\/p>  <p>  A further option is to build a new modern courthouse on a greenfield\/brownfield site and a number of potential sites are being considered in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has further advised that the Chief Executive of the Courts Service has recently met with the Chief Executive of Kerry County Council in Tralee to discuss the future provision of court facilities there.

In the decade since the original plan, international research has tended to favour smaller prisons within reach of support communities as the best option for rehabilitation.

Principally, the person must have disposable income of less than &euro;18,000 per annum and disposable capital assets of less than &euro;100,000 (excluding the home in which they live). <\/p><p>The person&rsquo;s case must also satisfy the merits criteria laid down under that Act.  These criteria include if the applicant is reasonably likely to be successful in the proceedings and if having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the cost to the Board as against the benefit to the applicant, it is reasonable to grant legal aid. <\/p><p>The Deputy should note that in many repossession cases the applicant is unlikely to have any prospect of success as the lender will usually be entitled to orders for possession and sale in circumstances where the mortgage is valid and in arrears.  In such circumstances the applicant is unlikely to meet the criteria for the granting of civil legal aid. <\/p><p>However, they may be eligible under the Abhaile Scheme for both financial and legal advice and help to get a solution in place which will resolve their home mortgage arrears and ensure they can stay in their homes, and I deal with this below. <\/p><p>There is no specific funding provided to the Legal Aid Board for the defence of repossession cases nor does the Board break down spending on such cases.  This is because legal services in repossession proceedings, where provided, are entirely provided by salaried solicitors in Legal Aid Board law centres who do other legal aid work e.g. family law and child care.  Services are therefore provided out of the Board&rsquo;s general resources i.e. its grant from the Oireachtas and income from contributions and costs recovered.<\/p><p>There is no separate waiting list for repossession cases and the waiting time applicable is the waiting time at the particular law centre to which the person applies.  The waiting times at Legal Aid Board law centres as at 31<sup>st<\/sup>January 2019 are set out as an appendix. <\/p><p>I must clarify that the Legal Aid Board is tasked with providing civil legal aid.  In most cases this legal aid is not free.  While services provided pursuant to the Abhaile scheme are free of charge as they are provided to insolvent persons, most applicants (including those seeking legal services to defend repossession proceedings) pay a contribution for legal advice and a further contribution if they require representation in court.<\/p><p>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that insolvent persons seeking <b><i>legal advice and assistance<\/i><\/b>in relation to repossession proceedings against their home may be able to avail of such advice through the Abhaile scheme, which is the Government&rsquo;s free mortgage arrears support service, launched by the Government in October 2016. <\/p><p>Abhaile is not focused on bringing challenges to repossession proceedings because in most cases this will not help the borrower, for the reasons explained above.  Instead, Abhaile focuses on solving the borrower&rsquo;s substantive problem, by getting in place a solution to the arrears themselves &ndash; at the same time, keeping the borrower in their home and helping them back to solvency.  This is a far more sustainable and effective focus for public intervention &ndash; both more effective for borrowers, and better for taxpayers. <\/p><p>Abhaile does provides legal aid for a borrower to seek court review under section 115A of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 (as amended), where creditors refuse a reasonable personal insolvency proposal put forward by the borrower that includes their home mortgage arrears.  In the year to July 2018, 64% of such cases were decided in favour of the borrower. <\/p><p>The legal advice and assistance services provided under Abhaile to borrowers regarding home mortgage arrears include advice on repossession proceedings against the home and are as follows :<\/p><p>- A solicitor consultation service, which provides a free legal advice consultation to provide the borrower with independent legal advice on the borrower&rsquo;s best options for sustainable resolution of the mortgage arrears on their home and on any repossession proceedings affecting the home, with written confirmation of that advice to the borrower.  A second consultation is also available under Abhaile, where justified;<\/p><p>- A duty solicitor service, which provides advice and assistance to unrepresented borrowers facing repossession proceedings at county registrars&rsquo; courts.  With leave of the Court, this can include applying for adjournment to facilitate the borrower getting a solution into place, and speaking for the borrower in court.  In addition, MABs court mentors are at court to provide information and support to unrepresented defendants.<\/p><p>The eligibility criteria for the advice and assistance elements of Abhaile are that the person must be:<\/p><p>- insolvent (as defined under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012: i.e. &lsquo;unable to pay their debts in full as they fall due&rsquo;);<\/p><p>- in mortgage arrears on the home in which they normally reside (principal private residence); <\/p><p>- at risk of losing their home (e.g. they have received from the mortgage lender repossession proceedings, a letter indicating that such proceedings will issue, a letter indicating that they are deemed non-cooperating, or an invitation to consider sale, surrender or other loss of all or part of the home); and<\/p><p>- reasonably accommodated (i.e. the costs of continuing to live in the home are not disproportionately expensive having regard to the needs of the borrower and their dependants). <\/p><p>The Deputy should note that a person admitted to the Abhaile scheme does not need to wait before they are seen by a solicitor for legal advice.<\/p><p><b>Appendix &ndash; Waiting times at Legal Aid Board Law Centres as 31<\/b><b><sup>st<\/sup><\/b><b>January 2019<\/b><table><tr><th><\/th><th>Waiting for 1st Consultation<\/th><th><\/th><th>Waiting for 2nd Consultation<\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Law Centre<\/td><td>Longest person waiting<\/td><td>No. Waiting<\/td><td>Longest person waiting<\/td><td>No. Waiting<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Athlone<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td>44<\/td><td>50<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castlebar<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>48<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>48<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork Popes Quay<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>129<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork South Mall<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>124<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dundalk<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>59<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ennis<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>44<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td>47<\/td><td>130<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway Francis St<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway Seville House<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jervis Street<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>116<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>64<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Letterkenny<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>56<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>70<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Navan<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Nenagh<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>65<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Newbridge<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>44<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portlaoise<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>47<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Smithfield<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>89<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tallaght<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>60<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tralee<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>120<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tullamore<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>57<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900067#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision Data","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900067#WRM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[8138\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900067#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the average stay of residents living in direct provision up to 31 December 2018, in tabular form; the number of persons staying by time range (details supplied); the percentage of the population in direct provision which these figures represent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>The data requested by the Deputy is detailed in the following tabular statement.

The Court has power to impose the proposal on creditors, if satisfied that it is fair and reasonable to all parties, thereby removing the so-called &ldquo;bank veto&rdquo;.<\/p><p>Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, under the Abhaile Scheme, legal aid may be provided to an insolvent borrower to seek a personal insolvency review under s. 115A of the Personal Insolvency Acts, if the proposal refused by their creditors includes resolving the mortgage arrears on their home. Funding may also be provided for appeals by a borrower in s. 115A cases. A number of appeal cases have already been funded to the High Court, and a small number, to the Court of Appeal.<\/p><p>Where legal aid is certified under Abhaile in such cases, there is no charge to the borrower. Abhaile pays fixed fees to the personal insolvency practitioner (PIP), solicitor, junior counsel and where needed, senior counsel, representing the borrower. <\/p><p><b><\/b>The Legal Aid Board has already certified over 1,000 personal insolvency review cases for legal aid under Abhaile, and it is continuing to provide legal aid for personal insolvency reviews on this basis. I should add that in the year ending 30 June 2018, 64% of such cases were decided in favour of the borrower.<\/p><p>The Deputy&rsquo;s questions refer to adjustments in the fees payable to professionals for Abhaile legal aid in such cases, which were notified by the Legal Aid Board at the end of January. I should clarify that there are no changes to the level of service which borrowers are expected to receive, or to the eligibility of borrowers for Abhaile support.<\/p><p>These are reasonable adjustments, which represent proper management of taxpayers&rsquo; money, while ensuring that the borrowers are fully legally protected.<\/p><p>It would be incorrect to suggest that these changes will have any negative effect on access of Abhaile clients to the necessary processes, including court processes, to get them to a solution. Nor will they adversely impact equality of arms between a borrower and their PIP, on the one hand, and an objecting creditor, on the other.<\/p><p>Firstly, as regards representation by counsel: a borrower will continue to be represented in s. 115A cases by a personal insolvency practitioner, a solicitor, and as needed, by junior and senior counsel.<\/p><p>The Board has indicated that barristers will not be approved <i>automatically<\/i>in every case. There is no other area of civil legal aid where that is the case &ndash; and it is obvious that it may not be always be necessary to approve counsel, for example, in a personal insolvency review case which is undefended.<\/p><p>However, the revised terms and conditions set out by the Legal Aid Board expressly indicate that in personal insolvency review cases,  junior and (as needed) senior counsel will continue to be approved &lsquo;where there are legal complexities that require the involvement of counsel&rsquo; and this is expressly explained as including where a creditor raises legal issues that need to be argued by a barrister in court. Counsel may also be approved on a case by case basis if there are exceptional circumstances, at the Board&rsquo;s discretion.<\/p><p>Many personal insolvency review cases raise complex questions of law. I and my Department are fully aware of the nature of the cases brought and decided over the past three years. Indeed, in January this year, on the launch of the Abhaile second year Report, I specifically underlined the priority that I attach to the good work being done under Abhaile, and to ensuring that the personal insolvency review can function effectively.<\/p><p>More broadly, I would point out that under the changes announced by the Legal Aid Board the normal fees for a PIP or a solicitor for a defended personal insolvency court review are unchanged.<\/p><p>However, two reasonable changes are being introduced to the fees payable for all professionals. Firstly, the full fee will not be payable in undefended cases,<i><\/i>where no creditor opposes the court review. Secondly, personal insolvency cases often involve parallel applications by both partners, where a couple has the same home mortgage. In practice, the vast majority of parallel applications are treated by the courts as one single case. There is no reason for taxpayers to cover two full fees in such cases, and they will be payable at a full fee for one spouse and a reduced (10%) fee for the second spouse, representing the actual extra work involved. <\/p><p>These are manifestly reasonable changes.<\/p><p>Finally, barristers&rsquo; fixed fees are being reduced, but only to bring them into line with fees payable in other areas of civil legal aid where complex legal or procedural issues also arise.<\/p><p>My Department and the Legal Aid Board will continue to keep this area under close review, to ensure that Abhaile borrowers continue to have the necessary level of representation before the courts in personal insolvency review cases. This reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting borrowers who are trying to resolve their home mortgage arrears in a manner which is fair and reasonable to all concerned, and to keeping people in their homes where at all possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900067#WRM03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":693,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900067#WRM04200"},{"type":"question","counter":694,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[8427\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900067#WRM04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to cost overruns on contracts within his Department with a value in excess of &euro;10 million that came in more than 10% over budget in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019; if so, the details of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":695,"content":"<p>Capital projects in the Justice Sector are undertaken, in the main, by bodies under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality rather than by the Department itself, or are managed by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the Department and its Agencies.  <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that there were no capital projects completed by my Department (that is, under Vote 24) in the period in question with a value in excess of &euro;10 million.

This review also resulted in closures at plants in other international locations. <\/p>  <p>  Since that announcement was made, the IDA has worked to identify a new buyer for the facility.  This has included actively promoting the site to existing clients and potential investors.  However, I understand that, despite extensive efforts, no offer has been made for the site to date. <\/p>  <p>  While I remain very disappointed by the closure of this facility, I welcome the continuing overseas investment in Clare, where there are 66 IDA client companies employing a total of 6,948 people.  The IDA, in promoting Clare as an investment destination, markets the county as part of the Mid-West region along with Limerick and North Tipperary.  The overall trend for employment in multinationals across that region is positive.  The total employment in overseas companies in the Mid-West now stands at almost 19,000 people across 125 client companies.<\/p>  <p>  Recent investment announcements by overseas companies reflect the potential of Clare and the surrounding area to attract high-quality FDI.  The decision by Jaguar Land Rover to establish a new software engineering facility in Shannon, for example, shows that the region can attract high-tech investment and the employment opportunities associated with such projects.  Beckman Coulter&rsquo;s announcement that they are to expand their current facility with the addition of 70 new roles is further evidence of the area&rsquo;s attractiveness to investors.  Edwards Lifesciences have also established a new facility in Shannon which was officially opened last summer. <\/p>  <p>  Of course, indigenous enterprise also has a critical role to play in the region.  That is reflected in the Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative (RAPJ), which is a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create 135,000 new jobs outside of Dublin by 2020.  A key objective of each of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region within one percentage point of the national average.  Since the launch of the RAPJ in 2015, there are now 18,800 more people in employment in the Mid-West and the unemployment rate is now at 7.2%.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that we will continue to build on this strong employment base &ndash; both FDI and indigenous driven &ndash; in the region and in Clare in the coming months and years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900067#WRM05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Budgets","counter":705,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900067#WRM05400"},{"type":"question","counter":706,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[7916\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900067#WRM05500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the parts of her  budget she plans to cut for the savings required to fund the overrun in the national children&rsquo;s hospital; the amount her Department will contribute in 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":707,"content":"<p>I wish to confirm to the Deputy that the re-scheduling of capital monies to accommodate the additional costs associated with the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital this year will not impact on my department&rsquo;s Budget.

My Department&rsquo;s vision is to make Ireland the best place to succeed in business, delivering sustainable full employment and higher standards of living across all regions of the country.  It incorporates climate action into policymaking, and through our supporting agencies by funding research related to climate change and assisting enterprises to reduce emissions and achieve greater energy efficiency.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025 Renewed, the Government&rsquo;s national enterprise strategy, recognises the effects of climate change and the imperative for sustainable development.  The development of the green economy presents commercial opportunities to companies across many sectors in Ireland, in addition to the desired environmental benefits.  Enterprise 2025 Renewed recognises that enterprises and enterprise policy have key roles to play to support, develop and adopt innovative technologies, products and services that increase efficiencies, reduce waste and deliver sustainable development.  The ambitions set out in Enterprise 2025 Renewed are given effect through supporting strategies such as Innovation 2020 as well as through the National Planning Framework which has a strong focus on the development of sustainable enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  The bioeconomy and circular economy are seen as both a means to support the modernisation and strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s industrial base based on the creation of new value chains and greener, more cost-effective industrial processes, and to create a more sustainable economy based on circular production and consumption practices.  The bioeconomy and circular economy present a range of potential opportunities for firms, ranging from micro-enterprises to SMEs to large firms.  These potential opportunities span the economy, from food, forestry and marine, to biomaterials and biochemicals, to bioenergy and biofuels.  State-owned and semi-state companies as well as social enterprises are also engaging with the opportunities presented. <\/p>  <p>  The transition to a low carbon economy is a central component in Future Jobs Ireland, a new cross- Government economic framework to prepare Ireland for the challenges and opportunities ahead in terms of the transition to a digital and low carbon economy. <\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland focuses on five pillars namely:<\/p>  <p>1.   Increasing SME productivity; <\/p>  <p>2.   Embracing innovation and technological change; <\/p>  <p>3.   Enhancing skills and developing and attracting talent;<\/p>  <p>4.   Increasing participation in the labour force; and<\/p>  <p>5.   Transitioning to the low carbon economy.<\/p>  <p>  The development and implementation of Future Jobs Ireland is being led jointly by the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department.  However, Future Jobs Ireland is a whole of Government approach aiming to enhance the productivity performance of our SMEs; ensure quality and sustainable jobs; and build a resilient and innovative economy.  It will ensure our enterprises and workers are well positioned to adapt to the technological and other transformational changes our economy and society will face in the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The work so far has included extensive consultation, the highlight of which was the National Summit on 22nd November last which saw over 200 participants engage with me and a number of my Ministerial colleagues, including the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Mr Richard Bruton, T.D., to help shape the Future Jobs Ireland agenda. <\/p>  <p>  We know the move to a low-carbon economy will radically change important sectors of the economy, but it will also present new opportunities to those firms on the cutting edge of this transition.  I recognise that we need to support our enterprises and workers in navigating the transition to a digital and low carbon economy.  Through Future Jobs Ireland, we envisage the creation of a Transition Teams model to help prepare enterprises in declining sectors and workers in vulnerable job roles to take steps to secure their future.  <\/p>  <p>  At the same time, in order to exploit the economic and job creation opportunities presented by the transition, Future Jobs Ireland will ensure we have the right skills and the right regulatory, funding and policy environment in place to do so.  Future Jobs Ireland also aims to maximise the potential of the circular and bioeconomy to promote rural economic development and growth and to drive sustainable economic development as we transition to a low carbon economy.<\/p>  <p>  Government is expected to consider Future Jobs Ireland 2019 later this month with a view to launching the report at the end of February.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is working closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in its preparation of the new All of Government Climate Plan.  It will be aligned with Future Jobs Ireland 2019 and my Department&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Plans.  Of particular relevance to economic green growth is the use of networks of businesses to deploy initiatives that reduce carbon emissions.  Job opportunities arise in the manufacture of environmental goods, and provision of environmental services (e.g. renewable energy, efficient energy use and management) and includes employment across a wide range of other sectors including ICT, food, tourism, construction and financial services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900067#WRM06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":714,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900067#WRM06300"},{"type":"question","counter":715,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[8256\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900067#WRM06400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if Ireland or the EU has a free trade agreement with the Philippines; if no trade agreement exists, the applicable duty for exports from the EU to the Philippines; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":716,"content":"<p>International Trade Policy is a competence of the EU Commission under the EU Treaties and defined as the Common Commercial Policy.

The commitments in the plan are aimed at improving access for patients waiting for hospital operations or procedures, as well as patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment.<\/p><p>A key element of this Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List which\u00a0remains a significant challenge. The HSE, in line with the National Service Plan 2019 will provide 3.3 million outpatient appointments, more than 1 million of which will be first outpatient appointments. <\/p><p>In addition, the NTPF will, as part of their\u00a0increased allocation in 2019, fund additional first outpatient appointments through weekend and out of hour&rsquo;s clinics and &lsquo;see and treat&rsquo; clinics. \u00a0The NTPF will deliver\u00a0this additional activity\u00a0by working with hospital groups and individual hospitals as well as private health providers to maximise the number of patients treated

These guidelines are available on the Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  -  The HSE has been requested to establish and maintain a Register to facilitate the programme and work is continuing in relation to the sourcing of appropriate quality-controlled, affordable cannabis-based products for Irish patients.<\/p>  <p>  -  Drafting of secondary legislation to underpin the access programme continues and will be finalised once appropriate cannabis product supplies have been established. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme aims to facilitate access to certain cannabis products which have not been authorised as medicines by a statutory Medicines Competent Authority. As such, they are not subject to the same rigorous safety, quality and efficacy standards that are in place for medicines, nor are the producers subject to the same responsibilities as the marketing authorisation holders for authorised medicines. Whilst efficacy and safety data are not available for these products, it is crucially important to be assured, as far as possible, of the quality of these products.<\/p>  <p>  Availability of cannabis products that are of an appropriate quality standard and are affordable to patients is clearly critical in establishing the access programme. To the Department&rsquo;s knowledge only two countries, Canada and the Netherlands, currently permit export of such cannabis products, which meet acceptable quality control standards, beyond their borders. The Netherlands permits exports of cannabis dried herb, but does not permit commercial export of their oil-based cannabis formulations.<\/p>  <p>  Department officials are working intensively on finding solutions to the supply of appropriate products for Irish patients, in parallel to their ongoing work on other significant projects. As a result of extensive recent discussions with Danish and UK counterparts, Department of Health officials are now in contact with a number of potential suppliers of medical cannabis. These discussions may take some time to become productive. <\/p>  <p>  Pending full operation of the Access Programme, doctors continue to utilise the Ministerial licencing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients.\u00a0 Twenty-nine licences have now been granted in respect of sixteen individual patients.

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland, following issues which had emerged in relation to the CervicalCheck screening programme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening.\u00a0This increased level of engagement with the programme is very welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put pressure on lab capacity and turnaround times.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results; however, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff.\u00a0 The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan, which will take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme\u00a0into stabilisation this year.\u00a0This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE advises that the CervicalCheck Programme has recently agreed with laboratories to prioritise those slides which originate from women who attended colposcopy, as this cohort of women are considered to have the most serious need.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE also advises that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years. Due to this very fact, it is important that any woman of screening age attends for cervical screening each and every time she is invited to participate. The HSE has advised that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, is not necessarily dangerous and poses a very low risk to women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900070#WRP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":863,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900070#WRP02000"},{"type":"question","counter":864,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[7864\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900070#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the relevant stakeholders regarding a drug (details supplied) will be informed regarding the recent HSE leadership team meeting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":865,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[8199\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900070#WRP02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a decision will be made in respect of the application submitted in July 2018 by a company (details supplied) for the Translarna drug for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":866,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[8200\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900070#WRP02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the drugs committee will assess the new submission made by a company (details supplied) for the Translarna drug for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":867,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 359, 411 and 412 together.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. <\/p><p>The Act specifies the criteria to be applied in the making of reimbursement decisions which include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE.<\/p><p>I am advised by the HSE that the application for Translarna (Ataluren) was discussed at the January HSE Leadership Team meeting and that the\u00a0HSE is in the process of communicating its decision to the relevant company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900070#WRP02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":868,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900070#WRP02500"},{"type":"question","counter":869,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[7869\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900070#WRP02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the HSE disability services will provide a placement for a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":870,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.<\/p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care.

In this instance I take it that the Deputy is referring to a delay in the receipt of results following a smear test and will respond on that basis.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2018, I asked CervicalCheck to make the necessary arrangements to provide that any woman who had had a CervicalCheck smear test, and whose GP considered that she should have a further test as part of her reassurance, to access such a further test without charge. This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland, following issues which had emerged in relation to the CervicalCheck screening programme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening.\u00a0This increased level of engagement with the programme is very welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put pressure on lab capacity and turnaround times.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results; however, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff.\u00a0The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan, which will take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme\u00a0into stabilisation this year.\u00a0This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE advises that the CervicalCheck Programme has recently agreed with laboratories to prioritise those slides which originate from women who attended colposcopy, as this cohort of women are considered to have the most serious need.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE also advises that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years. Due to this very fact, it is important that any woman of screening age attends for cervical screening each and every time she is invited to participate. The HSE has advised that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, is not necessarily dangerous and poses a very low risk to women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900074#WRT03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rare Diseases Strategy","counter":1118,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900074#WRT03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1119,"qnumday":451,"qnumall":"[8449\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900074#WRT03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a grant for treatment that has been approved by the Rare Disease Technical Review Committee can be denied.","asker":"1336","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1120,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, relating to the work of the Rare Diseases Medicinal Products\/Technology Review Committee, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900074#WRT03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Administration","counter":1121,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900074#WRT03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1122,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[8491\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900074#WRT03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an appointment will be scheduled for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1123,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

To this effect, I recently launched the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot, a targeted support of &euro;20 million for suckler farmers specifically aimed at further improving the economic and environmental efficiency of beef production.  As well as clear environmental and climate benefits, the BEEP will provide farm gate investment at a time of market volatility and uncertainty relating to Brexit.  The pilot has been designed to be as straightforward as possible. Applications will be accepted up until this Friday 22 February, and I would urge all eligible farmers to apply.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd. Also, it should be noted an additional &euro;23 million was secured for the ANC scheme in 2019, which, effectively restored the Budget to pre-downturn levels.<\/p>  <p>  While, I am aware of the current challenges facing beef farmers, I cannot intervene directly in any commodity price.  Cattle prices are a matter for the processing industry and the farmers who supply it. Cattle prices are influenced by a variety of factors such as the level of consumer demand, production levels and exchange rate differences. The UK's decision to leave the EU also presents enormous challenges for the entire beef sector.<\/p>  <p>  I am, however, very conscious that the beef sector is currently facing a difficult period.  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector. I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector. According to National Farm Survey data, suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.<\/p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agri-food sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  It is crucial that we all continue to work together.

I would point out that in discussing the funding for the CAP post-2020, we should bear in mind that these discussions are taking place as part of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) post 2020 negotiations, agreement on which is ultimately a matter for Finance Ministers and EU Heads of State and Government.<\/p>  <p>  I am focused on the overall level of the CAP budget post 2020.  The MFF post 2020 proposals outline a 3.9% cut to Pillar 1 Direct Payments funding, and a 15% cut to Pillar 2 Rural Development funding.  This is unacceptable in my view.  The retention of an adequate budget for the CAP post 2020 is a key priority for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  There is a possibility for Member States to contribute more to the overall EU budget, to mitigate against the cuts proposed in the MFF post 2020 proposals.  The Taoiseach has previously indicated that Ireland would contribute more to the EU budget but only if that funding contributes towards the European ideal.  The CAP is one such policy.  It contributes to job growth and enhancement of the position of the European rural population, delivers on public goods and, post 2020, it will contribute even more towards helping the EU meet its climate and environmental objectives.  However, this cannot be achieved without an appropriate budget in place.<\/p>  <p>  I have been advocating strongly amongst my agriculture counterparts to maintain a strong CAP budget. Along with counterparts from France, Spain, Finland, Portugal and Greece, we have called for the restoration of the CAP budget for the 2021 &ndash; 2027 period to current levels.  Up to 20 Member States have joined this alliance and we will continue to work together in an effort to build consensus on this point.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that to achieve the best outcome, we need to seek common ground with like minded Member States.

These proposals are complex and we are now in the middle of intensive and challenging negotiations for the next CAP 2021-27.   However, the proposals are just that and we still have some way to go before agreement on these proposals will be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  I have always sought to have a broad consultation on these proposals.  In February 2018, I launched my Department's public consultation process which included six meetings with stakeholders across the country.  The objective of the consultation was to allow members of the public outline their views on the issue, having regard to the challenges facing the sector.  In total, 164 written submissions were received, which included responses from farming organisations such as the IFA, INHFA, ICMSA, ICOS, ICMSA among others. The submissions provided a vital insight into farming and societal views.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the public consultation, I hosted a Conference in July 2018 on the new CAP legislative proposals for interested stakeholders, including farm bodies, state agencies and the environmental pillar. This was a timely opportunity to bring all interested stakeholders together for a constructive discussion on the future CAP. The range of speakers came from the political sphere, from the European Commission, and from my Department.  The conference was a very useful opportunity to hear the views of the many stakeholders involved.  The outcome from the consultation process and the stakeholder conference is feeding into the Department&rsquo;s on-going analysis and policy response to the proposals.  Since then there have been ongoing informal consultations with stakeholders, including farm bodies, state agencies and the environmental pillar. <\/p>  <p>  The CAP post 2020 proposals set out a new delivery model which requires Member States to submit a CAP Strategic Plan, covering Pillar I and Pillar II expenditure, to the Commission for approval.

The Harbour was last dredged in the early 1980s.  A number of investigative and preparatory works and initiatives have been undertaken over the last few years in respect of a potential dredging project in Howth FHC. A final site investigation report was received in October 2016 and has been assessed by the Department's Engineers. This report included vital information on the nature and amount of the material to be dredged.<\/p>  <p>  The Department also appointed a Consulting Engineer in 2016 to advise on a number of possible developments in Howth, including a dredging project. A final report was issued from the Consulting Engineers in late October 2017 which confirmed that the concentrations of contaminants in the sediment to be dredged are such that while the material cannot be considered inert, it can be classified as non hazardous. This means that dumping at sea will not be permitted, which in turn has a significant effect on the project cost. <\/p>  <p>  Department Engineers subsequently met with Fingal County Council, to review possible operational and permitting requirements. Engagement with the Council is ongoing in regard to exploring disposal options for the dredged material. It would be the Department's view that the material should be treated and re-used to reclaim much needed additional ground for Harbour use.<\/p>  <p>  This project will require Planning Permission, an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) and a Waste License.

Juvenile salmon from each river migrate to sea as juveniles and return to their natal river to spawn and create the next generation of fish unique to that river. The origin of all wild Atlantic salmon is the river in which they were born. <\/p>  <p>  Management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI). IFI is supported in its management role by scientific advice from Ireland&rsquo;s independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC), comprising scientists from a range of organisations. IFI also has to have regard EU legislation, particularly the Habitats Directive under which salmon habitats are protected. <\/p>  <p>  Scientific and management assessments of each of the distinct stocks are carried out every year with IFI engaged in extensive stock monitoring which feeds into the Scientific Group's annual reviews. An average of the 5 years data is used to estimate expected returns for the coming year to ensure that a good or bad year does not have a disproportionate impact on the assessment in any single year.<\/p>  <p>  I will provide a copy of the most recent Wild Salmon and Seatrout Statistics report compiled by IFI which includes commercial and angling catch statistics from 2001 to 2017. This statistics are indicative of wild salmon abundance in this period. <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated by IFI that 200,000 Atlantic salmon returned to Irish shores last year. Populations are widely distributed throughout Irish fresh waters. This level of return as part of natural migration represents a comparatively healthy condition for Irish stocks relative to international levels. However, returns to Irish and other shores has decreased significantly in recent decades. It is considered that if Ireland had not adopted its management measures, including ending indiscriminate mixed stock fishing at sea, since 2007 the decline would be considerably more pronounced.<\/p>  <p>  The management of wild Atlantic salmon is a shared international issue manifesting in rivers in all countries around the North Atlantic. Scientific analysis from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) estimates that marine survival of migrating salmon has been at or below 5% in the North Atlantic for more than a decade. <\/p>  <p>  The protection and conservation of salmon internationally is managed through the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) with which Ireland is aligned through the European Union. Concerted international co-operation has ensured that restrictions in distant waters, to where salmon migrate, are in place via NASCO agreement. The majority stock component of salmon migrating from European, including Irish, waters migrates to Faroese waters. In 2018, my officials and those of IFI joined delegates from the EU, USA, Canada, Norway, the Russian Federation, Greenland and the Faroes in negotiating a multi-annual ban on all commercial salmon fishing in Faroese waters so that stocks migrating there are protected. These international discussions were chaired by Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the issue of salmon hatcheries, there are significant genetic and ecological concerns when salmon reared in a hatchery environment are released into the wild and national policy in Ireland follows the guidelines prepared by NASCO with regard to applying the precautionary approach to any proposed stocking of hatchery reared Atlantic salmon into the wild.<\/p>  <p>  There are many possible causes for decline of Atlantic salmon populations including climate change and sea-lice infestation from Aquaculture which impact marine survival. Stocking is not considered an appropriate solution. IFI&rsquo;s advice for enhancement of salmon stocks nationally is to continue with single stock salmon management to achieve individual river spawning targets while also supporting habitat enhancement and removal of artificial barriers to migration rather than artificial stock enhancements which have potentially detrimental genetic impacts. <\/p>  <p>  2019 commences the International Year of the Salmon which aims to bring people together to share knowledge, raise awareness and take action on how we can ensure the resilience of salmon in Ireland and in the Northern Hemisphere. I am leading Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this international initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900076#WRV03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Disposal Charges","counter":1252,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900076#WRV04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1253,"qnumday":498,"qnumall":"[7692\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900076#WRV04100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the steps being taken to accelerate the process of developing a mechanism to provide a support for vulnerable persons with a condition such as lifelong or long-term medical incontinence to help meet the average annual cost of disposing of their domestic waste; the way in which the introduction of GDPR has hampered the implementation of the measure; if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties this has posed for persons supporting those with conditions that require a high volume of domestic waste; the reason a pay-by-weight system was rolled out prior to the provision of a domestic waste allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1235","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1254,"qnumday":526,"qnumall":"[8174\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900076#WRV04200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 504 of 6 February 2018, the status of the issue relating to the annual support of &euro;75 for persons with lifelong or long-term medical incontinence; when the scheme will be introduced to assist persons meet the average annual cost of disposal of medical incontinence products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1255,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 498 and 526 together. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the commitments set out in A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland, published in 2012, and in the interest of encouraging further waste prevention and greater recycling, the Government took the decision in June 2017 to phase out flat-rate fees for kerbside household waste collection.

In Ireland, gas powered generation also provides an important back-up for intermittent renewable wind generation. <\/p>  <p>  So while gas usage will reduce significantly in the years ahead, Ireland will still need secure sources of gas. At present this is provided by both gas piped on shore from Irish gas fields and imports through gas pipelines from the UK. <\/p>  <p>  The development of an LNG facility could further enhance Ireland&rsquo;s gas security of supply by increasing import route diversity and would be compatible with the State&rsquo;s commitments to tackle climate change. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy is fully aligned with the EU&rsquo;s climate and energy objectives on the transition to decarbonisation, which includes continuous and ongoing review of policies to reduce harmful emissions, improve energy efficiency, incentivise efficient and sustainable infrastructure investment, integrate markets, and promote research and innovation while ensuring our energy security of supply is maintained and enhanced.<\/p>  <p>  The project to which the Deputy refers is a private commercial project. Final investment decisions for the project and compliance with any legal and regulatory requirements in relation to consents or permits are the responsibility of the project promoter. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that in August 2018 Shannon LNG announced it had entered into an agreement with New Fortress Energy to develop the proposed LNG terminal project at Ballylongford. I understand that my Department was notified on 23 August that a press release on this would be issued on the next day. On 21 November 2018, at the request of Shannon LNG, officials from my Department met with representatives of Shannon LNG and New Fortress Energy. The purpose of this meeting was to introduce New Fortress Energy.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the production, sourcing, buying and selling of natural gas produced outside this jurisdiction, this is an operational matter for the undertakings involved. Any undertaking would be required to comply with EU law in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900077#WRW00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1288,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 512 and 513 answered with Question No. 500.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":1289,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900077#WRW01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1290,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[7792\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900077#WRW01300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the projects which have been delayed as a result of cost overruns at the national children&rsquo;s hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1291,"content":"<p>My Department will reprofile &euro;4 million, representing less than 1.5% of its overall capital allocation for 2019, to support the additional costs arising this year on the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital project.

Juvenile salmon from each river migrate to sea as juveniles and return to their natal river to spawn and create the next generation of fish unique to that river. <\/p><p>Management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI). IFI is supported in its management role by scientific advice from Ireland&rsquo;s independent Technical Expert Group on Salmon (TEGOS), comprising scientists from a range of organisations. IFI also has to have regard to EU legislation, particularly the Habitats Directive under which salmon habitats are protected. In that regard, given the established scientific advice, the issue of further review does not arise. <\/p><p>Scientific and management assessments of each of the distinct stocks, including the Suir, Nore and Barrow, are carried out every year with IFI engaged in extensive stock monitoring which feeds into the Scientific Group's annual reviews. An average of the 5 years data is used to estimate expected returns for the coming year to ensure that a good or bad year does not have a disproportionate impact on the assessment in any single year.<\/p><p>It is not possible to definitively predict the projected opening dates for any individual river. Responsible management demands that rivers are only open to harvest, by either angling or commercial means, once a sustainable harvestable surplus, sufficiently in excess of the individual conservation limit for each river, is identified. The annual assessment process is based on up to date information to determine the status of each river and to inform fisheries management The conservation limit is the number of adult spawning fish required to sustain a healthy population in the river. <\/p><p>The following table set out the percentage Conservation Limit achieved on the Rivers Barrow, Suir and Nore 2013 to 2019;<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>River Barrow<br \/><br \/>(CL - 11,738)<\/th><th>River Suir <br \/><br \/>(CL - 14,055)<\/th><th>River Nore (CL 10,420)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>year<\/td><td>% Conservation Limit (CL) achieved <\/td><td>% Conservation Limit (CL) achieved<\/td><td>% Conservation Limit (CL) achieved<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2019<\/td><td>16%<\/td><td>102%<\/td><td>80%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>17%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>77%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>18%<\/td><td>79%<\/td><td>70%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>18%<\/td><td>68%<\/td><td>60%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>17%<\/td><td>80%<\/td><td>91%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>29%<\/td><td>83%<\/td><td>121%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>29%<\/td><td>117%<\/td><td>153%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The issue of heritage activity is a matter for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Conscientious management of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon rivers must primarily concentrate on the availability of a sustainable resource and all activity which involves the taking of fish is permitted and delimited based on this conservation imperative. <\/p><p>Licensing of commercial fishing, including snap net fishing, is based on the most recent track record of the participants\/applicants. Consideration of such track records can obviously only reference the years in which the rivers were open to harvest and the closure of a river does not impact the issuing of licences in this manner. <\/p><p>I will provide a copy of the most recent Wild Salmon and Seatrout Statistics report compiled by IFI which includes commercial and angling catch statistics from 2001 to 2017. These statistics are indicative of wild salmon abundance and stock trends for all rivers in this period. I have also asked IFI to prepare a detailed briefing note on the rivers Suir, Nore and Barrow which I will forward to the Deputy shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900078#WRX01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":1341,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900078#WRX01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1342,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[8418\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900078#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if his attention has been drawn to cost overruns on contracts within his Department with a value in excess of &euro;10 million that came in more than 10% over budget in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019; if so, the details of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1343,"content":"<p>My Department actively manages budgets and expenditure across its six Programme areas to deliver on its business priorities and objectives.

These developments include the extension of  the universal pre-school programme which now provides two years of free pre-school education to all children, schemes that subsidise the cost of early learning and care to parents and extra supports to ensure children with additional needs,  including children with a disability, homeless children, programme refugee children and children in low income households, can access early learning and care.

","asker":"1312","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1481,"content":"<p>My Department has recently led the development of First 5, a Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families.  First 5 identifies a range of measures to support families given their fundamental importance in shaping children&rsquo;s experiences and outcomes.  The vision for babies and young children articulated in First 5 is of a healthy childhood starting in pregnancy; time together with parents especially in the first year in a nurturing and playful home environment where material needs are met; high quality play-based Early Learning and Care experiences; positive transitions to primary school; and supportive community contexts. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting parents in caring for young children at home in a range of ways.<\/p>  <p>  Within the remit of my Department, the policy priorities are to provide access to Early Learning and Care supports to parents of young children, whether they work full time, part time, or look after their children at home full-time. These policies seek to support children&rsquo;s early development and to support their families.<\/p>  <p>  An example of supports for Early Learning and Care provided by my Department is that, from September of this year, all children are eligible to avail of two years of universal pre-school, without cost, through the Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE) prior to beginning primary school.  Some 107,000 children are already benefitting, many of whom are children of stay-at-home parents.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore the current targeted Early Learning and Care subsidy schemes are available to families where parents are in receipt of certain social welfare payments, medical cards, or GP Visit cards, again many of whom are stay-at-home parents.<\/p>  <p>  A universal subsidy is available to all parents of children under the age of three, or whenever the child becomes eligible for the universal preschool programme (ECCE), regardless of whether parents are working or not. The Affordable Childcare Scheme, ACS, which will be launched later this year will make Early Learning and Care subsidies available on the basis of family income and will be available to stay-at-home parents. This is underpinned by the Childcare Support Act 2018.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for local parent and toddler groups to organise activities for parents and young children in the community to support their development through play. Both working parents and stay-at-home parents participate.  449 groups were supported in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In the coming years my Department will also be leading on developing a new model of parenting services from universal to targeted provision, covering key stages of child development and taking account of parents and children in a range of contexts and parenting relationships. <\/p>  <p>  More widely across Government, there are various initiatives that support stay-at-home parents. A child benefit payment of &euro;140 per child per month is available for all children. Budget 2019 announced an increase to the home carer tax credit to &euro;1,500 per year.<\/p>  <p>  There have also been a number of new measures to support parents to spend time at home with children in their early years. Two weeks of paternity leave and benefit for fathers was introduced in 2016. In 2017, there was an extension to maternity leave and benefit to mothers of babies born prematurely.  Budget 2019 also announced the introduction of a new parental leave scheme which will be available to both fathers and mothers. First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families sets out Government's commitment that by 2021, parents will each have an individual entitlement to seven weeks of paid parental leave, to potentially allow children to benefit from an additional 14 weeks parental care in their first year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900080#WRZ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residential Institutions Redress Scheme","counter":1482,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900080#WRZ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1483,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[7951\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900080#WRZ03800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to address the issue of redress for the small number of survivors from the Bethany homes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1484,"content":"<p>When the Ryan Report was published in 2009 there were a number of calls for the Residential Institutions Redress Act to be extended to include additional institutions, including the Bethany Home. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills is responsible for the Redress Act legislation and related arrangements and that the scheme has been closed to new applications since 2011.

Everyone has a role to play in preparing young people to reach their developmental milestones. Thus the provision of aftercare services should not be regarded as an event, but as a continuum of service building on the skills and capacity young people have developed during their time in care.<\/p>  <p>  A comprehensive aftercare service relies on the full participation and informed consent of young people in the development and implementation of their aftercare plan. It also relies on cooperation and partnership with other key stakeholders, including the Health Services Executive, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Education, SUSI, voluntary groups, and community groups.<\/p>  <p>  Legislative provision for aftercare has been strengthened by the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015, which imposed a statutory duty on Tusla to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person, following an assessment of need. The Act created an explicit statement of Tusla&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports. An eligible child for the purpose of this statutory entitlement is any child who has spent 12 months in the care of the State in the 5 years between the ages of 13 and 18 years old, while an eligible adult is any young person aged 18, 19 or 20 who has spent at least 12 months in the care of the State between the ages of 13 and 18 years. Note that this eligibility is not contingent on the child or young person being in care on their 18th   birthday. Specific legislative provision is in place for aftercare to continue until a young person is 23 years of age where they are finishing a course of education. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the new legislative provision, Tusla has developed a suite of policies and guidance documents for aftercare support, which includes guidance on direct financial support. <\/p>  <p>  The most prominent form of such support is the aftercare allowance, which is provided to cover a young person&rsquo;s day to day costs as they progress in education or accredited training. Under current Tusla guidance, an eligible adult will qualify for an aftercare allowance where they have turned 18 in the care of Tusla, having spent the previous 12 months in care, are attending an accredited education course, third level course or training programme as outlined in their aftercare plan, and agree to engage with Tusla aftercare and provide updates on their progress. <\/p>  <p>  For those young adults who are not in education \/ training at 18 years, aftercare services support them in accessing any relevant financial allowances and support to which they may be entitled from the Department of Social Protection or other agencies. The amount of financial support an adult will receive at 18 years and the relevant agency or Department will be specific to each adult&rsquo;s circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  While this policy provides the basis for the standardised aftercare allowance, Tusla recognises that some particularly vulnerable adults (which can include young people with mental health issues, addiction issues etc.) will need tailored support as part of their aftercare plan and this may include tailored financial support. Current policy provides for decisions in such instances to be made by principal social workers and area managers on a case by case basis. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the financial guidance in relation to financial support to young adults in aftercare is currently under review following 12 months&rsquo; implementation and a consultation process with key stakeholders is currently underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900080#WRZ05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":1497,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900080#WRZ05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1498,"qnumday":591,"qnumall":"[8417\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900080#WRZ05300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her attention has been drawn to cost overruns on contracts within her Department with a value in excess of &euro;10 million that came in more than 10% over budget in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019; if so, the details of same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1499,"content":"<p>I can confirm that my attention has not been drawn to any cost overruns on contracts engaged within my Department that meet the criteria set out by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900080#WRZ05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":1501,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900080#WRZ05600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Facilities","counter":1500,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900080#WRZ05500"},{"type":"question","counter":1501,"qnumday":592,"qnumall":"[7669\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900080#WRZ05600","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the funding schemes available to national schools for the improvement of playgrounds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":1502,"content":"<p>Primary responsibility for the development of school facilities rests with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  From my own Department's perspective, the CL&Aacute;R programme provides funding for small scale projects in designated rural areas that have experienced significant levels of depopulation.

Although this issue relates to CE supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise just one small group within the wider community and voluntary sector.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to clarify that CE supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector that receive state funding.  They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions, pension contributions or the Pension-related Deduction (PRD) under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI), which only applied to public servants.  Supervisors pay a PRSI Class 'A' contribution towards the state contributory pension. This pension has a maximum personal rate payable of &euro;12,695 per annum increasing to &euro;12,956 in March.<\/p>  <p>  While my Department funds wages and training costs in respect of CE participants and supervisors, it does not - and has not - provided provision for funding for CE supervisor pensions.

The issue was examined by a Community Sector High-Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments including my own Department were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal.<\/p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications of providing such a pension scheme.

A follow-up meeting to deal with technical questions arising from the exercise took place on Friday, 15 December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  This scoping exercise clearly highlighted that the provision of any such pension scheme presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347 million depending on the size of the sector, which is difficult to ascertain.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that this cost excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.<\/p>  <p>  It continues to be the position that state organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and that it is not for the State to provide funding for such pension scheme provision.

That agreement was signed recently and the process required to ratify the agreement is ongoing.  Under the terms of the agreement all existing arrangements with regard to recognition of, and access to, social insurance entitlements will be maintained in both jurisdictions.  This means that the rights of Irish citizens domiciled in Ireland to benefit from social insurance contributions made when working in the UK and to access social insurance payments if resident in the UK are protected.

As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.\u00a0 This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by\u00a0approximately &euro;1 billion every 5 years.\u00a0 In the coming decades, the ratio of workers to pensioners is set to halve, which clearly has significant implications for any state pension system, based as it is on a pay-as-you-go basis.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.\u00a0 This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.\u00a0 Therefore, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.\u00a0 This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.\u00a0 This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.\u00a0 This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.\u00a0 Reversing the 2014 change could be expected to cost a sum in the region of &euro;100 million per annum, depending upon the impact it would have upon retirement patterns.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age, and where this happens, they will have higher incomes, and possibly higher pensions, than if they retired on their 65th birthday.\u00a0 Where this is not possible and\u00a0a person exits the workforce before reaching State pension age they may apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.\u00a0\u00a0Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are currently paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years. <\/p>  <p>  Jobseekers Benefit is payable subject to the person satisfying the general scheme conditions.\u00a0 This entitlement is normally paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.\u00a0 Arrangements are in place to provide that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year can generally continue to be paid benefit up until pensionable age (66 years) provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions.\u00a0 The jobseekers schemes are kept under review and any further changes, including entitlement beyond the 66th year, will be considered in that context.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to\u00a0remember that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.\u00a0 While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.\u00a0 In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900082#WRBB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Benefit Applications","counter":1599,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900082#WRBB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1600,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[8118\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900082#WRBB01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of a carer's benefit application by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1601,"content":"<p>Carer's benefit (CARB) is a payment made to insured people who leave the workforce to care for a child or an adult in need of full-time care and attention.

Planning legislation places no specific restrictions on the height of trees or hedges, nor does it make any particular provision for remedy from any other nuisance which may be caused by trees in an urban residential area.  However, there is currently a civil remedy available through the Courts concerning branches or roots of neighbouring trees encroaching on a person&rsquo;s property.<\/p>  <p>  The possibility of providing a broader civil law remedy for parties affected by high trees and hedges on adjoining properties was raised previously with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made, whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property, such as the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property, could apply to the Courts for an order, and that the Courts could make an order as they see fit, for example, to cut the trees back to an appropriate height. <\/p>  <p>  In response, the Minister for Justice and Equality suggested that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation, which is being increasingly used internationally as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes, rather than through the Courts.  Legislation subsequently introduced by the Minister for Justice and Equality has been enacted as the Mediation Act 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Mediation Act, which came into operation on 1 January 2018, contains provisions to underpin a comprehensive statutory framework to promote the resolution of disputes through mediation as an alternative to court proceedings which should ideally be only used as a last resort.

Other amendments made under the 2018 Act include that where such development has not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced by the planning authority within four years, beginning on the expiration of the appropriate period of the permission (or such period extended under section 42 of the 2000 Act, as amended), the authority shall, where requested by the majority of owners of the houses involved, comply with section 11 of the Roads Act 1993, but the authority shall disregard the financial implications of doing so.<\/p><p>In addition,  the authority may at its absolute discretion, at any time after the expiration of the relevant permission authorising the development or where it considers that enforcement proceedings would be futile, initiate the procedures under section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 where requested by a majority of the owners of the houses in question.<\/p><p>My Department  launched the National Taking-in-Charge Initiative (NTICI) in April 2016 to trial new approaches and working methods in supporting and accelerating overall national and local action on the taking-in-charge process of housing estates, including estates with developer-provided water services infrastructure (DPI).  Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10 million in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the associated call for funding proposals.

My Department provides exchequer support to the local authorities across a number of programmes to support their work to maintain and improve their social housing stock but, in all cases, it is the local authorities that identify priority works.<\/p>  <p>  The funding support from my Department to the local authorities to improve their social housing stock includes significant commitments under regeneration and energy retrofitting.  Under the regeneration programme, local authorities are making significant progress in the advancement of major programmes in areas including Dolphin House and St Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens in Dublin, as well as in Limerick and Cork cities and a number of other areas.  In Dolphin House, where complaints had arisen previously regarding some housing conditions, 2018 saw the full refurbishment of 63 of the existing apartments alongside the construction of 37 newly built social homes for the residents of the area, with over &euro;25 million in investment.  The regeneration programme there will continue into 2019 and beyond.   <\/p>  <p>  The energy retrofitting programme has seen over 68,000 social houses and apartments being retrofitted to date, through some &euro;128m of investment.  The programme aims to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels and address issues around fuel poverty.  These investments to improve the housing stock, with exchequer support, are additional to ongoing work and investment by the local authorities themselves.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that stock condition surveys are now either completed, underway or in planning in a number of local authority areas, including Dublin City.  The extent to which the refurbishment or upgrade to social housing is required, and the plans of local authorities to address this, will depend on the findings of the individual stock conditions surveys as they are completed.  Some stock may require little or no upgrading and responsive maintenance will continue to be provided by all local authorities, as has been the case to date to address housing issues as they arise in the authorities&rsquo; social housing stock.  <\/p>  <p>  The very significant investment currently being made in regeneration projects such as Dolphin House, which was specifically referenced in the complaint regarding social housing conditions in Ireland made to the European Committee of Social Rights, is a key element of the Irish Government&rsquo;s commitment to these issues.  Equally, the continued work of local authorities in undertaking stock condition surveys and both responsive and planned maintenance programmes, as well as important programmes such as the Energy Retrofitting programme, also address the issues of concern raised with the European Committee of Social Rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900084#WRDD06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rental Accommodation Standards","counter":1772,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900085#WREE00400"},{"type":"question","counter":1773,"qnumday":688,"qnumall":"[8390\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900085#WREE00500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his views on whether there is a conflict of interest in cases in which the local authority is both the enforcement agency and the landlord at the same time; and his plans to rectify the matter in the near future.","asker":"1305","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1774,"content":"<p>I understand that\u00a0the Deputy is referring to the matter of standards in respect of\u00a0social housing.<\/p>  <p>  Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017, which also apply in the case of houses let by housing authorities.

Details of the Council's funding of schemes and initiatives for the particular support of music can be found on its websites at the following link <i>.<\/i>These include funding for a number of bursaries including a music bursary award to support professional artists to develop their art practice.  I understand that applicants are only eligible to apply for such funding on reaching 18. <\/p><p>The National Concert Hall (NCH) has a programme for Musicians and Music Students that offers a variety of initiatives to develop young musicians.  These include a range of competitive bursaries including the Young Musician&rsquo;s Award for String Players, which is a fund of &euro;10,000 awarded every second year and which is open to players between the ages of 13 -17; the Bernadette Greevy Bursary for singers, which is a &euro;5,000 award, part-funded by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; and the Jerome Hynes Composition Competition, which is a &euro;2,000 bursary for young composers.<\/p><p>Funding has been also provided to the Veronica Dunne International Singing Competition which is a triennial international classical singing competition held in Dublin.  This is an established Irish musical event of international standing which invites the most talented young singers to compete on this global stage, with a star-studded Jury, international press coverage and exposure to the most influential people in the industry.<\/p><p>The NCH offers a wide range of other initiatives designed to foster the development of young musicians.  These include masterclasses and workshops presented by visiting artists; a development orchestra called SinfoNua; the Female Conductor Programme, a major new project encouraging women into the world of orchestral conducting; and a new summer programme, the International Master Course, for high-level students and emerging professionals.  For younger musicians, the NCH also partners with the Royal Irish Academy of Music on the Primary Ensemble Project, a programme supporting the development of music ensembles in primary schools.<\/p><p>In addition, Creative Ireland's Creative Youth Plan, launched in December 2017, seeks to ensure that every child in Ireland has practical access to tuition, experience and participation in music, drama, art and coding by 2022.  This Plan is being led by my Department, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council, all working in partnership.  The Creative Schools programme is one of the key deliverables of the Creative Youth Plan.  Following an open application process, 150 schools were selected for the pilot in the school year running from 2018 to 2019.  These schools have approximately 38,000 pupils.  Music is the focus of a number of the Creative Plans being developed by these schools in conjunction with their creative associates.<\/p><p>In addition to curricular provision for music at both primary and post-primary levels, the Department of Education and Skills currently supports the Music Generation initiatives, in respect of a wide number of local Music Education Partnerships (MEPs).  I understand that Music Generation is being expanded nationwide over the period to 2022 and that they are currently in phase 2 of their three phase expansion plan. <\/p><p>Under the National Creativity Fund, developed under the Creative Ireland Programme, I recently announced the foundation of the first national youth orchestra for disabled musicians in Ireland - <i>Le Ch&eacute;ile<\/i>.  This is a collaborative, inclusive and exciting step for the country&rsquo;s musical youth; the orchestra will be developed through the Royal Irish Academy of Music&rsquo;s (RIAM). <i>Le Ch&eacute;ile<\/i>will develop musical ensembles for young disabled musicians in every province in Ireland, culminating in the foundation of the Open Youth Orchestra of Ireland(OYOI) &ndash; the very first of its kind in Europe.<\/p><p>Funding to local authorities, under the Creative Ireland Programme in 2018, resulted in over 1200 events taking place across the county, of which over 120 were specially related to music events.  A large number of these were specifically for children and young people. <\/p><p>In addition to the above, the following initiatives by my Department are targeted towards support for music.<\/p><p>- Annual funding is provided by my Department to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann (CC&Eacute;) for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish traditional music and culture. CC&Eacute; provides weekly classes at community level in all traditional instruments, singing, and dance through its network of centres and branches all over the country. <\/p><p>- The National Folk Theatre, Siamsa Tire, which receives annual funding from my Department, brings to life Irish folklore through music, song and dance.<\/p><p>- My Department provides funding for the purchase of equipment under the Music Capital Scheme to performing groups and individual talented musicians on an annual basis. The Scheme is managed by Music Network on behalf of my Department. <\/p><p>- Culture Ireland, provides supports for Irish artists and musicians to travel abroad and develop their careers.  <\/p><p>I would also add that my Department provides funding to many different orchestras. In terms of music and ensuring that it is a vital part of cultural life in Ireland, my department provides funding for the cross border orchestra of Ireland and the peace proms. The Department provides annual funding to the Cross-Border Orchestra Peace Proms in which 20,000 children from 250 schools across the island of Ireland participate. The Proms provide a vital platform for young people to showcase their musical talent.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also note that  last October  I announced, with the Minister of State for Higher Education, Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor TD, joint funding of &euro;9 million for the Royal Irish Academy of Music (RIAM) to assist in the re-development of its historic Westland Row premises. This is capital funding  and is being provided under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 which commits to exchequer investments of &euro;1.2 billion in our cultural heritage and &euro;2.2 billion in Ireland&rsquo;s higher education infrastructure over the coming decade. In this case my Department  is allocating &euro;3m to the project, with the Department of Education and Skills allocating &euro;6m, to give a total exchequer contribution of &euro;9m.<\/p><p>Support for music and musicians will continue to be a key focus of the supports provided by my Department and its agencies, and more broadly by Government in the context of the Creative Ireland programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900085#WREE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Architectural Heritage","counter":1798,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900085#WREE03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1799,"qnumday":698,"qnumall":"[8334\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019021900085#WREE03200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her plans for the restoration of a building (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1800,"content":"<p>My role as Minister with regard to the protection and management of our architectural heritage is set out in the provisions of relevant legislation, as are the role of local authorities and the responsibilities of owners. <\/p><p>The buildings referred to by the Deputy are in local authority ownership.
