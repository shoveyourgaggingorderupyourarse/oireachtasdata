The White Paper on universal health insurance was published on 2 April 2014.  Following its publication, a major costing exercise involving the Department of Health, the ESRI and others was initiated to examine the cost implications of a change to a multi-payer, universal health insurance, UHI, model, as proposed in the White Paper.  Draft results from the initial phase of the costing exercise were presented to me at the end of May.  These draft results are now informing deliberations on next steps, including the necessity for further research and cost modelling.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the UHI costing exercise is a major research project with a number of phases.  The next phases in the costing exercise are likely to include deeper analysis of the key issue of unmet need and a more detailed comparative analysis of the relative costs and benefits of alternative funding models.<\/p><p>This will inform Government discussions on the best long-term approach to achieving universal health care.  It is important that universal access does not result in shared but longer waiting lists for all, but instead results in more health care needs being met in a timely manner.  For this reason additional analysis of unmet need and capacity is important as we implement changes on a phased basis.<\/p> <p> Finally, I have already indicated that it will not be possible to introduce a full universal health insurance system by 2019, as envisaged in the White Paper.  However, I emphasise my commitment to universal health care and to implementing key health reforms, as set out in the programme for Government and the White Paper.  In particular, I have pushed ahead with critical building blocks for universal health care, including the phased extension of universal general practitioner care without fees, improved management of chronic disease in the community, implementation of financial reforms, including activity-based funding, and the establishment of the hospital groups.  We have recently seen significant progress in the extension of GP care without fees to children under six years of age and we are also seeing the phased expansion of free GP care to all those aged 70 years and above from August.  The introduction of universal GP access for the youngest and oldest in our society is an important step on the path to universal health care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900003#A00800","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436430900,"counter":15,"content":"<p>That is an extraordinary reply.

The scheme was designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial and it aims to minimise the stress for all women concerned.  The scheme was designed following meetings with all three support groups, two of which have welcomed its establishment.  It was set up to give women who do not wish to pursue their cases through the courts an alternative option in which payments are made to women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy, whether negligence is proven.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is voluntary and women did not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition of participation in the scheme.

Ms Justice Clark has indicated that she will write to each of these applicants to request that all outstanding documentation and information that the applicant may wish to rely on in the assessment of their application is furnished to the scheme.  The judge will specify a time limit in which information must be furnished and after this time has expired, the applications will proceed to assessment on the basis of the documentation and information furnished.  Given the legal and other costs involved and the frailty of some of the women, the judge wishes to ensure that the scheme does not continue for longer than is necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Ms Justice Clark has commissioned medical experts in the areas of obstetrics and gynaecology, radiology and orthopaedic surgery to assist her in assessing applications where there is an absence of available evidence either that the procedure was undertaken or of its consequences on the health of the woman.

The roll-out of the framework is currently being advanced through the HSE's addiction services and the local and regional drug and alcohol task forces.<\/p>  <p>  An evaluation of the framework, which was piloted in ten sites during 2013, found that both service users and the agencies involved in service provision, expressed a high level of enthusiasm for the framework.

The committee has developed national protocols under the framework to facilitate inter-agency co-operation.

In 2014, the division commenced a process of developing financial information specific to mental health services.  This exercise included the validation and costing of approximately 9,000 staff working in HSE mental health services nationwide, representing about 80% of total spending on mental health services.  This work is continuing.  As there is no single financial ICT system available to the HSE, such validation is labour intensive and difficult to achieve with full accuracy.<\/p><p>This financial analysis has been combined with population figures adjusted for deprivation to inform decisions regarding the allocation of new funding in 2014 and 2015.  In this way, the HSE mental health division is moving towards population-based funding through reassigning discretionary funding in favour of comparatively under-funded services.  The information and methodology will continue to be refined in order to support funding allocations and arrive at a situation where mental health spending <i>per capita<\/i>is more consistent.  It is recognised that such allocation processes have to be phased in to allow time for costs to be adjusted in line with national norms.  <\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that, in response to Parliamentary Question No. 22548\/15, the HSE in its reply of 30 June 2015 gave detailed financial information for mental health, broken down by geographic area for the years 2013-15, inclusive.  I will arrange to have a copy of this information sent to the Deputy.<\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the Government has made significant efforts to prioritise and modernise mental health care nationally.

Even though fewer people may have cancer than have mental health problems, the cost of treating each cancer patient is always going to be very much higher than the cost of treating somebody with common mental illnesses, such as depression.  That is an issue that needs to be borne in mind in setting financial targets.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of actual cash, the mental health budget for 2012 was &euro;711 million; in 2013, it increased to &euro;737 million; in 2014, it was 766 million; and in 2015, it is &euro;792 million.

In budget 2015, additional funding of &euro;25 million was provided to support services that provide alternatives to, and relieve pressures on, acute hospitals.  Of this &euro;25 million, some &euro;10 million was used to provide an additional 300 places under the fair deal scheme.  This reduced the waiting time for approved applicants from 17 weeks to four weeks.  Some &euro;8 million was used to provide access to an additional 115 short-stay beds across the Dublin area, &euro;5 million was used to provide 400 additional home care packages which will benefit 600 people in the course of the year, and &euro;2 million was used to expand the community intervention team services in primary care across Dublin and the surrounding region. <\/p>  <p>  In April 2015, the Government provided a further &euro;74 million to address issues that impact on delayed discharges.

The Minister spoke about the demands in other hospitals in the context of his consideration of the accident and emergency department in Portlaoise hospital.  He must know that the accident and emergency departments in Naas and Tallaght hospitals are totally overcrowded, all the more reason to maintain the 24-hour service in Portlaoise hospital.  We need adequate cover for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900010#H00900","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1436434500,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I am told now that a report will probably not be ready until sometime in September.  That is down to the fact that so much consultation has to take place with everyone who is affected, not only the staff in the hospital but GPs in the area and, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, the impacts that this may have on other hospitals such as those in Naas, Tallaght and Tullamore.  I am told it could be September before a plan of action will be ready.  I have seen the letter from the Laois GPs.  I was pleased to note they called for the HIQA report to be implemented but of course reports have to be implemented in full, not only the parts of them that one likes while leaving out the parts that one does not like.<\/p>  <p>  Part of the under-six contract was that we made it a stipulation that anyone getting such a contract would have to be a member of a specialist register for general practitioners because we do not think it is acceptable that somebody who is not on the specialist register should work as a GP and treat children for their ailments.  Yet we do see it as acceptable in Ireland that we can staff emergency departments with people who are not on the specialist register for emergency medicine.  It is an issue up and down the country that we allow so many of our centres not to be staffed with specialists.  The reality is that there may not be sufficient specialists available to staff them all with specialists.  Therefore, are we willing to accept an inferior level of care?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900010#H01000","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1436434500,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I understand and appreciate the issues and we all acknowledge the HIQA report.  I believe the Minister accepts that people locally welcome the improvements in the maternity services that have flown from the HIQA report.  Essentially, we want the same level of determination to be shown to make the accident and emergency service safe.  If the HSE and HIQA cannot stand over it being safe, the issue is to make it safe; the issue is not to close it, or close it for half of the day or half of the 24 hour period.  The Minister will be aware that between 25% and one third of admissions to the accident and emergency department are paediatric cases as a result of the large paediatric unit, and the maternity services, in the hospital.  To ensure that the hospital works fully, it is essential that it has permanent consultant cover.  I do not believe there is a permanent consultant covering the accident and emergency department in Portlaoise and that is a central issue that must be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900010#H01100","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1436434500,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I had tabled a similar question.  The key issue is consultant cover.  Having met the Minister and discussed that issue with him, and I thank him for the meeting with the public representatives from the County Laois area, he will be aware of that.  Portlaoise hospital has only 24 hours per week temporary, part-time consultant cover.  That is not satisfactory, and the GPs have gone to great lengths to explain that.  In terms of throughput over the years, Portlaoise hospital had 38,000 attendances through its emergency department while Tullamore hospital had, on average, about two thirds of that figure.  The general practitioners have outlined clearly the interdependency of the other important parts of the hospital, including the maternity and paediatric services, on the emergency department.  Its paediatric unit is very busy and is one of the top eight in the country.  I ask the Minister to take that into consideration in his deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900010#H01200","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1436434500,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

We have very large emergency departments in this country with four and five emergency department consultants who are not in the departments after 6 o'clock or 8 o'clock at night.  They are on-call from home or, in some cases, they will not cover weekends.  Even with four or five consultants, either because of unwillingness or too onerous a rota, we do not have 24-7 consultant cover.  I am not sure we have that in any emergency department in Ireland; they are probably on-call from home.<\/p>  <p>  We have only a limited number of specialists, and we have to consider the level of patient safety risks we are willing to accept.  If it is not possible to recruit people to cover a special service 24-7, or if there are not enough patients for them to keep up their skills in which case they cease to become specialists, we have to decide if we are unwilling to accept an inferior and non-specialist service just because it is local, and that is not particular to Portlaoise as it also applies elsewhere.  One of the big struggles that will happen in Portlaoise is hiring the additional consultants for obstetrics and paediatrics.  We need those additional consultants in obstetrics and paediatrics to ensure there is senior cover in that unit, but what if we cannot recruit them?  We have serious difficulties recruiting people.  The Rotunda hospital advertised two jobs not that long ago and did not get any applicants.  We need to have a very serious conversation with the public as to what we do if it is not possible to staff units with specialists.

I received a heart-rending e-mail last week from a woman who has been working since she was 14 years of age.  In recent times she has had to move back to her parents' home because of the cuts to rent allowance and her inability to afford rent.  Her lowest point was going to the post office recently and realising that her payment had been cut from &euro;150 to &euro;81.  She describes the impact of this cut.  Of course, there is no increase in her wages.  She will require close to &euro;50 to pay for petrol to go to work.  She wrote that what the Government has done is to make her feel ashamed and humiliated because she is a lone parent.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste has heard similar sentiments, because the woman's view was \"What does the T&aacute;naiste care?  Her aim is to liberate lone parents.\"  The woman wrote that the Government had just set her back years and she was ashamed of it.<\/p>  <p>  Equally, the Labour Party Whip, Deputy Stagg, finds the T&aacute;naiste's cuts indefensible.  In an e-mail to his constituents who have contacted him about this matter, he stated that he voted for this in 2012 because he was told that the promised child care system would be in place before the last and most severe of the changes.  Then he wrote that there had been angry debate at parliamentary party meetings on the issue and that he simply failed to see how cutting the income of the very people who are making a real effort to improve the lot of their families and themselves helps them in any way to get out of the poverty trap, when it clearly has the opposite effect.  He stated that he would continue to press for a reversal of this bad decision.  He finally stated that he did not blame the constituents for withdrawing support for the party, but he would continue to try to convince those who are making decisions.  Clearly, Deputy Stagg has not convinced the T&aacute;naiste, the person who has made the decision that has caused genuine suffering to many.<\/p>  <p>  I have come across other cases.

The Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government refused to reform benefits for lone parents.  John Downing was on radio in recent times recalling a discussion with one of the former Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers for social protection.  Notwithstanding the advice in those days of the OECD and others that lone parents were the people most at risk of poverty in Irish society, and the fact that this was a time when there was a lot of money to spend on social welfare, Fianna F&aacute;il chose not to undertake any kind of reform.<\/p><p>Through a combination of approximately 19 hours per week of work and the family income supplement, FIS, the purpose of this reform, which is in its third year, is to lift the situation for lone parents and bring their income up above &euro;400 per week, depending on the number of children they have and the hourly rate at which they are employed.  For a lone parent, for instance, who would only be on one-parent family allowance for himself or herself and one child, that would work out at the moment at an average of about &euro;220 per week.  I think most people in the House would agree that is a very low income.  However, if a lone parent raises his or her hours to 19 per week at the minimum wage and receives FIS as well, his or her income would rise to over &euro;400 per week.

Almost a month has passed since the staff and concession holders of Clerys were turfed out onto the street by liquidators.  All they have received from the Labour Party so far is a two-faced response.  The T&aacute;naiste and her Government colleagues have described the actions of the new employers as absolutely despicable, insensitive and appalling.  The T&aacute;naiste borrowed a phrase from the failed Labour Party leader in England, Ed Miliband, when she said that these actions represented predatory capitalism.  Her comments stand in contrast with what the other face of the Labour Party, the Minister of State for inertia, Deputy Nash, said when he published his report on the liquidation of Clerys earlier this week.  Even though the report in question provides a textbook analysis of a tactical insolvency delivered with merciless precision, astoundingly the Minister of State has said there is nothing to see here.  Shockingly, he has also said there are no deficiencies at all in the legislative framework.  If the State is on the hook for millions of euro with regard to the redundancies of workers who have been treated in a despicable manner, how in God's name can anybody accept that there are no deficiencies in the legislative framework in this State?  The truth is that the legislation in this State, under the stewardship of this Government, incentivises ruthless employers to go down the route of separating out companies so that they can use tactical insolvency to insulate themselves from their responsibilities to this State and to their workers.  The T&aacute;naiste's approach of talking tough while doing nothing is tactical deception on her part.  The strong words she used yesterday contrast sharply with the inertia of the Minister of State.  There is a disagreement here.  Who is right?

Some very broad and deep legal issues are arising from the manner in which this insolvency was structured.  I refer to the group structure of companies.  The Deputy needs to be very careful with what he is suggesting.  The use of group structures by companies in Ireland goes back practically forever - certainly back to the 1940s - in company law.  There is nothing improper in having a group structure, but there is everything wrong - just as there is with tax avoidance, particularly aggressive tax avoidance - in manufacturing a situation which results in a company in the group apparently achieving a very significant price for the property part of the group, while leaving the operational side of the group, which employs the workers and the concessionaires, bereft and insolvent of funds.  It is a very clever and aggressive scheme of company law planning.  We have ways of addressing those issues in tax law.  A number of issues are being addressed by the Revenue Commissioners at the moment.  I want to make it clear that this process will have at least two parts.  The message I want to send to people who have been working and giving great service in Clerys over many decades is that their redundancy payments, which are funded through the social insurance that has been willingly paid by them and by everyone else in this country, are secure.  Unfortunately, these payments will be made at a minimum rate and not at the rate they might have got if the company had reached an agreement with the workers, which would have been right and proper in this case.

If I have to paint it out clearly and simply for the T&aacute;naiste again, I will do so.  A number of purchases in 2012 and 2015 have been about maximising property profits and minimising responsibility to employees.  Gordon Brothers walked away from the sale of  Clerys with approximately &euro;15 million.  Natrium has bought a prime development opportunity worth multiples of what it has invested.  The Minister of State, Deputy Nash, has said he is satisfied that Gordon Brothers and Natrium are not required under company law to cough up with regard to employees' entitlements.  Is the T&aacute;naiste satisfied that they are not forced to do so?  If we do not resolve this through legislation, we will be back here in six months talking about another firm.

The fact that it has not been asked to do this yet is alarming.  Such situations are happening repeatedly, and in large numbers, but this practice is not being challenged.  The Minister of State says in his report that section 224 imposes a duty on directors in respect of company employees.  What is the specific provision in that section and where is the precedent?

They are not before the court because they committed a heinous crime, but because they are homeless.  They are homeless due to the decisions of this Government.  The Government has shown the same disregard to people on rent supplement, who are facing massive hikes in rent, as it has shown to lone parents.<\/p>  <p>  Alan suffers from serious epilepsy.  He was in a coma in Tallaght hospital and had to quit his job.  Kelly is now his full-time carer.  They are two of the nicest people one could meet.  Their previous landlord sold their house so they were forced to move out.  Like many others, they did everything they could to find somewhere else to live.  However, they simply could not find a landlord who would accept rent supplement or a rent they could afford.  As no suitable accommodation was offered by South Dublin County Council, like others they were forced to sleep in a tent.  They decided to bring the problem to the council's door by sleeping in its offices overnight a couple of weeks ago.  The council went to the High Court to seek an injunction to force them out of the offices.  Is this what we have come to?  Does the T&aacute;naiste stand over a situation where councils are going to the High Court to seek injunctions against homeless people because they do not have sufficient emergency accommodation for them?<\/p>  <p>  Since a court case a week and a half ago, the couple have been sleeping in a tent in Sean Walsh Memorial Park.  They have also stayed in emergency accommodation.  The conditions in the emergency accommodation are horrific.  In the first place they stayed, the entrance was blocked with rubbish, the mattresses were covered in urine and mould was growing on the windows.  In the next place, there was vomit and food on the floor and unwashed mattresses.  Alan and Kelly are not criminals.  They are simply homeless as a result of decisions made not by them but by others.  However, they are treated like criminals.  Their situation, as Alan described it to me yesterday, is like an open prison, with curfews, no cooking facilities and no individual freedom.  They are not alone.  There are 3,000 people in a similar situation, 1,000 of whom are children.  The T&aacute;naiste is responsible for a significant part of this problem by refusing to increase the rent supplement caps while also refusing to introduce rent controls.  Will she now review this decision?<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, there is a hole of &euro;18.5 million in Dublin city's budget for homelessness services.  Will the Government give a commitment to fill that hole?  Will it investigate the conditions in emergency accommodation and commit itself to improving them?  Finally, will the T&aacute;naiste take note of the housing activists who have taken matters in their own hands?  They have taken over a hostel owned by Dublin City Council on Bolton Street, which was just left there.  They have refurbished it and are opening it to house homeless people.  If they can do that with no resources and as volunteers, given the hundreds of empty NAMA properties throughout the State and in south Dublin why cannot the State take the same action to provide emergency accommodation and social and affordable housing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900022#T02700","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1436439300,"counter":459,"content":"<p>First, with regard to Alan and Kelly, if the Deputy has been advising them as constituents, I strongly suggest that he ask them to get in touch with the community welfare service in the area.  That has been the consistent advice to people in housing difficulties.  They should go and talk to the community welfare service, which has complete discretion with regard to the amount of rent that may be paid.  At this point, there have been well over 1,000 cases dealt with by the community welfare service.  A total of 1,200 cases are in the Dublin local authority areas and 700 to 800 are throughout the rest of the country.  I am surprised if the Deputy has been dealing with the case, as I would hope he would advise the couple to contact the community welfare service.  In addition, in the six months of this year so far, there have been 6,000 renegotiated or new rent supplement tenancies.<\/p><p>The bulk of these are in Dublin.  It is not the best option to go homeless.  It is much better to deal with the community welfare service to see if a property can be accessed that suits the needs of the individuals in question.  As I stated, we have done this in approximately 6,000 cases so far this year, specifically for people under threat of homelessness for the reasons the Deputy outlined.  We have done it specifically in approximately 1,200 cases in the Dublin local authorities.<\/p> <p> I met recently with representatives of the Simon Community, Threshold and other housing bodies, all of which agree that the protocol is working well.  Therefore, I strongly recommend the protocol to Deputy Murphy and Alan and Kelly as a way of perhaps assisting them.

Every single year in this Government's term has seen fewer social houses built than in any other year on record.  That is the truth.  The Government can make all the housing announcements it wants but building local authority houses to get people off the housing waiting list, including the 8,500 people, Alan and Kelly included, on South Dublin County Council's waiting list, is the only way to fundamentally address the housing crisis.  The Government is doing nothing to solve the problem apart from making announcements.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the case of Alan and Kelly and 3,000 other cases, the T&aacute;naiste's advice is to recommend that people avoid going homeless.  We, too, recommend to people that they should not go homeless and people recommend to themselves that they should not go homeless.  People do not want to be homeless and they do not end up in homelessness lightly or without having made contact with a community welfare officer and doing everything else they possibly can.  However, when a landlord is selling a property, the tenants must move out and many are unable to find somewhere else to go.  Alan and Kelly are in contact with South Dublin County Council on a daily basis.  They currently have emergency accommodation because other people were cleared off the homeless list, which will now fill up again.  The advice they are receiving is not that they will be allocated a house but that they should find a landlord who will take the housing assistance payment.  They cannot find any landlords who will take the HAP and they are not the only people in that position. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900023#U01200","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1436439900,"counter":472,"content":"<p>It is a national problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900023#U01300","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1436439900,"counter":473,"content":"<p>A recent survey published by the Simon Community found that only 12% of available properties were within rent supplement and housing assistance payment limits.

The position was that for anybody wishing to transition from one gender to another there was an objectionable obstacle, namely, a medical assessment.  Following various representations, and I recognise the distance the Government has come in this regard, that was removed for people from the age of 18 upwards.  <\/p><p>Representations had been made to the Government regarding the position of people aged between 16 and 18 for whom originally no provision was made.  Ultimately, they were included in the legislation but subject to some severe restrictions.  They have to overcome a number of obstacles in order to apply for gender transfer, including proof of identity, proof of birth, statutory declaration, parental consent, order of the Circuit Court, another certificate as well as the medical report from both a medical practitioner and an endocrinologist or, alternatively, a psychiatrist.<\/p><p>I am seeking to remove the medical assessment in so far as those aged 16 to 18 are concerned.  That it is required flies in the face of all the evidence and studies.  I quoted one study on Committee Stage from the United Kingdom which found that only 4% of people come to the realisation they are the wrong gender by the time they reach the age of 18, and 76% of them become aware of this before they leave primary school.<\/p><p>In my opinion, people of any age should be entitled to transition.  For people under the age of 18, the practice would be that they would be doing so at the behest of a parent or guardian.  There can be no serious suggestion that a parent or guardian would undertake such a process lightly.  In some countries, for example, Argentina, it is possible to transition under the age of 16, again at the behest of a parent or guardian.  That has not caused any great problems in practice.  <\/p> <p> On the amendments, while I recognise I will not get any concessions today for people under the age of 16 years, I am asking that the obstacle of a medical statement in respect of people aged between 16 and 18 years be removed.  I do not think that is an onerous ask of the Government, recognising that it has already come a fair distance.  This Bill has been in gestation for a lengthy period.  It follows on from the decision of the European Court of Justice, many reports and various drafts of legislation and so on.  This has been a lengthy process.  It is unlikely we will return to this issue again in the short term.  In light of all of the effort that has gone into this legislation and the number of changes that the Government has already, wisely, made, I believe it should go this one step further in relation to 16 to 18 year olds.  This would not require significant alteration of the legislation.  There are many obstacles in the path of a person aged between 16 and 18 years.  Given that usually people realise at a much younger age than 16 years that they are in the wrong gender, it is desirable that the Government would accept these amendments.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State will, no doubt, respond that there is a clause in the Bill which provides for a review after two years.  Perhaps he will elaborate on what exactly that review will entail.  Will it automatically entail amending legislation if that is deemed to be necessary?  I think it will be necessary.  We were late legislating in this area.  However, being late gives us the advantage of having an opportunity to review what other jurisdictions have done.  Jurisdictions that have recently legislated in this area have gone a good bit beyond what we are now proposing.  I anticipate that we will have to revisit this legislation to make some of the changes that we could make today and that people will suffer as a result of us not having made them today.  <\/p> <p> In my view, there should be no need for a medical statement in respect of persons aged between 16 and 18 years of age.  This provision should be removed and transition should be possible at any age at the behest of a parent or guardian.  As I said earlier, this is not a process that would be undertaken lightly.  I am seeking removal of the requirement for a medical statement in respect of 16 to 18 year olds.  In my opinion, this is a very minor demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900025#X03300","speaker":"1059","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436441700,"counter":537,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Dea's proposal in respect of people over 16 years of age but under the age set down in this particular Bill is very reasonable.  During the debate on the heads of this Bill and on Committee Stage, we debated the various onuses this Bill accords at different ages.  I acknowledge the significant progress that has been made in the past number of years in terms of the approach of the State to this issue, as reflected in the Bill.  However, I do not believe the legislation goes far enough.  We now have an opportunity to be a world trendsetter in this area, such that other countries would look to us as an example of best practice in this area, just as in the past we have looked to other countries such as Argentina.  Denmark was the first European country to allow a legal change of gender without medical statement.  We have learned from that change made by Denmark two years ago.  We are close to being one of the first countries to address this issue, although much has changed since this process first commenced.  It would be a pity if we did not recognise that people usually know from a very young age, in many cases without medical practitioners or their parents knowing, what gender they are.  People are often assigned a gender by society which does not really take account of who they are.<\/p>  <p>  In refusing to accept these amendments proposed by Deputy O'Dea, the Government is forcing 16 and 17 year olds, at a time that can be very traumatic in the life of any teenager, to wait a further two years to transition.  While having to wait another two years might not be a burden for those of us who are into the second half of a century, for young people it is a burden.  This could lead to further problems for them in school, in society or even at home.  The amendments do not go as far I would go but they are a half-way measure.  It would be appropriate for the Minister of State to make some changes at this stage rather than wait a number of years until this legislation is reviewed to do so.  In my opinion, given the major changes being introduced in this Bill, and the fact that we cannot anticipate how it will work in practice, we will have to revisit it in the future.  We had all hoped we would have the opportunity to celebrate the victory of the marriage equality referendum in the context of its implications for this Bill but we have not been able to do so.  It is hoped we will have an opportunity to do so when the marriage equality legislation has been published.  It is possible that various provisions of that Bill will impact on this legislation, thus requiring us to revisit this Bill sooner than originally intended.  Perhaps, during debate on the marriage equality legislation and the outcome of the referendum, the opportunity will be taken to review whether some of the proposals we have put forward in the amendments before the House today can be taken on board.  <\/p>  <p>  Many groups have worked tirelessly on this issue, in particular Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, which advocates on behalf of people who have been wrongly assigned a gender by the State or were wrongly diagnosed at a young age by medical professionals to be of a certain gender.  As far as I am aware, TENI is happy with the progress we have made but, like me, it believes we could have gone a lot further.  I recently reviewed the observations of the Equality Authority on the revised general scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill 2014.<\/p><p>Some of the points we are making today were set out in that document, which shows how long the issues are being teased out not only by Members of this House, but also by concerned organisations.  Those organisations are urging us to get the legislation right, just in case we never come back to it or it is years before we do so.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the commitment by the Government to review the provision in two years.  That is a saving grace in some ways, but I am mindful that I have heard many such commitments in this House.  We should perhaps note that there is emergency legislation from the Second World War still on our Statute Book, namely, the Offences Against the State Act 1939.  Just because there is an undertaking to review this Bill in two years time, there is no guarantee it will actually happen.  Who can know whether the Minister of State or any other Member will be here then?  The problems identified by Deputies on all sides of the House might not be addressed by the next Government, in which case it will fall to the groups that have lobbied us on the matter to continue lobbying.  There will be a challenge for us all in seeking to address the issues that remain to be addressed when the review finally does happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900026#Y00200","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436442300,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I support this group of amendments.  Unfortunately, I missed the closing date to submit my own proposals and it was not possible, with only two days to do so, to put forward amendments to the amendments.  I support the appeal from transgender people aged 16 to 18 and under 16 for the Government to take this opportunity to make provision for an interim gender certificate.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs submitted recommendations or amendments to Cabinet in this regard?<\/p>  <p>  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, has had a number of meetings with Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, BeLonG To and other groups, where he had a chance to speak to people who will be affected by these provisions.  The failure to make provision for those aged under 18 will impact directly on young people's lives.  They should have had a much stronger say in terms of their communication with the Department.  By failing to make provision in the legislation for that age group, we are saying to a generation of young people that they must wait two years before anything will be done for them.  In Norway, a recent proposal seeks to extend gender recognition provisions to apply to children as young as seven years of age.  In other countries, a lot of research is being done and debate is taking place on how legislation can be changed to accommodate the needs of young people.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State knows my position on this issue.  There is no reason the legislation cannot be reviewed much sooner than in two years time.  We might consider it in six months, say, and, if necessary, introduce amendments to make provision for 16 to 18 year olds and under 16s.  Is the Minister of State open to an earlier review, before the five-year term of this D&aacute;il is over?  This is good and progressive legislation, which moves us a great deal further along from where we were some months ago.  It comes in the wake of the progressive \"Yes\" vote in the marriage equality referendum.  The Ombudsman for Children has called for the Bill to be amended to make provision for under 16s, as has TENI, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the Children's Rights Alliance.  Those organisations are arguing for the change as something that will have a significant impact on people's lives.  The feedback we are getting shows that young people know who they are in terms of gender recognition from a fairly young age.  They have to deal with that every day of the week in school, at sports activities and everywhere they go.  It will be a terrible shame if we do not use this opportunity to put a more definite process in place for reviewing the need to make provision for 16 to 18 year olds and under 16s.

I acknowledge that these amendments were put forward in a spirit of co-operation.  Our engagement with groups like TENI and BeLonG To and the opportunity we had to meet with young people and parents and hear their stories have helped to shape this Bill into one of the most progressive legislative measures ever to come before the House.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dea expressed concern that we might never return to the legislation.  In fact, there is an absolutely solid commitment that it will be reviewed.  My intention, if I return to the House, is that it be reviewed, at a minimum, within the two years.  It will, moreover, be a comprehensive review.  All of us who have participated in the debate, at pre-legislative scrutiny stage and on Committee Stage, know how quickly its provisions have changed and how much we have learned in the course of our discussions.  I have no doubt there will be changes to the legislation in future as more research is done and a greater understanding is gained of the issues.<\/p>  <p>  The age issue to which Deputy Joan Collins referred is more appropriate to discuss in the context of amendments Nos. 16 to 22, inclusive, and No. 26.  I will deal with it, therefore, when we come to discuss those proposals.  To answer her straightforward question, I am not aware that the Minister for Children and Youth submitted recommendations or amendments to Cabinet in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  I do not propose to accept this group of amendments.  The Bill provides for a model of self-declaration for persons aged over 18.  Crucially, there will be no requirement to have any medical input in the application process for a gender recognition certificate.  That is a major step forward, as has been recognised outside the House, and makes us one of the most progressive countries in the world on this issue.  However, statements from medical practitioners will need to be provided during a court process where a person aged 16 or 17 is applying for gender recognition.  The amendments that were passed on Committee Stage provided that within the court process, supporting statements from the applicant's primary treating medical practitioner, who will be either an endocrinologist or a psychiatrist, must confirm that the child has transitioned or is transitioning into his or her preferred gender.  It is important to emphasise that the medical element of the process will remain strictly within the boundaries of the court.  Where a child receives a court exemption, he or she will not be required to provide any further medical evidence to the Department in respect of his or her application.  It is for this purpose alone that the definition referred to in amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and No. 5 must remain as part of the Bill.  I cannot, therefore, accept the proposals, although I acknowledge the intent behind them.<\/p>  <p>  I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 14 and 32, which provide for non-disclosure by an applicant in respect of surgical procedures.  There was never any question of making gender recognition dependent on a person having to provide medical evidence of reassignment surgery or treatment.<\/p><p>These amendments are entirely unnecessary, and I am concerned that they would have unintended consequences.  There was never any question of making gender recognition contingent on a person providing medical evidence of reassignment or any other treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900027#Z00300","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436442900,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that a very neglected, abused and harassed group of people are being dealt with in some measure, but I condemn completely the manner in which the Bill is being guillotined.  It is outrageous that the debate will finish at 2.30 p.m.  Many amendments tabled by me, the Anti-Austerity Alliance and others, which were a result of meetings with TENI and other advocates on this issue, will not be heard, which is really unfortunate.  The advances in the Bill are welcome and great credit is due to the social movement that took place in this country around the marriage equality referendum.  I have no doubt that the Government would not have agreed to the changes sought if the \"Yes\" vote had not been so decisive.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of those aged under 18 is important, and I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the decision not to accept the amendments.  The idea that because one is aged under 18 one will be treated differently from adults is unacceptable.  After everything that has happened in this country regarding the rights of children and women in the past, surely the Government should have taken a much more enlightened approach.  Children have a right to express their opinions, their identities and who they are.  Let us be clear.  Children know from a very early age if they are gay, bisexual or transgender.  We have all been educated in recent times about that, and many children know and express that to their parents.  Whether their parents accept that is another issue, but it is to be hoped many of them will.<\/p>  <p>  Amnesty International has made the case that young children and those aged under 18 need to be listened to.  The Ombudsman for Children has also asked the Government to take account of those aged under 18.  The Minister of State could have accepted the amendments tabled to allow people to not have to go through medical examinations or certifications.  A person aged 16, for example, is legally allowed to give his or her opinion on what should happen to him or her when he or she is in hospital.  The Minister of State could easily have lowered the age in the Bill to 16 years.<\/p>  <p>  Children should be able, with the support of their parents, to apply for a certificate without having to go to a doctor.  There are real problems with regard to medical practitioners.  TENI has said there is a lack of trained medical professionals and doctors who are willing and able to deal with this issue.  The waiting lists are very long and it is likely that it would be two to three years before somebody would be able to have his or her identity asserted.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to make some general points about those aged under 18, because I may not get to make them again.  I refer to the issue of schools.  I ask the Minister of State to follow the Bill with a discussion about what schools will be asked to do to cater for transgender young people.  As we know, 90% of primary schools and 53% of secondary schools are denominational.  Some excellent documentaries have been aired on RTE radio on which young transgender people were interviewed, and a major issue for them was schools.  People are forced to wear very gendered uniforms which they do not want to wear.  They are forced to use certain toilets, which is inhumane and undignified.  Schools have refused to recognise that some young people want to be a different gender, even when they have the support of their parents and families.<\/p>  <p>  School textbooks and policies on bullying are also issues, and need to reflect the fact that there are more than two genders in society and that a spectrum of genders exists.  I have spoken to young people involved in the Spectrum Group, which deals with the major problem of homophobic and trans-phobic bullying in schools.  There has to be a recognition that society has changed and people want a tolerant, diverse, pluralist and open society.  The Amnesty International findings on abortion, which were published yesterday, bear this out.  People want a separation of church and state in this country.  That is the only way young transgender people in schools will be able to fully express who they are without being pigeonholed and told not to feel a certain way.<\/p>  <p>  During the marriage equality referendum, a bishop said that if the vote was passed schools would not be expected to reflect same-sex couples in school textbooks, but they are.  What about transgender people?  The Bill is very important and a good step forward, but it must be followed by a realisation by this and future Governments that we need to separate church and state and allow much more diversity of options, particularly for young people who do not accept the shackles and straitjackets that our generation and others were put into.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900028#AA00200","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1436442900,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I will withdraw amendments Nos. 14 and 32, because the Minister of State said there could be potential unintended consequences.

The Minister of State has given a commitment that that was never the intention of the Bill, and therefore I am happy to withdraw the amendments.<\/p>  <p>  The main intention of this group of amendments is to give recognition, at the very least, to the way society has evolved.  There is a discussion within it about the age of responsibility, what age people can get married at and the age at which people can play as full a role in society as possible.  There is a debate among the USI, the National Youth Council and others on reducing the voting age.  Most parties believe the voting age should be reduced to 17, if not 16, thereby putting major responsibility into the hands of 16 or 17 year olds.  If one accepts that those of that age can make decisions that could influence future Governments or the society in which they live, one cannot at the same time be unwilling to give them the full rights and respect necessary to have a full understanding of their gender.  <\/p>  <p>  We should open up the new provisions contained in the Bill as fully as possible to those aged 16 and 17 years of age.

In my part of the country it can take up to 12 months to bring a case to the circuit court, and it is an expensive process.

Deputy Collins has indicated to us that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has indicated the Minister of State should have accepted the amendments to change the medical hoops being put in the way of young people between the ages of 16 and 18 and deal in a fair way with people aged under 16, but the Minister of State is still refusing to do so.  I do not really understand why, because everybody, including the UN, the ISPCC, TENI, all of the groups and anybody who knows or cares about this issue is saying the Minister of State needs to go further and accept the amendments, and clearly it is the expressed will of the people in the country.

She wants us to reflect on the area of education.  We are very anxious and concerned that transgender children in schools are protected and respected.  This is a major concern for parents and is one about which my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is also concerned.  I have met many parents on this matter.  When Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn was Minister, he introduced wide-ranging compulsory anti-bullying procedures which cover this area.  The Minister for Education and Skills has already had a meeting on this and I am aware she has written to TENI, BeLongTo and school representatives on having further round table discussions.  Transgender children have their main experiences in the educational system.  We need to engage further with educators to ensure transgender children are respected in the education system.  Before I came to the House, I spoke to a parent about how uneven the experience can be and the difference the attitude of a principal can make.  The Minister and I want to ensure proper policies are in place throughout the education system whereby children will be treated with respect.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy O'Sullivan, will follow up with interest groups and representatives of principals and others in education in a round table discussion which will lead to a policy to ensure transgender children are treated with the respect any child deserves.  I have no doubt this will happen.<\/p>  <p>  This has been quite a long process and Deputies O'Dea and &Oacute; Snodaigh have engaged extensively on it.  We had prolonged discussions on Committee Stage on a range of issues.  These changes did not come about because of the marriage equality referendum.  They were well flagged.  We withdrew the Bill and engaged with the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland on a range of issues.  The original pre-legislative scrutiny which took place was based on the age of 18.  In response to those discussions, this was lowered to 16.  In response to the debate in the Seanad, the two year review was introduced.  The Bill has progressed much slower than I wanted, and I would have much preferred to have seen this legislation at a much earlier stage.  The Bill is all the stronger, but at some stage one must go forward and enact legislation which will be reviewed.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Collins's remarks on the Minister, Deputy Reilly, he is the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and I hope he takes on a very strong role with regard to transgender children.  It is very much within his remit.  If he proposes amendments, I hope he brings them to Cabinet.  This is complicated legislation and there must be forethought and a large amount of consultation before any changes made.  A significant amount of consultation has taken place throughout the Bill's progression and every Member of the House has engaged with a wide range of people.  If the Minister, Deputy Reilly, intends to bring forward amendments or further legislation on transgender children he will certainly have my advice and support and I look forward to it.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, hold strong views on this and has concerns about transgender children and I am sure he will continue to work in the area.

If the amendment is accepted, we know we can start a review in a year.  There will be a new Government this time next year, no matter what I or those opposite do in the mean time.  Since we know there will be an election and a new Government, this would force it to act very quickly rather than in two years, which the Minister of State proposes.<\/p><p>The second part of the amendment provides for a five-year review.  As the Minister of State indicated in the first contribution, much is happening not only in Ireland but right across the world.  I have mentioned Denmark as an example of how things are moving quickly.  We need to ensure that we will not just have a review in two years.  We hope the next Government will be enlightened and address the shortfalls that will become apparent, and we have already identified some of them.  In five years or ten years, others may become evident.  I am just trying to ensure this will not just be a once-off review, with the legislation put on the shelf forever.  <\/p><p>We are discussing a small group in society and I am thankful they have been blessed by very good advocates able to explain to those of us who were not fully <i>au fait<\/i>over the years the difficulties faced by children, in particular, and adults.  They have been able to get across to us, as legislators, the importance of addressing this issue through a human rights approach to law.  I want to ensure we can have a quick review and a follow-up one to capture some of the changes in our society.  I hope it can deal with the positive changes at least.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900030#CC01100","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1436444100,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I support Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's amendment.  This is obviously a substantial and progressive change to our laws that we welcome, albeit with certain criticisms and reservations.  It is new legislation so that is the idea for having a review as quickly as possible is to see how it will work and affect different groups of transgender people or to ensure any problems can be quickly ironed out and changed.<\/p>  <p>  I will highlight a few issues and one relates to what we have just discussed.  In one year, we should be able to examine this in a real way and see if anybody between 16 and 18 years of age managed to get a gender recognition certificate by going through the process of courts and medical examination.  If they have not done so over the course of a year, would it illustrate a problem and mean that we should simply lower the age from 18 to 16?  It is a concrete question and with the benefit of a year's experience, we would be able to review it.  I accept the Government's commitment to resolve the forced divorce requirement but will it be done in a year?  It is a vital issue and at least if there is to be a definite review in a year, it will force the Government of the day to confront that reality.  If it has not been dealt with for some reason, it can be dealt with at that stage.<\/p>  <p>  Other issues are not considered in the Bill and a review in a year would likely highlight the need to deal with them.  For example, there is a question of an \"X\" gender, or those people who identify neither as male nor female.  We have amendments on that later but it is likely we will not get to them because of the guillotine.  A review is likely to highlight that as a major issue requiring amendment.  Amendment No. 4 dealt with a residency requirement and after a year, we could see if it affects any groups of workers or students not in the country for a year but who seek, for whatever reason, a gender recognition certificate.  Finally, we could see the impact of the legislation in education and whether further action should be taken.  It is clear that in this case, we need a quicker review period than two years.  The Minister of State has the right under the current wording to do it more quickly but it should be in law that this must happen within a year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900030#CC01200","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1436444100,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I support the amendment.

It is entirely sensible and appropriate.  The Minister of State has acknowledged that elements of this Bill will have to be changed but cannot be changed at the moment for purely legal reasons, as Deputy O'Dea mentioned.  The main explanation given to us on Committee Stage of the debate was that the marriage equality amendment had not yet been passed.  Therefore, now that the referendum is over and the amendment is passed, once any legal problems are cleared out of the way, it logically follows that the Government will immediately amend this Bill, if it is still in government, or that any future Government would do so immediately.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State made a point earlier in response to me about the significance of the marriage equality referendum in setting a context in which the Government could go further than it is going in this Bill, particularly in the area of dealing with young people aged between 18 and 16 and people under 16, and the other issues that need to be dealt with.  I am sure this was discussed before, but the requirement for a person to declare a solemn intention of living in the preferred gender for the rest of his or her life also should not be there.  We should be supporting gender self-determination.  I do not see why one has to give a commitment to stay in a particular gender forever in order to get a certificate.  We should have gender self-determination.<\/p>  <p>  All these things need to be looked at, most importantly the situation for young people.  My point about the referendum was not that it forced the Minister of State to make some of the changes he has made.  That is largely down to the advocacy groups, who have educated us all on these matters during the course of the debate.  I accept his point on that.  It is the advocacy groups, TENI and others, that have helped us to understand the issues.  My point is that the referendum indicates that the people are way ahead of politicians on matters of equality.  Any political hesitation that might stop the Government from going further in this Bill is unwarranted.  The people have stated their belief in equality in these matters.  The statement made was not just about marriage equality; it was about the need for equality more generally, including in matters to do with transgender people.<\/p>  <p>  There is no political reason to lag behind where the people are - something we have done, sadly and at a terrible cost, in this State for many years.  The political system has lagged behind.  Big, powerful institutions have held us back and lagged behind where people are.  A year is a long time in the life of a young person.  Things are pretty tough for young people, generally speaking, and if a year is a long time, two years is a very long time.  The Minister of State has spoken about the need for more consultation on these matters.  We have had the consultation, we have had the best advice and we have had an extensive discussion.  I do not see why he will not accept the amendments, but given that he is not going to, I do not see why he could not agree to the review in a year and making those changes in a year's time, rather than stringing it out for two years, because that is a long time in the lives of young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900031#DD00400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1436444700,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Two years is adequate.

In response to Deputy O'Dea, once the review has commenced, a report needs to be made to both Houses within 12 months, which is an important element.  A review is adequate.<\/p>  <p>  We will get to the other amendments regarding the requirement to be single and all that, so instead of jumping around the place, I will respond to that then, but Deputy O'Dea knows very well from Committee Stage that I had hoped to be able to bring amendments on Report Stage, and it is the intention of the Government to remove that provision, subject to the outcome of the case that is now in front of the courts.  Depending on how the court case goes, the Government is committed to bringing forward an amendment removing the requirement that a person undergoing gender recognition must be single.

It means that work will be done on this for the 12 months, whether by the Department itself or by the committee, which did very good work on the original legislation and proved in many ways that parliamentarians could grapple with legislation at an early stage.  This was one of the first pieces of legislation that came under the pre-legislative scrutiny model and it proved that we could do that.  It allowed us to engage, as parliamentarians and on a cross-party basis, with advocates who had heard the horror stories and so on of people who have been struggling with our society and our society's views over years.<\/p><p>The likes of Dr. Lydia Foy, FLAC, BeLonG To, TENI and Focus: The Identity Trust, came to us individually but have also made submissions to the committee.

We already know some of the issues.  It will still be fresh, unlike in two years' time.  I hope some of us will be around to help that work, but if we were all to go, there would be at least some committee members who are advocates.  The nature of this type of work is that Members advocate for a while and then move on to the next issue.

I understand that Deputies have received an information note setting out the purpose of these amendments.<\/p><p>As Deputies will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has been implementing a programme of reform of the State's employment rights and industrial relations procedures and institutions since 2012.  His aim is to establish a world-class workplace relations service and employment rights framework by streamlining the existing mechanisms and establishing a simpler structure while building upon the recognised strengths of the existing systems.<\/p><p>The reform programme is at an advanced stage and the legislation that will give statutory effect to these reforms, namely, the Workplace Relations Act 2015, was signed into law by the President on 20 May.  The Minister has announced that the WRC will commence on 1 October 2015.<\/p><p>The effect of the Workplace Relations Act, when it is commenced, will be to replace the five existing workplace relations bodies with two.  The Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be replaced by the new Workplace Relations Commission.  The appeals functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.  The cost of running these bodies will be reduced through the better use of technology and shared services, staff reductions, the elimination of duplication and the centralisation of administration and case management services.  This rationalisation will deliver a much better service to end users, including employers and employees, at a reduced cost to the State.<\/p> <p> Significant progress was achieved in advance of the enactment of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 in the technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required to underpin the workplace relations reform programme.  I will mention the measures that have been already put in place.  The Equality Tribunal has been transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in anticipation of becoming part of the Workplace Relations Commission.  A single contact portal and a post registration unit have been established to deal with all aspects of case management as far as complaints are concerned.  A single workplace relations complaint form and e-complaint facility has been launched.  A single workplace relations website has been designed and launched.  A single adjudication and appeals decisions database has been designed and launched.  An early resolution service has been established.  The selection process for an external panel of adjudicators and an accredited training programme for adjudicators has been completed.  The selection process for two new deputy chairs of the court has been completed.  Enhanced technologies and business processes, including the completion of the procurement and design of a customer relationship management solution, have been implemented.<\/p> <p> Work will proceed at an accelerated pace over the coming months to make progress with a comprehensive programme of work to ensure our workplace relations services are business-ready for establishment day.  This includes the preparation of regulations relating to critical procedures, the finalisation of arrangements for the introduction of compliance notices and fixed charge notices in support of inspection activities, the transitioning of e-business, the phasing out of information and communications technology systems in line with the rationalisation of services and the implementation of the proposed customer relationship management solution to support complaints and adjudication management.  Key senior management positions will be fully aligned with the new structure and processes.<\/p> <p> As Deputies are aware, the Workplace Relations Act is complex.  When it is commenced, its effect will be to replace the five existing workplace relations bodies with a new simplified two-tier structure.  The Act will also result in the establishment of new structures for the resolution and adjudication of complaints and disputes across the entire corpus of employment rights and equality legislation.  As a result of the introduction of these new structures, it has been necessary to make consequential amendments to 24 primary Acts, 34 specified parts or sections of Acts and numerous statutory instruments.  As part of the technical and complex drafting process, it became clear following the enactment of the Act as certain technical legal elements were worked through that a number of technical and drafting amendments would be necessary to ensure the smooth running of the new structures.  As a consequence, it is essential that these amendments be effected before the commencement of the legislation and the establishment of the new structures on 1 October 2015.  It is proposed that the aforementioned amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 2015 will be inserted into the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Bill 2015 as a new Part 3 of that Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900033#FF01800","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436446500,"counter":601,"content":"<p>While we will not be opposing this motion, we do not feel it is a good way of doing business.

I am unhappy about the way the amendments have been presented to us here today.  As has been previously said, it is not a proper way to do business in a democracy.  I welcome the Bill, however.  It has been said that low pay is endemic and entrenched in the Irish economy.  Recent data from the OECD showed that the prevalence of low pay in Ireland is among the highest in the OECD.  The relevant figure is 21.8%.  It is interesting that a report on equality in Ireland that was recently published by Ellen Zentner of Morgan Stanley economists found that the United States has the highest proportion of low pay.  This is very interesting.  The relevant figure for the United States is 25%.  It is shocking that Ireland is in second place with a figure of 21.8%.  The figure for the United Kingdom is 21%.  The figures for Switzerland, Finland and some of the Nordic countries are way below 10%.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions recently told an Oireachtas committee that low-paid workers are more likely to suffer from a range of unfair employment practices that adversely effect their ability to earn a living.  Following the Dunnes Stores strike over zero-hour contracts and the low levels of pay associated with such contracts, many of us are concerned about what kind of jobs and work practices we will be facing in Ireland over the coming years.  It has to be accepted that a new breed of employers is expecting workers to work variable hours with uncertain contracts and on low pay.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions told the Oireachtas committee that any legislation has to include provisions that ensure employers cannot frustrate attempts to improve working conditions, such as efforts to establish employment regulation orders in sectors such as hotels and catering businesses.  It is interesting that the Central Statistics Office has said that approximately 135,000 people are classed as part-time under-employed workers.  These people would like to take up full-time work.  It worries me that this Bill is providing for a couple of little get-out clauses that will allow employers to find a way out of paying what they should be paying in terms of low pay.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting that I have mentioned Switzerland because yesterday I attended a meeting attended by the Swiss ambassador.  When I asked him a few questions about the Swiss economy, he made the interesting point that the payment of good wages is the best solution for dealing with poverty.  This is why I mentioned that the figure of 10% in Switzerland is one of the lowest in the world.  The Minister of State and I are aware that there is a cost factor for our economy if we keep people on low pay.  The cost factor is huge if we keep people on unemployment benefit because it restricts what they can spend money on.  People on low pay are exactly the same - they are restricted in how they can spend.  There is a draw on the social welfare system because people have to get family income supplement, etc.  There is also a draw on the health service because people need medical cards, etc.  There is a huge pull out of the economy.  It has been found in some countries that if people are paid reasonable wages, they can pay tax and contribute back into the economy.  This can increase spending in the economy.<\/p><p>If we have hundreds of thousands of people who are restricted to barely surviving, just buying food and barely able to pay their television licence, electricity and gas bills, we are not contributing to growth in the economy.  Everybody knows we need external investment and internal spending.  However, we are putting a cap on hundreds of thousands of people who wish to, and can, contribute to the economy if they are given a chance to do so.  The best way to do that is to give people a reasonable rate.  It might be a cost in the short term, but employers and Governments should see that it could contribute to the coffers of whatever Government is in power as well as to small and medium sized businesses and enterprises, because people will have spending power.  I realise the Minister of State means well, and I will not vote against the Bill as it is a big step forward.  However, the position in Ireland at present, with 21.8% on low pay, is appalling.  It is shocking that we are just behind America, and we all know how some employers can treat their workers in America.  We are at nothing if we do not ensure in this Bill that employers will pay a decent wage.<\/p> <p> I would like to have more time to speak on this but I must conclude.  My determination of a decent wage is not a minimum wage.  Again, we must look to the Nordic countries, where people talk about a liveable wage.  This is not rhetoric from the left that people should be paid a liveable wage.  There is good, sound economic reasoning for giving people a liveable wage.  The best way to take people out of poverty is to give them work, but they must be given a decent, liveable wage that they can spend and with which they can have a quality of life.  If the vast majority of people who are on low incomes, unemployed or just above the threshold of being impoverished had the chance of a job with a liveable wage, does anybody think they would not take it?  Of course they would in order to improve their position.  That is how we must go in the medium and long term.  As the Swiss ambassador said yesterday, the best way of dealing with poverty is to give people a decent rate of pay.  It lifts them out of poverty and helps the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900034#GG00600","speaker":"1094","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436447100,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I will make substantive points on the issue of low pay and on the amendments in the discussion on Report Stage.<\/p>  <p>  We will not oppose the motion.  The Anti-Austerity Alliance supported the Workplace Relations Bill and the Minister of State claims that these changes are necessary arising from that legislation.  However, there is a point at issue about parliamentary procedure and the right of the D&aacute;il to scrutinise legislation properly.  There is a right and democratic way of doing things and a wrong way of doing them.  This is another example, although a less cynical one, of what we saw last week with the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, where unrelated amendments were tabled at the last minute, thus preventing proper scrutiny.  In this case, I do not believe it is done to prevent proper scrutiny, but because it is the quickest way of doing it.  That does not herald some type of democratic revolution, or fulfil the democratic revolution that was heralded.<\/p>  <p>  There are questions for the Minister of State as to why this was not foreseen when the Workplace Relations Bill was debated.  If there had been proper parliamentary scrutiny at that stage, the fact that these other changes were required could have been recognised.  Why could we not have a Workplace Relations (Amendment) Bill which could go through the proper parliamentary process and the proper Stages of scrutiny?

Low pay and under-employment are entrenched within the Irish system.  That means for hundreds of thousands of individuals the simple necessities of life are beyond reach for their families.  As has been said, over 20% of the population is on low pay.  The facts that people who are working are in poverty, that people who are working are getting a subsidy from the Government to subsidise their employers to pay them the low wage and that the State is employing people in the public sector on a low wage and giving them family income support, acknowledging that their wages are not enough for them to survive, mean that when we approach a Bill such as this we must do so with ambition and an understanding of the real lives of mothers, fathers and children throughout the State.  For that reason, we have asked that the Government broaden the terms of the Bill.<\/p><p>The Bill refers to low pay.  However the national minimum wage applies to 4.7% of the population.  Low pay affects over 20% of the population, so over 15% of people in the State will not experience any positive effects from this Bill.  From the start we have asked the Government to substitute the phrase &quot;matters related to low pay&quot; to broaden the scope.  We have tabled this amendment and a number of other amendments to ensure we provide something useful to those people.  I wholeheartedly urge the Minister of State, even at this late stage, to take the time to consider the families that have been left out of this legislation and to see how they can be helped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900035#HH00900","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1436447100,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I support the amendment.

I do not accept the criticism that the remit of the new organisation is narrow.  The opposite is the case as the commission's role will extend far beyond setting the rate of the national minimum wage on an annual basis.  The body was established on an interim basis at the end of February and, given the short timeframe it has to report to me and Government and make a recommendation for a new rate for the national minimum wage, it has focused on this task in the early months of its existence.  I do not make any apologies for that. <\/p><p>Section 5 provides that the Low Pay Commission may be requested by the Minister to examine and report on such matters related generally to the functions of the commission under the Act.  This may be a rather an inelegant way of providing that the commission will have a broad remit.  In addition, its remit will be very much based on concerns expressed in the House every week about matters related to low pay.  This Government and subsequent Governments will need to be conscious of this issue and address it in a democratic fashion.<\/p><p>The Government must provide the Low Pay Commission with its work programme not later than two months after the legislation has been enacted and, subsequently, by the end of February each year.  In doing so, it will reflect on the state of play in respect of low pay, the incidence and prevalence of low pay and various related matters and various sectors that may be of concern to the House and Governments in future.  This is how the Low Pay Commission's work programme will be developed.  It will be adopted by the Government each year and sent to the commission for its examination.  This will allow me and future Ministers to ask the commission each year to do the work all Deputies want it to do and advise the Government in an expert and evidence based manner about the best approaches to take.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the proposed amendments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900036#JJ00200","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"vote","time":1436447700,"counter":618,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 33; N\u00edl, 52.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Dara Calleary and Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn; N\u00edl, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Joe Carey.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900036#JJ00300","aye":["1066","1199","1003","1190","1071","1193","1057","1083","1195","1101","1022","1198","1182","1108","1094","1040","998","992","1008","1017","981","1197","1177","969","1044","984","1005","1001","953","970","1102","1080","1065"],"nay":["974","1079","989","1029","1042","975","1092","1031","972","1041","1093","1099","1006","994","1091","968","1011","1103","957","1014","1085","1068","951","1051","995","1106","1097","1033","1021","1110","1053","1180","1000","977","1004","1070","985","1067","1056","1045","1058","1069","1073","971","964","947","952","961","1010","948","950","1024"]},{"type":"speech","time":1436448300,"counter":619,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 3, 4, 28 and 29 form a composite proposal and may be discussed together.

We must raise the standards and counter the pressure and drive towards the race to the bottom.<\/p>  <p>  I would point to another dimension to this issue which we discussed at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday and I was very pleased to get a positive response from economists who were there.  We were debating the issue of quantitative easing, which is a technically dense, complicated, barely understandable process that is being engaged in by the European authorities, the ECB and so on, essentially to counter the impact of austerity.  I, and others, put it to that group of economists, Stephen Kinsella, Dan O'Brien and Constantin Gurdgiev, who are quite a mixed bag from the political and ideological spectrum, that with respect to all the economic crisis, quantitative easing, austerity and the problems the European and global economy are facing, that the big problem is low pay and that all of those measures were symptoms of the fact that the share of income that is going to labour has dropped by about 10% since the Thatcher- Regan era and there has been a corresponding increase in the national economic cake or wider European economic cake going to profits.  There has been a significant and consistent transfer across Europe and the world of wealth from the pockets of workers, in the form of wages, into the pockets of the rich in the form of profits and that transfer lies at the base of the economic crisis we are now witnessing.<\/p>  <p>  There is an economic imperative, from the point of view of the whole economy, to address the issue of low pay, not only for the low-paid but for the stability of the entire economy.  If workers do not have enough money in their pockets, they cannot afford to put a roof over their heads and they cannot afford to pay for goods.  If they cannot do that, it causes a big problem for the economy and there is only one way that can be resolved and that is by them getting loans - many loans - they cannot afford pay back.  The result of that is credit bubbles and the financialisation of the entire economy.  That is what has happened during the last 25 years.  <\/p>  <p>  The question of radically redressing the race to the bottom, the issue of low pay and the transfer from wages to capital which has essentially taken place during the past 25 years is really a matter of economic urgency for our economy and the global economy, not to mention for the people who are really struggling.  Some 19% of those working are living in poverty, which is an extraordinary situation.  Stephen Kinsella said yesterday that this is a Marxist argument but Marx was right; he actually said that.  I was amazed by that comment.  Constantin Gurdgiev did not quite agree with him all the way but he nodded to indicate that there was a very significant element of truth in it.<\/p><p>For various reasons we have to shift the narrative on the question of fair remuneration, a living wage and a decent income for working people.  Otherwise, the crisis our economy has just gone through will recur and on the current trajectory, it is increasingly likely that will happen.  We have to address this and one way to do that is to say that decent remuneration is a human right to counter the relentless narrative about competitiveness, which becomes the justification for attacking pay and conditions for workers.  That sounds good on the face of it but when we examine it closely, it is a disaster for the economy when it is viewed in its entirety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900038#LL00600","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436449200,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I thank the contributors for the remarks they made.  They are making a strong case for the establishment of an institutional framework like the Low Pay Commission and for the collective bargaining legislation I am introducing, the re-establishment of REAs and sectoral employment orders and the work I intend to carry out on zero-hour and low-hour contracts.  We are all at one on that.  We may differ in terms of how we might approach it, but the best way to tackle incidents of low pay is to do it in a strategic, sustained and structured way and try to change our institutions to ensure they are hard wired to constantly seek to address the issues that concern us all and those who spoke on this particular amendment.<\/p>  <p>  Section 4 sets out clear objectives for a national minimum wage, which are designed to assist as many low-paid workers as is reasonably practicable, set at a rate that is both fair and sustainable and, where adjustment is appropriate, is adjusted incrementally and over time is progressively increased without creating any significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  I have stated previously in the House, and I have no hesitation in stating again, that I want to see the national minimum wage progressively increased where the economic circumstances and the demands of job creation, social conditions and other requirements converge.

I speak in support of all the relevant amendments but in particular amendment No. 7 tabled by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n on broadening the remit of this commission and, in particular, inserting in the Bill, which we have also done with one of our amendments, the question of a living wage because this should not be just about establishing a bottom floor in terms of a minimum wage but a wage on which people can live.  People have a right to live and should have wages to reflect the cost of living.  A good deal of research was done by the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, and others to emerge with the living wage which, for a single adult, in the best case scenario, was about &euro;11 an hour when it was originally proposed some years ago.  They have done new work in recent months which has increased the living wage to &euro;11.50 an hour.  That does not take into account people who have children.  We have to have an aim of establishing that people achieve the living wage and it should be an aim of the Low Pay Commission to do that as opposed to solely dealing with the question of the minimum wage.<\/p><p>Our amendment No. 18 is a call on the Government to face up to the reality of bogus self-employment practices.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>recently headlined on the issue but, interestingly, did not mention the construction industry.  The very bidding process for State construction contracts feeds into a situation where so-called self-employed people end up earning less than the minimum wage, for example, in Rhatigan's, where the workers were on &euro;5 an hour.  When the big construction companies enter bids they make claims that they can lay X number of blocks for Y amount of euro but when we take into account the physical limitations in terms of the number of blocks that can be laid per hour, it can be seen that not only are the REA rates not being observed but the minimum wage rates are not being observed either.  It is essential that is inserted in this Bill.<\/p><p>We are also in favour of something the Minister of State has spoken about previously, namely, other legislation to deal with that, but our amendments are before the House and we believe they should be accepted as an indication that we will take this issue seriously.<\/p><p>Those who are meant to be taking it seriously, namely, Revenue, are not and as such it is losing out on massive amounts of money.

There is no acknowledgement of the serious level of wholesale tax fraud that is going on in this area.  The State is not interested in dealing with it.  There is an interesting parallel between current events in Greece and the attitude of our State to the issue of bogus self-employment, which is rampant in the construction sector here.  There has been much talk about the biggest problem for Greece being that the Greek people do not want to pay taxes.  In comparison with Greece, Ireland is a legally compliant State where people play by the rules and the State is very serious about going after people who play fast and loose with the tax system.  Public sector and PAYE workers in Greece pay their taxes in the same way as people in Ireland.  It is taken out of their pockets.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as there is a problem with regard to tax in Greece, it revolves around the self-employed sector.  It is true that there is a large self-employed sector in Greece and that there has been an expansion of that sector in Ireland.  This is a sector which Fine Gael in particular would like to see expand even further.  Self-employment in the construction sector has expanded significantly from what it was in the good old days.  While previously workers in that sector would have been employed directly as PAYE workers, there has been an exponential expansion of self-employment in the sector and, with that, wholesale abuse and exploitation of that category of self-employed construction workers.  <\/p>  <p>  In regard to the amount of tax collected from the self-employed in the construction sector, as against that collected from PAYE workers in the sector, the numbers of which in each category are similar, while hundreds of millions are collected from the PAYE sector, a minus is often recorded in respect of those categorised as self-employed.  Even where an amount is collected, it is derisory.  Any cursory examination of the number of people who are supposed to be self-employed in the construction sector would indicate that not all of them could be, in reality, self-employed.  This sector has expanded massively and direct employment has reduced in tandem, the result of which has been a very significant loss to the Exchequer.  We hear constant and entirely credible, confirmed in many cases, examples of tax fraud and abuse and exploitation of the RTC-1 system.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear to me that the Minister for Finance and, in my view, Fine Gael, because it is ideologically committed to this whole notion, are not interested in dealing with this issue.  They choose to turn a blind eye to this because it enables the State to have public contract work such as school buildings construction done cheaply, even if it means workers are being exploited and the tax system is being abused.  In their view, they are promoting competition.  This abuse is taking place on a widespread basis.  While the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is not willing to address this issue, one would expect a Labour Minister to avail of any opportunity to address it and this legislation presents such an opportunity.   <\/p>  <p>  I was contacted again this morning by one of the Rhatigan's workers, for whom address of this issue is now a crusade.  Fair play to him because week-in, week-out he provides me with details of where this is going on.  I have not had time yet to have a proper discussion with him but he left a message on my phone this morning about another site where this is going on.  He said that contractors from the North have come up with a new scam, which has something to do with invoicing of the main contractor, to get around Scope or NERA on the issue of compliance in the context of self-employment.  This is rampant and the Minister of State knows it.  We need a specific mandate for the commission to address this issue in a serious way.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n made some important points on the wider issue of the minimum hourly rate.  This is of critical importance when it comes to the issue of accommodation.  The ability of people to access affordable accommodation is at crisis point.  While this is obviously a serious problem for the people, it will soon be a major problem for our economy if people cannot afford accommodation because their wages are so low.  The question of wages being sufficient to allow people to put a roof over their heads is critical.  This requires serious consideration.  It is untenable that some people are paying 50%, 60% and sometimes 70% of their income on keeping a roof over their heads.  It is shocking.  Various bodies across Europe recommend that people should not be paying more than a quarter or, at most, a third of their income for accommodation.  Otherwise, they will get into serious financial trouble.  People here are spending virtually all of their income on accommodation.  Sometimes even that is not enough to keep a roof over their heads.  The Low Pay Commission should, as part of its work, examine whether the level of pay here is adequate to ensure that people who are working can afford to pay for accommodation.  People should not have to fork out every penny they have to do that.  <\/p>  <p>  The proposed amendment is very good in that it points in this direction.  Even if the Minister of State will not accept it, the issue of affordability of accommodation and its relationship to wage levels must be the focus of this or any future Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900040#NN00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1436449800,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I subscribe to everything that Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Paul Murphy had to say in regard to amendment No. 7.

The points Deputy Boyd Barrett made are crucial to this debate.  Unless we begin to move in the direction of a living wage and focus on people's quality of life, we will continue to see exploitation in such areas as housing, where even people on reasonable wages are being crucified in terms of what they have to pay out.  Those on low pay, including people making only the national minimum wage, some of whom are on local authority housing lists, are struggling to meet the cost of lower-rent accommodation.<\/p> <p> We need to move beyond talking about low pay and minimum pay and instead focus on ensuring that people earn a liveable rate of pay.  I am sure the Minister of State would subscribe to that concept.  It is how one lifts people out of poverty while at the same providing stimulation to the economy.  If we pay people a liveable wage, they will have the means to spend more in the economy and have a better quality of life.  To that end, the remit of the Low Pay Commission should be expanded to allow it to make recommendations as to what a living wage should be.  It is not about whether people should or should not be on low pay - I expect the commission will say they should not be - or about setting a minimum wage.  The minimum wage is not working.  In fact, it is keeping thousands of people on or below the poverty line.  In a context in which the cost of living is beginning to increase again, particularly in respect of housing, it is clear that a national minimum wage is not the solution to poverty in the medium or long term.  I conclude by referring, as I did earlier, to the observation by the ambassador from Switzerland that paying people a reasonable wage is the way to take them out of poverty and stimulate the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900040#NN00300","speaker":"1094","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436450400,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I am pleased to point out to Deputy Boyd Barrett that wages are increasing across the economy, though not perhaps at a rate that would satisfy him and his colleagues.  After years of extreme difficulty in this country, that development illustrates how far we have come.  We have a way to go before we reach a point where everybody can share in the accelerating economic recovery.  There is no denying, however, that the evidence shows wages are rising across the bulk of our economic sectors.<\/p><p>Section 5 of the Bill sets out a comprehensive and challenging set of factors that the Low Pay Commission must take into account in any year in coming to a recommendation as to the appropriate rate for the national minimum wage.  Amendment No. 7 seeks to assign additional factors that the commission must take into account when recommending a minimum hourly rate of pay, including a requirement to reduce the incidence of low pay and support the phased introduction of a living wage.  I would have been happy to address the issues of overtime and Sunday premiums, as dealt with in amendments Nos. 6 and 8, but unfortunately those amendments were ruled out of order.<\/p><p>Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment No. 9 seeks to have the Low Pay Commission, in addition to its obligation to issue an annual recommendation on the national minimum hourly rate of pay, be  required to make an annual recommendation to the Minister on a living wage.  I have spoken in the past, both here and elsewhere, about my support for the concept of a living wage.  However, we need to differentiate between the application of a national statutory minimum wage and the living wage movement, which is a societal movement that would see employers volunteer to pay - indeed, be proud to pay - what is agreed to be a living wage.  I have looked very closely at the operation of the living wage concept in the United Kingdom and how it has evolved in recent years.  That initiative grew out of a very successful grassroots civil society campaign and draws its strength from the fact it has cross-society and cross-economy support.  Some 1,500 employers have signed up to and endorsed that approach.  As I said, it is a concept the T&aacute;naiste and I support.<\/p><p>There were interesting developments yesterday in the House of Commons when the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, made some compelling remarks on the living wage.  Whatever about the flaws in his overall approach, we should at least appreciate that efforts are finally being made in the neighbouring jurisdiction, limited as they might well prove to be, to tackle low pay.  What the Chancellor has done does indeed seem, on the face of it, like the political masterstroke some have described it as.  However, when one chisels away at it and looks under the bonnet, it is, like all tactical masterpieces, found wanting in many respects.  People have not reflected on the impact that cuts such as the withdrawal of tax credits will have on the working poor in the UK.  Those cuts seem to be a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for the more positive changes that are being introduced.<\/p><p>What Mr. Osborne has done, in effect, is set out on a journey towards an annual increase in the national minimum wage, which is what the Low Pay Commission in the UK would have been doing anyway.  In other words, he has really just rebranded the national minimum wage as a living wage and has, in fact, put a ceiling on that payment of &pound;9 up to 2020.  I am not prepared to impose any such restriction on the thinking of the Low Pay Commission in Ireland.  It is a flawed approach to impose any such curtailment on an independent statutory body, but it is what is happening in the UK.  Nobody should be seeking to strangle an important civic society movement or trying to occupy that space.  As I said, Mr. Osborne's initiative amounts simply to a rebranding of the national minimum wage, but that is a discussion for another day and a matter for our colleagues across the water.  As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n noted, I have indicated my intention to host a forum on the living wage in the autumn, to which we will invite civil society organisations, trade unions and employers to discuss how a living wage might be applied in this country.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 10, from Deputy Calleary, would require the Low Pay Commission each year to research and recommend to the Minister national minimum rates of pay for youth and apprentice categories, and to research and recommend to the Minister national minimum rates of pay for female workers.  The sub-minimum rates provided for since 2000 under the National Minimum Wage Act were originally recommended by the National Minimum Wage Commission, which was appointed to advise on the introduction of a national minimum wage.  The commission recommended that employees under the age of 18 be entitled to 70% of the national minimum wage, with a view to striking a balance between ensuring young employees were not exploited and ensuring that the rate of pay applicable to them would not encourage students to leave full-time education.  The National Minimum Wage Commission also recommended that sub-minimum rates apply to employees in the first two years of employment over age 18 and to those undergoing structured training.  The commission was of the view that employers should be encouraged to focus on training and that the structure of the national minimum wage should provide encouragement and inducement for employers to take on unskilled staff and involve them in training.  The rationale underpinning these provisions is that, all else being equal, an experienced employee is of more value and more productive than a new entrant or trainee.  It is equally important that those seeking employment are not prevented from having an opportunity to enter work because of their lack of experience or training.<\/p><p>Apprentices have been excluded from the scope of the national minimum wage provisions since their introduction in 2000.  The reason for this is that there had been a separate long-standing statutory wage-setting mechanism covering apprentices, namely, registered employment agreements.  While the REA system was struck down in 2013 by the Supreme Court, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015, which has been passed by this House, will provide, <i>inter alia<\/i>, for the possibility for sectoral employment orders covering statutory pay and pension provisions for workers in particular sectors, including provisions for apprenticeship rates.  These are important issues which may be appropriate for the Low Pay Commission to examine in the context of a future work programme.  However, I do not propose to include them as part of the commission's ongoing annual recommendations.<\/p><p>On the question of requiring the commission to recommend national minimum rates of pay for female workers, the Deputy is aware that the commission may be asked to look at a range of related matters in the context of the minimum wage.  The prevalence of female workers on or near the national minimum wage is well known and it is in this context that I see the Deputy's concerns better addressed.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>In any event, setting a minimum wage based on a person's gender would probably be in breach of equality legislation.<br\/><br\/>On amendment No. 11, I indicated on Committee Stage that I would bring forward an amendment to section 5 on Report Stage to amend the date on which the committee must submit its recommendations and report to the Minister.  As the Bill is currently drafted, the date specified is 15 July of the year to which the examination relates.  I propose to change this to the third Tuesday of July of the year to which the examination relates.  <br\/><br\/>It had been my intention to bring this Bill back to the Seanad on 9 July following the completion of Report and Final Stages on 6 July, but I have been informed that this will not be possible for logistical printing reasons.  Instead, it is now my intention to return to the Seanad on 13 July, with the intention of having the legislation finalised at that point.  This presents some difficulties in terms of having the Bill on the Statute Book on or before 15 July.  Accordingly, I have decided to move the reporting period back by four working days.  The amendment also has the advantage of removing a specific date from the Bill and providing for a day that will fit the Government's schedule and with the general calendar of Government meetings.  I wish to stress that this change to the reporting period is not associated in any way with the work of the commission, which I understand is making very good progress.  The minor change is purely for logistical reasons.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 12 to 18, inclusive, provide for the addition of a range of factors to the already extensive list the commission is required to take into account when making a recommendation.  I and my Government colleagues have given very serious consideration to the criteria set out in the Bill.  Many of them have stood the test of time and are incorporated into national minimum wage legislation going back to 2000.  They provide a balanced suite of issues and factors for the commissioner to consider.  To add a further wide-ranging list of factors to be taken into account, as set out in these amendments, would make it virtually impossible for the commission to undertake the level of analysis required, and it would be very difficult to produce an agreed recommendation, or any recommendation at all, by a set date on an annual basis.<br\/><br\/>Some of the additional factors, such as issues surrounding decent work, are part of a wider decent work agenda that I am pursuing, with the introduction of sectoral employment orders and registered employment agreements and the work we are doing on zero- and low-hour contracts, or that already exists in the context of the Bills I mentioned, including the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015.  Previous references to changes in earnings have served us well and I do not consider it necessary to refer specifically to median earnings changes or proportions above or below particular proportions of median earnings.  Specific expertise is available to the commission to properly interpret changes in earnings data.<br\/><br\/>Another amendment refers to Northern Ireland.  Comparisons with it or other jurisdictions that have national minimum wages must involve the absolute values while also having regard to purchasing power parity.  The commission has sufficient expertise available to it to make these distinctions.  It would not be appropriate to specifically require the commission on an annual basis to analyse different welfare supports, health care provision, child care and social housing across different jurisdictions.  I agree that fair wages should never be sacrificed for the creation of jobs that are exploitative or unsustainable.  That is why section 4 of the Bill provides very clear objectives for the national minimum wage.  In this regard, the commission will be obliged to ensure that any recommendations it makes on the minimum wage rate will ensure it is a rate that is fair and sustainable.<br\/><br\/>On bogus self-employment, as referred to in amendment No. 17, I share the concerns expressed by Deputy Boyd Barrett and others.  This is an enforcement issue, rather than one that the Low Pay Commission should be required to take into account.  Deputies will be aware that NERA inspectors carry out inspections of employers&rsquo; employment records and workplaces to determine compliance with employment law and employees' statutory entitlements.  In 2014, NERA carried out more than 5,500 such inspections.  The policy of NERA is to seek voluntary compliance where breaches of employment law are detected, and it works with employers and allows them every reasonable opportunity to rectify breaches.  Allegations of non-compliance with employment rights legislation should be referred to NERA, which investigates matters that are brought to its attention.  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned complaints he has received about alleged bogus self-employment, and I encourage him to report them to the relevant authorities.  If he wishes, he can pass them on to me and I will address them on his behalf.<br\/><br\/>It is not within the remit of NERA to make determinations regarding the employment status of individuals <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>employment or self-employment; that is the responsibility of the scope section of the Department of Social Protection.  The Revenue Commissioners also have a role to play.  Where either of these bodies makes a determination on these issues, NERA, in accordance with the code of practice for determining the employment or self-employment status of individuals, will generally accept their decisions on the issue.  Finally, the matter can also be determined by the courts.  Whether any given situation is an abuse of the subcontracting or relevant contracts tax, RCT, systems is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.<br\/><br\/>On the promotion of gender equality, it is important to note that the national minimum wage applies to all workers irrespective of gender.  As such, it is the epitome of a measure that eliminates gender inequality in its application.  However, as minimum wage workers tend to be predominantly female, by its very nature, a national minimum wage is more beneficial to female workers.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 7, 9 and 10 and 12 to 18, inclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900041#OO00200","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436451000,"counter":648,"content":"<p>If I need more time, I hope the Acting Chairman will give me some, because I took his initial direction that we were only speaking on amendment No. 7.  I will not speak for too long.<\/p>  <p>  Most of my amendments are to do with the necessity for a living wage.  The Government has a major opportunity to deal with this, an opportunity that it may not have again.  That means we should grasp this opportunity with both hands.  Work is currently being undertaken on an independent basis by the Living Wage Technical Group, which is a group of progressive organisations.  We believe the Low Pay Commission needs to undertake similar work.  To do that, it needs to broaden the remit of issues to take into consideration.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 14 refers to economic inequality.  Nowhere in the Bill is the commission instructed to consider poverty when making recommendations to the Minister.  It is difficult to believe that we could have such a debate without the crisis of poverty being hardwired into the Bill.  The Bill is too heavily weighted towards a limited number of economic measurements and is not helpful in tackling economic inequality or rebuilding the economy.  <\/p>  <p>  Others have mentioned that the percentage share of the national income comprising wages has crashed.  I understand there has been a fall of 20% in the past 20 years, which is in line with other European countries, but it is still a significant shift in how an economy works.  In other words, an economy is not working for the people who are working in it any longer.  Some 50% of all women in the State earn less than &euro;20,000, which is a shocking figure for this generation.  It seems completely unreasonable that the issue of income inequality between men and women is not hardwired into the Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said the minimum wage was blind to gender and therefore everybody would be treated the same.  However, we know everybody is not treated the same, and one's gender determines one's income, to a certain extent, under a minimum wage.  Unless the infrastructure of the minimum wage is changed or how we deal with low pay is changed in a way that takes gender inequality into consideration with regard to wages, we will not fix the issue.  <\/p>  <p>  I refer to amendment No. 18.  The construction industry in this country is in crisis with regard to how it operates.  Decent construction work should involve direct employment, with people receiving a wage, sick pay, holiday pay and the entitlements that citizens should expect.  Recruitment companies in this country are advertising for people on the RCT system to do work that is normally done by those paid a direct wage.  They tell companies they do not owe the workers any entitlements - holidays, pensions or anything else.<\/p><p>These companies operate in the chasm the Government has left in company and contract law.  They are making fun of the Government with regard to commitments.  I know of people who worked on the Kishoge site who were told by their employer they were now self-employed and gave them their wages.  They thought the money was for one individual, but the employer told them it was for all five people in the room.  This is what is happening under the chaos of the Government's relevant contracts tax legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900042#PP00200","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436451600,"counter":650,"content":"<p>It was interesting that the Minister of State suggested David Cameron was playing a bit of a game, by committing to a living wage but taking it away with the other hand through tax credits.

I am very glad to say a motion was passed at the ICTU conference, against some resistance it has to be said by the unions generally associated with the Labour Party, but nonetheless the majority of unions, headed up by the right to water trade unions, stating that ICTU should oppose water charges because they are another regressive tax which reduce the real income of workers and therefore it is an issue for the trade union movement.  They are absolutely right.  I am sure it was for political reasons that certain trade unions with a strong association with the Labour Party opposed the motion.

With regard to amendment No. 10, the Minister of State mentioned that apprentices are subject to registered employment agreements, but the Low Pay Commission should be in a position to set a consistency about certain conditions for every apprentice.  It should be the overarching body which sets the guidelines for various types of apprentices.  As other Deputies have said, women are particularly affected by low pay issues.  A total of 90% of those affected by the Dunnes Stores situation are women.  This is the case throughout the service and retail sectors.  The amendment does not intend to introduce different rates and the Minister of State acknowledged this.  The Low Pay Commission should be the body which, from its inception and foundation, has enough ambition and manpower to be the overarching body for low pay in all areas.  Rather than having a silo approach whereby various people have various areas of responsibility, we should give this body the teeth and resources from the start to tackle all of the issues, not only pay but, as other Deputies have said, accommodation, child care and all of the expenses which affect the value of pay.

Indeed, it has slipped backwards.  Given the facts that low wages are entrenched in the economy and we need a system to ensure that the minimum wage is a decent living wage, it is important that we use the Low Pay Commission in an effort to keep an eye on poverty, low wages and the minimum wage.  Britain, which has more experience with a minimum wage and low pay commission than we do, is coming to the view that its commission needs a watchdog role.  This view was echoed by the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI.  In its submission to the jobs committee, it called for our commission's remit to be expanded to include a watchdog role and for powers to be granted to it to set targets for reducing low pay across a number of areas.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, IMPACT launched a report, entitled \"JobBridge - Time to Start Again?\", in which it sought for the JobBridge scheme to be scrapped and for the Low Pay Commission to be tasked with examining the prevalence of open market, unpaid internships.  The report, spearheaded by Dr. Mary Murphy of Maynooth University, recommended that the commission report on the key patterns of paid and unpaid open market internships.  Some 80,000 people are in job activation schemes, many of which do not offer those individuals the economic value of their work.  People are being exploited, are not receiving extra training, have no opportunity to progress in their roles and are receiving low pay.<\/p>  <p>  These two suggestions are innovative uses of the Low Pay Commission.  They would benefit society and empower the commission to eradicate poverty.  It is also noteworthy that the British are considering developing their Low Pay Commission further whereas we are seeking to replicate its original version.  They are designing an iPad while we are designing the calculator.  We need to ensure that we are ahead of the curve in developing mechanisms that eradicate low pay.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State should not use this debate to say \"No\" to every amendment.  Instead, the Government should listen to Opposition parties' positive proposals, not be partisan, focus on those proposals that would be of material benefit to individuals' pay packets and ability to look after their families and take some of these amendments on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900047#UU00500","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1436453100,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I support Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment.  We need a watchdog in respect of employment, low pay and exploitation.  We have some watchdogs, for example, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, but they are underfunded.<\/p><p>I wish to speak in support of subsection (6) of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment on the role of internships and the need for more research into same.  Having done an amount of work in this regard, particularly through the campaigning website, <i>ScamBridge.ie<\/i>, it is my strong belief that internships, facilitated by the State via JobBridge, First Steps and Gateway in terms of councils, T&uacute;s and so on, are consciously used by many employers to take advantage of free labour.  This is widespread and has an impact across employment, in that employers can effectively tell or imply to employees that, if they seek wage increases or so on, the employer can bring in someone for free to do that work and therefore question why they would grant any wage increase.  Rather than dealing with the issue of unemployment, internships can make it worse, because they depress wages generally in the economy and normalise the idea of people working for free.  This is not just an Irish phenomenon, but an international one.  We should stand against it.  Researching the key patterns in paid and unpaid open market internships would assist us in knowing what is happening and outlawing those internship programmes that are exploitative, which ours are.<\/p><p>Turning to amendments Nos. 20 and 21 from the Anti-Austerity Alliance, we must be sensitive and responsive to changes in the cost of living, particularly as regards the low paid.  The commission making recommendations every three years is not adequate.  A better approach would be yearly.  It would be even more preferable were minimum wage rates indexed to inflation so that, if there was inflation, low paid and minimum wage workers would not automatically lose out.<\/p><p>Regarding amendment No. 21 specifically, three months is too long a lapse between recommendations emanating from the commission and their being acted upon by the Minister in the context of cost-of-living increases and higher inflation rates.  Such a time lapse would be used by employer organisations to apply pressure on the media and build opposition to increases in the minimum wage.  It should be shortened to one month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900047#UU00600","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1436453100,"counter":715,"content":"<p>At 21.8% or 22%, low pay is entrenched in Ireland's economy.

If low pay is so entrenched in our society as to make us only second to the US, we must have some way of monitoring how people are treated after we pass this legislation.  If we do not monitor something, how will we know whether it is working?

What is the point of the commission if it just finishes after it makes its recommendations without being able to monitor what happens to workers in Ireland over the next five or six years?  How are we going to know how people are being treated?  We have already heard examples today of people not even getting the minimum wage.  The Minister of State and I know there are examples of people not getting it.  I wanted to speak earlier on amendment No. 10, but I did not get an opportunity to do so.  As I said earlier, it is unacceptable that people under the age of 18 are on a 70% rate because it opens the door to exploitation.  I think the recommendation in this amendment that some way should be found to monitor this matter is a reasonable one.  The commission is the group to do that.  We should not be leaving it to organisations in Europe like the human rights committee to talk about the breach of human rights that is the denial to people of the right to earn a minimum or living wage.  We have to find some way for this commission to monitor this.  I suggest we should instruct it to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900047#UU00700","speaker":"1094","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436453700,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I would like to add my support to these amendments.  The expression about lies, damned lies and statistics is certainly a relevant idea when we are talking about low pay.  We can bandy around statistics, as the Minister of State did earlier when he said that pay levels are increasing.  We can debate whether the JobBridge and Gateway schemes are licences for exploitation or, as I suspect the Government would argue when cases of abuse are highlighted, otherwise good programmes that are being abused in a small number of rogue instances.  Similarly, there is an urgent need for rigorous monitoring and enforcement levels to end the abuses associated with bogus self-employment.  We can debate things at theoretical, legislative and statistical levels, but the devil is always in the detail of the individual real cases.  That is how we discover what is really happening and what needs to be addressed, tightened up and changed.  If the Low Pay Commission is to become an active force in addressing the scourge of low pay, the abuse of schemes like JobBridge and the question of bogus self-employment, it must be given a real, tangible and concrete watchdog role.  I have nothing to add to Deputy Paul Murphy's points.  I agree that we need something that is responsive to the changes in the cost of living, etc.  As such changes often happen over relatively short periods of time, we need to be able to review these matters on a more frequent basis.

Section 5 of the Bill introduces a new section 10(C)(4), which provides that the commission may be asked by the Minister to examine and report on matters relating generally to the functions of the commission under the Act.  The Bill provides that such a request shall be made not later than the first two months of each year, apart from this year, and will be part of the commission&rsquo;s work programme.  I believe the legislative provision covering the work programme to be given to the commission each year should not be prescriptive and inflexible.  Amendment No. 19 would tie the hands of the commission with regard to its annual work programme.  A request can be made to the commission to examine and report on specific issues related to the work of the commission.  While the specific topics raised in the amendment may well be worthy of examination by the commission at some point, I do not believe it is appropriate to set them down in legislation.<\/p>  <p>  On amendment No. 20, section 5(5) of the Bill provides that every three years, the commission will report generally on the operation of this Act and, in particular, on the impact of any orders made under it on low pay, income distribution and employment costs.  Amendment No. 20 would impose a requirement on the commission to produce such a report every year.  I believe that would be quite impractical.  We do not want the commission to spend all its time analysing itself and its own work.  The intention behind the requirement for the commission to submit an analysis every three years of the operation of the Act and, in particular, on the impact of orders made on foot of its recommendations is to allow time for the full impact of the orders to be properly assessed.  Inevitably, it take some time for the full effects of such orders to feed through and for worthwhile and reliable evidence to be analysed.  In my view, to require the commission to carry out such indepth analysis of the impact of its recommendation regarding the national minimum rate on an annual basis would not be a good use of the limited resources available to it.   In addition to the submission of an annual recommendation on the national minimum hourly rate of pay, the commission may be asked to examine and report on matters relating generally to its functions under the Act.  We went into that in some detail earlier.  The reports that the commission will make, in addition to the report it submits to the Minister accompanying its annual recommendation on the national minimum wage, will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  On amendment No. 21, I agreed on Report Stage in the Seanad to introduce an amendment to provide that the Minister shall cause a copy of any report or recommendation submitted by the commission to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas not later than three months after the receipt of that report or recommendation.  Amendment No. 21 would provide that the reports should be submitted within one month of their receipt.  Section 6 of the Bill provides that the Minister is required to make a decision on a recommendation of the Low Pay Commission within three months of receiving it.  I would not consider it appropriate to require the Minister to lay the report before the Oireachtas while consideration of the issue is still ongoing.  Of course Deputies and Senators will have an opportunity to debate the reports as they are tabled and scheduled for debate in the Houses.  That is correctly the case.  Accordingly, I cannot accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900048#VV00300","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"vote","time":1436454300,"counter":719,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 29; N\u00edl, 47.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn and Sandra McLellan; N\u00edl, Deputies Paul Kehoe and Emmet Stagg.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900049#WW00100","aye":["1066","1199","1003","1190","1071","1193","1083","1195","1101","1022","1198","1182","1100","1094","998","1017","981","992","1183","1197","969","1044","1005","1001","970","1102","1080","1065","956"],"nay":["946","1079","989","1029","1042","975","1092","1031","972","1093","1099","994","1091","1046","968","1011","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","951","1051","1106","1097","1033","1098","1021","1110","1053","1180","977","1004","1070","985","1067","1056","1058","1073","971","964","947","961","1010","948","950","1024"]},{"type":"speech","time":1436454600,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 20:<blockquote>In page 5, line 26, to delete &quot;23 years&quot; and substitute &quot;year&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900050#XX00100","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436454600,"counter":721,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1436454600,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 21:<blockquote>In page 5, line 35, to delete &quot;3 months&quot; and substitute &quot;1 month&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900050#XX00300","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436454600,"counter":723,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1436454600,"counter":724,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 22 is out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900050#XX00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436454600,"counter":725,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 22 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1436454600,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900050#XX00700","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1436454600,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 23:<blockquote>In page 6, line 10, to delete &quot;3 months&quot; and substitute &quot;1 month&quot;.<\/blockquote>I do not propose to rehash the arguments made in the earlier discussion on related amendments.

Amendment No. 25 provides for a prohibition or restriction on charges or deductions from the national minimum hourly rate of pay.  The Payment of Wages Act already provides a redress mechanism for unlawful deductions from wages.  Section 5(1) of that Act allows an employer to make deductions required or authorised by law, such as PAYE or PRSI, or required or authorised by a term of the employee's contract, such as occupational pensions schemes, or any deduction agreed to in writing in advance by the employee - for example, trade union subscriptions or VHI premiums.  Section 5(2) of the Act places significant restrictions on employers with regard to deductions or the receipt of payments from wages of employees.<\/p>  <p>  As regards fair hours of employment rules, the Organisation of Working Time Act regulates working hours.  In this context, Deputies will be aware that I have commissioned a study on zero-hour and low-hour contracts by the University of Limerick and I expect the study to be completed in the third quarter of this year.  Where the evidence points to some adjustment being required to the protections in place under employment law, these will be brought forward for consideration by the Government.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 25. <\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 26 seeks to ensure that businesses will be allowed sufficient time to plan for any adjustment proposed in the national minimum wage.  I am supportive of the view that any increase in the minimum wage must be done in an orderly way in order that companies can plan their business.  I remind Deputies that the ESRI, in its 2006 analysis of the most recent Labour Court recommendation proposing an increase to the national minimum wage, concluded that adjusting the minimum wage by a substantial amount on an irregular basis, with lengthy gaps between increases, as occurred in the past, is more likely to have a detrimental impact on employment and to contribute to uncertainty for employers and actual and potential employees than regular, smaller and fairly predictable increases.<\/p>  <p>  A significant benefit of the establishment of the Low Pay Commission is that the national minimum wage rates will be assessed annually and, therefore, when they occur, any adjustments will be incremental and less disruptive for business than the previous step changes which were criticised by the ESRI in its 2006 analysis.  The deadline of 15 July 2015 for submission of the Low Pay Commission's recommendation was specifically to allow time for consideration of the issue in the context of the year's budgetary considerations and to provide for any adjustment in a planned way.  Consequently, this very structure achieves the objective the Senator seeks in his amendment.<\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission will also ensure that any advice or recommendations it makes to the Government is evidence-based by utilising agreed data, carrying out research and consultations with employers, workers and their representatives and taking written and oral evidence from a wide range of organisations.  This is to ensure that any suggested changes to the national minimum wage will have a minimum adverse impact on employment and competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  The commission will consult workers and employers who are directly affected by the national minimum wage, as it has been doing, to get a handle on the real experience of businesses and employees in sectors associated with low pay.  While I recognise the intent behind the proposal, I cannot accept the amendment, as I do not consider it necessary given the new structures and processes that are being put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900050#XX01600","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436454600,"counter":736,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1436454600,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 26:<blockquote>In page 6, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:&quot;(5) Where the Minister declares an order for any increase to the national minimum wage, a sufficient lead in period should be made available for this new rate to be met in a planned way.&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900050#XX01800","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1436454600,"counter":738,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1436454600,"counter":739,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 27:<blockquote>In page 6, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:<b>&quot;Complaints and protection against victimisation<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>7. <\/b>An employer shall not penalise or threaten against a worker, or cause or permit any other person to penalise or threaten penalisation against a worker for having made statement to the Low Pay Commission or for giving evidence on their own experience through their representative organisation.&quot;.<\/blockquote>The amendment does what it says it does.  <\/p><p>It seeks to provide that an employer shall not penalise or threaten a worker or cause or permit any other person to penalise or threaten penalisation against a worker for having made a statement to the Low Pay Commission.

I recognise and respect the Deputy's intention in terms of tabling the amendment, but there is already a number of protections in place for workers who consider that they have been the subject of victimisation in the workplace.  As matters stand, any worker who finds himself or herself the subject of victimisation for making a statement to the Low Pay Commission or giving evidence via his or her trade union already has the possibility to take a case under the Industrial Relations Acts.  In addition, the 2004 code of practice on victimisation provides that where there is a dispute in an employment where collective bargaining fails to take place and where negotiating arrangements are not in place, no person should be victimised or suffer disadvantage as a consequence of their legitimate actions or affiliation arising from that dispute.  A procedure for addressing complaints of victimisation is set out in the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.

I am speaking very slowly for the Minister's sake.  The main thrust of the amendment, with its focus on the appointment of a Secretary General and the assignment, rather than the appointment, of Clerk positions, is to ensure that the Houses of the Oireachtas Service will be, from the top down, a flexible, modern organisation which can adapt to the demands of providing support services to Parliament in the 21st century.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment proposes to insert two new sections to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Acts, not the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959, which is a good indication of the modernising thrust of these amendments.  The first one provides for the appointment of a Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.  The second, which deals with assignments, would ensure that the current mandatory link between the Secretary General and Clerk of the D&aacute;il could be broken and put on a more flexible, optional basis depending on need, as decided on by the Ceann Comhairle of the day.  It removes the risk of a twin-track promotion whereby the posts of Clerk of the Seanad and Clerk Assistant are without competition and in the gift of the Chairman of each House.<\/p>  <p>  My amendment, by focusing on the recruitment of a Secretary General, would ensure that any competition would be open and would be likely to attract a broader field of candidates than if the Clerk of the D&aacute;il functions are portrayed prominently, which could deter talented individuals from applying.<\/p><p>My amendment, by providing that the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, would place not more than three successful candidates in order of preference, ensures that there is no dual role for the Ceann Comhairle of the day in both the nomination and the appointment process.  On that point, the Minister stated on Committee Stage that the dual role proposed for the Ceann Comhairle is the same as that of the Minister when a Secretary General in the Department is appointed.  The Minister stated that if a Minister goes with three names selected by TLAC to the Cabinet which appoints, this arrangement means &quot;... there is some flexibility for the Minister to make a discernment&quot;.  This is quite a revelation and means that despite a recruitment process by TLAC, whose personnel the Minister assures us is now predominantly private sector, ultimately it is the political officeholder who has significant if not crucial influence in the final call on the appointment.  This risks putting the working relationship of the senior Civil Service and Government Ministers or officeholder in Leinster House on an uneven footing.  Ambitious senior civil servants know who the boss is and if they are good enough to be qualified by TLAC, then all things being equal the Minister could give him or her the nod.<br\/><br\/>I have campaigned for a long time against the politicisation of the appointments of senior garda&iacute; and judges.  I had two Bills debated here to try to put a more transparent and independent appointment process in place, but I did not realise that TLAC, as we are now told, is subject to a Minister's discernment as well.  Ministers are ultimately in the driving seat and the senior civil servants know that, and undoubtedly adapt accordingly.  It would not be human to do otherwise.  However, what kind of culture is created and does it serve the country's interest, or the agenda of the Government of the day which - let us not be naive - may not always coincide?  Now we can understand former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, when he said at the banking inquiry last week that no official came to him when he was Minister for Finance pointing out the risks of an economic meltdown.  Thus, the Minister should adopt the principle under amendment allowing the professional independent body, TLAC, to place candidates in order of preference and, for the good of the country, do away with the indulgence of having a Minister's discernment in all top appointments.<br\/><br\/>To afford the Ceann Comhairle of the day the same level of discernment here in such a relatively small pool would be disproportionate, unhealthy and unwise.  The Minister's predecessor, Dr. Ryan, when bringing the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Bill 1959 through this House on 11 November 1959 thought it unwise that a Ceann Comhairle should have the power to appoint when he stated:<blockquote>It may happen that the Ceann Comhairle at some future time may be influenced in his judgment by having worked so long with a certain man [sic] [I am quoting] or something like that.  We are rather fortunate discussing this question now because it is not likely that any of those appointments will be made in our time.  We have young men [there was no room for anything broader in 1959, apparently] in the positions and we can, therefore, discuss the matter disinterestedly.  That is what I am afraid might happen - that some Ceann Comhairle in the future would be unduly prejudiced in favour of a certain person and that, in spite of consultation and so on, he would go back to that appointment.<\/blockquote>Clearly, allowing the Ceann Comhairle the type of discernment the Minister wants him to have would not have occurred in 1959.  My amendment would ensure that those standards, thought wise then, will be maintained now.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the third part of my amendment, having assignments rather than appointments to allow for full integration and flexibility, which is a mantra for this Minister for every public body but, strangely, not in Leinster House, speaks for itself and will allow for the mandatory link between the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and the chief executive officer to be placed on a more flexible footing based on need, but also ensures there will not be a twin track for promotion for officials here, and the level playing pitch will apply to all as appointment to Clerk and Clerk Assistant positions in the gift of the Chairman of each House will not arise as no promotions would be involved, just assignments.<br\/><br\/>My amendment also provides for a new competition to take place if there is not agreement on any of the candidates nominated by TLAC.  Even the 1959 Act nomination process provided for disagreement and the fact that it is omitted in this Bill is a sign of just how <i>una voce<\/i>is the appointment process.  The Ceann Comhairle of the day is in the driving seat and it is not anticipated that he is likely to disagree with himself.<br\/><br\/>I am worried that the Minister is trying to straddle a 1959 model of management of Clerks with modern requirements for a 21st century parliamentary administration.  My amendment will get him off the hook and, in accepting it, he will be doing the State some service and ensure the Oireachtas service is fit for purpose to provide Members of this House with the services needed in the 21st century.<br\/><br\/>In the event that the Minister will not accept my amendment No. 1 I have tabled an alternative proposal in Nos. 2, 7, 8 and 9, which I will briefly address because they are grouped.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 2 is the main one which contains two main proposals, first, that the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will be appointed by the Ceann Comhairle following a resolution passed by the D&aacute;il.  There is a number of reasons for proposing that the D&aacute;il would approve the appointment.  The first is that the Minister said, when replying to the Second Stage debate, that there was no alternative for having the Ceann Comhairle having a role both in the nomination and appointment of the Clerk given the Taoiseach no longer wanted to have such a role.  Having the D&aacute;il do so provides a solution.  The second is that having the D&aacute;il approve the appointment is more inclusive for a position that must serve all Members of the House and mitigates against any hint or perception that the Government parties had an undue influence in the appointment given their overwhelming majority on the commission.  Third, having the D&aacute;il approve the appointment is justified as there is a number of examples where the D&aacute;il approves a person for appointment to high public office, such as the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Ombudsman, and where the President appoints, and they are equal in rank in terms of pay etc. as that with the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  Moreover, there are many examples of countries where the parliament approves the appointment of the Secretary General.  The amendment is not proposing that the D&aacute;il should appoint the Clerk-Secretary General which happens, for example, in the United States and Sweden, but rather the House approves the nomination from the commission for appointment by the Ceann Comhairle, as happens in Germany and the Netherlands.<br\/><br\/>Fourth, having the D&aacute;il approve the appointment would be seen to be more transparent and accountable and raises the profile of the D&aacute;il itself in a positive way.  It retains the open competition by TLAC as proposed in the Bill already but reduces the formal statutory role of nomination from the Ceann Comhairle to that of the commission, which would recommend a candidate to the D&aacute;il for nomination for appointment by the Ceann Comhairle.  The first stage of the process would be that TLAC would recommend not more than three candidates to the commission, which would be obliged to consult with parties or groups not represented on the commission to meet that point made during Second Stage.  The amendment also allows for a rematch of the competition in the event of a disagreement.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 provide for a confined competition among serving staff for the positions of Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il and Clerk and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad to ensure there is transparency in these senior appointments and that there is a level playing pitch across the board for all promotions inside Leinster House.  As it stands, the Bill could allow for a dual system with the Clerk and Clerk Assistant positions being filled by the gift of the Chairman of either House or all others by the standard Civil Service completion process.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 9 is a consequential amendment to amendment No. 2 and while retaining the open competition by TLAC for the most senior position under the Bill, the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, it defines it as a confined competition for the appointment of other clerks, as in amendments Nos. 7 and 8.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900052#ZZ02100","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436456400,"counter":810,"content":"<p>I strongly welcome debate on this sort of legislation.  In truth we do not have enough proper debate in the House in terms of how the House itself should be structured.  I have said from the beginning that I do not believe this is a matter that should be determined by the Executive: it is a matter for the House.  One of the main thrusts of this legislation is for the Executive to withdraw, for example, the role of the Taoiseach in the nomination of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  It is being removed to make it exclusively a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  We had some debate on Second and Committee Stages on these matters and we need to go over some of the ground again.  Looking at Deputy Ross's first long amendment, the first two items of the section proposed by Deputy Ross would refer to the Secretary General of the Oireachtas service being the chief executive of the Oireachtas commission and being the officer accountable for the accounts of the commission for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts.  This is the position as currently exists under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Acts and will remain the position after the enactment of this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Ross is proposing to make a couple of changes and I will deal with those now.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>First, the Deputy suggests in his amendment that the Clerk of the D&aacute;il would be appointed by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission following consultation by the Chairman of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with leaders or designated leaders of groups of parties in either House of the Oireachtas who are not represented on the membership of the commission at that time.  Second, the Deputy proposes that the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, would nominate people for appointment in order of merit, to circumscribe the ability of the Chairman of the D&aacute;il - the Ceann Comhairle - to choose whom, among candidates that are deemed suitable for the position, he might nominate to the commission for appointment.  This would make the process beyond TLAC a rubber-stamping exercise.  Although the formal appointment would be made by the commission on the nomination of the Ceann Comhairle, if there was a preferred candidate, the Ceann Comhairle's options in making a proposal, and the commission's options in determining a proposal, would be simply to accept or reject the preferred candidate.  Obviously, that would be a very significant delimiting of the role of the Ceann Comhairle.  I am willing to discuss that but I think it would be the wrong approach, and I will make a number of points in that regard.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the Deputy's point about a process that involves consultation with others, which we debated at some length on Committee Stage, I believe that all parties should have some involvement in this matter.  My view is that this would be captured by their being represented on the commission, but that is not my business in terms of this legislation.  The vagueness of a consultation process is, as the Deputy will know in his heart, meaningless.  What does &quot;consultation&quot; mean?  If it means calling people into a room and asking for their view, that would not have any legislative impact.  It would simply mean that the matter went through a process.  I would prefer if the commission were more broadly structured, but, as I said, that is not a matter that falls to be determined in this legislation.  It is probably a matter that would properly be addressed at the beginning of the next D&aacute;il, which is not too long away.  I do not want to put into legislation a vagueness or inexactitude in terms of a process that requires a consultation that is fairly meaningless.  The amendment provides that leaders or designated leaders be consulted.  Are their views to have a meaning?  Are they to have an overruling view or is it simply that somebody - in this instance, the Ceann Comhairle - is to have a consultation with them?<br\/><br\/>This is a fairly simple measure.  As I have repeatedly said, it is a modest improvement, in my judgment, in the appointment system for the most senior administrator in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The objective is to open this up to open competition, with candidates from within and outside the public service invited to apply for the job, the criteria to be laid down in advance and TLAC to receive those applications, interview the candidates in its normal way and make its judgment.  It is not normal procedure for TLAC to prioritise.  As I have said previously, it provides a shortlist of suitable candidates.  There have been occasions when, of all candidates, only one was deemed suitable.  That would be a very short list.  In the main, two or three candidates are presented to a Minister for appointment to, say, the role of Secretary General.  <br\/><br\/>I know there is a purist view reflected in the Deputy's contributions to this House in terms of the role of any politician in doing anything.  I happen to believe that people are elected to do things.  Being elected gives one a mandate.  It is not the mark of Cain that makes one unsuitable to make judgments or, to use a phrase I used on Committee Stage, discernments.  The Deputy was critical of Ministers having a list of two or three candidates from which to choose, those candidates having been deemed suitable and appropriate by TLAC to serve in the office of Secretary General.  The Deputy thinks Ministers should not have any leeway and that it should be a <i>fait accompli <\/i>that TLAC would make that judgment.  Having had the privilege of leading three Departments, I do not agree with that.  A Minister comes into a Department with an agenda.  The most important aid in delivering the agenda that the Minister is elected to implement is the chief administrator of his Department, namely, the Secretary General.  There will be times when people are not compatible.  A Minister has to make a judgment in terms of compatibility.  Often Ministers do not have that choice because there is an extant Secretary General, but where there is to be a new Secretary General, I think it is appropriate that some choice, in terms of the person who is to serve in the post, be available to a Minister.  I know Deputy Ross disagrees with that, but I do not think it would be wrong.  In fact, I think it would be the right course of action for the same choices to be available to the Ceann Comhairle.  Currently, the Ceann Comhairle, with the Taoiseach, makes a choice from the pool of talent within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is too narrow a pool.  I believe there should be a much broader pool of talent available.  This should include anybody who is interested in the job.  Judgment in regard to whether a candidate is suitable for appointment to this important job should be made based on the information contained in his or her curriculum vitae, his or her experience and the skill set he or she may bring to the job.  For those reasons, I do not accept the views expressed by Deputy Ross.<br\/><br\/>On the Deputy's point regarding a vote of the D&aacute;il on the matter, I have examined what happens in other jurisdictions.  In some jurisdictions Parliament votes on such matters.  In my opinion, this politicises the position of chief administrator.  I think it should be a professional appointment.  The D&aacute;il does not vote on the appointment of Secretaries General of Departments.  In the American system, many appointments, including to the position of ambassador, are voted on by the Senate.  That is its tradition.  I do not think it is a particularly good tradition.  I think that the independence of our Civil Service has been one of the great strengths of our Republic over its almost 100 years of existence.  I do not believe that voting in the D&aacute;il on a nomination will enhance that independence or that status.  I think it would diminish it somewhat.  That is my personal view on this matter.  I do not agree with the line taken by the Deputy in that regard.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the other amendments in the group, I do not have a completely fixed view in relation to the other officerships that are encompassed by this legislation.  I did ponder for a while on whether they should also be part of the TLAC process, but felt, on balance, that there needs to be flexibility within the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of such appointments and that the redeployment of less senior staff than the Clerk of the D&aacute;il should be done from within the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Ceann Comhairle in consultation with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  If appointment to the positions of Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad was by way of the TLAC process, this would tie people into fixed terms, with no flexibility thereafter for them to be redeployed to other areas to get different experience.  It would also lessen the uniqueness of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  Although I have argued that there should be an open competition for the position of Clerk of the D&aacute;il and chief executive of the commission, with the same person fulfilling both roles, I believe we need to preserve not only the status but the independence of each House.<\/p><p>That is why I want to give a role to the chairman of each House in determining staff appointments, subject to the formal decision-making role of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  It is a better way of going about it than what we had before.<\/p> <p> On the question of whether these provisions will be the last dealing with this issue, I hope they are not.  I would like to see the new D&aacute;il look afresh at all these matters, because we need to modernise the administration of the Houses generally.  That is probably best done by an incoming D&aacute;il rather than one in the last months of its term.  It is important that when we have a vacancy for the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, as there currently is, that it be filled in a more modern way than was the case in the past.  As a result of the provisions in this Bill, the incoming Clerk of the D&aacute;il will be appointed through an open and transparent process which will involve the endorsement of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900053#AAA00200","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436457600,"counter":813,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

I am aware of the political dynamics that have been going on behind the scenes and the difficulties that are left unspoken, for some reason, in this House and which are the reason it took so long bring the legislation forward.  I do not intend to go into any of that other than to observe that there appears to have been a struggle between the Taoiseach and the Ceann Comhairle on the issue and the Bill is some sort of a fudged compromise.  It is an outcome that is detrimental to the culture of political life in this country, and I say that with full sincerity.  I accept that the Minister is genuine in what he says in terms of why he is making these appointments, but most party politicians do not see this the same way as do some of the Independent Members.

The use of the word \"discernment\" gives the Minister a power he or she should not have.  One of the great curses of political life in this country is that all parties, when they get into power, look after their own.  I referred in my initial contribution to the Judiciary and the Garda, where we find more obvious examples of this type of thing because those institutions are more prolific than the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Nevertheless, the administration of these Houses is an important issue.  It is indicative of the persistence of the political culture that there is to be no change in this regard.  Indeed, the discernment which Ministers have in the making of appointments, as referred to by the Minister, is now being extended to the Ceann Comhairle.<\/p>  <p>  I hoped but did not expect there would be a change in the political culture, led by this House, such that this type of ministerial power, the power of patronage and preference, would be taken out of the political arena.  The Ceann Comhairle is, after all, a politician, whether we like it or not.  The Ceann Comhairle is elected and is part of the culture, even though, in theory, he or she is a person of impeccable character and infinite and infallible qualities.  That is not quite the case in practice, but it is the kind of fiction we are supposed to believe in.  I had hoped this House might set an example and be the forerunner in effecting a change in the political culture, but that is not to be.  The Minister knows as well as we do that the use of political power, especially in the allocation of top jobs, has been abused by all parties since the foundation of the State.  It has been abused to the extent that people who are blatantly not qualified are promoted into positions which are beyond their abilities.  They are promoted because they are members of political parties and have served those parties well.  They pop up with qualifications, some of which are fig leafs and others genuine, and are appointed, with extraordinary regularity not just to semi-State bodies, but to the Bench and to the top of the Garda in positions to which they probably would not be promoted if they were not of a certain political colour.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, that type of practice is not going to end.  The retirement of the last Clerk gave us an opportunity to reform such practices in this House.  It is very unfortunate that the opportunity is being forfeited.

These provisions represent a fundamental step towards exactly the culture he is talking about.  Under the current regime, the Ceann Comhairle selects the Clerk from the staff of the House.  I am proposing that the post be filled by way of a competition that is open to all and administered through the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC.  I have completely reformed that committee in my time in office and it now consists of a majority of external members.  Every interview panel for the appointment to positions such as the Clerk of the D&aacute;il will be chaired by an external member and comprise an external majority.  The only people that could be given patronage under this system, as the Deputy puts it, are those included on the short list as being deemed suitable for appointment.

The current practice is that the Chief Whip makes decisions on where all Members of the House are based.  The amendment proposes that we de-politicise the current arrangement, take the decision-making power away from the Chief Whip and give it to the Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The current system is most unfair and undemocratic.  The Chief Whip can and does act in a partisan manner at times and decisions are made to remove people forcibly from their offices, on which Deputy Mathews will speak.  He has direct experience of the removal of his papers, which was completely out of order.<\/p><p>Renua Ireland believes that the Government of the day, in particular the Chief Whip, should have no entitlement to manage and assign office accommodation and should not disrupt Members who have been elected by the people to serve them.

We want to de-politicise the distribution of office space and ensure that all Members of the Oireachtas, who have an equal constitutional mandate, are treated with full equality regarding all of these matters.

Those who are not members of the main Opposition parties, including Fianna F&aacute;il and the Technical Group, are treated very poorly in terms of speaking slots.  We do not have an equal opportunity to put our points across.  We are all Members and are supposed to be treated equally.  We all have the same mandate and are trying to put across our various points, but the current system is unfair.<\/p><p>We had a full discussion on Committee Stage about parliamentary allowances and the taking of moneys by political parties when Members are no longer part of them.  Renua Ireland wants the membership of a political party to be reviewed on a yearly basis, and if one is not a member of a party at the end of a calendar year a party would not be able to draw down that money.  Taxpayers' money should no longer go to fund parties to which Members no longer belong.  We want fairness on this.  The Chief Whip should not be able to make such decisions; the power should lie with the Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900056#DDD00400","speaker":"1182"},{"type":"speech","time":1436458200,"counter":830,"content":"<p>This amendment is a good safeguard for fairness and equality for Members of a Parliament.  We, rather than parties, have been elected as Members of Parliament.  Parties are the umbrella or playing colours of individuals elected to Parliament.  It is sometimes good to see what has happened in reality in order to diagnose a problem or explore the possibility of fairness and better conduct in the future.  I am not trying to examine scar tissue for the sake of it.  Rather, I want to determine whether there is a better way of doing things.<\/p>  <p>  On 2 July 2013 there was a vote in the House and the Government Chief Whip directed Members of the Government parties to vote in a certain way.  It was an exceptional piece of legislation and in any other county Members of Parliament would have been given the democratic right as representatives to vote in accordance with their consciences.  That did not apply on that occasion, therefore we were voting in accordance with what was not a personal conscience, but rather a conscience within the ambit of being a representative of the whole people, as the German basic law describes in its constitution.  The principles of the constitutions of Lithuania, Czech Republic, Latvia and the Netherlands also refer to that.  We were prevented from behaving within those democratic principles.<\/p>  <p>  The outcome of not voting in accordance with the direction of the Chief Whip was immediate expulsion from the parliamentary party.  We were handed a letter immediately, on 2 July.  I am giving the chronology because the House was going to rise within a fortnight, just as we will rise next Thursday on 16 July.  The direction to get out of our offices and obey the Chief Whip in what was almost a reprisal for voting in accordance with conscience was over the top.  This amendment would prevent such over the top behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  There was a lot of pressure leading up to the decision to vote in accordance with my conscience and my health was not great at the time.  I am not revealing this for prurient reasons, but it is important to say it because it happened.  I visited my doctor who told me my blood pressure was extremely high.  I told him there had been a direction to get out of my offices and he said that was not appropriate.  The summer holidays and recess were coming up and it would have been the reasonable and courteous thing to do to organise things by arrangement in a consensual and cordial fashion.  There was no emergency.  I had a medical certificate that recorded that my blood pressure was elevated and vacating offices was not indicated.<\/p>  <p>  The certificate was presented to the Office of the Taoiseach, as well as to the Chief Whip.  It had no effect whatsoever and a week later all my communication lines, such as phones, e-mails and computers, were cut.  It was like before the Normandy landings.  They were restored and we limped on in the office for a week.  The following weekend, without my knowledge, everything was removed, including the pictures on the wall and all my papers and files, from the five-storey building to the basement in Leinster House 2000.<\/p><p>At the time I pointed out it has an inbuilt fire hazard because vertical steel girders going down to the ground support an impenetrable wire mesh.  If the corridors of the building went on fire there would be no escape.  I pointed this out but nothing has been done about it. <\/p> <p> These are facts, and if they were within the ambit and responsibility of the Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas, as proposed, it would be a much better, safer and safeguarding framework.  As Deputy Flanagan stated it would depoliticise the accommodation of duly elected Members of Parliament who are solemnly doing their best to carry out their responsibilities.  I am not playing around with geography, physics or psychology, I am being dead honest.  It should not matter who belongs to what party or no party.  It is helpful for members of parties to be grouped in buildings in easy access of one another, and I have no problem with this, but in exceptional circumstances, there should be above all courtesy, understanding and respect and there was not.  This happens when there is too much concentration of power and authority, no matter who the office-holder happens to be.  It is the framework which is dangerous.  The framework of giving the allocation of office accommodation in a practicable way with the ultimate responsibility being assigned to a civil servant not exposed to political pressures and temptations is a very good idea.  I humbly entreat that it be taken on board for the future.  This is with an eye to the future, in the same way as one has fire escapes in buildings.<\/p> <p> If we look at the facts and what happened, we see it could have been prevented.  There was no need for it, but the temptation was there because an act of insubordination in the minds of the Whip and the Government took place and there was going to be a punishment for it.  This is wrong.  It is as plain as the nose on my face that this is wrong in the circumstances.  Anybody from any other jurisdiction speaking any other language would clearly understand this.  In the haste of the blizzard of trying to get stuff through legislatively, behaviours get heated, judgment goes missing and courtesy goes out the door, and this is not a good idea.  We saw it today with regard to pressing a red or green button, when Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in the haste of getting to his seat mistakenly hit the wrong button.  When things are done too hastily errors occur, such as bank guarantees, overnight liquidations of busted banks and the setting up of NAMA on half an hour's reading, when the papers in the hands of the Deputies in the 30th D&aacute;il were still warm from the Xerox machine.

One of the first Topical Issues I raised here, with my colleague, Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, regarded an extension of BreastCheck, the national screening programme to detect breast cancer among women.  At the time, women aged between 50 and 64 could avail of this programme, but there was evidence that women from the ages of 64 to 69 were also at quite a high risk.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The figures show that 87 women's lives would be saved a year if this was introduced.  Thankfully, in last October's budget, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, agreed to this change and to extend it.  No doubt by the end of the year or next year, the figures will show that countless lives will be saved.<\/p> <p> We also have a screening programme called CervicalCheck for young women.  At the age of 25, they receive a letter - it is something I received - to tell them that they can avail of a free smear test to check for cervical cancer.  Sometimes young women can be shy or nervous about doing this, but when one gets a letter to say that the service is there, that it is free to avail of and that other young women of the same age are availing of it, one is more likely to go.  These two services, combined with raising awareness on a national scale, will continue to save lives.<\/p> <p> We have begun to talk about cancer a lot more in recent years than we have done in the past.  It is not the secret that people kept a long time ago and the more we talk about it, the more we raise awareness.<\/p> <p> Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men in Ireland, apart from non-melanoma skin cancer which is a non-invasive cancer.  Some 29% of all men diagnosed with cancer have a diagnosis of prostate cancer.  It can be detected by a simple blood test.  As with most cancers, if one diagnoses it early the likelihood of beating the disease and making a full recovery is extremely high.<\/p> <p> However, sometimes men are reluctant to visit GPs.  I hope men do not mind me saying this, but sometimes they have to be on their death-bed before they go to a GP or before their other half or a family member makes them go.  If it were part of a screening programme and if they were to receive a letter to encourage them to go, it might encourage more men to do so.  For example, a couple of weeks ago a gentleman in my constituency - he is not somebody who I would know - had a two-page article in the local newspaper essentially telling his story.  He was 57 years old when he found out he had prostate cancer and it tore his world apart.  He managed to survive it.  One point he made with which I would agree is that there was no national programme to encourage men.  There is advice but if men were to receive a letter through the door stating the service is there for them to avail of, they would be more likely to take it on board.<\/p> <p> According to the statistics, over 3,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year.  Sadly, approximately 500 of those will lose their lives.  A startling figure is that 11% of all cancer deaths in Ireland are those of prostate patients.<\/p> <p> I would ask the Minister to look at this.  Previous studies have shown that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend the introductory programme but if one were to look at further figures, one in 10,000 men under the age of 40, one in 38 aged between 40 to 59, and one in 14 for ages 60 to 69 will be diagnosed.  If one thinks of one's grandfather, father, brothers, uncles, cousins and neighbours and work colleagues, the likelihood is high of one, two or many more of those having prostate cancer in a couple of years' time and I do not see how introducing a screening programme that could detect this early would do any harm.  Somebody stated it would do more harm than good but I do not see how that would be the case.  This is an extremely important issue.  CervicalCheck and BreastCheck have saved lives and I think we need something similar for men.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900059#GGG00300","speaker":"1180","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436460000,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McEntee for raising this important issue.  The importance of early detection of cancer is fully accepted by Government.  Population-based screening programmes are an important element of early detection and have been introduced for cancers in Ireland where international evidence supports this approach.  At present, available evidence has given rise to population-based screening programmes being recommended for bowel, breast and cervical cancer and such programmes have been introduced here.<\/p>  <p>  However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a prostate cancer screening programme.  Instead, the focus is on the early detection of such cancers through rapid access clinics that have been established in the eight designated cancer centres.  These clinics provide access to early diagnosis and multidisciplinary decision-making for prostate cancer, with patients who are deemed to be at higher risk being fast-tracked to the clinics.  Men referred to these prostate clinics undergo comprehensive assessment, with appropriate imaging and biopsies.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from non-melanoma skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in Ireland.  In recent years, the rapid access prostate clinics have seen between 2,400 and 2,800 men annually.  Approximately 1,300 of these patients each year have had a diagnosis of a prostate cancer, a diagnosis rate of 40%.  It is vital, therefore, that men are aware of the symptoms of prostate diseases and present early to their GP.  The Deputy's comments about the reluctance of men to do this sometimes are well made.<\/p>  <p>  Last month my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, launched clinical guidelines on the diagnosis, staging and treatment of patients with prostate cancer.  These guidelines, which were approved by the national clinical effectiveness committee, represent a significant step forward in dealing with prostate cancer in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Survival from cancer has improved markedly in recent years and is expected to increase further when the long-term effects of the reforms in cancer care under the current cancer strategy, including screening programmes, impact more fully.  However, it is predicted that the total number of cancer cases will rise in the coming years, with better diagnosis combined with an increasing, and aging, population.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently working on the development of a national cancer strategy to provide the focus for cancer control for the next decade.  A steering group has been established to inform this work.

It is difficult to have an open-ended scheme, as with CervicalCheck or BreastCheck, as one must pick a certain age demographic.  Men aged between 60 and 69 have a one in 14 chance of developing prostate cancer and six in ten cases are found in men over the age of 65, and it would be possible to start something like this targeted at those ages where it is most prevalent.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, 3,000 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed this year in Ireland.

The Minister's involvement in the Moore Street issue, as she has made clear countless times, arises from the preservation order that was placed in 2007 on Nos. 14 to 17 under the National Monuments Acts.<\/p><p>Any plans or proposals for the wider area outside the confines of the national monument are the responsibility of Dublin City Council as the planning authority.  Redevelopment plans for the area have received full planning permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The properties around the national monument are in private ownership.  They are not subject to the Minister's remit under the National Monuments Acts.<\/p> <p> The historical significance of the fundamentally intact building at No. 16 as the final headquarters of the 1916 Rising was the determining factor when the decision was taken to make the preservation order.  These buildings are the only substantially authentic, original and intact pre-1916 buildings on the street.  They are the only buildings that retain significant original elements that would have been there in 1916, including staircases, partitions, plaster work, doors, floors, fittings and fixtures.  Above all, Nos. 14 to 17 also contain the physical evidence of the presence of the insurgents in the form of the openings broken through party walls as they tunnelled their way up the street.  All of these elements are being retained, secured and permanently safeguarded as a result of the Government's decision to assume ownership of the national monument.<\/p> <p> The Minister is pressing ahead as speedily as possible to acquire the site, carry out the restoration work and have the 1916 commemorative centre open to the public.  I wish I had a better timeline for the Deputies, but I do not.  I look forward to the day work gets started on the Moore Street project.  All of our citizens can look forward with pride to the day it opens its doors to welcome the public as a fitting testament to the men and women of 1916 and what they fought for.  There are more discussions to be had, not least with the traders who occupy the street and do their daily business there.  Subject to agreement, we hope to have a wrap going around those four buildings in the very near future.  This will be a solid indication of the Government's intention to establish a lasting monument to the sacrifices of those who fought that week and had their final meetings in this historic building.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900061#JJJ01000","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Prices","time":1436461200,"counter":865,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900062#KKK00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1436461200,"counter":866,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, for coming to the House to debate this important issue.  The decline in Common Agricultural Policy funding means that the issue of price has to take centre stage.  I have been telling the Minister for three years that it is absolutely vital for him to realise that the price issue cannot be left simply to market forces.  The reality is that there has been a significant decline in the price of milk, which is currently 22% lower than it was in July 2014.  The decrease we have had here is slightly bigger than the average decrease of 18% across the EU.  I will put that in monetary terms.  According to the ICMSA, every cent that is cut from the farmgate milk price is costing the average farmer between &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 per annum.  For the average dairy farmer, that means a loss of approximately &euro;30,000, which is a huge amount of money.  Given that the processing cost is 28 cent per litre, it is clear that we are approaching the point at which no profit will emerge from the production of a litre of milk.  People with low gearing ratios who have been in farming for a long time can probably ride it out, but this is a significant challenge for people who have got into very heavy investments.  I will elaborate on the major worry in this regard.  We see the uncertainty in the world.  Russia imposed a sudden ban because of things that could not have been foreseen three or four years ago.  I will explain what the Minister has allowed to happen.  The intervention price in the EU is 20 cent a litre.  We need a safety net at 28 cent a litre.  In other words, the intervention price should be 28 cent a litre.  An intervention price of 20 cent is nonsensical because that is the world market price anyway.  One can always sell one's product at that low level.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen a massive decline in sheep prices.  I know the Minister of State will probably read the same answer that she was given to read in the Seanad yesterday, when she spoke about technology adoption programmes and everything else.  We could have a big debate about EU schemes, but tonight is not the night for it.  Therefore, the Minister of State can skip that part of her reply.  The issue here is price.  In other words, farmers want to get their price in the market.  I am particularly interested to know what the Minister, Deputy Coveney, intends to do on two issues.  If he does not make sure there are constant live exports to provide for competition in the market, we will be in a bottleneck situation where the market is controlled by a very small number of processors.  This is particularly concerning because we do not have a food ombudsman here like they have in Britain.  I have two questions.  First, can the Government ensure we get the full capacity for live exports?  We need to have markets for live exports, and live exports need to be facilitated in every way.  Second, can the Government confirm my understanding that if one sends a 25 kg lamb into the factories to be killed, one will be paid for just 21.5 kg?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900062#KKK00300","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1436461200,"counter":867,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900062#KKK00400","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1436461200,"counter":868,"content":"<p>I do not believe the factories are throwing 3.5 kg of meat into their skips.

This seems to be another way for the factories in a monopoly situation to depress the price artificially.  I would be really grateful if the Minister of State could address the specific issues I have raised.  I refer to the issue of the intervention price, the question of what is being done about live exports and the need for farmers to be paid on the basis of the full weight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900062#KKK00500","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1436461200,"counter":869,"content":"<p>The Deputy is right when he says I spoke on this issue in the other House yesterday.  It is important for me to reiterate what I said on that occasion.  The Deputy will appreciate that I am responding on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who is in Galway today for bilateral meetings with the EU Fisheries Commissioner, Karmenu Vella.  The Deputy has spoken about market developments in the sheep and dairy sectors, which are two of the most important elements of our agri-food industry.  I will deal with the sheep sector first.<\/p>  <p>  Primary output from the sheep industry is worth approximately &euro;230 million.  This value has grown significantly in recent years.  More than two thirds of our output is exported.  In 2014, exports totalled almost 48,000 tonnes, with a value of &euro;218 million.  The sheep sector in Ireland is heavily dependent on the export market because domestic consumption is approximately 30% of overall production.  France and the UK continue to be our core markets.  The French market is usually represents twice the size of the UK market.  This reflects the strong demand and reputation in France for Irish lamb and the consumer preference in the UK for the British product.  I am aware that the sheep farmers are vulnerable to price fluctuations.  While prices are subject to the normal dynamics of the marketplace, the Government has provided a range of financial and structural supports to the sector that can help to make it more resilient and position it to avail of development opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of sheep prices, my Department monitors average sheep prices and sheep slaughtering figures on a weekly basis because the two are clearly inter-linked.  While the recent movement on prices has been disappointing, it is not out of line with the trend experienced in other countries and there have been some signs of recovery this week.  I am satisfied that recent movements do not point to a structural difficulty within the overall sheepmeat sector, but instead reflect the fluctuations that can happen at this time of year.  The latest available figures show that after a strong first quarter in 2015, when the average Irish price was approximately 11% more than in the same period in 2014, prices have fallen back.  This change in price in recent weeks is probably due to a combination of various factors.  Supplies are in full flow at present due to seasonal factors.  At the same time, there are poor market conditions.  This is believed to be driving down average prices as measured on a weekly basis.<\/p><p>While this recent dip in prices is disappointing, it remains the case that at the end of June the average year-to-date price was running at approximately 4% ahead of the price for the same period last year.  This week prices have started to rise sharply again, and demand for sheep and lamb from factories is very strong.<\/p> <p> In recognising the vulnerability of sheep farmers, the Minister has introduced a number of measures to help drive on-farm viability.  These include the sheep technology adoption programme, STAP, which was introduced in 2013 and has played a major role encouraging technology adoption on farms, while also requiring participants to undertake a number of farm tasks.  These farm tasks make use of the best technologies available to sheep farmers in Ireland while also encouraging improved breeding.  STAP is currently in its third and final year.  An average of approximately 4,000 farmers have participated in the scheme each year, and total funding of more than &euro;6.5 million was spent in 2013 and 2014.<\/p> <p> Various other schemes in the rural development programme, RDP, are also of direct relevance to the sheep sector.  For example, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, will benefit sheep farmers, and they will continue to be significant beneficiaries from the areas of natural constraint scheme.  A series of capital investment schemes is being introduced under the TAMS II scheme.  It must also be remembered that the sheep grassland scheme, under which more than &euro;65 million was invested in Irish sheep farms during its lifetime, has now been included in the direct payment of each sheep farmer under revised CAP arrangements.  The Food Wise 2025 report launched last week also includes included a number of recommendations relating to the sheep sector, and the Minister will put in place a robust implementation process to monitor progress on implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900062#KKK00600","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436461800,"counter":871,"content":"<p>One can do anything with figures, and unfortunately the Minister of State's colleague is a genius with this.  The Minister says the change in price in recent weeks is likely due to a combination of various factors and the fact that supplies are in full flow at present due to seasonal factors.  However, if there are a large number of sheep coming to the market at a low price and the price is very high in the spring, when there are very few sheep available, the high price is not much good to the farmer because of the number of sheep coming out.  If one looked at the average price paid for sheep, one would find that it has been a very bad year for lowland sheep to date.  What is being done to stimulate live exports to maintain competition for the factories?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said the market was subject to the normal dynamics of the marketplace.  Of course farmers will say that because of what they call the hourglass effect of farming - that is, many producers and many consumers but very few processors and multiples in the middle.  There is no normal dynamic in the middle.  The processor and the multiples have overweening power.  It is interesting that the Minister's erstwhile colleague, Commissioner Phil Hogan, shares my concern about the price issue and about what can be done to curb the power of the small number of major multiples.  All of the lamb goes to the Continental market; virtually nothing is exported outside the EU at present.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response on this.<\/p>  <p>  I have a second question.  Will the Minister of State accept that when the Minister amalgamated the sheep grassland scheme, particularly for hill sheep farmers, most of them were under &euro;150 per hectare?  By 2019, all of that money will be eroded because they will be at the &euro;150 figure, but they would have been at that figure anyway.  The way the Minister handled the grassland scheme is of no benefit to most hill farmers in the longer term.  It was a disastrous decision.  What is the Minister of State's view on that?<\/p>  <p>  With regard to milk, there appears to be great confidence that the market will rise.  However, it might not.  I listened to a report about China yesterday.  It said that China might have a classic stock market bubble of the same type that the US experienced in the 1920s.  It is ordinary citizens who invested in the stocks and shares.  If that is the case, purchasing power will go down.  What contingency is in place if there is a collapse in milk prices?  The best on offer at present is the intervention price of 20 cent, which is 8 cent below the production cost.  What will the Minister do to get the intervention price up to 28 cent per litre?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900063#LLL00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1436461800,"counter":872,"content":"<p>The price situation in Ireland is broadly replicated in other EU member states, reflecting the global nature of the problem.

The Minister will continue to push for the deployment and extension of EU market supports, such as aids to private storage and intervention, where appropriate.  A number of other measures have been introduced by the Minister and the Government to assist Irish dairy farmers, including the introduction of a number of agri-taxation measures in last year's budget, such as extending the income averaging to five years, which will be of great assistance to dairy farmers wishing to manage volatility; the introduction of a scheme to facilitate the repayment of the<\/p><p>superlevy bill by farmers over three years, which the Minister expects will be heavily subscribed; engagement with Irish banks to ensure that access to credit for the dairy sector is available, competitive and responsive to market volatility.<\/p><p>A combination of these measures, allied to the investment and expertise of our dairy farmers and processors, means that the Irish dairy sector remains well placed to realise its potential in years to come and to meet the challenges of market volatility along the way.

Put simply, our local businesses are the heart of our economy.  These businesses create and sustain employment in every community across this country.  While large multinationals boost employment in larger urban areas such as Dublin, it is local businesses that ensure the economic recovery is felt across all communities, including in Carlow and Kilkenny.  We regularly hear that the Government wishes to promote local businesses in expanding their orders, winning contracts and increasing employment.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly stated that he wants Ireland to be the best country in the world in which to do business.  We support that ambition.  However, despite all the talk, press releases and policy announcements, situations still arise in which State agencies impose unnecessary delays and inefficiencies which are undermining local companies that are ambitious and wish to build up their businesses.<\/p>  <p>  I will illustrate my point with the example of a small business in Carlow which is losing important business due to significant delays by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, in issuing the company's compliance certificates.  Keltruck Bodies Ltd. is a company that manufactures truck bodies.  It employs 13 full-time staff in its workshop on O'Brien Road in Carlow town.  Every truck body the company manufactures must be certified by the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  It currently takes between four and six weeks for the NSAI to certify a truck body from Keltruck Bodies.  This means that four to six weeks are added to the wait time for customers.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, stated in a response to my party leader on this matter on 13 May that the time for review should only be two weeks.  The equivalent process in the UK can be carried out within 24 hours by its standards authority.  Many of the customers of Keltruck Bodies are UK based and the company is losing exports to the UK due to the four- to six-week wait for a compliance certificate from the NSAI.<\/p><p>This is a perfect example of how the State is undermining local businesses in their quest to compete nationally and internationally.  One cause for the delay is clearly reduced staff levels in the National Standards Authority of Ireland with staff numbers reducing from 168 when the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was last in government to the current figure of 140.  These delays are having a dramatic impact on local companies in their desire to expand their business.  I call on the Minister to address the issue immediately.<\/p> <p> This is another example of red tape gone mad.  The company in question is willing to export but must wait between six and eight weeks for certificate of compliance from the NSAI.  The business employs 19 people and I ask the Minister to address the problem.  The same certification can be obtained in the United Kingdom within 24 hours.  Why do companies trying to survive and maintain employment have to wait between four and six weeks for a certificate of compliance?  I ask the Minister to do something about the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900063#LLL00400","speaker":"1199","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436462400,"counter":876,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be able to reply to my constituency colleague, Deputy Bobby Aylward.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, operates as the approval authority for related directives, 2007\/46\/EC, under the European Communities (Road Vehicles: Entry into Service) Regulations (S.I 157 of 2009) made by the then Minister for Transport, which requires that all member states have national approval schemes implemented through to October 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The automotive approvals process relies heavily on technically competent assessors to process the applications.  Applications for certification are processed by the NSAI on a first come, first served basis.  Since the beginning of the year, the NSAI has received 3,108 individual vehicle approval, IVA, applications, of which it has completed 2,843.  As of 9 July 2015, 196 files are being processed and these have been in process for an average of 3.5 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the increasing workload, the NSAI tendered in 2014 for an alternative service delivery, which commenced from January 2015 with Applus for the provision of technical assessors.  Owing to the regulatory and technical nature of the assessment process, it was not possible to increase processing capacity rapidly as the sourcing, training and induction of engineers takes a period of approximately six months before they become competent in the approvals process.  In addition, staff training reduces the time spent on processing.  While the addition of new resources was necessary to address the backlog, in the initial stages this is disruptive and impacts on the existing resource as training is necessary.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to resources issues, the processing times also reflect the technical nature of the approvals process itself, the unavoidable requirement on industry to build in an adequate provision for the automotive approvals timescale and the registrations cycle for new vehicles, which are in January and mid-year.  However, with regard to the three companies in the Carlow-Kilkenny area which have applications in process, I am informed by the NSAI that company A currently has no outstanding applications; company B has submitted 35 applications since January this year, of which 24 have been approved and 11 are in the process of approval.  A number of applications are awaiting responses to queries which need to be addressed before the approval can be completed; and company C has submitted 79 applications since January this year, of which 64 applications have been processed and 15 are awaiting processing.  Again, there are queries which need to be addressed before approval is completed.<\/p>  <p>  Approvals of a number of outstanding applications have not been completed as a result of queries from the NSAI to the applicants about the applications.  This can cause long delays as application forms must be fully completed before being processed.  Another contributing factor is the delay in separate approvals processes for different types of commercial vehicles which is outside the control of the NSAI.  Against this background, I encourage companies to inquire directly with the NSAI about the progress of their applications.  In this context, the NSAI has been working with individual companies experiencing pressure points to prioritise applications, according to the company's needs.<\/p>  <p>  I will supply the remainder of the reply to the Deputy if he wishes as it deals with some technical issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015070900064#MMM00200","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1436462400,"counter":877,"content":"<p>While I welcome the explanation provided, I do not agree with it.
