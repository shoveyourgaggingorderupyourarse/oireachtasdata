It seems to me to facilitate the eradication and destruction of certain elements of Irish heritage.  There are a number of parts to the Bill, including provisions on canals and the burning of vegetation on uncultivated land, as well as changes to the laws protecting National Parks and Wildlife Service rangers.  I will focus for the most part on the issue of hedgerows.<\/p>  <p>  There are no positive actions for wildlife in section 7 and section 8 of the Bill.  BirdWatch Ireland argues that several red-listed birds, including the curlew and yellowhammer, would be severely negatively impacted by the proposed changes in the Bill.  In Ireland, the curlew has experienced an 80% decline since the 1970s and is threatened with extinction globally.  The yellowhammer population in Ireland has collapsed.  Burning in March will destroy curlew occupied nesting territories and those of other upland birds.  The yellowhammer is a red-listed bird due to a staggering 90% decline in breeding population as part of an 11-year to 14-year trend.  The yellowhammer uses hedgerows for nesting and was once a common enough sight on telephone wires in rural Wexford.  One would do very well to spot one these days in Wexford or anywhere else in the country.  According to BirdWatch Ireland, 5% of yellowhammer nests are still active at the end of August.  Active means the nests still contain unfledged young.  The changes proposed in the Bill will contribute to increasing the already massive contraction in the yellowhammer population in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill flies in the face of the all-Ireland pollinator plan.  This is at a time when one third of all Irish bee species are threatened with extinction.  Bees pollinate many of our crops, such as oilseed rape, apples, peas, beans, strawberries and raspberries.  In a 2013 journal article, Dr. Dara Stanley from the National University of Galway and Dr. Jane Stout of the school of natural sciences at Trinity College Dublin, stated that the value of insect pollination of crops to the Irish economy is estimated to be &euro;53 million per year.  The World Wildlife Fund 2016 report says that changes in the timing of life-cycle events in nature mean that hundreds of plant and animal species are beginning to respond to an earlier spring.  We know that since 1970, the number of wild animals on the planet has dropped by more than half and by 2020 it is expected to drop by two-thirds.  We have animals and birds changing and expanding the structure and timings of their life-cycles, due to global warming.  The more vibrant periods of wildlife activity are encroaching further into non-traditional times of the year and the Government is proposing not to acknowledge this development, but to double down and make the timeframe in which we are liable to destroy them even longer.<\/p>  <p>  No scientific rationale has been proposed for the changes proposed in the Bill.  For example, burning has limited value as a land management tool.  The changes are proposed as a two-year pilot programme covering all 26 counties.  Not only is this poor legislation, but it is also poor in terms of scientific methodology.  What is the proposed control area for the experiment?  If all of the 26 counties will serve as the experimental group, then what does the Bill propose to use as the control group to which the experimental group might be compared?  How on earth will this so-called pilot period and its success or otherwise be monitored?  The National Parks and Wildlife Service is already chronically under-resourced and so far no extra resources have been promised.  <\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il got an amendment to the Bill when it was going through the Seanad which would exclude internal hedgerow cutting in August.  Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party, Independents, Sinn F&eacute;in and Labour were all against section 7 and section 8 of the Bill in the Seanad.  I hope their positions will be the same here.  It is important to acknowledge that tillage farmers have concerns about the cutting of internal hedgerows, as opposed to road-facing hedgerows, specifically those tillage farmers who grow winter barley.  It was mentioned during one of the Seanad debates on the Bill that farmers who grow winter barley account for 4% of the farming community.  If this figure is accurate, then perhaps a special provision might be made for these particular farmers.  Of course, this should be balanced with the need to maintain biodiversity.<\/p><p>The Bill also appears to pose problems with Ireland's EU greening payments for farmers.  It may very well weaken the case for funding for farmers in the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, as part of the Common Agricultural Policy.<br\/><br\/>Regarding burning on the uplands and lowland hills, as Oonagh Duggan of BirdWatch Ireland in a recent <i>Oireachtas Retort<\/i>interview argued, we need a strategy for upland management with hill farmers at its core, farming with nature in mind.  Many of our upland birds are red-listed for conservation concern.  They are on their way out, as is hill farming.  We need to think creatively about how we can support and care for both environmental farming and the environment itself.  However, the law on illegal burning must be enforced.<br\/><br\/>Using freedom of information requests, the Irish Wildlife Trust found that 57 wildfires took place across the country this year.  Almost all took place in March and April, the period when burning is illegal.  Over half the wild fires were in designated areas of conservation, including two national parks, Killarney National Park and the Wicklow Mountains National Park.  According to freedom of information requests, however, the Irish Wildlife Trust found no one has lost out on a single farm payment and no farmer was penalised in 2016 under cross-compliance rules.  I stand to be corrected if I am wrong on this last point.<br\/><br\/>Road safety is at the heart of the argument for the need to amend the Wildlife Act with this Bill.  Vegetation impinges on road safety.  Obviously, it is important and necessary to improve visibility on roads and reduce hazards.  Road safety should be the most important issue.  If I might presume to speak on behalf of BirdWatch Ireland, the Federation of Irish Beekeepers, the Irish Wildlife Trust and others who briefed Members recently, neither I nor any of these groups is ignoring road safety.<br\/><br\/>If a hedge needs to be cut to make a road safe, the hedgerows on that particular road should be cut at any time of the year.  However, there is absolutely no reason hedgerow cutting should be taking place in the so-called &quot;closed period&quot;.  If hedgerows are properly managed throughout the year, this simply would not be necessary.  At the recent briefing organised by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, this was made absolutely clear in response to questions raised by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.  Nobody should argue roads should remain unsafe.  However, that does not mean that road safety concerns should not, or cannot, be balanced with concerns with biodiversity.<br\/><br\/>Hedgerow cutting needs to be done according to best practice.  It needs to be regulated and there needs to be accountability.  The Heritage Bill is dependent on voluntary action.  It will not compel landowners to cut the necessary overgrowth that is actually causing road safety problems.  The proposed changes permit, but do not compel, landowners to cut hedges during August.  This means that the main road safety issue, namely, landowners who fail to comply with their obligations under section 70 of the Roads Act, is not addressed.  The biggest problem with the excessive growth of roadside vegetation is not landowners who want to cut hedges and cannot.  Rather, the issue is with those landowners who should cut their hedges and do not do so.  The proposed changes in this Bill do nothing to address this problem.<br\/><br\/>Another problem is that road safety issues during August, according to the provisions of section 8, would be self-defined by landowners.  The aim of section 7(2) is to allow regulated cutting in August.  This would in fact be nullified or invalidated by section 8.  Instead of the Road Safety Authority defining road safety, it will now be the landowners who decide with no regulation and no answerability to the Minister.  This would make a mockery of the very idea and purpose of cutting seasons.<br\/><br\/>My constituency, Wexford, has been a national leader in promoting biodiversity in terms of hedgerows through its Life Lives on the Edge programme.  The aim of this project is to maintain roadside vegetation at various pilot sites in the county.  The aim is to achieve biodiversity without neglecting road safety or infrastructural maintenance objectives.  Wexford is a biodiversity model for the rest of country.  The project co-ordinator in Wexford County Council, Niamh Lennon, deserves special praise for her work in developing the project.  The rest of the country can learn much from the success of this Wexford project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900003#A00600","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510222200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Thomas Byrne.

The idea this Bill, in particular section 7, is about road safety is a complete and utter fraud.  If it were to do with road safety, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport would be putting it before the House, advised by the National Transport Authority and Road Safety Authority.  That has not happened in this case.  Instead, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, who is meant to be protecting our heritage and rural affairs, disgracefully is using the guise of road safety to put a provision like this forward in the House.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions put forward originally in the Seanad would have allowed hedge-cutting in August at a time when many birds are still using hedgerows to nest.  The yellowhammer, which has a strong presence in County Meath, needs to be protected because it is endangered and still breeds in hedgerows during August.  However, this Bill was brought in under the guise of road safety.  We all put road safety first but there is no road safety issue in this case.  We already have a Roads Act which allows for the cutting edges for the sake of road safety.  There is no reason to change the law on the grounds of road safety.<\/p>  <p>  On the first day of law school, one is told if a measure has to be changed, it is because there was a mischief or something was wrong with it.  There is nothing wrong with the existing regulations in terms of road safety.  Local authorities have full power and control to decide whether there is an issue of road safety that requires hedges to be cut.  This Bill, as originally put forward in the Seanad, added nothing to that.  It simply allows certain vested interests - these vested interests were very few because no farmer I asked was looking for this provision - to take over legislation and use road safety in a fraudulent way to essentially give free rein to hedge-cutting in August.<\/p>  <p>  There was significant debate and ill feeling towards this legislation in the Seanad.  There was also much debate in my party.  I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who steered the debate in our party and nationally with the various interest groups lobbying on this.  His proposal is welcome in that he wants to have a pre-legislative scrutiny hearing on Committee Stage where all interested groups can thrash through sections 7 and 8 to understand exactly what is involved and where we and the Department should go on this.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill was originally introduced as a fraudulent measure with the claim road safety reasons required it.  The fraud continued and got worse.  After much debate in the Seanad, an amendment was fraudulently stuck in at the last minute of Report Stage which purported to deal with concerns raised in the Seanad.  I understand that in the middle of the night, section 7 was amended and representations were given that this would resolve the issue that a large majority of Senators had raised.  It has completely liberalised what was already an attempt at liberalisation of the position.  I would love for the Minister to contradict me and tell I am wrong on section 7.  I will be listening carefully to her reply on this.<\/p><p>As I see it, the new section 7 essentially removes the local authority as an arbiter of whether a road safety issue exists and makes the process self-regulatory.  That is the fraud.  That is certainly the legal advice others have received and it was certainly my reading of it when I read it originally.  I was horrified when I read it.  However, I am willing to listen to the Minister about this.  I meet the IFA regularly.  They are all really good people who contribute massively to this country's economy.  Never once did this issue come up in all of my meetings with the IFA over many years.  It was never brought to my attention that there was an issue with regard to hedges in August or any other time of the year or that there was a particular road safety concern that had to be addressed at any other time of the year.  This was never brought up with me.  Had it been brought up by the IFA, I would have considered it and looked at the issues, as I do with any legislation.  I would have examined whether it was necessary before forming a view, but it was never raised with me.  Rather than having the local authority be responsible for things under road traffic legislation, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, utterly fraudulently in my view, is allowing the local authority to be taken out of the picture and for a self-regulatory regime to be put in place.  If I am wrong on that, I will be delighted to be told that I am wrong and I will listen to and accept that, but I want all the interested parties to be listened to and their concerns addressed on Committee Stage in order that we get legislation that is necessary to protect our heritage, wildlife, farmers and road safety, if that is the agenda.  If we are looking at protecting road safety in this legislation, I would rather it came from the Road Safety Authority and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  That is where it should come from.<\/p> <p> I am not making the case that road safety should be of lesser importance.  It should be of huge importance.  I am not making the case that we should make life difficult for our farmers.  We should make life as easy as possible for them.  However, we had legislation relating to a closed season for years that was accepted by everybody and there were no issues.  I said that nobody ever lobbied me about it, and if they want to lobby me that the closed season needs to be opened, let them come and make the case to me, but someone made the case to somebody in the Department over recent years.  I do not really know who.  Certainly when I rang one or two farmers, they said this might help, but for the ones to whom I spoke, it was a relatively marginal issue and was not the most important thing.  I do not see how what is envisaged can be supported because we really have a crisis.  The Minister has responsibility for and is in charge of protecting our natural heritage.  That is her role in terms of this legislation, and we are doing a bad job of protecting our natural heritage.  The number of curlews is dropping dramatically.  The number of cuckoos has dropped dramatically.  I doubt the Minister hears it but she might hear the cuckoo in parts of her constituency, particularly the eastern side and possibly the west of Cavan.  The reason the number of cuckoos is falling is that nests are not available for cuckoos because the number of those birds is declining as well.<\/p> <p> We have a huge issue in this country.  In my experience, farmers are the biggest supporters and are the most understanding and knowledgeable about biodiversity and species, but the understanding, expertise and sympathy for our natural heritage farmers and organisations like BirdWatch Ireland, which I very much support, have along with all these groups and people living in rural Ireland are not demonstrated by the Department and Minister in any way, shape or form.  This legislation has been changed significantly.  It has been shown that there are substantial concerns and opposition but there is also substantial willingness for everyone to work together for the common objectives.  Yes, we all want road safety.  Everybody on every side of this debate has said that.  Everybody wants to protect our biodiversity and natural heritage.  Everybody wants to make sure our farmers have the best possible shot at producing the crops we need to feed ourselves and that farmers need to pursue farming, so everybody agrees on those broad principles.  What Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is proposing, which is that everybody gets together on Committee Stage to see how we all work together to see how best to deal with all of these issues, is really important.<\/p> <p> I will be totally honest.  Burning is not an issue to which I have given huge consideration personally.  It does not happen too much around where I live but there were some high-profile cases this year that caused angst.  They were illegal fires that caused people who live in the area and people all over the country angst, not just because of the inconvenience and the massive road safety concerns caused by large-scale burning during the legal closed season but also because the people worry about biodiversity.  Deputy Fitzmaurice spoke very interestingly last night.  Yes, he was standing up for rural Ireland.  We all want to stand up for rural Ireland and we do so.  I represent a constituency that is half rural and half urban, so I see both sides of the story.  However, Deputy Fitzmaurice seemed to think that this was a case of NGOs - do-gooders, as he called them - trying to interfere with the way rural Ireland has always worked.  Yet in all of what was essentially claptrap from Deputy Fitzmaurice, there was a golden nugget where he said that everybody should get together about burning and that local groups should be established to see how burning could be done safely to protect our biodiversity.  As I understand it, this is very similar to what BirdWatch Ireland has been saying so I think there is a huge opportunity for voices as apparently diverse as those of Deputy Fitzmaurice and the NGOs in the biodiversity sector to come together to work out the best possible solution to this matter.<\/p> <p> I do not normally speak so passionately about many of these issues but I am passionate about protecting our biodiversity and I believe I represent a substantial portion of the population of this country, both rural and urban, to which the Minister should listen.  This is something we believe in and value, something we see we are losing, and something we must protect and must urge the Government to protect.  There is huge potential on Committee Stage to work this out together.  I do not believe the amendment thrown in at the last minute in the Seanad was that but, as I urge the Minister to do, I am willing to listen and accept the exact legal position when that is through.<\/p> <p> I know the European Commission has been notified about requirements for the habitats directive and the birds directive.  They are serious issues that have been brought up by serious people and of which the Minister must have due cognisance.  It is hard to believe how an amendment brought in on Report Stage relating to the new section 7 could have been analysed for compliance with European law.  There is no possible way it could have been analysed to the exact level of detail required to make it compliant with the birds directive and the habitats directive.  It is really important that it is compliant because we do not want this country to be subject to fines.  We do not want hassle forever more after the Minister leaves office because someone did not dot an i or cross a t or because we did not all work together in this House with the NGOs, the IFA and even the contractors' association, which seems to have a strong interest in it, along with the Road Safety Authority and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Everybody should get together and try to work out a common solution to this.  That is what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is proposing, which is something I very much value.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has steered a very moderate course on this Bill.  There are many different voices here, but in response to Deputy Fitzmaurice, there are things that everybody is saying and it is up to us in this Parliament to distil them and work out a common approach in order that we can come up with something everyone can support and that can protect farmers, road safety, our really important biodiversity and the natural heritage for which the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is responsible.<\/p> <p> If Deputy Breathnach is ready and has enough time, I will share the remainder of my time with him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900004#B00900","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510222800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the main objective of this Bill.  I endorse what Deputy Thomas Byrne said about bringing together the various interest groups as the Bill progresses.<\/p><p>I compliment the many custodians of our countryside, including environmental groups such as BirdWatch Ireland, An Taisce, the Irish Wildlife Trust or the Hedge Laying Association of Ireland, together with many environmental enthusiasts such as the 880 Tidy Towns groups which manage the issue of biodiversity in many of our towns and villages.  I especially compliment those in the agriculture sector who have for generations endeavoured to achieve a balance between food production and wildlife protection coupled with more recent and ever-growing problems associated with road safety.<\/p> <p> There is no doubt that the increase of vehicular traffic in our countryside, larger vehicular widths and the population growth, which has created an upsurge in walking, cycling and participation in rural pursuits, have added to the vexatious issue of when it is appropriate to trim roadside hedges.  Added to all of this is the issue of climate change, which is beginning to change the traditional seasons of growth.  That, along with additional heat and moisture, has seen unprecedented growth of roadside verges and hedgerows.<\/p> <p> Many views are being obstructed, and the onus of liability seems to fall increasingly on those in the agricultural sector to ensure that their property is not the cause of litigation.  In addition as a result of Storm Ophelia and previous storms, there has been a call to denude our roadsides of the trees that are just as important as our hedgerows.  Many of us are aware that for a person owning land on either side of a public road, effectively the roadway is part of the landowner&rsquo;s portfolio and inevitably will give rise to litigation in time to come.  Equally a person owning only one side owns to the centre of the road.<\/p> <p> The Heritage Bill is about getting a balance between road safety and wildlife protection.  Anyone with roadside frontage is very aware of achieving this balance.  I compliment those in the agriculture sector who have been the real custodians of our wildlife for generations.<\/p> <p> The hedgerows along many of our rural roads need trimming back beyond what the current legislation allows.  All we need to do is talk to those who jog, cycle or walk on these roads, not to mention those who drive trucks.  Reference has already been made to the damage being done to protruding mirrors.  In getting that balance right we need to protect the interests of human life without compromising the wildlife living in those hedgerows.  The 187 tragic road fatalities in 2016 represented a 15% increase on the previous year, which speaks to issues relating to protection of our hedgerows.  It is about getting the balance between wildlife protection and the safety of those who use our roads.<\/p> <p> Regarding road safety concerns, most farmers who avail of schemes such as GLAS will employ environmental planners in order to effect that plan.  I have had personal experience with both the previous REP scheme and the current GLAS where in the development of the plan, the planner indicated from a road safety point of view the need for hedgerows to be trimmed outside the season, and that was then accepted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  While people have talked about the local authorities having responsibility for the roadsides, the reality is that most local authorities do not cut any hedges except at junctions and ultimately those in the agricultural community get hedge-cutting notices.  It is trying to get a balance between that road safety issue and wildlife.<\/p> <p> Without over-complicating the system of EU grant aid, there is a method there in order for the whole issue to be legalised without necessarily interfering with our wildlife to any degree.  We all have to survive and food production is equally important.  The bees and the birds obviously help with growth and propagation.  For the agricultural sector to survive, that balance can be achieved.<\/p> <p> I welcome that the Bill provides for a review in two years.  The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry.  If people do not subscribe to the balance that I support, it can always be reviewed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900005#C00200","speaker":"1332","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510223400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in opposes the Bill for many reasons.  Obviously, we are all very conscious of having to protect our environment and wildlife, and of road safety.  I grew up in a rural area and am very much aware of those aspects.<\/p>  <p>  I am very concerned over the decline in the bird population.  One figure suggests that our bird population has declined by a quarter over a number of years.  Much of that is down to irresponsible work carried out by some farmers, in particular the uncontrolled burning on hills and mountains.  Many of my age group will remember in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s welcoming spring with the arrival of the cuckoo.  I have not heard a cuckoo for years and many other people living in rural areas would have a similar experience.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, who is beside me, says he has never heard a cuckoo, which is down to the lack of management and lack of control of our hedges, ditches and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  An aspect of it goes back to what was called progressive farming - removing ditches and hedges to make huge fields for convenience to accommodate the type of machinery that is used nowadays.  The cost we have paid has been the decline in a number of species of birds and the effect it has on wildlife.  It has not all been progressive; it has had that effect.  Travelling along motorways, one will see areas with one field that previously had four fields, and the associated protection for the wildlife is gone.<\/p>  <p>  Frequent cutting has also done damage to bees owing to the decline in the flowers they need to produce honey.  Fewer flowers result in fewer bees.<\/p>  <p>  I was very impressed by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's contribution on consultation and having focus groups sit down to decide on how to move forward.  The consultation between the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the EU comprised just one informal meeting, which is inexcusable.  We need many more meetings to ensure we have the necessary type of consultation.<\/p>  <p>  It would be good if all the lobby groups came together to argue out their case.  We all want to protect our wildlife, to ensure that our roads are safe and that needs to be done in a responsible way.<\/p><p>I do not accept that the powers are not there for local authorities and others to deal with areas which are a danger to the public, irrespective of the time of year.  They have the legal authority to do it.  That should certainly not be an argument against it.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will be voting against the Bill but we want to offer constructive criticism.  It is not just about scoring points.  Collectively, all of us here want to do the right thing.  We want to protect our birds and wildlife and ensure that our roads are safe.  We want to ensure we keep our countryside as it should be for future generations.  That is the role we will play in taking a position today.  Consultation is needed and people must be listened to.  Many arguments are made every day in the House on the decline of rural Ireland, usually with reference to the declining population and the lack of jobs.  Our environment is equally important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900006#D00200","speaker":"1317","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510224000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>The question was raised earlier as to whether this is heritage legislation at all.  Many aspects of the Bill are not sufficiently cognisant of what many environmental NGOs and farming community voices have said, namely that there is no need for sections 7 and 8.  There is no huge cry or lobbying effort calling on the Minister to look at this area and introduce these provisions.  As such, I hope the Minister will be open to some of the suggestions we put forward this morning.  I will consider two aspects of the Bill, namely Waterways Ireland and canals and sections 7 and 8 on burning and cutting of hedgerows and moors.<\/p>  <p>  Every organisation needs legislation to facilitate its activities and to ensure compliance with the law, in this case on the use of public waterways.  However, the Bill proposes to change fundamentally the way people use our canals and waterways.  I have looked at the system Waterways Ireland currently operates.  On the Barrow navigation, the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal, five days' mooring is available under the combined mooring and passage permit, but opportunities also exist to take up to 12 months' mooring vacancies on serviced and unserviced moorings.  Waterways Ireland operates an extended mooring permit at a cost of &euro;152 which allows 12 months' mooring at a single designated location and this is available at more than 60 locations on the Grand Canal, Barrow navigation and Royal Canal.  Most extended moorings are on soft banks without services but there are also serviced moorings available on the Barrow navigation, Grand Canal and Royal Canal.  After 12 months, however, one must reapply for a permit.  There is no permanent permit.  Nevertheless, a lot of people live on barges because it is a way of life, cheaper and services can be accessed on the docks.<\/p>  <p>  I have been approached by a number of boat and barge residents from the Grand Canal who are hugely concerned about the by-laws the Bill proposes to introduce and the tremendous powers it proposes to grant to authorised officers to challenge people in these areas.  I have referred to the &euro;152 payment, but there is also a &euro;126 payment to moor in these areas.  Residents have been told they could have to pay up to &euro;5,000 for a permanent permit on the Grand Canal.  One of the people who approached me is a pensioner on the State contributory pension.  If he were in a local authority house or apartment, he would be paying &euro;30 per week in rent, or approximately &euro;1,500 a year.  If the Bill is enacted, there will be lots of regulations on follow-up, authorised officers' powers, by-laws, enforcement, fixed payment notices, search warrants, service of directions, and prosecutions, but I see nothing about how much the long-term permits people are hoping to get will cost.  We need to step back and discuss with the people the moorings and Waterways Ireland how this should be progressed, just as people have said we should proceed in relation to hedgerows, uplands and burning and cutting.  This is a way of life for these people just as buying a house and moving into a home is for someone like me.  Everything around the mooring is part of their way of life.  The Minister should be very careful because these people feel they are being evicted from their permanent residences, albeit they have to renew their permits annually at the moment.  I ask the Minister to take cognisance of that and to avoid making it prohibitive for these people to stay on the canals.  I ask her to assist these people and to consider grants to allow them to upgrade their boats and ensure they are canal or water worthy.  She must work with them.  I will put down amendments in this regard on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 7 and 8 are the two main sections people have raised.  Under section 40 of the Wildlife Acts, vegetation on uncultivated land and any vegetation growing in any hedge or ditch is protected during the period March to August, inclusive.  The Bill proposes to change section 40 to permit under regulation the cutting of vegetation grown in any hedge or ditch on the roadside during August and the burning of vegetation in March.  It also exempts landowners from section 40 in any cutting undertaken pursuant to section 70 of the Roads Act.  A coalition of environmental NGOs, which the Minister knows well, has gathered 30,000 signatures from citizens who are concerned that the proposed changes will have a negative impact on already threatened wildlife.  In general, there is no scientific basis for the proposed changes, which is very important and must be taken on board.  The proposed changes impact on Ireland's commitment under European regulations but have not been formally discussed with the EU as far as I am aware.  They also place additional pressure on already threatened species.  There has been no assessment by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport of the implications of the Bill for road safety.  The two year pilot period covers all 26 counties but no methodology for the study has been provided.  No baseline data have been recorded despite the lapse of two years during the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service is already underresourced but no additional resources have been promised.<\/p>  <p>  I turn to section 7(1).  Burning in March destroys occupied nesting territories.  Even if the birds have not yet laid eggs, breeding may not take place that year if an established area is destroyed in this way.  Burning has limited value as a land management tool and other management strategies, including grazing, should be deployed to improve upland farm areas.  Agricultural policy should reflect the value of scrub and upland habitats for biodiversity, stock management and shelter and not seek to have such areas made ineligible for agricultural payments.  Cutting hedgerows from March to August impinges on the biodiversity value of hedgerows.  The changes proposed in section 8 are for the convenience of land managers and are not aimed at strengthening wildlife protection.  Section 8 will result in the reduced oversight of biodiversity protections.  There are provisions in existing legislation to address road safety.  The proposed changes permit, but do not compel, landowners to cut hedges.  The main road safety issue relates to landowners who fail to comply with their obligations under section 70 of the Roads Act but this is not addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is internally inconsistent.  The purpose of section 7(2) to permit regulated cutting in August is nullified by section 8 which permits year-round, self-definition of road safety issues by landowners with no regulation or ministerial oversight.  That leaves section 40 of the Wildlife Act unenforceable having regard to hedge cutting and hedge removal.  Hedge cutting is currently restricted during the period 1 March to 31 August annually.  The National Roads Authority can cut during the closed period for health and safety purposes and it is the authority that defines road safety issues during that closed period.<\/p><p>The roads authority is answerable to the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for work undertaken during the closed period for health and safety purposes.  There is a discrepancy between the provision of section 70(2) of the Roads Act and section 40 as regards landowners as there is currently some legal uncertainty as to whether a landowner who is served a section 70 notice by the roads authority during the closed period is exempt from the Wildlife Act.  In reality, the NPWS is very unlikely to consider a prosecution where a section 70 notice exists.<br\/><br\/>As regards section 7(2) of the Bill, landowners can cut roadside hedges under regulation by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht during August for a two year period renewable by Oireachtas resolution.  Roadside cutting is not limited to safety issues by primary legislation.  No draft regulations have been published and road safety issues during August would be self-defined by landowners.<br\/><br\/>Section 8 exempts landowners from section 40 of the Wildlife Act for road safety purposes.  Road safety issues year round are now self-defined by landowners who are subject to no regulation and have no answerability to the Minister.  That is not consistent with the intention of section 7(2) and effectively leaves section 40 of the Wildlife Act unenforceable as regards hedge cutting.  The section amends the principal Act and is not subject to the two year pilot period.  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht does not have authority in matters of health and safety in respect of roads.  There are no Government guidelines for landowners on assessing and dealing with road safety issues caused by structures on their land.<br\/><br\/>As regards burning and environmental impacts, annual wildfires have severely damaged upland habitats across Ireland such that the National Parks and Wildlife Service has assessed them all as being in bad condition.  The decline in hill farming has coincided with a decline in wildlife and habitats.  Many upland bird species are locally extinct and listed on BirdWatch Ireland's red list of birds of high conservation concern.  Such birds include the red grouse, nightjar, twite, ring ouzel and golden eagle.  A study carried out by the University of Leeds in the UK found that controlled burning resulted in the loss of biodiversity, water pollution, soil degradation and increased carbon emissions.  Effects from annual wildfires are likely to be much worse.  Controlled burning does not happen in Ireland.  A freedom of information request by the Irish Wildlife Trust, IWT, found that controlled burning happened in one location in 2016.  Data gathered by the IWT in 2015 and 2016 show that approximately 50% of all wildfires take place in areas designated for nature conservation.  Failure to protect these areas risks sanction from the European Commission.  Existing enforcement measures are not effective in preventing wildfires.  A freedom of information request by the IWT found that in 2016 no farmer was penalised under cross-compliance rules despite extensive and widespread wildfires that year.  It is to be hoped that no farmer consciously started a wildfire.<br\/><br\/>Our hills are valuable for more than just the food produced therefrom.  They are also important landscapes for recreation and amenity, protect water quality, help prevent flooding, store carbon and are home to unique wildlife.  Rewarding farmers for all of these services and not only one as is currently the case holds the key to protecting our environment and the livelihoods which depend upon it.  Restoring peatlands will help us reach our commitments under climate change agreements, restore habitats for endangered wildlife and protect water for downstream use, including alleviating floods.  A new uplands strategy which brings together complementary interests and which can propose tailored solutions to suit each area is urgently needed.<br\/><br\/>Those points were submitted by BirdWatch Ireland and Neil Foulkes of the Hedge Laying Association of Ireland and I wanted to read them into the D&aacute;il record.  It is important that we put that on the agenda because I do not believe that farmers are anti-biodiversity.  They want to be part of that diversity and be able to support it in every way they can.<br\/><br\/>As regards climate change, all Members know that bees are integral to our climate.  If the bees go, we go.  There have already been problems in Ireland in respect of a loss of bees of different varieties.  There have been recent attempts to reintroduce bees into the environment.  I wish to read into the record a letter from Jane Sellers and Loretta Neary of Dunlavin in County Wicklow, who are very involved in beekeeping:<\/p><blockquote>When you deliberate on the Heritage Bill please be aware of the following facts: honey bees and other pollinators are entirely reliant on flowers for their food, which is pollen and nectar; in many parts of Ireland hedgerows and scrub are the only sources of flowering plants and habitat; to cut, grub or burn flowering vegetation at any time of the year is to deprive pollinating insects of food; to cut hedges or verges in August is to destroy a food source vital to bees as they gather pollen and nectar to store for winter; to grub and burn flowering vegetation in March is to destroy a food source vital to bees as they emerge from winter; important hedgerow and verge\/ditch species that flower in August include blackberry, rosebay, ivy, meadowsweet, gorse.  Important species of scrub that flower in March include gorse, willow, hazel and alder.<\/blockquote><p>Arguments are mounting that we have to take a step back from the Bill as it stands and revaluate it along with those interested groups and those affected by the Bill such as NGOs, the IFA, the Road Safety Authority and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  As a nation, we must ensure our roads are safe and that our farming community can work with biodiversity and make a living out of it and also ensure our biodiversity is kept up to scratch.  Question marks have been raised about EU payments and the European habitat and birds directive and I would be interested to find out more about that.  There would be a case taken to the European court if the Bill is passed in its current form.  I would like there to be a step back from this.  I will be opposing the Bill and calling for a vote on its progression to the next Stage.  We should work together to ensure that any changes to canals and our heritage have to be taken on board by everybody and ensure no one is prohibited from pursuing their way of life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900007#E00200","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510224600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for bringing forward the Bill.  There are certain aspects of it on which I would like further clarity but it is a move in the right direction and one we should have made long ago.  That would have avoided a hell of a lot of issues we are dealing with today, including people being killed on roadsides by falling trees, as well as the problem of illegal burning that is not being properly controlled.  The Bill goes some way toward tackling those issues, although it needs further clarity which will hopefully be delivered in the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  As regards verge cutting, rural Ireland, and in particular a huge percentage of the area I represent in Cork South-West, is in a state of disarray in respect of overgrowth on roadsides.  I put forward a motion to Cork County Council approximately two and a half years ago while I was a councillor that it would carry out a survey on overgrown trees on the roadside in west Cork.  I am sad to say that survey never took place.  We were lucky not to have experienced more damage about a month ago when there was a severe storm because everything I said at that time came true.  We have a lot to commend the ESB for because if it was not for the ESB cables and poles holding up trees in west Cork there would have been a severe loss of life.  We were lucky to have a very good radio station that warned people to stay inside.  There were trees flying down onto roadsides left, right and centre during the storm, which had gusts of 191 km\/h.<\/p>  <p>  People, and Deputies in particular, in urban Ireland do not have a clue what is going on in rural Ireland.  They go on about birds and bees but do not understand that the farmers of west Cork and Ireland protect our birds and bees to the best of our ability.  Common sense has to come into play.  It has not been in play in respect of verge cutting for many years.  My worry is that verge cutting will be extended to August on a trial basis.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>There should be no trial basis.  It is common sense to cut verges and I will prove it to the Minister.  Fair play to Cork County Council - I give praise where praise is due - it has come up with a great verge cutting scheme in west Cork.  It is a fabulous scheme, under which local communities can apply for funding to cut verges.  In my proud community council area of Goleen every single community applied for a grant.  Every community saw a need to do so as simply roads were closed.  I received a call from a holiday maker in Goleen in July who asked: \"In the name of God, what is wrong?  I cannot go up my road.  It is closed from both sides.\"  Common sense should have been applied.  There should have been no need to ring the local authority or fill in forms.  Verges should be cut and clean and tidy.  If they had been, there would have been no need for that gentleman to worry.  Unfortunately, because of the system in place, we could not go near them and it was disappointing for me to have to tell him.<\/p> <p> When grant application forms were put on the table, every community council, all of which have a lot of environmental protection thoughts on their minds, jumped at the opportunity because they knew that it was a necessity to apply.  Communities in areas such as Lowertown, Toormore, Rathoora, Goleen and Cloghankilleen to Mizen Head and Crookhaven, as well as Caher, Letter and Arduslough applied for grant aid and thankfully received it.  They are now cutting verges which should not be cut at all in November or December.  They should have been cut two or three months ago when we had to protect the tourism industry.  We have people renting cars who will not get back their deposit because cars are being torn asunder in visiting beautiful parts of the world.  It is absolutely farcical.  <\/p> <p> This is a move in the right direction, but it should not be done on a trial basis.  It should be simple and solid.  We should cut verges because lives will be lost if they are not cut.  It should come from the top in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that every local authority should carry out a survey of trees growing along the roadside.  There should be strict regulations such that every tree would be cut before people's lives were lost and they are being lost.  People are worrying about the bringing forward of a drink driving Bill, but there is no such worry about those who are being killed or nearly killed or seriously injured by trees.  Far more people are going to be hurt than as a result of the carry on with the drink driving Bill.<\/p> <p> I will move on to another issue on which I seek clarity.  It is the issue of burning.  I am a farmer and met officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in Portlaoise before I came a Deputy.  I told them that they would be the cause of an inferno and they were.  They fined farmers for having gorse on their farms.  They fined them a sum of &euro;5,000 and made the fines retrospective by four or five years.  They are terrorising farmers.  What can they do?  They cannot leave the gorse or burn it because it is wet.  There is no proper burning season.  I am in discussions with the ICSA and the IFA to see if can we come up with some procedure as we cannot work within the system in place.  Basically, farmers are being forced out of business.  They will be fined out of business by the Department if they do not get rid of the gorse and they cannot burn it because there is no burning season.<\/p> <p> We are lucky that Muintir na T&iacute;re and Mr. Diarmuid Cronin are arranging for controlled burning.  I hope that in the next few weeks all stakeholders will be around the table or rather on the ground and that there will be controlled burning, which I would welcome.  However, the season must be extended.  If it is, there will be legal burning.  We must also stop blaming farmers.  In 99% of cases, they are not to blame.  In some cases, their land is being burned unbeknownst to them or the fire is spreading over the ditch from some other person's land.  In a lot of cases, there is messing at the side of the road at night time.  People get a thrill out of seeing the property of others burning.<\/p> <p> It is fine to talk about burning; it sounds beautiful for those living in an urban area who look out and see the Luas and beautiful taxis.  They will not have to worry about briars, bushes and trees.  I am sorry, but we do.  We are realists.  I welcome the movement being made to provide for burning and verge cutting, but we need to go further.  We need clarity.  It is not good enough that it is being done on a trial basis.  It has to be embedded in concrete.  I welcome many aspects of the Bill and appreciate that the Minister is doing her best to adopt a common sense approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900008#F00200","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510225200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank all of the Deputies who have participated in the debate.  I congratulate Deputy Catherine Martin who spoke last night on her election as chairperson of the women's caucus.<\/p>  <p>  I stress that the amendments to the Canals Act are primarily enabling provisions to allow Waterways Ireland to make by-laws to regulate boating on canals and manage their use.  They were developed on the basis of legal advice to ensure the by-laws would be legally robust.  The draft by-laws will be subject to public consultation for a period of up to 90 days and any person can submit objections to them.  Waterways Ireland shall consider the objections and the consent of the Minister will have to be obtained for the by-laws which will be subject to review every five years and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation and the by-laws that will emanate from it will enhance the ability of Waterways Ireland to manage the Royal Canal, the Grand Canal and the Barrow Navigation for the benefit of all of their users.  Last night Deputy Niamh Smyth referred to the Ulster Canal.  It is a priority for me and I am delighted that work has been well progressed on the first section of the canal, from Belturbet to Castle Saunderson where the bridge is almost complete.  I am glad to see that the work is continuing apace. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding hedge cutting and burning, a number of Deputies referred to the provisions in section 7 of the Bill.  Deputies will be aware that an amendment was passed in Seanad &Eacute;ireann to restrict the cutting of hedges in August to roadsides only.  It is proposed to harmonise section 8 of the Bill with the provisions of the Roads Act on the cutting of hedgerows for road safety purposes.  As I have stated, there is a conflict between the Roads Act and the Wildlife Act.  The divergence of law between the two makes no sense.  We must avoid confusion and inconsistency in order that the courts can interpret the law and deal with breaches of it.  The provision included in section 8 has been designed to harmonise the two items of legislation, clear up any confusion and remove conflict.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne has been misinformed.  This is a complex issue, but I will try to explain it.  We have the Roads Act, for which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is responsible.  Under that Act, the owner or occupier of land shall take all reasonable steps to ensure a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation is not a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road and that it will not obstruct or interfere with the safe use or maintenance of a public road.  He or she, therefore, is meant to take reasonable steps.  On the other hand, the Wildlife Act states very clearly that a person cannot interfere with the hedges in the period referred to.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport cannot amend the Wildlife Act which is the Act which prohibits hedge cutting along the roadside.  It is my responsibility to amend it.  Landowners were always permitted and even obliged under the Roads Act to cut hedges for the purposes of road safety.  It is not correct for the Deputy to suggest there is somehow fraud involved in bringing the Wildlife Act into line with the Roads Act.  That is unjustified.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is not about the widespread and heavy cutting of hedges.  It will simply allow a person to trim a hedge in the month of August in certain instances only.   In that regard, any trimming of hedges in August may only be of the current season's growth and may only be carried out along the roadside.  This affects only a small percentage of the overall number of hedgerows in the country.  If heavier cutting is required such as grubbing or flailing, it must be carried out during the current permitted period of September to the end of February.<\/p><p>They can continue to do so during the existing permitted period which runs from September to the end of February.  This is a two-year pilot project.  My Department will carry out studies to determine what effects, if any, emerge during this pilot phase.  The expert advice of officials in the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, however, is that hedge-trimming of this nature in August is unlikely to have much of a direct impact because of the scale involved.  This will be a managed and measured regime and will be subject to clear guidelines.  It will strike an appropriate balance between protecting our wildlife and allowing for common sense trimming of hedges in certain instances only.<\/p> <p> There has been a lot of misinformation and scaremongering about this Bill.  This Bill will not make it compulsory for anybody to cut a hedge in August.  If a hedge is blocking the view of road users, however, the landowner will now be able to trim back that hedge in August.  This is a serious issue on local byroads in rural Ireland where hedges are growing out on the roads, damaging cars and restricting the views of motorists.  There is of course a provision whereby local authorities can cut hedges in the interests of road safety but the reality is that local authorities simply do not have the manpower or the resources to be out on every byroad in the country inspecting and trimming hedges.  Anybody living in rural Ireland will be aware of this.  We cannot have a situation where cars are damaged and accidents caused because drivers cannot see around corners due to overgrown hedges.  The proposal in the Heritage Bill 2016 represents a moderate and common sense solution to address this problem.<\/p> <p> The curlew was mentioned.  I have established a special curlew task force to examine what steps can be taken to support the native curlew, something that has been warmly welcomed by groups such as Birdwatch Ireland.  Like many Deputies in this House, I too am from rural Ireland and I respect our farming community and its contribution to the local economy in rural areas.  Our farmers are the custodians of our countryside and any suggestion that they are indifferent to our natural heritage and wildlife is complete nonsense.  Farmers are not seeking to cause harm or damage.  All they want is the flexibility to carry out their own work in a manner that also respects our biodiversity.  Deputy Breathnach is right when he says that we need to strike a balance and that is what this Bill does.<\/p> <p> With regard to the burning provisions, I echo the Deputies who condemned the spate of illegal burning in certain parts of the country during the spring and summer periods.  There is a misconception, however, that this Bill will allow for the extension of the burning season into March and therefore allow all landowners to burn vegetation on any day during the month.  I want to make it clear that the provision is not a blanket approval to allow indiscriminate burning of vegetation in March.  This legislation, rather, will allow me to make regulations to allow burning in certain areas of the country, in a particular county or parts of a county, at specified periods in the month of March.  I want to work with landowners in this respect.  This Bill does not allow for widespread burning of vegetation.  I also point out that in both Britain and in Northern Ireland the burning of vegetation is allowed up until the middle of April.  What I am proposing, then, could not be considered an indiscriminate or unreasonable measure.  The forthcoming regulations and best practice guidelines will provide guidance to landowners on a number of issues, including rotational burning; that species and habitat consideration should be to the fore in planned burning; and the need to liaise with relevant authorities and local fire service personnel.  What is proposed here is, in essence, the potential extension by a maximum of four weeks to the period during which controlled and responsible burning may be carried out.  This will be limited to particular areas and subject to statutory regulation.  Such controlled land management activities in March have nothing at all to do with the kind of burning incidents we witnessed during the summer.<\/p> <p> I note the contributions made by some Members on the impact of the burning and hedge-cutting provisions on bird life, especially on the nesting period for various species.  I want to assure Members that the regulations that will be drafted to give effect to these provisions will take account of the nesting period as well as of our obligations under EU nature directives.  Deputies Fitzmaurice and Michael Collins pointed out that we all depend on the people of rural Ireland to preserve our countryside and I agree with them on this.  Like many other rural Deputies, we were reared in rural Ireland to respect our countryside and to look after it.<\/p> <p> With regard to the Heritage Council, I stress that the changes mainly relate to governance procedures and have arisen as the result of a detailed review undertaken in 2012.  I agree with Deputy O'Dowd that the Heritage Council and its local heritage officers have done great work in engaging with local communities and indeed, through the schools programme, with young people in order to encourage them to connect with and preserve our heritage.<\/p> <p> Historic towns were also mentioned.  In 2014 we ran a very successful pilot programme in three historic towns - Westport, Youghal and Listowel - in partnership with the Heritage Council and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Beginning in 2018, we hope to roll this out to more towns in the coming years.  I consider this very important.<\/p> <p> I look forward to further constructive discussion and debate on the next Stage.

Ten years ago there were 21,000 people on waiting lists for surgical and medical treatments and day-case or diagnostic treatments.  Yesterday the list showed that there were 684,800 patients waiting on lists of various types: outpatient, 494,530; inpatient day-case, 80,894; endoscopy - active, 19,300; inpatient day-case, 18,000; inpatient day-case planned procedures, 11,700; planned procedures for endoscopy, 51,000; and endoscopy, 8,294.  The reason I reference all those lists is simply that nobody knows how many people are waiting anymore because we consistently change the goalposts.  We consistently change how we assess the numbers of people on waiting lists.  We now have a situation where we have so-called suspended lists.  One is suspended from the list, one is in abeyance, and then one is brought back onto an active list at some stage.  People suffering with juvenile arthritis, scoliosis and several other paediatric illnesses and diseases are waiting inordinate periods of time for outpatient and inpatient procedures.  It is wholly unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  In the NHS in England, there are 1,511 people waiting more than a year for an inpatient appointment.  In Galway hospital alone, there are 2,914 waiting more than a year for an inpatient appointment.  The fact of the matter is the health services are in crisis.  Yesterday, if the T&aacute;naiste wanted to seek clarity on that, all she had to do was read the Minister's two press releases, both contradictory, one trying to correct the other in terms of targets achieved and targets missed, numbers who were seen and numbers who were not seen.  There were corrections even in the context of the press releases sent out.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, we have a situation where advertisements are being issued for winter readiness and proofing of the health services for winter.

It is a priority for the Minister for Health, as every action he has taken supports that.  This is shown by the budget that has been given for the health service, the new initiatives, the increase in the funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the &euro;1 million per week extra that will be spent on dealing with waiting lists, and the fact that the trend is downward.<\/p>  <p>  There is much work to be done.  Nobody questions that.  I ask the Deputy to look at four hospitals with the lowest numbers on trolleys since 2006, Beaumont, Mayo, Cavan and Connolly.  It is important to note this progress.<\/p>  <p>  No doubt there is a huge challenge.  Given the demographics, the fact people are living longer and the demand on the health services, and as we develop more primary care centres, of course, the demand continues in the hospitals.  It is important to note that the home care packages, numbering 45 extra a week, will help deal with these issues because people will be able to get the services they need at home.<\/p>  <p>  The truth in regard to waiting lists is that the latest NTPF figures show that the number of patients waiting for a procedure has fallen by over 2,000 in the past month and it is the third month in a row the inpatient day-case list has fallen.  This is the category of patients who are actively waiting for treatment and these reductions have to be seen as real progress.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the Deputy's point that more needs to be done - we cannot relax for one moment in regard to this because of the level of demand - but let us look at what is happening in the context of the trend being downward.  There were significant decreases in October in both the 15-to-18 month waiting list, which was down over 1,000, and the over 18 months category, which was down over 1,000.  For the second month in a row, there was also a decrease in the total number of patients waiting for an outpatient appointment with 788 fewer patients waiting for an outpatient appointment.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's point that patients were suspended because their doctors had decided they were unfit or unable to attend for clinical or personal social reasons, that is a reasonable thing to do because the people were not in a position to take up the appointments, and Deputy Kelleher himself asked for this.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has accepted the Deputy's broader point about the accuracy of waiting lists and how waiting lists in this country compare with those internationally.  Trinity College is conducting a study on how waiting lists are compiled in this country and how it compares internationally and we will have that information at the beginning of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900011#N00300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1510226400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>If the T&aacute;naiste wanted any evidence that our health services are in crisis, all she need do is go over to the Oireachtas print shop and see the number of Fine Gael Ministers and Deputies dispensing leaflets pointing out that one can get EU cross-border treatment and avail of treatment abroad schemes.

The purpose of the hearing was to consider whether the warning against taking the drug while pregnant was strong enough.  It followed on from a review in 2014 based on which the European Medicines Agency took the decision to strengthen the restrictions on valproate containing medicines owing to the risk of malformations and developmental problems in children exposed to the drug in the womb.  The agency's most recent summary guide for health care professionals on the risks associated with valproate for female patients issued in 2016 states: \"Sodium valproate should not be used in female children, in female adolescents, in women of childbearing potential and pregnant women unless alternative treatments are ineffective or not tolerated because of its high teratogenic potential and risk of developmental disorders in infants exposed in utero to valproate\".  In its most recent valproate patient toolkit the HSE states: \"If you take valproate when you are pregnant it can harm your unborn child\".  The leaflet goes on to state that for women who take valproate while pregnant around ten babies in every 100 will have a birth defect and that about 30 to 40 children in every 100 may suffer from developmental problems.  Shockingly, it was only earlier this year that instructions were issued to include a warning label for the outer packaging of Epilim products that had been introduced in Ireland, but they still not being adhered to everywhere.  Unfortunately, these measures have come too late for some.  A number of women in Ireland, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery, were not informed about the harmful repercussions for their unborn child when they were prescribed and took sodium valproate while pregnant.  In 2013 Epilepsy Ireland estimated that the drug had affected at least 400 children.  The syndrome which affects these children is known as foetal anticonvulsant syndrome or foetal valproate syndrome.  It can give rise to spina bifida, heart defects, breathing difficulties, overlapping fingers and toes, club foot, hip dislocation and distinctive facial characteristics.  <\/p>  <p>  Last week I met Karen, Wendy and Susan, all of whom had been prescribed sodium valproate while pregnant and all of whom have children with foetal valproate syndrome.  They are not looking for much.  Will the Government undertake an investigation into the current and historical use of the drug?  Will it acknowledge that these women should be compensated for the impact of the drug on their families?  Will it also commit to establishing a State-wide register for those who are on the medicine and those who will be prescribed it in the future, as well as a register for the children who have been affected by foetal anticonvulsant syndrome caused by exposure to sodium valproate?  As a matter of urgency, will it put in place appropriate pathways for the diagnosis and treatment of foetal anticonvulsant syndrome, as well as providing additional services for children with the syndrome?  Previous Governments did not exactly cover themselves in glory when it came to women's health issues.  We have seen Taoisigh and Ministers for Health stand where the T&aacute;naiste is and apologise to women.  She has a chance to do this right.

I am not familiar with the details of the particular drug, but the Minister for Health is informed on issues such as this by the Chief Medical Officer, CMO and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, which regulates the use of medicines and drugs.

One such provision was a statutory right to develop and have respected, as practicable, advance health care directives.  Advance health care directives are documents in which a person specifies what action should be taken if in the future he or she is no longer able to make decisions for himself or herself because of illness or incapacity.  A well known example of such a directive is what is called a DNR - do not resuscitate.<\/p><p>Should a patient ordinarily require cardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR, or ventilation, this treatment will not be administered.  These directives can be particularly important in mental health care, where empowering people to involve themselves in their care and recovery has been demonstrated to help improve outcomes.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, while providing for directives, excludes people being treated as involuntary patients in mental health services.  An involuntary patient does not, by definition, lack the capacity to make any decisions about care.  This is very clear in legislation, despite the exclusion of such patients from having the right to advance health care directives.<\/p> <p> This amending Bill would remove that block on involuntary patients with capacity forming advance health care directives.  It was developed by Mental Health Reform and in conjunction with Sinn F&eacute;in.  The amending Bill explicitly refers to the inclusion of involuntary patients in the definitions section.  It also removes the section that blocks involuntary patients from this right.  An advance health care directive is a legal document in which a person specifies what action should be taken for health purposes if the person is no longer able to make decisions because of illness or incapacity.  These are provided under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, which has yet to be commenced, but only for voluntary patients.  As involuntary patients do not necessarily lack capacity and advance health care directives are often drafted by patients who have capacity, this is a very unfair separation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900015#R03500","speaker":"1279","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510229400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900016#S00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510229400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900016#S00300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1510229400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>As this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900016#S00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510229400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900016#S00500","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510229400,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Multi-Party Actions Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1510229400,"counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900016#S00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1510229400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for certain procedural and other changes in civil actions so as to provide for the bringing of Multi-Party Actions; to reduce the cost of litigation; and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>T&aacute; m&eacute; an-sh&aacute;sta a thairiscint inniu go dtabharfar cead chun an Bhille um Chaingne Ilph&aacute;irt&iacute; a thabhairt isteach.

We intend to move to Second Stage during our Private Members' time next week.  The legislation that will be discussed is a potential game changer in how the courts deal with cases where large categories of people are affected by a particular injustice and inequity and share a common issue of fact or law.  There are numerous examples of people, including victims of the tracker mortgage scandal, defective medical products or fraud on an institutional basis, who could potentially benefit from these processes.<\/p><p>Currently, the only real option for such persons is for a test case to proceed and related cases to follow on the basis of precedent.  Our model has significant advantages over that, with the primary benefit being it would reduce the cost of litigation, duplication and cost of representation.  It would make better use of court resources and, crucially, improve access to justice.  Our proposal is heavily grounded in the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission paper on multi-party litigation from 2005, which, unfortunately, has sat on the shelf since.  There are many people who are the victims of injustice and who would have an actionable case, for example, in a tort or breach of contract, but the cost of taking this on makes it effectively impossible.  This Bill brings access to justice within the grasp of such people.<\/p><p>The most current example is the tracker mortgage issue and the duplicitous, dishonest and scandalous manner in which the banks have treated the victims.  The Government has essentially facilitated them in doing this.  The banks have essentially taken advantage of the fact that those affected are often not in a position to take action individually because of the financial cost involved.  This Bill will allow for people to proceed on the basis of strength in numbers and it will embolden many to become part of an action where previously the fear of costs may have intimidated them.  This has the potential to revolutionise how cases like this are heard.  We are far behind comparable jurisdictions in not having an avenue to justice like this.  It could have a similar effect as processes like class action in the United States or the group legal order in the UK.  We want to give those who are affected by this and other injustices the tools to take on the banks or any other institution, body or individual.  We hope all parties will support this legislation and allow it pass through these Houses without delay.<\/p><p>I will briefly go through the sections.  Section 1 is the interpretation element and section 2 provides for certification.  This would be a judicially controlled process where an applicant would consult the courts service as to whether a previously certified multi-party action is relevant.  When certifying, the nominated judge must consider whether it is likely there will be multiple cases giving rise to multi-party action issues and if it offers an appropriate, fair and efficient procedure for the resolution of multi-party action issues.  Where certified, the nominated judge would make a multi-party action order.  Section 3 governs that order and section 4 governs the process for joining the multi-party action register, which will contain the names and details of all parties taking the multi-party action.<\/p><p>Section 5 relates to the directions the judge may give as to the resolution of the order, including the details required in the documentation, the cause of action and any further such directions.  This section offers a crucial degree of flexibility in terms of division of the various elements of the case.  Section 6 relates to the lead solicitor, who would lead the multi-party action.  Section 7 relates to the lead cases or case, to be agreed by case conference as to whether it adequately and fairly represents the interests of all those on the register.  Section 8 relates to the effect of a multi-party order and the circumstances in which it is binding.  Section 9 provides for the costs where costs shall be divided equally, unless the judge orders otherwise, and members of the order shall be jointly and severally liable.  Section 10 provides that nothing in the Act shall be construed as limiting or reducing the power of any authority to make rules regarding the practice and procedures of court, provided they are consistent with the provisions of the Bill.  Section 11 is the Short Title and commencement.<\/p><p>I encourage all parties to support this legislation and the principles therein have been supported publicly, at least in commentary, by several parties, including the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il.  I hope they will support this legislation and I hope the Government will consider it as well.

It set the issue as a priority and devoted a meeting to examining these benefits on 24 November 2016.  At this meeting the committee heard evidence from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, a specialist neurologist with an interest in epilepsy and the mother of a young girl who suffers from intractable epilepsy.  The Joint Committee on Health is very supportive of making medicinal cannabinoids available to patients who do not respond to conventional medication.  On 19 January 2017 the committee produced a report on medicinal cannabinoids.  In that report the committee noted that, despite the encouraging medicinal possibilities offered by cannabis and cannabinoids, there is still a shortage of peer-reviewed evidence for the efficacy and safety of cannabinoid treatment for many conditions and that potential benefits had to be balanced against risks.  The report stated that we should therefore pursue a careful yet committed course of action in engaging with medicinal cannabinoids.<\/p><p>Also in November 2016, the Minister for Health tasked the HPRA with producing a report on the subject of cannabinoids and their medicinal efficacy.  That HPRA report, Cannabis for Medicinal Use - A Scientific Review, was completed on 31 January 2017 and published by the Minister for Health on 12 February.  The health committee held a meeting to discuss the report on 7 March.  Thus, it has demonstrated a commitment to making available regulated, safe, efficacious cannabis-based products for patients through prescription for conditions that have a proven response and in respect of which the products are well tolerated.<\/p> <p> The Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 was debated in the D&aacute;il on Second Stage on 1 December 2016, after which it was referred to the health committee without a vote.  The committee decided to conduct a detailed scrutiny of the Bill before it proceeded to Committee Stage.  In that regard, it met on 5 April 2017 when it heard evidence from the Bill's sponsor, Deputy Gino Kenny, who was accompanied by a consultant psychiatrist and a professor of pharmacology.<\/p> <p> The committee held a second meeting on 13 April when it heard evidence from officials of the Department of Health, together with officeholders from the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, on their respective views on the content of the Bill.  Thus, the committee has held four meetings on this issue in the past year. <\/p> <p> Based on its consideration, the committee has determined that the Bill has technical issues and implementation difficulties, that it may have unintended policy consequences, including leakage of supply of cannabis to recreational markets and a lack of safeguards against harmful use of cannabis by patients.  It also determined that there were major legal issues, given that the numerous amendments that would be necessary to reconcile the Bill with existing law would be onerous, and that access to medicinal cannabis in Ireland would be better achieved through an access programme and secondary legislation, which the committee has been informed is under preparation.  Therefore, it recommended that the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 not proceed to Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> The purpose of the Bill is to make cannabis available as a medicinal product for individuals who receive certification from a registered doctor.  To that end, it proposes the foundation of a cannabis regulatory authority that would regulate the sale of medicinal cannabis and oversee a system allowing pharmacies to receive licences to sell medicinal cannabis. <\/p> <p> While the committee appreciates Deputy Gino Kenny's statement that his aim in sponsoring the Bill is to alleviate unnecessary suffering, aspects of the Bill cause it to be concerned that it may not be possible to reconcile the Bill with its above-mentioned careful approach to medicinal cannabis.  The committee is concerned that the Bill proposes the removal of cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 as a controlled substance, meaning that it could have major unintended policy consequences, decriminalising cannabis in non-medicinal circumstances.  This seems to conflict with the intention of the Bill which is to make cannabis available specifically for medicinal use, as expressed in the Title.  It is the view of the committee that the decriminalisation of cannabis is not a safe course of action as the cannabis plant has many psychoactive effects that are potentially harmful.  The Bill is as much about decriminalising the use of cannabis as it is about promoting it for medicinal use.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is the relevant Minister quoted in the Bill, indicating that decriminalisation is the Bill&rsquo;s main focus.<\/p> <p> The committee is also concerned that the Bill's proposal to establish a cannabis regulatory authority to regulate cannabis would establish a parallel system of regulation, duplicating the functions of the HPRA, and allow a substance that has not received authorisation from the HPRA to be considered a medicine.  This would be an unusual departure which would subvert the agency&rsquo;s regulatory authority and ignore its expert advice that herbal cannabis is not capable of being authorised as a medicine and could create an undesirable precedent. <\/p> <p> Advocates of the Bill state the HPRA is not willing to regulate cannabis.  It is not possible, however, to regulate the whole-plant extract of the cannabis plant which has over 100 varieties and several hundred components.  Authorised medicines must be of high quality, safe and effective.  Furthermore, the system of access to medicinal cannabis proposed in the Bill appears to the committee to be too loose to guard effectively against leakage of supply to recreational users, could lead to overuse by patients and could have unanticipated harmful effects owing to side effects and interactions with other medicines. <\/p> <p> The Bill would allow a doctor to certify a person as having a condition that could be reasonably treated by cannabis without having to stipulate a dosage or a finite period for treatment.  There is no provision in the Bill for stipulating the type of cannabinoid product a patient should be treated with.  There is no reference in the Bill to the medical indications for cannabis certification by a doctor.  A lack of specific indications for a product that has no authorisation from the HPRA would raise many legal and medical indemnity issues. <\/p> <p> A certificate is fundamentally different from a prescription.  Evidence was given to the committee by the Bill's sponsor that a doctor's certification was to be used as evidence to protect the holder of the certificate from prosecution and unnecessary criminalisation if found in possession of cannabis.  Doctors could be pressurised to provide certificates for reasons other than medicinal purposes.  Evidence was given to the committee that regulation of medicinal cannabis was key to its availability, yet the Bill does not define what the term \"medicinal cannabis\" means.  Therefore, it would be very difficult to regulate an ill-defined product.<\/p> <p> Embedded in the cannabis plant are cannabinoids which act on the endocannabinoidal system in the human body and have medicinal properties.  Whole-plant extract, however, also contains many other chemicals that are psychoactive and potentially harmful.  The isolation of cannabinoids which have proven medicinal beneficial effects and scientifically proven efficacy and safety is the key to developing medicinal cannabis products that can be legally prescribed and dispensed. <\/p> <p> Although the Bill limits the maximum amount of cannabis to be sold per transaction as one ounce, the committee cannot identify any provision which limits the number of transactions.  The committee cannot identify any provision in the Bill for medical follow-up or supervision beyond initial certification, to monitor potential negative side effects or interactions with other medications.  It is, therefore, worried that any individual who receives certification from a doctor would then be able to buy as much cannabis as he or she wanted indefinitely, without continued medical supervision. <\/p> <p> Normally medication is prescribed with reference to strength in milligrams and instructions are given on frequency and length of use.  Such stipulations are not mentioned in the Bill.<\/p> <p> The sponsor of the Bill proposes that whole or full plant extract be made available in whatever form, including smoking cannabis, when used for medicinal purposes.  The method of consumption would the patient's prerogative.  That is entirely unacceptable to the committee.  Smoking cannabis is not recommended as an acceptable method of use for medicinal purposes.<\/p> <p> The committee also wishes to draw attention to the use of the word \"consumer\" rather than \"patient\" in the Bill to describe medicinal users of cannabis.  The Bill's use of imperial measurements which implies selling cannabis by weight rather than strength in milligrams which is the convention in medical prescriptions is unacceptable.  Also, the Bill suggests the proposed cannabis research institute commission research on cannabis for recreational use, as well as medicinal use.  Additionally, the institute would promote public awareness of cannabis as to its safe use.  This element of the Bill seems contrary to its purpose. <\/p> <p> Although the committee has outlined a number of discrete problems in the drafting of the Bill, some of which may be more easily fixed through amendments than others, the underlying approach of the Bill proposes a system of access to medicinal cannabis that would be much looser than the committee considers prudent.  Therefore, a central element of the Bill is irreconcilable with the committee's views on how medicinal cannabis should be approached.  The committee favours a gradual introduction of medicinal cannabis that is evidence-led for each condition for which access is approved, as endorsed by the usual regulatory authority for medicines in this jurisdiction and which has the benefit of close monitoring by medical professionals of the effects of treatment.  The committee has been informed that such an approach is being pursued by the Minister for Health and his officials.  Departmental officials told the committee members in their engagement with them on 13 April that an expert reference group had been established and that it was drafting guidelines to facilitate the use of cannabis treatments under an access programme.  That work is being informed by the HPRA. <\/p> <p> The committee understands the Department will progress statutory instruments to advance the access programme.  The committee views such an access programme as a more careful and desirable method of introducing medicinal cannabis to Ireland and, therefore, views the continued advancement of the Bill under scrutiny as duplicative and undermining of the access programme proposed.<\/p><p>Having received legal advice, the committee is satisfied that enacting the Bill as it stands would create legislative contradictions between the Bill and existing Acts.  Resolving such contradictions by amendment of this Bill or of other Acts appears to the committee to be an onerous undertaking, quite apart from the further redrafting which would be necessary to avoid undesirable policy consequences.<\/p> <p> The committee understands that sections 42 and 43 of the Bill, as drafted, would legalise cannabis entirely, as the 1977 Act would cease to apply to cannabis.  That seems to conflict with the intention of the Bill, which is to make cannabis available specifically in medicinal circumstances.  If those sections were to proceed without significant amendment, they may also necessitate amendment of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016, as well as having complicated implications for extradition law.<\/p> <p> The Bill may necessitate amendment to the Health Acts 1947 to 2015, the Pharmacopoeia Acts 1931 and 1977, the Poisons Acts 1961 and 1977 and the Pharmacy Acts 1875 to 1977, and other legislation, affected by the medicinal prescription of cannabis.  Differing definitions of cannabis between the Bill and the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 creates a possibility that the differing interpretations could be exploited in the criminal justice context.  The enactment of the Bill would possibly give rise to the need to amend the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 and Misuse of Drugs Act 1984.<\/p> <p> The Bill's creation of offences without prescribing corresponding penalties conflicts with the 1977 Act which provides both offences and penalties.  Sections 16, 18 and 19 of the Bill, respectively, provide for licences to wholesale, import, and cultivate cannabis.  The committee understands that those would require the amendment of sections 3, 15, 15A, 15B, 17 and 19 of the Misuse of Drugs 1977 Act.  Section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, which defines drug trafficking, might need to be amended.  Section 15 of the 1977 Act would need to be amended to allow a parent to give medicinal cannabis to their child.  Based on all the considerations, as outlined above, the committee recommends that the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 should not proceed to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900020#Z04300","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510233000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to have this report.  I begin by thanking the Joint Committee on Health and all its members for the incredible work they put into considering this issue and for the unanimous report they produced which we are debating today on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  The last time we met to debate the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016, we agreed not to divide this House because there is much common ground between us.  We all wish to help patients for whom medicinal cannabis may be a treatment option.<\/p>  <p>  I again acknowledge the significant work undertaken by Deputy Harty and all the members of the committee on this Bill.  The committee heard testimony from a number of interested parties, including the Bill's sponsor, Deputy Gino Kenny, the Department of Health, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Health Products Regulatory Authority.  The committee members carefully considered the views and concerns expressed and they went further in seeking their own legal advice on the Bill.  While the committee has determined that the Bill has technical and implementation issues and that it may have unintended policy consequences it also decided unanimously that the best way to proceed is on the grounds of a compassionate access programme.  Today, the Government finds itself in a rather bizarre position in that it supports the unanimous cross-party report on the Bill only to find out that the authors of the Bill may now have a different view on how to proceed.  I am happy to tease that out because ultimately we all want to try to help patients who might benefit from the use of medicinal cannabis.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Gino Kenny said the intention of the Bill is to make cannabis available to patients, but he is aware there is a number of worrying provisions in the Bill, including references to recreational use of cannabis, as well as proposed amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act which would mean that cannabis would no longer be a controlled drug and possession for personal or recreational use would not be an offence.  It is important to remember that we are talking about cannabis and we should proceed carefully.  As many of us are very much aware, cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in this country and that it is younger people who are particularly at risk from the effects of cannabis use, which can damage their mental health and their future prospects in life.  That is the medical evidence by the way not just my own view.  I think that most people in this House would acknowledge that there are significant concerns about the prevalence of recreational use of cannabis among people in society.  People can continue to distort this if they wish but while I strongly believe that Ireland should allow medicinal cannabis to be made available as a treatment option for certain medical conditions, I also strongly believe, that as Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, we have a duty to be guided by evidence-based best practice and consequently we must follow the advice of the medical and scientific community on how best to make the wish I think we all share a reality in terms of people's health.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Gino Kenny's Bill also proposes the establishment of two new State agencies, namely, the cannabis regulation authority and the cannabis research institute.  He has views in terms of how that could be addressed.  Those provisions would be in my view an attempt to bypass the existing regulatory systems that are in place for health products.  We discussed earlier the importance of those regulatory systems.  Like the health committee, I too do not see the need for more regulators in the area of health products when the HPRA already has extensive experience in regulating products for medical use, including controlled drugs used in the health care setting.  I have voiced those concerns in the past and the committee has similarly concluded that many of the provisions in this Bill would have undesirable consequences for the regulation and safe provision of health care so it is clear there is significant work to be done.<\/p>  <p>  The question of providing access to cannabis products that are not authorised as medicines is a complex but important matter.  While it has been reported that a lot of research has been carried out on the use of medicinal cannabis, there is much anecdotal evidence but not the type of clinical research that is the norm when medicines are authorised in this country or in other countries.  There is still a lot that is not known about the side effects of cannabis and about its interactions with other medicines that patients may already be taking.  Some cannabis products contain a chemical known as THC, which is psychoactive, meaning it has mind-altering effects and for that reason it is strictly controlled in this country under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  Other cannabis products that are of particular medical interest are those containing a single active ingredient known as CBD, which is not psychoactive and so is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts and can be prescribed by doctors without a need for a special licence.<\/p>  <p>  Given the complexities involved, any measures put in place to allow access to cannabis for medicinal purposes will need to be done in a cautious and controlled way and with the appropriate level of medical involvement for patients with long-term illnesses.  While we are looking for a solution to providing access to medicinal cannabis for those who need it, this has to be done with the appropriate involvement of medical consultants who are treating patients with complex illnesses.  That is where this Bill and I part company.  I want to put in place an access programme for medicinal cannabis that is authored by doctors.  This Bill is an attempt to put in place legislation from politicians.  We are not neurologists.  I have brought people together to try to progress that view and to make sure we have clinical buy-in.  I will address that in a moment.  I think we all share a common desire to make progress on the issue of medicinal cannabis.  We have accepted that approach and made progress as an Oireachtas in that regard.  I and many of my Government colleagues and Deputies from across the House have met with patients and their carers who passionately believe that cannabis should be available as a treatment option for various health conditions.  They want to do what is right for their patients, child, loved one or relative.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to make clear once again that, while cannabis is not currently viewed under Irish legislation as a product having medicinal use, there are already provisions under the Misuse of Drugs Acts to allow an Irish-registered consultant to apply for a licence for cannabis-based products for an individual patient.  The Chief Medical Officer, the top doctor, has advised that licences should only be granted in cases where a consultant has endorsed the proposed course of cannabis treatment.  Such applications can be considered on a case-by-case basis.  I have granted two licences for two separate individuals following receipt of valid licence applications.  Any application I receive endorsed or supported by a consultant will be granted.  That is the approach I have taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900022#BB00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1510233000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900022#BB00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1510233000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I have received two applications from consultants.

Separately and importantly, we are progressing well with work on the cannabis for medical use access programme.  That follows on from a commitment I gave to this House that there are better ways than primary legislation to achieve the same outcome whereby we can have a doctor-led compassionate access progress for medicinal cannabis.<\/p>  <p>  In February, I published the country's first ever policy review on this area, namely, the HPRA's report, Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review.  On foot of the conclusions of the regulatory body, namely, the HPRA - we know what happens in this country when we do not listen to regulators - I announced that I would establish a cannabis for medical use access programme for patients under the care of a consultant, for the following medical conditions, on the basis that they were the medical conditions recommended by the HPRA.<\/p><p>The conditions are spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, MS, nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, and treatment-resistant epilepsy.  I then put together an expert group chaired by the eminent Dr. M&aacute;ir&iacute;n Ryan from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  I established the group in March to develop operational, clinical and practise guidelines for the access programme.  There is no point having a piece of paper or report that cannot actually work in a doctor's office.  Dr. Ryan brought together an expert group to put the clinical and operational guidelines in place.  The group included medical consultants who treat epilepsy, MS, cancer and other serious illnesses, along with patient representatives, pharmacists and health regulators.  Considerable work has been undertaken by my officials and my Department to try to put in place the new access programme for medicinal cannabis for the first time ever in the country.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to inform the House that the expert group has drafted clinical guidelines.  The group has completed the targeted consultation and finalised the guidelines.  I thank Dr. Ryan, the patient representatives and the doctors who dedicated an extraordinary amount of time to ensuring that we can have clinical guidelines for a compassionate access programme.  Officials in my Department are now working on secondary legislation in the form of three statutory instruments that will underpin the access programme.  These statutory instruments will be finalised in December.  The expert reference group has made significant progress in developing the clinical guidelines for the programme.  However, further work is required in terms of how we source suitable quality-controlled cannabis-based products.  We must ensure we have a source for any product that can be accessed under the new scheme.<\/p> <p> I have no wish to conflate the issues, but should the point come up during the debate, I inform the House that my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, will put in place a review group under the national drugs and alcohol strategy to look at alternatives to criminal sanctions for personal use for some drugs.  The intention is to take a health-based approach in respect of drugs and drug addiction.  Shortly, the Minister of State will appoint a chairperson.  This is a key recommendation of our new national drugs strategy.<\/p> <p> I believe the Bill to be well-intentioned.  I have no doubt about that or about the commitment, passion and dedication of Deputy Kenny.  I do not believe this is a party political issue for him.  I accept his bona fides on the matter.  However, I have to take heed of the advice available to me as well as the advice, legal and otherwise, available to the Joint Committee on Health.  The advice was agreed unanimously by that committee.  The Bill would require significant amendment before it can proceed any further.

Unfortunately, Vera Twomey is not here today.  She collapsed outside the D&aacute;il today.  I hope she gets well soon.  I know she is here in spirit and that she will be back with us very soon.<\/p><p>I stood on this spot a year ago with a great deal of hope in my heart.  Obviously, the country was probably behind what we are trying to do.  We are trying to give safe and legal access to cannabis for people who need the medication.  The hundreds of people I have met over the past year shared my hope that they would be recognised as medical patients.  They had hoped that they could have safe and legal access to medicinal cannabis.  They had hoped to be able to come out of the shadows of darkness brought about by their illness.  It was not an illness they chose.  The illness chose them.<\/p><p>Today I stand here with despair, unfortunately.  I hope I am wrong.  This place can grind a person down sometimes, and we are all human.  I have been left with a sense of despair.  I will never give up in any sense.<\/p><p>Over the course of the past year, I believe our Bill has been completely sabotaged.  I was rather shocked by the shambolic nature of the pre-legislative scrutiny.  I believe it was politically motivated in some ways.  It was rigged.  Some of the comments made in the Joint Committee on Health were extraordinary, although I am not going to go into them now.  I believe the Committee on Health looked for every excuse to stymie progress of our Bill.  It is as simple as that.  Deputy Harty has said every conceivable negative thing about our Bill.  He has never said one positive thing about it, but there are positives aspects to it.<\/p><p>I am not saying the Bill is perfect by any means.  However, it is always amendable in my eyes.  Let us consider all the international evidence.  Those responsible had to abandon the compassionate access scheme in Germany because it was so restrictive.  The Minister's compassionate access scheme is extremely restrictive.  I will explain how restrictive it is.<\/p><p>The situation of Ava Barry is instructive.  I went to see her in the Netherlands.  It was a bittersweet experience.  It was sweet to see a child doing very well.  However, it was a bitter experience to see an Irish citizen in medical exile in Holland.  I came back ten times angrier.  I was angry that a child should have to go to another country to get simple medicine.  Over there, she can go to the pharmacy.  The pharmacist gives out the medication.  She gives her money and comes back to her house.  Is it not shambolic that an Irish citizen has to go to another country to do that?  Ava has been almost seizure-free since she went over there.  Under the compassionate access scheme that the Minister is promoting, she would be unable to access the scheme.  That is the simple truth.<\/p><p>I am keen to dispel some myths about our legislation.  I find it rather incredible that one of the pretexts set out in the Committee on Health report was that it would be too onerous to go through the Bill.  We are lawmakers.  We are elected to the D&aacute;il to change laws.  That is our job.  If it is an onerous task, then it is worth it.  I do not understand that point.<\/p><p>What really annoys me is the point about a shortage of peer-reviewed evidence.  The evidence is available.  It is coming out of people's ears.  Of course we need more research.  However, it seems that people want to hide behind that until kingdom come.  They say there is not enough peer-reviewed research, but there is.  It is only that certain people choose to look away.  There is ample evidence that people can greatly benefit from the Bill.<\/p><p>I have always said that we would look at the Bill objectively with anyone in this room, regardless of political persuasion.  I have no problem if people want to take out certain provisions.  The main thing is to give people legal access to medicinal cannabis.<\/p><p>I have a message for the Deputies in the Chamber who will be voting on this next week.  In my eyes, they will be on the wrong side of history, science, public opinion and international recognition.  No matter what happens after next week, our fight will continue.  The political establishment might be giving up on people, but we will never give up on the people who are in the Gallery.  They will never walk alone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900023#CC00400","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1510233600,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I went to the Joint Committee on Health with an open mind.  We facilitated pre-legislative scrutiny when we discussed the Bill in the D&aacute;il previously.  We intend to look at the option of allowing it to go to Committee Stage again.  However, there is no point in saying otherwise.  The Bill, as drafted, is seriously flawed.  This was highlighted in the discussions during pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Joint Committee on Health has overwhelmingly rejected the Bill in terms of its suitability for Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened to what has been said by the sponsors.  I hope they put on the record a willingness to accept the flaws highlighted in the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  There may need to be substantial amendments.  I hope all parties embrace this issue to ascertain whether we can produce meaningful legislation that will allow for access to medicinal cannabis in limited circumstances.<\/p><p>It is easy to make sweeping statements in the House setting out the pros of cannabis and claiming it is all good but it is a psychoactive drug which has highly damaging consequences for health.  Benzodiazepines may be legal medicines that are prescribed daily but they have catastrophic effects on people.  Just because a drug is prescribed does not mean it will always have only positive effects.  We must tread carefully on this issue.<\/p> <p> As I stated, Fianna F&aacute;il is willing to facilitate the Bill's passage to Committee State to enable a discussion to take place on how we can progress it in such as a way as to ensure the intentions outlined by the sponsors are realised.  We must not have cannabis becoming freely available, through prescription, to people other than those who need it for the reasons set out by the Minister in his access programme.  The programme is excessively restrictive, however.  It is appropriate that the Minister acts on the advice of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, on this issue but we must consider how the programme can be opened up, through consultants and the HPRA, to help people access it on a controlled basis.  As drafted, the Bill is deeply flawed.  I hope Deputies accept that and that if it proceeds to Committee Stage, it will be embraced in a non-partisan manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900023#CC00500","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510234200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I thank the Joint Committee on Health for the work it has done on this issue and Deputy Gino Kenny for introducing legislation on medicinal cannabis as it has focused minds on the issue.  I agree with Deputy Kenny that if a task is onerous, it does not mean it cannot be done.  It is not a question of laziness in the Civil Service or political circles.  If the Bill is flawed and requires work, as Deputy Kenny has acknowledged is the case, let us do the work.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad the Fianna F&aacute;il Party will facilitate the Bill's passage to Committee Stage and, onerous or not, the necessary improvements will be made to the compassionate programme in order that people will have access to medicinal cannabis.  I do not want cannabis to become available in every sweet shop for recreational use, nor is that the intention of anyone else.  Cannabis clearly has a medicinal benefit in treating a variety of conditions, although I appreciate that research in this area is ongoing.  In fairness to the Minister, he has tasked people with carrying out various reviews and producing proposals.  Let us move this issue forward quicker.  Refusing to allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage to allow us to try to make improvements to it, however onerous, and kicking it out on the never-never would be a betrayal of the many patients who could benefit from medicinal cannabis.<\/p>  <p>  Last night, I received a text from someone who is known to me and is not a typical recreational drug user.  He states he is unable to live the life he should be living, is on disability allowance and is not fit to attend college or full-time work, despite having tried to do so.  If, he asks, there is a plant that can relieve his pain, why can it not be safely prescribed by his doctors who want to help.  They have not been trained but want to be trained.  The text, which goes into much more detail, highlights the type of people and the variety of conditions who are holding out hope that Deputies, rather than pontificating endlessly, will make an honest effort to get this Bill to Committee Stage and make the necessary changes.  We must maintain the unanimity that was evident in the House on Second Stage in order that medicinal cannabis can be made available to patients who need it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900024#DD00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1510234200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Marc MacSharry for observing the time limit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900024#DD00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1510234200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I appeal to the Government to drop its opposition to the Bill proceeding to Committee Stage.

This is what is necessary because tens of thousands of people in this country are suffering from chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, the effects of nausea from chemotherapy and a host of other conditions for which there is, to quote the experts, strong evidence of the efficacy of medicinal cannabis.

He should read the Barnes report and stop interrupting me.  He spoke earlier and will have more time to respond.<\/p>  <p>  Witnesses at the committee stated the strongest evidence in respect of medicinal cannabis was on pain.  The joint committee's report states that pain is complex, which is correct.  However, we do not mind allowing opiates to be prescribed when there is widespread opiate addiction caused by opiate based painkillers and benzodiazepines.  We can regulate these products with the complexities of pain but cannot do so with medicinal cannabis, even though all the evidence shows that opiates are much more dangerous than medicinal cannabis.<\/p>  <p>  There is no evidence to back up the statement that there would be leakage to recreational use.  Professor Barnes and Dr. &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in stated that no evidence of increased recreational use of cannabis or increased problems relating to cannabis has emerged.  Specifically, there is no evidence of diversion of medicinal products to the illicit market.  As in Ireland, illicit cannabis is so widely available in the countries in question as to make diversion insignificant.  We have diversion with prescription painkillers, yet the Minister has not banned them.  We have diversion of opiate based drugs, even though their use is not based on the prescriptions given.  The Minister has not banned those drugs or argued that they cannot be regulated, as he has argued in the case of cannabis, despite the absence of any supporting evidence.<\/p>  <p>  Why can Germany, the Netherlands and a number of US states do what is proposed in the Bill?  The problem with the HPRA regulating this issue - this concern was raised by Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il - was that its compassionate access programme did not provide access.  Other countries abandoned their access programmes and introduced laws similar to what we have proposed.  They dealt with the issue by having their version medicinal products regulatory authorities establish a new subdivision to deal specifically with cannabis.  We are open to an amendment providing for such a change.  This could be easily achieved on Committee Stage if there was a will to do so.  If this Bill is not the vehicle for doing so, it will be two years before we have another Bill on this issue, on which we have spent a year already.<\/p>  <p>  Vera Twomey collapsed with stress outside the House and her daughter is in Holland.

This is a very serious and emotive issue, on which there is a wide range of views and opinions that the House should acknowledge.  Previous speakers referred to the work done by the Joint Committee on Health.  I did not attend the hearings with a closed mind or with a view to being negative in any way, shape or form.<\/p><p>At all times I approach my work with the committee in the same way I approach my work in here, which is with an open mind.  However, I also come in here as a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy and I represent my party's policy.<\/p> <p> It is our policy that we look at the issue of medicinal cannabis from a medical and a health perspective, and that we should in all instances defer to the medical experts and the patient advocacy groups.  That equally means that when it comes to legislating for medicinal cannabis, we must look to ourselves, as legislators, to see what it is we can do.  That is what Sinn F&eacute;in has sought to do right throughout this process.<\/p> <p> On Second Stage, I outlined the many concerns that I and my party have about the Bill and the possible unintended consequences.  At that point, I stated that we would reserve the right to scrutinise the Bill at the Joint Committee on Health and amend it to make it fit for purpose and to bring it into line with our party policy.<\/p> <p> I still hold some of those concerns, but I believe that the process of legislating and scrutinising should continue so long as there is an acceptance that the Bill is flawed in many ways but that the drafters are willing, as they indicated - Deputy Boyd Barrett pointed out that they had indicated that to us outside the Chamber and now on the record - to work with us and others who support the objective to ensure that the legislation can be amended and made fit for purpose.<\/p> <p> I have spoken with the drafters.  They have accepted the concerns that we had raised around the complexities and the unintended consequences.  They have liaised with myself and some of my colleagues in the interests of progressing this Bill and working towards legalising medicinal cannabis.  They have agreed to compromise on a range of areas in the Bill which are beyond the scope of legalising medicinal cannabis.  I respect the drafters, as colleagues and legislators.  I accept their bona fides when they show that they are willing to compromise and amend sections of the Bill in order to ensure it is only for the legalisation of medicinal cannabis.  I am sure I and others can work well with them in the spirit of co-operation in order to deliver for those who need medicinal cannabis, namely, these are the people who we must have at the forefront of our thoughts.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in supports the legalisation of medicinal cannabis where it has been deemed medically necessary for a patient by his or her clinician, in consultation with the patient and-or parents or guardians, as appropriate.  We have a long-standing party policy, decided by our membership, to support the legalisation of medicinal cannabis.  It is through that prism that we looked at the legislation on Second Stage and that is why we supported its passage at that Stage.<\/p> <p> Today cannot pass without me saying that there are parts of the legislation which we believe to be flawed and to hold it up as the final and complete answer to patients is unfair.  There was a great deal of misunderstanding, some of which was bordering on misinformation, when it came to this Bill.  It is irresponsible to say that the Bill, in its current form, will guarantee access to medicinal cannabis for all who need it.  It is apparent, from the legal advice and the motion from the Joint Committee on Health, that it will not.  While I agree with the legal advice, which is factually correct that amending the Bill would be an extremely onerous undertaking and require substantial redrafting to avoid any undesirable policy consequences, if the drafters can work with us, as they indicated to me that they would both outside this Chamber and on the record, and if they are willing to compromise on the sections of the Bill which have nothing to do with the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal use, then I believe that we can overcome these issues.<\/p> <p> In the meantime, we await the launch of the medicinal cannabis compassionate access programme.  I ask that the Minister consider placing the statutory instruments before the Joint Committee on Health so that we might be able to ensure they are devised in such a way that we get the maximum value for those people outside the House who are awaiting this legislation and the compassionate access programme.<\/p> <p> Having met the drafters and having been assured that they understand that there are elements which are problematic for my party, they are willing to work with others who support these objectives.  They are prepared to compromise on the sections which go beyond the objectives of the Bill.<\/p> <p> We will oppose the motion as outlined by the Joint Committee on Health.  We will give conditional support to the medicinal cannabis Bill provided it is sufficiently amended, in line with our party policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900024#DD01700","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510234800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I want to put on the record what I believe is happening in this debate.

If that is a signal on the part of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party that it intends to gut this Bill on Committee Stage and achieve on Committee Stage what the party was unable to do today, we will fight it all the way on that.<\/p><p>A more accurate assessment of the Bill and its so-called flaws was published in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>by Fergus Finlay, who wrote that this is &quot;an excellent piece of work which needs to be tightened up in some respects&quot;.  That is fair and balanced.  He wrote that &quot;what happened to Mr Kenny's Bill on medicinal cannabis was another example of extremely poor parliamentary work [he was not referring to Deputy Gino Kenny here], that actually failed to protect the public interest.&quot;  That was a criticism, by the way, of the Joint Committee on Health, and Mr. Finlay was correct in that regard.<\/p><p>The Minister talks about having an approach based on medical opinion and not that based on politicians' opinion.  I am all for that.  The proposal the Minister puts forward of having a regulatory system which allows for the prescription of medicinal cannabis for those with epilepsy, MS and suffering nausea post-chemotherapy is far too limited.  The most wide-ranging, authoritative and comprehensive study into this was the study conducted around the Barnes report in the UK.  Barnes's recommendation was medicinal cannabis for the management of chronic pain.

She and her husband have been forced to take turns to care for their daughter in another country.  One would have to have a heart of stone not to want to sort out their situation.  How come it is fine to have medicinal cannabis available in Holland, Australia, Chile, Germany, Greece and Mexico but not Ireland?  It is down to the fact that the establishment has adopted an extremely conservative and backward position on this issue, as it does on so many other issues, including abortion.  It is ironic that Deputy Kate O'Connell has talked about the lack of health care and medicine for women but does not recognise that the same is happening in this case purely because of the nature of cannabis.

She highlighted the problems facing her young daughter, Ava Barry, who was suffering from a severe form of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome.  She has seizures numerous times a day, but these seizures can be reduced significantly by the administration of medicinal cannabis.  She is now living in the Netherlands where she is able to receive the appropriate medical help and her seizures have stopped.  Vera has described this as \"life-saving\".  However, Ava is unable to return home as she cannot legally obtain the necessary cannabis based treatment here.  This is yet another failure on the part of the health system.  Why are we, as a nation, shamefully shipping people out of the country in pursuit of simple cures which could easily be available here?  Ava's case is but one example.  Another is that of John Patrick Harrington who had to travel abroad to undergo a simple cataract operation.  Why can we not deal with our own health issues here rather than exporting them?<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that certain provisions of the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 are unclear and that there are numerous technical issues with the legislation, including unintended legal implications, as highlighted by the Joint Committee on Health.  I note the findings of the report on the scrutiny of the legislation.  The report's authors are fearful that the Bill which proposes the removal of cannabis from the list of controlled substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 could have major unintended policy consequences such as decriminalising cannabis for recreational use, of which I am not in favour.<\/p><p>However, I do not accept the committee report outcome that the Bill should not advance to the next Stage because there are too many technicalities and problems facing the legislation in its current form.  I seek that the Bill would go forward to Committee Stage and any relevant issues and amendments be addressed at that point, and Deputy Kenny has said he accepts this.  The issue at hand is far too important, not only for young Ava Barry and her mother, Vera, who have faced this nightmare for years, but for all the people affected by this type of epilepsy, severe migraines and many other illnesses.  I am sure all the relevant changes to the legislation to allow only sick patients obtain the necessary CBD can be addressed on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900026#FF01600","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I am very glad we seem to have a changed situation.  This morning my understanding was that the Bill would not be moving on to Committee Stage and I do not know what changed in that regard.  I listened to what Deputy Harty said.  I know there was a fairly extensive discussion at the committee and there can be different views on how what went through.  However, there was not an absence of debate, and Deputy O'Connell can refer to that as well.  For whatever reason, I welcome that Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il seem to have changed their view on the merits of the Bill going to Committee Stage.  I am glad it will.  Whatever one's view, it is a very complex, technical and difficult issue and the parties need to present their detailed alternatives and to have an open legislative process.  As Deputy Gino Kenny acknowledges, there are flaws in the Bill and he is not clinging on to the structure or any particular wording.  In some ways, it provides the House with the opportunity to do something innovative, and while it is complex, difficult and challenging, I believe it is something we should aim to do.  We would support that step, as we have at each stage.<\/p>  <p>  I want to refer to two issues.  We have heard the evidence on one side while Professor Michael Barnes is on the other side, and I am glad he is coming here next week to address the medical case.  I refer to the inquiry report from the all-party parliamentary group for drug policy reform in the House of Commons which was published recently.  I refer to it because my Green Party colleague, Caroline Lucas, was one of the main authors of this significant report.  To give some context, the report by Professor Michael Barnes and Dr. Jennifer Barnes was based on a literature search producing over 20,000 references and the evidence was graded according to the system used by the American Academy of Neurology.  While I do not dispute that Deputy Harty and others have medical views, this is the sort of thing we need to tease out on Committee Stage, given this report suggests there are 20,000 references to medical cannabis having effects in regard to pain management and moderate evidence in regard to its use in treating sleep disorders, appetite stimulation and in cases of chemotherapy, fibromyalgia and so on.  That was the report that influenced me, partly because it comes from my Green Party colleagues.<\/p>  <p>  As I understand it from listening to Deputy Harty, the other argument is there is a concern this would lead to the effective decriminalisation by the back door.  That probably will not come into this Bill, which is specific in its intention around medicinal use.  From our party's perspective, however, that is also a debate we should be having.  Our current system, which is based on a criminalisation process in regard to the possession or use of cannabis, is not effective, is not working and, in fact, is forcing people into the criminal system.  It would be far better to have a health-centred approach which does not look to criminalise someone if they are using but looks to help them.  Where that has been introduced in countries like Portugal and Australia, it seems to have resulted in lower use, although the evidence on this needs to be teased out.  It may be able to protect the vulnerable who we do not want using it, such as younger people, but we may be able to get away from this incredibly expensive and punitive criminal system which is not stopping supply but is just letting the criminal underworld run it.  It is far better for us to do that in a safe, medically tested way rather than through the current system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900027#GG00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I welcome Vera to the Visitors Gallery and hope she is fine again.

We all know there are thousands of individuals out there, including thousands of children, who would benefit from medicinal cannabis prescribed in a proper way.  That is what this Bill is all about.  It is to ensure there is a regime in place whereby medical cannabis can be available to the very many people who are suffering and to people whom it would benefit where there is good medical and scientific evidence that it can alleviate suffering.

The evidence is out there and has been given by various experts and specialists over a long number of years.<\/p>  <p>  The bottom line is that other jurisdictions have dealt with this matter.  They have introduced legislation and introduced programmes whereby patients can be prescribed cannabis to their benefit.  If other jurisdictions have done it, I do not see why the Oireachtas cannot do it.  I certainly support this legislation.  As Deputy Kenny said, amendments need to be made to the Bill.  Many are very straightforward, such as changing the word \"consumer\" to \"patient\", changing the word \"certificate\" to \"prescription\" and simply deleting the reference to \"smoking cannabis\".  Many of the matters raised by the committee can be dealt with in a very straightforward and simple way.  Now is the time.

Despite the caveats and reservations in the report on the scrutiny of the Bill - I listened carefully to Deputy Harty on that matter - and coming from the Department of Health and the Minister, the Bill should proceed straight to Committee Stage and any reasonable and necessary amendment should be tabled then or on Report Stage.<\/p>  <p>  In his introductory speech on the Bill last December, Deputy Gino Kenny made a powerful case for its passage into law.  In particular, he recalled the extraordinary campaign of Vera Twomey on behalf of her daughter Ava.  I welcome Vera to the Public Gallery.  The Deputy was heavily involved in that campaign.  He also drew our attention to other harrowing medical situations, such as those of Marie Fleming and her husband Tom and of Mark Gaynor and his son Ronan.  I recall Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith discussing the difficulty involved in treating Dravet syndrome during a later part of the debate.<\/p>  <p>  Like many Deputies, I was struck by a report, entitled Cannabis: The Evidence for Medical Use, which was produced by Professor Michael Barnes and Dr. Jennifer Barnes in May 2016.  It presented good evidence for one or more cannabis products or natural cannabis in the management of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, spasticity, nausea and vomiting, particularly in the context of chemotherapy, and the management of anxiety.  The report also outlined a graduated list of the successful use of medicinal cannabis for many other conditions.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to Deputy Harty's caveats and reservations and his statement that the Bill should not proceed to Committee Stage, but the issues raised could be addressed.  These are said to be \"technical issues and implementation difficulties\".  I have read some of the committee's work.  The claim that there is a \"shortage of peer-reviewed evidence for the efficacy and safety of cannabinoid treatment for many conditions\" does not seem to have a basis in fact, given the wide international experience and research to which I have alluded.  The point that the committee makes about the cannabis regulatory authority has relevance.  This House is always reluctant to create yet another quango or agency, but the remit of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, could simply be extended, as Deputy Gino Kenny has argued in line with the German model, to include the regulation and research of medicinal cannabis treatment.<\/p>  <p>  The scrutiny report also had difficulties with the proposed framework of the avenue to cannabis, but the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017 clearly enunciate the responsibility of a registered medical practitioner in prescribing drugs that, in the future, could include medical cannabis.<\/p>  <p>  I again wish to convey my support to Deputy Gino Kenny and his colleagues in People Before Profit for producing the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill.  The Bill should proceed to Committee Stage and I am heartened by some of the comments that have been made during this debate.

While the legislation before us will have a major impact for Vera, it is also important to realise that it will be further reaching than that.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of the committee.  I read its report.  The committee found significant challenges in the Bill.  According to the concluding remark on the last page of the recommendations to the D&aacute;il, it would be onerous to address those issues.

When we are fully satisfied on the safety of any drug, I am happy to have it used.  When I say \"safety\", I am referring to standard procedures.  It is through double-blind randomised trials that one finds out whether a drug is useful and safe.  Any amount of testing must be done before it gets into the public domain.

In fairness to both, we had a very frank conversation around some of the issues we had with the Bill.  Deputy Kenny has always known that we have concerns about certain aspects of the Bill which have prevented us from supporting its passage at the final stage.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kenny has always said that he is willing to work with others within the House to address these concerns.  Last Tuesday week, we put four particular concerns to Deputies Kenny and Boyd Barrett.  In fairness to both, not only did they take those concerns on board, they came back with draft amendments they were willing to allow on Committee Stage which addressed our concerns.  On that basis, we decided it was in everyone's interests to allow the Bill to go forward to Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The sponsors of the Bill showed a willingness to work on the aspects which we felt fell outside its purpose, that is, to provide medicinal cannabis.  Some of the issues we raised concerned Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill and some of the functions which would be given to the cannabis authority.  Some of those functions went way beyond medicinal use.  I will list some of them for the information of Deputy Barry, who said the Bill is not deeply flawed.<\/p>  <p>  One asked employers to review current drug-free workplace policies.  A second considered research for recreational use.  A third referred to patients as consumers. A fourth referred to methods of consumption.  A fifth related to the descheduling of cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug.  In fairness, Deputies Kenny and Boyd Barrett came back with an amendment to reschedule it.  It will not be descheduled, as is the current proposal.  Rather, the amendment will reschedule the drug as a Schedule 4 drug along with other medicines which can be classified as drugs, such as benzodiazepines.  That is a very responsible attitude to take.<\/p>  <p>  Another unintended consequence of the Bill which we wish to highlight is that as it is currently drafted, somebody who has a criminal conviction for the sale and supply of cannabis could obtain a licence.  A convicted drug dealer could obtain a licence.  That has been addressed by the sponsors of the Bill.  On that basis, we are willing to support its passage.  This is nothing to do with public pressure or U-turns.  Rather, it is Members coming together with a willingness to work together to pass legislation.  We are willing to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900029#JJ00600","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1510237200,"counter":336,"content":"<p>It is almost a year since we debated Second Stage of the Bill.  There was widespread support across parties at that time.  I am glad that the support has continued.  People recognised that medicinal cannabis can make a difference to people and that efforts need to be made to make it accessible to those whom it will help.  It may help conditions such as multiple sclerosis, MS, epilepsy and others.<\/p>  <p>  A number of issues were highlighted on Second Stage.  Since then, issues such as the cannabis board and the possible availability of cannabis well beyond medicinal use have arisen.  They need to be dealt with if the Bill is to progress.

I would be keen to support him and move the process along if that is possible.<\/p>  <p>  There was widespread cross-party support for the Bill.  I would like that to continue rather than there being efforts to divide and cause aggravation.  This goes beyond politics.  It is about making something available to ease people's conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Cannabis needs to be controlled and the Bill is not about the wholesale availability of medicinal cannabis.

There is a large inherent contradiction in this with the silence surrounding legalised opioids, which make billions of euro for pharmaceutical companies, and drugs like Lariam, which are legal but do enormous damage, held against the queasiness that exists around the legalisation of cannabis, which is safe and non-addictive.  It has been proven to have huge medicinal benefits.<\/p>  <p>  I do not need to be convinced of the hypocrisy that surrounds this issue and there are arguments that I have made many times before.  As one of only eight Deputies who supported a Bill from a former Deputy, Luke \"Ming\" Flanagan, to legalise cannabis in all circumstances, I clearly support the use of cannabis in medical circumstances.  We must be honest as that is not what today's debate is about.  This is about how to make cannabis available as quickly as possible to our citizens who so desperately need it.  I am mindful that we sat here almost a year ago and people desperate for that treatment were led to believe it could be granted with a wave of a hand; it was implied that if the Bill went through Second Stage, it would be sorted within a few weeks.  That did not happen.  If, as a result of some games being played today, we have another year of being in the same position, it will amount to a scandalous betrayal of people who need this treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I reject some of the analysis of the health committee on the Bill.  I have read its report and the reply from Solidarity-People Before Profit.  There are qualms among the committee members about the potential side-effects and the need for more peer-reviewed research and so on but those are not reasons not to advance the Bill.  There are plenty of ways in which the committee could have advanced the issues.  I also accept the points made that this legislation is deeply flawed.  It is a fact, although I wish it were not so.  It is in the way it has been drafted and there are fundamental problems with the Bill in its current form.  They need to be addressed or else we would be lying to people in the Gallery and outside.  The Bill has not been delayed because of some plot to delay the legalisation of medicinal cannabis but maybe civil servants who are slow at responding to issues have used poor drafting to delay it.  That should not happen.<\/p>  <p>  Today's debate seeks to move this forward.  The health committee debated making access more readily available through secondary legislation and so on.  In order to force whatever mechanism is required for delivery - I do not care if it is secondary legislation - this Bill should remain on the Order Paper.  It should go to Committee Stage and keep the pressure on so we will not be here in a year's time in the same position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900030#KK00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1510237800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Having listened to speakers this afternoon, on behalf of the Minister for Health I am left in no doubt that this is clearly a very important matter for Deputies and many members of the public as well.  I thank Deputies for the work that has gone into this and for taking part in today's debate.  We must all remember that the fundamental issue we are discussing is whether the Bill will progress to Committee Stage rather than the general issue of cannabis usage.  There seems to be consensus among colleagues that this should happen.<\/p>  <p>  Some of us are around here long enough to know if there is very flawed legislation, it might not be possible to amend it and sometimes it is better to start from scratch, redraft the legislation and resubmit it.  Most colleagues I have listened to have said there are serious flaws in the legislation so the committee will have a challenge in addressing them.  It may well be the case that the committee might have to start again and redraft the legislation.  It might be considered if a Bill is so fundamentally flawed, and the easiest thing might be start again.  However, we are where we are.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill has been carefully examined by the committee and the report indicates the Bill has fundamental flaws that could lead to many undesirable and unintended consequences for patients and wider society.  I know the committee put much time and work into this and took the matter very seriously.  Deputy Harty chaired those discussions.  There are medical professionals in the House who have also expressed their opinions, and Deputy Brassill spoke very strongly from his experience.  We must listen to that too.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill places the regulation and oversight of medicinal cannabis under a completely different and separate legislative and regulatory framework to all other held products.  This appears to be an attempt to bypass the existing well-established rules in place for the protection of public health and safety.  We are on new ground and we must proceed carefully.  The legal advice obtained by the committee refers to major legal issues with the contents of the Bill.  Currently, there is very little clinical evidence on the safety and effectiveness of many cannabis products and we must proceed cautiously as a result.  After all, we agree that cannabis is not a normal medicine and it has not gone through the normal assessment procedures and clinical trials for medicines, which are designed to protect patients.  Therefore, we must take great care in making such products available for patients.<\/p>  <p>  It is my view and that of the Minister for Health that a system of accessing cannabis for medicinal use must be introduced on a gradual basis under appropriate clinical supervision, and only for those patients recommended for such treatment by their treating consultant.  These consultants are experts in their patients' medical conditions and they are best placed to monitor carefully a patient's response to cannabis treatment, including improvements or deterioration in a patient's medical condition.  This level of clinical involvement limits the level of risk to a patient's overall health.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, the expert reference group established by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to develop the operational, clinical and practice guidelines for the access programme has made great progress in finalising the clinical guidelines for prescribing cannabis for medicinal purposes under the programme.  It is also important to note it remains open to consultants to prescribe cannabis treatment for a patient if granted a licence to do so by the Minister for Health.  In such cases, it is the decision of the patient's consultant to prescribe cannabis for a patient under his or her care.  It is also the decision of the prescriber to make an application to the Minister for Health for such a licence.  I advise any consultant considering this option to consult the Department of Health directly for more information.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Chairman and members of the health committee for their thorough examination of this Bill and their work in preparing this report of scrutiny of the Private Members' Bill.  It appears the majority want the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage and the Government will not oppose it at this time.  We have listened very carefully to the debate.  I wish the committee the very best in amending this legislation, as it will be a major challenge.  Like Deputy Kelleher and some others, I have been around this House for quite a while dealing with very complex legislation and I know this will not be easy.  One must be very careful not to have unintended consequences at the end of the process that could result in much damage.  The Government will not oppose the amendment to the motion and it will not support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900030#KK00300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1510237800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I am in a very difficult position, as I was when the debate was conducted on 1 December last year.  At the time I saw fundamental flaws in the Bill and I was the only person in the Chamber that night to speak against it.  I spoke on it from a position of genuinely held medical views, which I still hold.  I am also here as the Chairman of the health committee, which is proposing the motion that the Bill should not proceed to Committee Stage.  On that committee there were three Fianna F&aacute;il members, three Fine Gael members, a member of the Labour Party, a member of Sinn F&eacute;in and three Independents.  The recommendation that the Bill should not proceed to Committee Stage was reached without dissent.<\/p><p>It would appear today that is not the case and I find it very difficult to speak on a motion when those who did not dissent are now dissenting.  Such is politics.  I have learned much about politics from working on this cannabis Bill.<\/p> <p> I believe the committee had fair hearings.  I do not believe that anybody was badly treated at the committee.  Many Members, who were not members of the committee, contributed.  I do not accept that there was any bias.  I chaired the meetings in a fair and unbiased manner.  There were some robust exchanges and asked particular questions.  By analysing the contributions of all those who spoke at the meetings, and we had four meetings on medicinal cannabis, we came to our unanimous conclusion.<\/p> <p> It was the intention of the committee, and it is my intention as chair, to see medicinal cannabis products being available to patients.  I met Ms Vera Twomey in the audiovisual, AV, room in June 2016 and promised her that I would bring the issue before the Joint Committee on Health, which I did on 24 November last.  I know that she was bitterly disappointed in me when I told her on 1 December that I was going to oppose this Bill.  It upset her greatly.  However, my intention, and the intention of the committee, is to provide medicinal grade cannabinoid products to treat people who have conditions which will respond to it.  That is still the intention of the committee.  The committee rejected the Bill because we found that it was substantially flawed and was not going to progress the provision of medical grade cannabinoids for patients.  I would love it if that was possible in the future, but we had to deal with the Bill, and our conclusion was that it should not proceed to Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> The Bill was very poorly worded.  It is telling that many sections of the Bill were taken from the Luke 'Ming' Flanagan Bill of 2013, which proposed the introduction of recreational cannabis as well as medicinal cannabis.  Many of the sections of the Bill were taken from that previous Bill and were not cleaned up properly.  Both the committee and I found many references unacceptable.  It referred to recreational use, it referred to consumers rather than patients, it referred to selling cannabis rather than dispensing it and it referred to certification by a doctor rather than prescribing by a doctor, and there is a fundamental difference between a doctor issuing a certificate and a doctor writing a prescription because a prescription has a legal status whereas a certificate has no status, or certainly substantially less status.  The Bill proposes making available whole plant cannabis products.  Included in that is a provision to sell cannabis by weight, which of course implies that cannabis is for smoking.  It also proposes that cannabis should be sold in plain packaging so that it would not be advertised.  A further proposal is for a ban on smoking cannabis in the workplace, which I found quite extraordinary.  It implies that cannabis could be smoked legally outside the workplace.  Indeed, in section 44 of the Bill it defined cannabis as something that could be smoked.<\/p> <p> Those were the flaws that I could see.  The more one reads the Bill the more flaws become apparent.  That was the substantial reason the committee did not recommend that this Bill should proceed.  It certainly did not want to indicate that it did not support the provision of medicinal cannabinoid products, either on their own or in combination, which would treat illness.  That is the aim of the committee.<\/p> <p> The study conducted by Mr. Mike Barnes was referenced widely in the Bill.  One of the issues that the proposers of the Bill had was that the HPRA did not reference pain as an illness or a condition for which medicinal cannabis should be produced.  There are only four studies in the study from Mr. Barnes which deal with smoking cannabis.  None of those four studies reached a level that Mr. Barnes had set for good evidence that medicinal cannabis dealt with pain.  Those studies were class two and three studies, and the bar Mr. Barnes set for good evidence was not reached by those four studies.  That is not to say that smoking cannabis could not relieve pain, but in his own investigations the studies on smoked cannabis did not reach the level at which it could be called good evidence.  The products that Mr. Barnes referenced as having good evidence for pain relief were pure cannaboid products, and he named those four products which he accepted relieved pain.  However, smoking cannabis did not reach that level.<\/p> <p> The content of this Bill relates to smoking cannabis, and that was the main objection the committee had on the Bill.  Smoking cannabis has serious health effects.  It can precipitate psychosis, particularly if smoked by young adolescents or young adults.  It can trigger a psychotic illness.  I have patients who have had psychosis triggered by smoking cannabis.  I have come across patients who have been demotivated, and their lives changed completely, by smoking cannabis.  There is a 9% dependency rate if one smokes cannabis on a regular basis.  They are the issues that I feel are unacceptable in this Bill.<\/p> <p> I have to reiterate that the committee is committed to providing medicinal cannabis that is safe and effective and has data to back it up.  We could not accept the Bill in the manner in which it was drafted.  The Government made the excellent suggestion that this Bill be redrafted rather than amended.  The committee felt that it would be so difficult to amend this Bill that it would be practically impossible.  We are now going to be given the task of amending the Bill, and I feel it is going to be very difficult to amend it.  I suggest that redrafting may be a better course of action than amending.  <\/p> <p> I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am standing alone on this side of the House again.  It is a very uncomfortable position to be in.  I hope people understand that as Chairman of this committee I cannot go against its recommendation, so I will be voting that the Bill should not proceed to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900030#KK00400","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510238400,"counter":342,"content":"<p>A genuine and sincere thanks to all the Members present for their co-operation.

Consequently,\u00a0between 2014 and 2021, public capital expenditure in Ireland will have more than doubled which, as set out\u00a0by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, will see public investment in Ireland moving to be\u00a0among the highest in the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The ten-year capital plan is in the process of being finalised.  It will set out the public capital investment objectives beyond 2021.

The Labour Court recommendation was issued on 22 July 2008 following a hearing on 11 July 2008 in relation to a claim on behalf of community employment scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors supported by IMPACT and SIPTU.  F&Aacute;S, the then funder of the community employment schemes, was not a party to the Labour Court hearing on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  At the most recent forum meeting, in April of this year, my Department outlined its intention to conduct a detailed scoping exercise in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications of the issues under consideration.  In considering the particular matter referred to, regard must be had to the costs and precedent of such an arrangement were one to be created.  A scoping exercise is currently being progressed by officials in this Department and should be completed by the end of this year.  A meeting of the forum has been arranged to discuss the scoping exercise in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  It continues to be the position that State organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and that it is not possible for the State to provide funding for such a scheme.  The employees in question are, or were, employees of private companies, notwithstanding the fact that the companies concerned are, or were, reliant on State funding.  In considering the matter, regard must be had to costs and the precedent of such an arrangement were one to be created given that the individuals employed in that sector are not employed by the State, even if the services they provide are funded by the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900036#QQ00500","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510241400,"counter":401,"content":"<p>First, F&Aacute;S was part of the Labour Court hearing.  It made submissions to the Labour Court hearing in 2008.  The court's recommendation refers to the fact that the court has considered the submissions made to it by the direct parties, that is, the supervisors and by the funding agency, namely, F&Aacute;S.  It also said that F&Aacute;S acknowledged that the provision of pensions was regarded as a legitimate cost in the cases of employees in community training workshop so F&Aacute;S was very much part of the hearing and was very much aware of the implications of that hearing.  It put &euro;10 million aside.<\/p>  <p>  We understand a pathway was laid out with a view to resolving this issue without knocking on other claims, which is something we are all legitimately concerned about.  I understand the previous Minister, Deputy Howlin, had tried to lay out a pathway to do that before he completed his term of office.  We are talking about people who have given enormous service to their community.  The quality of a CE scheme is dependent on the supervisor.  Many of them are now coming to pensionable age with nothing to show for their service.

The information I have, which of course I will check given the point the Deputy made, is that F&Aacute;S was not at the Labour Court and had not consented to the matter being taken to the Labour Court for determination.  Given that Deputy Calleary has information to the contrary on that point I will take that into account but the information I have is pretty clear in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The second point I would make is that Deputy Calleary should think about where we were at that point in time.  It was 2008 and we had had a number of years of rapid economic growth.  The F&Aacute;S organisation was a significant beneficiary of much of that economic growth across that period.  In the many years in which significant resources were available, leading right up to the crash period, a pathway was not found to resolve that issue.  The reason for that is as I outlined earlier in my initial reply to the Deputy, and also the fact that despite what he said regarding it being possible to settle one matter without having knock-on claims elsewhere, he knows how difficult it is to do that.  When one makes progress in one area, within seconds of that progress being made there are other groups who legitimately feel that if one can do something for one group, in particular when it comes to industrial relations, that one has got to do the same for another group.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Calleary has a lot of experience in this area and he will appreciate the challenge this matter poses, in particular when we have so many other organisations, especially in the health service who are in a similar situation in that we have people working within them who are dependent on funding from the State to provide the service but are not employed by the State.  For those reasons the scoping process to which I referred has been set up to get an understanding of the number of people we are talking about and the cost involved in dealing with the matter.  The process is under way and will be complete by the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know why the forum meeting was deferred a few weeks ago but I imagine it had something to do with all the work that was under way in relation to the FEMPI legislation.

My Department and the Department of Education and Skills reached an agreement with the INTO and TUI on many, albeit not all, of the issues related to pay equalisation and we made progress in resolving some of them.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the public service stability agreement, a commitment was made to commence a process of examining pay equalisation within 12 months of the agreement being reached.  While the agreement has only recently been ratified and I have not yet introduced legislation to give effect to it, I am pleased to note that the first meeting under this process took place on 12 October.  As a result of that meeting, a process has been agreed whereby the issue will be analysed and data generated.  The process will be managed by the oversight body for the public service stability agreement, on which officials of my Department and representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions sit.  The process will be managed by both parties to the agreement and I am sure efforts will be made to progress work quickly next year.<\/p>  <p>  To return to a point I made in my exchange with Deputy Lisa Chambers earlier, the Department of Education and Skills has estimated that the cost of implementing pay equalisation in education would be &euro;70 million in 2018.  If pay equalisation were extended to the Department of Health, the cost would increase to &euro;156 million.  If it were extended to all staff hired on new entrant scales, it would increase to &euro;209 million.  To reiterate a point I made to Deputy Lisa Chambers, it is very difficult to make a move in one area that does not have consequences elsewhere.  To put the figure of &euro;209 million in context, it amounts to a significant proportion of the full cost of the entire pay agreement in the early years after its implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900038#SS01000","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510242600,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the update.

It would be very difficult to address it in isolation, however.  The costs of implementing pay equalisation in the Department of Education and Skills alone are significant.  An additional &euro;70 million is roughly comparable to twice the yield from the training levy for next year.  This levy will generate a significant amount of the additional resources the Department of Education and Skills will receive next year.  These will be invested in third and fourth level education.

As long as it is a convenience, I have nothing against the card.  Some comment has been a little bit over the top.<\/p>  <p>  There are two comments I would make.  One is on the design of the card.  I have to say the writing on it, for example, the PPS number, is very small for older people.  It is much better on the medical card where it is much bigger.  It is a small, but important, point because this is used commonly by older people accessing services.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue is more germane.  Zealot approaches cause chaos.  What I mean by a \"zealot approach\" is this.  I had a case of somebody who wanted to get a driver's licence.  He could not get the driver's licence because he did not have a card and could not get the card because he did not have a driver's licence and did not have a passport.  Social welfare took a practical view and issued the card on reasonable evidence of an out-of-date licence.  The point that seems to have arisen is that it is being demanded as an absolute, only way of identifying oneself whereas, in my view, and I ask the Minister to consider this, in most cases one would have to produce suitable evidence of one's identity which would include a passport, a card or other suitable identification because the people who likely do not have it are older people who are well settled in the community and who are easily identified.  If, however, the Department states one must have the card the most likely person to get trapped is somebody who is known to everybody but the rule states the person has to have the card and he or she gets caught, literally, in a vicious circle.

They articulated in a very painful way what they are encountering regarding their loved ones, both in terms of the adult services and the lack of respite services in their area.  The reality is that, on occasion, an after-service is not available for some months after their children leave school, which is often due to a lack of trained staff at the facility they have been offered.  Staff recruitment can take many months so young adults have to stay at home until recruitment is complete.  This current process needs to be reviewed.  The timescale to find a facility for these young adults is very short and there is rarely any transition time for them to get used to the new day services.<\/p>  <p>  The way it has worked in the past is that, in September, school leavers are identified for the coming year and support services carry out an assessment and report to the adult day services.  This should be completed by December in order to have the services available by May.  We have been told by both the services that were available, as well as the Nano Nagle school, that the school-level referral process starts too late.  They recommend that the students need to know where they are going after Nano Nagle at least two years ahead of time.  There is also a problem with funding in that additional funding may be needed.  I will continue the point in my supplementary contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900041#VV00700","speaker":"1317"},{"type":"speech","time":1510244400,"counter":472,"content":"<p>To follow on from Deputy Ferris's contribution, I will not be repetitive because there is a very straightforward ask.  To commence the process in September for completion the following June does not give enough time and it needs to commence 12 months earlier.  If that happened, one would get the assessments done, get the funding in place and get the staff in place, which would give some hope of a smooth transition for special needs children coming out of the school environment and going into the adult environment.<\/p>  <p>  Another important issue is the question of the transition itself.  It often happens that a child will finish in the Nano Nagle school or any other special needs school and will not know the person who is going to be caring for them in the day services they are going into and will not know where the day services are.  There will be no preparation by the school and no opportunity for the school to meet the new carers.  The whole thing is operating on a trial and error basis, which is not acceptable for the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State, first, to bring the assessment process back 12 months and, second, to allow for a minimum of a six-month transition for the special needs child, the parents and the carers to get familiar with the new set-up and to make the transition as smooth as possible for what we all know are the most vulnerable people in society, to whom we, as elected Members, have a duty of care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900041#VV00800","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1510244400,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  I have some knowledge of this service because it is not far from my area.  I am based almost as close to the centre as the two Deputies and I know people from my own constituency are using it.  I will refer the points made by the Deputies to the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath.  I will ask that he meets the Deputies outside the Chamber to try to progress the issue.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to outline the position on services for young people with disabilities who need continuing supports from the health services.  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide them with greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE disability services engage in a detailed and person-centred process with a wide range of agencies every year to identify the most appropriate service provider and quantum of service to meet the individual needs of each school leaver.  This process takes place over a number of months and is led by the needs of each individual school leaver.  In addition, the HSE disability services also engage with individual school leavers' families to listen to any concerns they may have regarding the process and work with both families and agencies to seek an appropriate placement for the school leaver.<\/p>  <p>  Some 291 applications were submitted to the Cork Kerry community health care disability services under the 2017 school leavers process, including four from Nano Nagle school in Listowel.<\/p><p>A placement was offered to each and every one of these applicants.  However, 57 deferred their placement, chose another option or the individuals remained in school for another year.<\/p> <p> Notwithstanding that, the Cork and Kerry community health care organisation, CHO, acknowledges that there are some shortcomings in the school leaver process.  In order to enhance the process, the CHO has approved the recruitment of two occupational guidance officers.  These additional resources will support enhanced delivery of the school leaver process for 2018 and thereafter.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State acknowledges that there are still a number of deficits in the school leaver process that are common to all parts of the country.  The available funding does not provide for access to multidisciplinary team support and access to transport to and from placements for day service users.  Local HSE disability services management, not only in Cork and Kerry, but in other counties as well, continues to work at local and national levels to address these deficits.  The HSE will continue to engage with the service users, their families, service providers, national HSE management and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in this regard.<\/p> <p> On behalf of the Minister of State, I wish to inform the House that the assessment of needs for each individual school leaver who will require a day service in 2018 has already commenced and a validation exercise will be undertaken by the national office in terms of profiling in the first quarter of 2018.  If it would be of any assistance, I could ask my office to engage with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and suggest that he sit down with Deputies Ferris and Brassil, together with the other Oireachtas Members from County Kerry, whom I am sure have an interest in this matter as well, as soon as he is available to discuss the issues that have been raised tonight regarding the Nano Nagle school, which affect north Kerry and a cohort of people in west Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900041#VV00900","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510245000,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

For example, if the timeframe was moved back by six, nine or 12 months, there would be scope to make the transition easier.<\/p>  <p>  Funding will always be an issue.  More funding is needed, but when one is recruiting staff for a position that has been approved, the days of ringing someone and asking whether he or she is free to do the job are gone.

We need to be practical on that front.<\/p>  <p>  During the upcoming meeting with the Minister of State, we will also raise the issue of respite for parents, a service that is at a low level, and the need for a practice nurse in the school to help administer drugs and feed some of the children who have life-limiting conditions and need percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, PEG, feeding, etc.  The school needs a full-time nurse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900042#WW00300","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1510245000,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I do not disagree with anything the Deputies have said.

The safety net of this transitional arrangement is available through these services.  The HSE acknowledges in the reply that I read out that the services are not ideal and there are deficits.  Unfortunately, we do not have as much money for them as we would like.  We are trying to perform a loaves and fishes operation.  We have made progress in recent years, but we would love to do more.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies Brassil and Ferris suggested, if logistical and practical elements can be changed on the ground through dialogue without requiring a pile of money or, indeed, any additional money, that can be thrashed out with the Minister of State.<\/p>  <p>  I have some knowledge of this area because I know a great deal of the west Limerick terrain, and the next closest town to Glin, Athea, Mountcollins and Abbeyfeale is Listowel.

Ireland's name features in all this, which, like Robin Hood in reverse, seeks to rob the poor, the working class and the middle class to create a tax-free globe for the rich and mighty, both corporate and personal.  The newspapers, including <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and <i>The Guardian <\/i>in the UK, that have supported the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, ICIJ, in publishing this information are to be congratulated even if what they have to say is disturbing.<\/p><p>The Paradise Papers and Panama Papers show that these arrangements and structures are the enemy of a flourishing, open democracy.  The secrecy that is the core asset and principle of tax havens, as well as their no-tax status, is the greatest threat to countries such as Ireland and other EU member states.  It is also probably a critical factor in the creation of a global elite of oligarchs, billionaires, multimillionaires and companies that are outside of normal taxation.  This is one of the scandals of our age.  Its consequences in terms of undermining the kind of open and flourishing democracy that we all aspire to are frightening.<\/p><p>What is the Minister going to do about this in terms of Ireland's reputation, which risks being shredded, and what actions will he take?  When I was a member of the previous Government, the Labour Party in particular sought to include Ireland fully in the OECD process.  That stands to us now as we face the difficulties of Brexit.  However, I hear a deafening silence from Fine Gael in particular, but also from the Independent Alliance, regarding the scandal of international taxation.<\/p><p>Multimillionaires in Ireland can park their recently-purchased jets for an hour or two in the Isle of Man, thereby cheating the Revenue and Irish taxpayer of the VAT that would be due on such a luxury product, and the Minister has his hands up and open and has nothing to say about it.  I realise the Minister of State who is to respond is not personally in charge of this area but all I can say is that we are fooling ourselves.<\/p> <p> As the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union, we must address this area.  We only want people to pay their fair share of taxation.  We do not want particularly punitive tax rates.  Why are people in ordinary jobs in Ireland, including civil and public servants and those in private businesses, paying quite a lot of tax while other people are flying in on jets or sailing in on yachts, having spent two hours in the Isle of Man?  They are not even contributing VAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900042#WW00600","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510245600,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I am taking this issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  The Minister is aware of the publication by media outlets of information deriving from the Paradise Papers.  The Paradise Papers are not currently publically available but the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, ICIJ, has indicated that it intends to release them in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>To the extent that these or any similar papers identify individuals or entities associated with Ireland, Revenue will examine the cases and intervene as appropriate.  At an international level, Revenue will also work in close co-operation with other tax administrations within the framework of the OECD&rsquo;s Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration, in addressing issues raised by the papers and will, as appropriate, share information under existing legal frameworks.  The Minister for Finance has confidence that any issues of concern will be investigated by the Revenue Commissioners, as appropriate, as soon as the papers become available.<\/p><p>  On the media references to the Irish banks, as the Deputy is aware the Minister for Finance has no direct function in strategic or operational decisions made by the banks in which the State is a shareholder.  Decisions in this regard are the responsibility of the board and management of each institution, under the supervision of their regulator and equivalent authorities in the jurisdictions relevant to their operations.  The Minister must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial and independent basis and in this regard a relationship framework has been specified that defines the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Finance and the bank.  As the Deputy is aware, these frameworks can be found on the Department of Finance website.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that AIB has indicated it does not support or facilitate tax evasion and acts in accordance with all relevant tax and data protection laws in any jurisdiction in which it operates.  Under the terms of its EU restructuring plan, AIB was tasked with becoming a simpler, smaller and more domestically-focused banking group, to ensure its stability and return to viability.  AIB previously had banking operations in many jurisdictions around the world and provided a range of standard banking services to its international customers.  As part of the EU restructuring plan commitments, the bank made the decision to dispose of some of these operations, such as its Polish subsidiary, and close others, which included the winding down of their operations in the Isle of Man and Jersey.  The bank has confirmed to the Minister for Finance that it was decided to wind down AIB ISL Limited in the Isle of Man and AIB (CI) Limited in Jersey in 2012 and they ceased operations on 31 December 2013.  The banking licence of both companies was terminated and the administration of both, which is a legal and regulatory requirement as part of the orderly wind-down of the banking operations, was migrated to and continues to be carried out by two companies, namely, Estera Trust (Isle of Man) Limited and Estera Trust (Jersey) Limited.  The bank has also advised the Minister that it fully complied with a series of disclosure orders made by the High Court In Dublin between 2004 and 2012 in favour of the Revenue Commissioners in respect of information held by the bank&rsquo;s Irish operations as part of Revenue&rsquo;s offshore products investigation.<\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland has advised the Minister for Finance that it is its group&rsquo;s policy to fully comply with all the requirements as set out in tax legislation in the countries in which it operates.  The group is also committed to maintaining open and co-operative relationships with the relevant tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates.  To this end, the bank has informed the Minister for Finance that the group has signed up to and operates within the co-operative compliance framework with the Revenue Commissioners and the equivalent banking code of practice on taxation with the UK's HM Revenue and Customs.  The group closed the last of its retail operations in the Channel Islands in June 2014 following a general business review.<\/p><p>  Significant action has been taken, in Ireland and internationally, in respect of offshore activity in recent years.  Revenue originally launched an investigation into offshore activity in 2003 and has collected more than &euro;1 billion in tax, interest and penalties to date as part of this investigation.  Changes were also made in 2016 to the voluntary disclosure tax regime.  Since that change, the Minister for Finance is advised by Revenue that the number of disclosures exceeds 2,700, with a value of more than &euro;80 million.  As already noted, as soon as any information becomes available it will be closely examined by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900043#XX00200","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1510245600,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I do not know that there is anything new in what the Minister of State has said.

We have now been told the process has gone as far as we can with SUSI.  The family must now come to terms with the fact that their children have to leave college because the family cannot afford the fees and expenses.  Unfortunately, the father's business went bust and he has been declared insolvent, with the family entering into a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA.  The mother's income, which is the sole income of the household, is now an allowance from her salary, with the remainder going to the PIA to cover debts.  The family does not have access to the amount that SUSI has calculated as income and they are working from extremely tight allowances, where every cent is accounted for in the PIA.  The husband cannot claim social welfare as he was self-employed.<\/p><p>The response from the student grant appeals board states:<\/p><blockquote>There is no provision under the student grant scheme to provide for any exceptions to those involved in the process of insolvency.

This family's individual spending decision is no longer theirs, as every decision is made for them, with the allowance from the bank right down to what they can spend on groceries.  The comment is very unfair.  I have no interest in playing the blame game and we all know the difficulties in dealing with banks.  I am more interested in what my Government can do for this family and families in similar positions.  The Taoiseach speaks about rewarding people who get up early in the morning and go to work, and this family is an example.  The family members are hard working.  The wife is a hard-working professional and the husband was an entrepreneur who, due to unfortunate circumstances, has been left in this position.  They want a bright future for their children.  These people could have gone down the route of declaring bankruptcy and living on the State, receiving free education, social welfare, medical cards etc., but this was not an option.  The family wants to repay its debts.<\/p><p>In the Minister's previous role with responsibility for jobs and enterprise, he encouraged people like this family to do well in business.  It is vital that the Government helps families when business does not go to plan.  My Government needs to assist our entrepreneurs at all stages as they are valuable to our economy.  This is one of the nicest families I have come across in my time in politics and the stress being faced by them is unimaginable.  The parents have been losing sleep and carrying guilt because they cannot assist their children in obtaining an education, as every parent wants for their child.  Their children will have to drop out of college after working so hard to gain places in their respective colleges.  The family is also worried about banks that will not allow them to alter the allowance in any way.  This is affecting their overall health and particularly their mental health.  They are exhausted, stressed and understandably depressed.  The mother was in my office and broke down, telling me, &quot;Peter, there is no more I can possibly do.  We have let our children down.&quot;<\/p><p>In this day and age, no family in Ireland should have to face this problem.  I ask the Minister to insert a provision under the student grant scheme to provide for exceptions for those involved in the insolvency process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900044#YY00300","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1510246200,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I certainly sympathise with the case outlined by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The difficulty I have is that SUSI is a national statutory-based scheme and its allocation of student grants is based on an assessment of gross income.  That assessment is applied uniformly in all cases.  Where people have other outgoings, such as a mortgage or any other payment, they are not deducted.  It is not a net means test and it has always been based on gross income.  People might argue that it should consider net income in certain circumstances but it does not.  It is applied nationally in that way and there is no special arrangement for people in insolvency, as the Deputy outlined in the comments he made.  SUSI treats this in the same way as other means-tested arrangements and there are no special means tests available through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, for example, dealing with insolvency cases.  Again, it is income that is assessed and allowance is only made for tax paid or similar items.<\/p>  <p>  Although it is not in my area, it is my understanding there is an arrangement whereby a family means requirement is carried out before the personal insolvency agreement would be arranged.  Within that process I understood there was an obligation to ensure provision was first made for children, including cases where young people were in college.  I do not know if that assessment of means was made before finalising what was deemed to be a reasonable contribution to the debt.  I do not know if it failed to take account of the fact that children were in college.<\/p>  <p>  The only scheme I can point to within my Department is where students in third level institutions experiencing financial need can apply for support under the student assistance fund.  This helps students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who may otherwise be unable to continue their studies due to financial circumstances.  Information on that fund is available through the access office in the third level institution being attended.  The fund is administered on a confidential and discreet basis.  This year we increased the allocation to the fund to assist access for students facing hardship.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the system under SUSI is statutory-based and it takes into account gross income.  I do not have the authority to waive those provisions for any individual case.  There is the possibility of appeal but that is still on the basis of existing legislation.  It seems the only direction I can suggest to Deputy Fitzpatrick is the student assistance fund.  Has there been a failing in the personal insolvency agreement in considering the outgoings of the family in respect of the children's education?  I do not know if that can be examined under the Insolvency Service of Ireland arrangement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900044#YY00400","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1510246200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I understand that in SUSI guidelines and rules there is no provision under the student grant scheme to provide any exceptions to those involved in the insolvency process.

We are facing a massive crisis at primary level, which needs to be addressed by the Government.  Principals across the State and indeed in my constituency of Dublin North-West are facing huge difficulties in obtaining substitute teachers to cover sick days and maternity leave, and in filling permanent positions.  This has resulted in pupils being crammed into other classrooms, or in the case of smaller schools closing for the day.  In 2017, this is unacceptable.  We are dealing with the future of our State and we cannot afford for pupils to be left behind in the education system due to a lack of substitute teachers to cover illness or maternity leave.  I do not believe it is good enough for the Government to congratulate itself on budget 2018, having reduced the pupil-teacher ratio to 26:1 one week only for that ratio to become 26:0 the next week due to the lack of a substitute teacher or the lack of cover.<\/p><p>One of the issues we are facing on this issue is the number of young, newly qualified teachers being recruited for positions in the Middle East.  We have seen this affect our health service with nurses taking up employment abroad and now we are facing this in our education services.  When answering my parliamentary question on 24 October the Minister advised that his Department has no evidence of a recent or current shortage of primary teachers.  The evidence is there to be seen in the data from the academic years 2010-2011 and 2014-2015 provided by the Teaching Council working group.  The same group noted that substitute cover was required 915,000 days per year on average.  However, teachers were employed by schools for an annual average of 590,000 days of substitute cover, which means that only 62% of substitutable absence was actually covered.<\/p><p>I am worried that this has resulted in special needs assistants, SNAs, being taken away from the most vulnerable pupils in an effort to cover these absences.  Such testimony has been provided to me by a number of principals and teachers.  This is completely unacceptable and something which will unquestionably worry the families of these students.  <\/p><p>Another concern is the drastic affect this will have on DEIS schools, many of which are in my constituency.  I have met with the Catholic Primary School Management Association, CPSMA, which believes it is these schools which will be affected the most by this shortage.  There are also a number of DEIS schools in the Minister's constituency, and I am sure he does not want to see those schools or their students being at a further disadvantage when it comes to staffing issues.  He is aware that the CPSMA conducted a survey of principals on this matter.  The results are startling and the feedback from principals is extremely worrying.  Some of the relevant feedback was as follows, and I quote:<\/p><blockquote>I accidentally entered Galway instead of Dublin into the TextaSub service one day and I got about 15 responses.  I spoke with many of them and offered them the position.  They informed me the rent was too expensive in Dublin to sub here. <\/blockquote><p>Another example is as follows:<\/p><blockquote>For the last sick leave I rang 16 qualified teachers and sent out a TextaSub to 112 substitute teachers.  Only one person responded to the text. <\/blockquote><p>This appear to me to not only be a shortage, but a potential crisis in the making.  Only 66% of substitutable days were covered.  If we are to look ahead to Saturday in Copenhagen, were Martin O'Neill to have three injured players on the pitch but only be able to substitute in two players, people would have to ask about the managerial effectiveness at play there.  It is perfectly reasonable to ask about the managerial effectiveness at play here if we can only substitute in two teachers for every three missing on a given day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900045#ZZ00300","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1510246800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I hope the Deputy is not tempting fate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900045#ZZ00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510246800,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I hope I am not tempting fate, but I have no doubt that Martin O'Neill and the boys in green are adequately prepared for any such issues that arise in the game.

As the Deputy knows, the Government has reduced the class size twice in the last three years, and last year we provided 1,093 additional teachers.  This September an additional 1,160 teachers will start.  That amounts to 2,250 additional teachers in the last two years.  Those are permanent, full-time positions.  There has been no difficulty in filling those positions.  They have been filled, and there are currently a total of 37,000 teachers across the primary school system.  In urban DEIS schools there are now smaller class sizes.  There is great strength in that.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of resource teaching for children with special needs, even in those very difficult crisis years we continued to expand those numbers, and the number of teachers provided for resource teaching has increased by 50% over the years since 2011.  We have a well staffed primary school system, and we continue to make very substantial improvements.  Next year I will be making 637 additional teaching positions available.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of supply and demand, there is no doubt that we have successfully filled the full-time positions by recruiting at that level, with over 2,250 additional teachers hired in a very short space of time and where 1,750 have been recruited.  However, substitution may involve working for one or two days here and there.  I recognise that poses difficulties within an economy where there are increasing opportunities.  It is less attractive for teachers to wait for short periods of placement.  In order to ease that I have made a number of changes.  There are a very significant number of career breaks - 1,750 in the primary system - so I have made arrangements to increase the limits for people who are on career breaks.  They are now allowed to do substitution work for up to 90 days.  I have also arranged that those who have recently retired can, if they remain registered, take up opportunities for substitution positions.<\/p><p>For a number of years there was an effort to restrict the use of retired teachers to fill those positions because there was a need to prioritise those who were coming out of college who did not have opportunities.<\/p> <p> There is some pressure in this area but I took the opportunity to examine the recent trends.  It might reassure the Deputy to know that there is an increase this year over last year in the payments we are making for substitution to people who are qualified to substitute.  We are paying more people who are qualified, available and in the schools to meet casual vacancies than we were last year.  It is significantly more, going from &euro;100 million to &euro;125 million.  That is a 25% increase in the payments being made to people who are undertaking substitution duties.  Unless there has been a massive surge in absences that I cannot see, we are making provision.<\/p> <p> However, there is no doubt that there is a particular problem in Dublin.  I will monitor this issue carefully but according to the most recent data I have, and admittedly it is data from the end of 2016, some 7.5% of the days when there could have been substitutes were not paid.  In other words, people were not available to be paid substitution where substitution was justified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900045#ZZ00600","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510247400,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

This specific issue has been brought to my attention by the CPSMA and I feel duty bound to act on it given the figures.  Many of them are disputed by the Minister's account.  Nevertheless, it is clear that 90% of schools have indicated in a recent survey that they have difficulty sourcing a substitute teacher and 82% of them have indicated that it has been more difficult this year than in any previous year.

Part of the reason they have been so difficult is that the force has been exposed to a series of events that have had the effect of damaging public confidence in the force.  Before outlining some of those events, however, it is important to state that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has many fine attributes.  The men and women who serve in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na today are as committed and diligent as their forbears in the force who served during the last century.  However, we must acknowledge that, perhaps because it is a different time, the Garda is being exposed to greater public scrutiny than was the case in the past.  As a result of that greater public scrutiny, there has been a loss of public confidence in the Garda due to the events I will discuss presently.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge that when it comes to doing its primary job of fighting crime and protecting the Irish people An Garda S&iacute;ochana does the job excellently.  Recent events in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na confirm that.  Perhaps part of the difficulty for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that it finds the other aspects of the policing job, which require accountability, transparency and answering questions, difficult to deal with.  The positive news, however, is the fact that it is an excellent force when it comes to fighting crime and defending the Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to acknowledge that politicians cannot simply state repeatedly that the responsibility to reform the force and to rebuild public confidence rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alone.  It is unquestionably the case that primary responsibility for trying to rebuild trust in the force rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and particularly its senior management, but everybody has a role to play in this respect.  Significant responsibility rests with the Government.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is new to the Department but since this Government came to power in May 2016 it has not come to grips with its responsibility for reforming and improving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is not a criticism of the Minister but of the Government in general, in terms of how it has recognised and responded to the series of issues that have arisen in the force.<\/p>  <p>  However, responsibility does not rest with the Government alone.  All Members of this House have a responsibility, including the main Opposition party.  We must recognise that the great power politicians in this House have is, first, to hold the Government to account and, second, to make laws.  The Garda will only be reformed if we change the laws in respect of how it operates.  That is not the only basis on which it can be done, but it will not happen without that.  It is not just the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is also the responsibility of politicians.  That is the reason I have put forward this legislation which we are now debating on Second Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The series of issues that have given rise to a loss of public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relate to matters pertaining to whistleblowing and the establishment of tribunals of inquiry.  However, in my opinion the most significant damaging event that had an impact on public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was the false breath tests and the convictions that took place as a result of individuals being prosecuted who should not have been prosecuted because they had already paid the fixed notice penalty.  I should outline how we reached this point in respect of the false breath tests.  On 23 March, senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na announced that there were 950,000 false breath tests recorded on the Garda PULSE - police using leading systems effectively - system.  At the time of making the announcement they stated that no single reason could be identified for so many false breath tests on the system.<\/p>  <p>  That was an astonishing statement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was not acceptable or permissible for those members to make that statement and just leave it hanging.  At the time my party stated that there had to be answers and accountability for it.  Unfortunately, we got neither answers nor accountability.  As a result, we made a significant and serious decision for the main Opposition party - we stated that we could no longer express confidence in the then Garda Commissioner.  That decision was not taken lightly, but we made it due to the fact that there had been such a significant statement from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na yet there had been no answers as to how so many breath tests had been falsely recorded and there had been no accountability.<\/p><p> Subsequently, there was the investigation and inquiry conducted by Assistant Commissioner Michael O'Sullivan who reported in September 2017.  He reported that rather than there having been 950,000 false breath tests, there was another half million, bringing the figure to 1.45 million false breath tests on the garda PULSE system.  Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan's methodology for this investigation was to examine approximately 2,100 checkpoints.  He listened to some of the recordings of phone calls made by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Garda information service centre after the checkpoints took place and on the basis of that assessment he determined that the figure in question was 1.45 million false breath tests.  <\/p> <p> Last week, the Policing Authority published the report by Crowe Horwarth which it had commissioned into the matter.  The report stated that the figure for false breath tests on the garda PULSE system was not 1.45 million but 1.85 million.  That PULSE system has a total of 3.2 or 3.3. million breath tests recorded on it.  This means that more than 50% of breath tests recorded on the PULSE system have been categorised as false by the Policing Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p> <p> This House must take steps to deal with this issue.  I introduced the Bill we have before us some months ago following the initial announcement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in March 2017 that there had been 950,000 false breath tests and since then, the figure has risen to 1.85 million.  We need to do something, not specifically on the breath tests but to change the way that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates so that things such as this do not happen in the future.  We keep telling An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that this cannot happen again, but if we want it not to happen again, we must change the law. <\/p> <p> I will identity the particular sections in the legislation before the House.  The first significant proposal is in section 2 of the Bill which provides for an amendment to section 41(a) of the principal Act, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended by the 2015 legislation which established the Policing Authority.  The Policing Authority is a significant addition.  It is the mechanism that we should use to ensure that reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes place.  The Policing Authority has been given certain functions and responsibilities by this House through the primary legislation by which it was established but what we must recognise that under this, there was no obligation on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to inform the Policing Authority about its audit into the false breath tests which was being undertaken across the country.  That is why in section 2 we seek to introduce an obligation on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to inform the Policing Authority about any matters which have required an internal review, audit or examination of the functions or operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and which were requested by the Garda Commissioner, deputy commissioner or any assistant commissioner.  This means that only significant internal reviews and audits would be obliged to be reported to the Policing Authority.  It is astonishing that the Policing Authority was not apprised of what was happening in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regrading the false breath test review until the early part of this year.  It was an issue which had been ongoing within the force since 2015 which is when the Policing Authority should have been informed.<\/p> <p> In section 3, we seek to give power to the Policing Authority to be able to dismiss a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if in the extraordinary circumstances of the case, the member's conduct or his or her continued membership or position would undermine public confidence in the garda&iacute; and the dismissal of the member is necessary to maintain that confidence.  This gives the Policing Authority a significant power, and it is a power that we believe it should have.  There will only be real reform in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when its members perceive that there is an oversight body with significant powers and responsibilities over the force.  In section 4 we also seek to give powers to the Policing Authority to supervise the functioning of the Garda Commissioner's office and to supervise the discharge of functions by the Commissioner.<\/p> <p> The final substantive section is in section 5 where we seek to give powers to the garda inspectorate to be able, if necessary, to enter, inspect and review any garda station or premises without prior notification.  We put these down because we think it will add to and build up confidence in the force once more.  Garda&iacute; are in the strong position to know that the public has faith in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and want it to succeed.  Confidence in the force has been damaged and we need to help in its rebuilding.  This legislation will assist in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900046#AAA00500","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510248000,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I will begin where my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, concluded, namely in public confidence in the garda&iacute;.  Irish confidence in the garda&iacute; has been maintained quite consistently.  It is testament to the standing in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is held but it is not infinite which the force can take for granted.  I acknowledge and will elaborate on something which Deputy O'Callaghan said, and the Minister for Justice and Equality might pass it on to the Garda authorities, which is the gratitude felt in communities in constituencies such as mine for significant Garda successes.  I would highlight some in recent months and am thinking of one in Citywest recently in my own constituency.  A phenomenon that is also becoming more common, and has crept into our society without our noticing, is the presence of armed support units.  Recently, in my local service station, I noticed a garda with a gun in his holster pass me as we were both buying coffee.  The Garda has secured considerable wins.  Garda&iacute; patrol our city and they continue to keep the people safe.  There was an incident recently involving the Kinahan gang where they put their lives at considerable risk in order to protect people.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda has opened up in recent years.  The role of the joint policing committee at local authority levels is a process about which they were initially reticent but my experience as a member of one is that the garda&iacute; have become more open to the process in terms of engaging with public representatives and the public on matters which are important to them.  Members of the public are no longer scared to have a go at garda&iacute; at public meetings and at community meetings, which is something that would not have happened 10 years ago.  That is a healthy development.  However, one does not want that healthy dialogue to pass a tipping point where it moves to a place of disrespect for the force.<\/p>  <p>  The force, as a collective, may count its lucky stars that in spite of there having been almost 2 million false breath tests which have never been accounted for, no rationale has been given for it.  From all the different organisations within the Garda - an investigative force, which has uncovered the most incredible evidence relating to crimes, secured convictions in the most phenomenal cases which have come before the courts, and secured prosecutions of criminals from all classes and none - no one has been able to explain why and how this happened or who initiated it.  <\/p>  <p>  The role of the Garda Inspectorate is expanded in this Bill.  I want to focus on the Garda Reserve.  Its numbers are dropping but out of the 120 or 130 pages in the original Garda Inspectorate report in December 2015, there were 80 references to the Garda Reserve.  The report said it needed a champion in the Garda, that its role needed to be buffered, that there was a role for an officer corps, a cadet corps.  None of these have been acted on in any significant way by the Garda.  It will take the role of oversight bodies such as the Garda Inspectorate and the Policing Authority to ensure that happens.  <\/p>  <p>  I believe this Bill is timely, and very important in giving significant additional, necessary powers to the Policing Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900047#BBB00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1510248600,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for the opportunity to engage with Members of the House on the critically important issues of Garda accountability and Garda oversight.  I welcome the opportunity for Members to reflect on the role and work of the Policing Authority, which has been undertaking a most valuable programme of work since it was set up.  While I acknowledge and appreciate that the Bill purports to provide the authority with additional powers in line with the recommendations contained in the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality's December 2016 report on Garda oversight and accountability, I regret that I must oppose the Bill now before the House.<\/p>  <p>  My opposition to the Bill is primarily based on, but not limited to, the issue of its timing, which does not take account of the process under way through the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland or the legislation governing the Policing Authority, in particular section 62O of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended.  There are further serious difficulties with the Bill which I will have the opportunity to outline to the House later in my speech.  I must draw the attention of the House to the substantial grounds that exist for opposing this legislation.  It goes without saying that the Government is fully supportive in principle of the Policing Authority having appropriate powers in order that it can carry out its oversight functions in an efficient and timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  A fundamental difficulty with this Bill is that it is being introduced at a time when the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which was established in April of this year following consultation with the party sitting opposite me, is undertaking a comprehensive examination of all aspects of policing in Ireland.  That examination will consider all functions currently carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the range of bodies with oversight and accountability roles, namely, the Policing Authority, the Garda Inspectorate, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Department of Justice and Equality, and the Government.  I note in particular that Deputy O'Callaghan is on record as welcoming both the membership and the full terms of reference of the commission.  He has committed his party to working constructively with it.  The House will be aware that the commission is to report by September 2018 and may, in accordance with its terms of reference, bring forward immediate proposals and rolling recommendations for implementation in advance of its final report.<\/p>  <p>  The terms of reference require the commission to bring forward proposals addressing the following five themes: the structures and management arrangements required for the most effective delivery of policing, including all functions currently carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the appropriate composition, recruitment and training of personnel; the culture and ethos of policing; appropriate structures for oversight and accountability; and the legislative framework for policing in Ireland.  I emphasise again that oversight and accountability is one of the five themes under consideration by the commission.<\/p>  <p>  While I appreciate that the Deputy's Bill has been initiated in the spirit of trying to contribute positively to the overall governance and oversight architecture for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I strongly believe that progressing this Bill through the legislative process has the potential to cause uncertainty for the commission.  This is particularly so in light of the fact that the commission is also required to examine the legislative framework for policing in Ireland.  Having said that, I acknowledge that there is a serious need for further reform of the framework of governance for policing in the State.  This is evidenced in the terms of reference set by the Government for the commission.  There is a clear consensus in the House on the need for reform.  I would have thought that there would also be a consensus on the methodology by which that reform might be identified and made effective, namely, on foot of the commission's report and subsequent recommendations.  I take this opportunity again to encourage Members of the House to engage fully with the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland as it goes about its important analysis and consultation process.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I wish to draw the attention of Members of the House to section 62O of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  This section requires the Policing Authority to prepare a report on its effectiveness and the adequacy of the functions assigned to it by the legislation.  The report can contain recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the authority and must be submitted to me, as Minister, by the end of this year.  I am required to lay that report before the Houses.  While it is, of course, accepted that the authority must have whatever powers it needs to carry out its oversight functions, it would be premature of this Legislature, which gave the authority the role of identifying any gaps in the legislation, to presume to know the answers before the authority has spoken.  It would be far better to wait to hear from the authority and then to consider what legislative changes are required.  It would then be for this House to decide whether to make such changes in the early part of next year or whether to wait for the commission's report in September.  Instead, if this Bill were to be enacted in advance of the reports of either the authority or the commission, we would run the risk of being accused of once again failing to deal comprehensively, in a holistic way, with the accountability and governance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Indeed, the very fact that we have commenced legislative consideration of the Bill could be construed as evidence of a fragmented and incoherent approach to the much-needed programme of reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  While it is clearly the case that lawmaking in the State is the exclusive prerogative of the Oireachtas, I feel it would assist our deliberations if the views of the Policing Authority on Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill were sought.  I put on record my appreciation of the time taken by the authority to engage positively with the Bill and for providing me with its analysis.  In its observations the authority demonstrates some concerns with the Bill, in particular about the implications for its independent oversight role should it be conferred with the supervisory or operational powers outlined in the Bill.  In the view of the authority, the Bill has the potential to weaken the clarity in the existing statutory framework about the role and functions of the Commissioner's responsibilities and accountability, thus compromising the independent oversight of the authority.  The authority is also of the view that the Bill is premature at this juncture having regard to the ongoing work of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  It considers that the commission should be allowed to complete its work and produce its report.  The authority also makes that point that it does not have any role in respect of the security of the State and that, accordingly, it would not be in a position to assume the responsibilities in the Bill which relate specifically to security.<\/p>  <p>  To take up the point about security, I will now address what is perhaps the most serious difficulty with this legislation, namely, that it makes no distinction between policing and security matters.  The Deputies will recall that during the passage of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, the Oireachtas decided that the authority was to have no role in respect of security services.  Instead, the 2015 Act established a reporting relationship between the Garda Commissioner and the authority in respect of policing services.  This distinction between policing and security is, in part, intended to address any constitutional issues concerning the delegation of the Government's executive powers under Article 28 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  However, the Bill before us makes no distinction between security and policing services and serves to give the authority oversight over the security functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which would put these provisions in direct conflict with the other sections of the Act which deal with the functions of the authority and would bring the Bill, and by extension the Act were the Bill to be enacted, into potentially difficult ground constitutionally.  Even if there were no constitutional issues, the Bill makes no concession to the fact that other provisions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act delimit the authority's remit to policing services.  Instead, if we enact this Bill, the authority will both be excluded from dealing with security issues and be responsible for directing the Commissioner in respect of them.  I fail to see how this can be right and proper.<\/p>  <p>  I will now turn briefly to the main provisions of the Bill.  I will outline some of the key areas of concern, always bearing in mind the concerns already outlined in respect of security matters.  Section 2 requires the Commissioner to keep the authority fully informed of each and every matter which has required an internal review, audit or examination of the functions or operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be requested by the Garda Commissioner, a deputy commissioner or assistant commissioner.  In practice, current legislation enables the authority to require the Commissioner to provide it with any review, audits or examinations which it considers necessary for the performance of its functions.  I refer the Deputy to section 41A(2) of the 2005 Act, under which the authority can require the Commissioner to furnish \"a report on any matters connected with policing services or the performance of the functions of the Commissioner relating to such services that may be specified in the requirement\".  Indeed the Commissioner is obliged to provide that report, which the authority can publish.  This provision is in addition to the provision in section 41A(1) of the Act which requires the Garda Commissioner to keep the authority fully informed of matters appropriate to the functions of the authority and any other matters which the Commissioner considers should be brought to its attention.<\/p>  <p>  Section 3 purports to enable the authority to dismiss summarily any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where it forms the opinion that, by reason of the member's conduct, his or her continued membership would undermine public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Indeed the proposition that the authority could dismiss the Commissioner or a deputy commissioner was considered in the development of the 2015 Act but, on the basis of legal advice provided by the Attorney General, the Act instead provides that the authority can recommend to Government that a Commissioner or deputy commissioner be dismissed if the reasons for removal relate to policing services.<\/p><p>It is unclear how this provision which appears to provide the authority with power to summarily dismiss would work, having regard to the fact that the Act of 2005 contains detailed procedures to guarantee fair processes for any person concerned.<br\/><br\/>Section 4 of the Bill would require the authority to supervise the functioning of the Garda Commissioner's office, establish policies and procedures, cause to be published and made accessible to the public all sections of the Garda code and Garda operational policies and review the adequacy and appropriateness of policies and procedures that underpin the operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Under current law, the authority performs a wide range of functions that are most extensive in overseeing the corporate governance structures and performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the area of policing.  Rather than critiquing the individual elements of the section, I draw attention to two key difficulties.  First, the intention is that the Policing Authority would supervise the discharge by the Commissioner of his or her functions and could direct him or her in the management of his or her office in the performance of his or her functions.  The authority, of course, is independent in its oversight.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must report to the authority on policing matters, but it is fully accountable to the Government.  To insinuate the authority into the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the various ways set out in the Bill would transform the role and function of the authority from overseer to supervisor or director.  The question would then arise as to whom the authority would be accountable for the operation of the Commissioner's office.  If the authority were to direct the Commissioner to do something that went wrong, who would be answerable?  The second problem is that, under section 26 of the Act, the Commissioner is responsible for directing and controlling An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He or s he is required &quot;to carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&quot;.  The Bill proposes no amendment to section 26 that would recognise that what is proposed by the Deputy in section 4 would be in direct conflict with the provisions of section 26.<br\/><br\/>Section 5 of the Bill appears to be intended to provide the Garda Inspectorate with a right to enter any Garda station without giving prior notice to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Again, I do not know whether this is intended by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, but this is the only provision that would require the Garda Inspectorate to obtain the approval of the Minister in order to carry out itsfunctions.  It is also unclear how the provision would interact with section 118 of the Act which requires that a written protocol be agreed between the Garda Inspectorate and the Garda on the provision of the information required.<br\/><br\/>The Government remains fully supportive of the Policing Authority.  I acknowledge its hard work, determination and skill, particularly of its chairperson, Ms Josephine Feehily.  We will continue to ensure the authority has appropriate powers in order that it can carry out its oversight functions in an effective and efficient manner.  I believe, however, that it is reasonable to propose that any extension of the powers of the authority take into account its views on what additional role, functions and powers it needs and also the recommendations from the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland which are awaited.  The Bill pre-empts both the views of the authority and the recommendations.<br\/><br\/>I read in the media that Deputy Jim O'Callaghan believes that if his Bill had been enacted, we would not have experienced the recent Garda controversies.  I do not accept that at all.  The roots of the controversies we have seen are deep cultural issues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that are not amenable to quick legal fixes.  If they were, there would be no problem a Bill could not solve.  As the Deputy will agree, however, having regard to his experience and expertise in these matters, policing is complex and responses to problems with policing have to reflect what is real complexity.  Having said that, I welcome and share his genuine and sincere commitment to reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Where we disagree is on the timing of further legislative change.  I am convinced that further <i>ad hoc<\/i>piecemeal legislative change at this point, even if the Bill before us did not have the deficiencies mentioned, would be wrong.  Instead of implementing such change, we should allow the authority, having operated under the existing legislative framework, to tell us what it believes is needed and, perhaps more importantly, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland to at least issue its report.  We will then be in a position to consider comprehensive proposals that will address the governance and accountability framework in an holistic manner.  I invite the contributions of Deputy Jim O'Callaghan and other Members of the House, be they on the Government or the Opposition side, on this important framework.  In the meantime, while I fully understand and acknowledge the spirit in which the Bill has been introduced, I must, on behalf of the Government, oppose it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900048#CCC00100","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510249200,"counter":505,"content":"<p>To be honest, I am a little gobsmacked by some of the comments of the Minister.  I refer to the idea that this House would be accused of implementing <i>ad hoc<\/i>measures and slow in dealing with these issues, as if this was the first time we had heard about them.  If anything, people outside the House have been accusing us of not acting swiftly and comprehensively enough.  We already have a plethora of reports the recommendations of which have not been implemented.  Therefore, it is a little ironic that we need to wait for the report of a commission on policing, a commission from which members have resigned because they believe the Government has not given it sufficient backing, when we have some excellent organisations in place that have demanded for themselves precisely some of the powers proposed in Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's Bill.  What it comes from is not a fragmented and unco-ordinated approach but actually a very thorough and detailed public scrutiny and engagement with the existing oversight bodies in order to hear from them what the limitations and problems were for them in performing their policing oversight role.  A number of the measures come directly from it.  A criticism - I have a few - is that the legislation does not go far enough and take on board enough of the points made during the discussions.<\/p><p>Let me quote Mr. Patten who oversaw the reform of policing in Northern Ireland.  The Patten report presents an illustrative backdrop to the circumstances in this state:<\/p><blockquote><b>5.2<\/b>In a democracy, policing, in order to be effective, must be based on consent across the community.  The community recognizes the legitimacy of the policing task, confers authority on police personnel in carrying out their role in policing and actively supports them.  Consent is not unconditional, but depends on proper accountability, and the police should be accountable in two senses - the &quot;subordinate or obedient&quot; sense and the &quot;explanatory and cooperative&quot; sense.<br \/><br \/><b>5.3<\/b>In the subordinate sense, police are employed by the community to provide a service and the community should have the means to ensure that it gets the service it needs and that its money is spent wisely.  Police are also subordinate to the law, just as other citizens are subordinate to the law, and there should be robust arrangements to ensure that this is so, and seen to be so.  In the explanatory and cooperative sense, public and police must communicate with each other and work in partnership, both to maintain trust between them and to ensure effective policing, because policing is not a task for the police alone.<\/blockquote><p>This very much sums up the challenges facing us in this state.  We do not need a commission on policing to tell us that.  We have seen with our own eyes the consequences of our not having the aforementioned arrangement in the midst of the deep cultural problems in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We had the very real benefit of the very detailed and comprehensive work undertaken on behalf of the State by the Garda Inspectorate which in its reports has referred to many measures which, if implemented, would serve as a beneficial tool in transforming policing.  Therefore, we do not need to reinvent the wheel in that regard.<\/p><p>In the first instance I wish to deal with the Policing Authority.  It is a little ironic that Fianna F&aacute;il is bringing forward some of these measures now when it previously opposed legislation brought forward by Deputy Mick Wallace that actually included some of these provisions to empower the Policing Authority more than provided for in the Government's legislation.  It is worth pointing out that there is a Bill from the last D&aacute;il that got stuck on Second Stage.That Bill, a Garda authority Bill, was drafted by Deputy Mick Wallace.  It would give much more far-reaching powers to the Policing Authority than the legislation before us.  While we could be doing more to reform the Policing Authority, I welcome the measures proposed by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan in his Bill.  As was said in the oversight discussions at the justice committee, the authority has very few hard, independent powers or sanctions under current legislation that could be imposed to compel compliance and co-operation.  Seemingly, it has no function at all when it comes to discipline.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>That is a deficit in the Bill.  The Bill does not propose to give power to compel compliance and co-operation, which is unfortunate because, for example, we know about the long delay in clarification by the former Commissioner of unreliable and incorrectly reclassified homicide statistics and delays in providing information on breath tests and fixed charge notices among other issues.  I welcome the fact that the Bill deals to a degree with discipline, giving the Policing Authority the power to establish policies and procedures for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which would be binding on all members, and the ability to dismiss a member of any rank.  That is necessary.  However, it is one thing to give the Policing Authority powers; the issue is whether it will use them.  The Policing Authority had the power under section 11 of the Act to recommend to the Government that the Garda Commissioner would be removed before she jumped ship and it chose not to use that power.  When the members of the Policing Authority were asked by the justice committee in September whether they had given consideration to exercising the power the authority had as the scandals around the Commissioner developed and got deeper and caused so much damage, the reply was that they had a conversation about whether they knew what the section meant.  That was an incredible response for a body charged with oversight of the police force.<\/p> <p> I welcome the proposal in the Bill that the Garda Commissioner must keep the Policing Authority fully informed of any matters which have required an internal review, audit or examination of the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Presumably, that would cover something like the internal review of breath test figures carried out by the Garda in 2015.  If that arrangement had been in place then, who is to say that the process of getting information out of the Garda might have been expedited much more quickly than it was.  Let us look at the Crowe Howarth report commissioned by the Policing Authority into breath tests and overseeing the Garda's own internal report.  I found it incredible that practically all of the recommendations were to implement what the Garda Inspectorate said in 2014.  I do not know what was paid for the report.  We are back again to reports we already have so let us implement them.  We have had report after report telling us to do what the Garda Inspectorate said.  What is even worse is that one of the key recommendations of that report was that a working group should be set up under the Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other bodies to review fixed-charge notices and to deal with the broad range of changes that should be implemented in that regard.<\/p> <p> When Assistant Commissioner Michael O'Sullivan carried out the internal review on the breath tests, his report to the justice committee was that the recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate report had not been implemented, yet in the Policing Authority report we heard that it had been up and running.  Acting Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in and his hierarchy team said at the justice committee that the recommendation of the Policing Authority that a working group would be set up had not happened and then we heard that not only had it happened, but 22 of the 37 recommendations had been implemented.  I found it incredible that the acting Garda Commissioner and his team did not know that or the people reviewing the situation internally.<\/p> <p> The Policing Authority as currently constituted was hand-picked by the Government and there was not a proper selection process.  The way in which that process was handled was deficient.  I very much welcome the points in the Bill about implementing the Garda Inspectorate report.  The request to go into stations unannounced came from the Garda Inspectorate.  It has the unanimous backing of all groups on the justice committee.  We think that is very much overdue.<\/p> <p> It is somewhat regrettable that we do not have all of the accepted changes that are necessary in terms of GSOC.  When GSOC came before us, it asked for substantial changes in law to allow it to do the job that it was set up to do, namely, holding garda&iacute; against whom there are complaints to account.  GSOC highlighted a whole number of areas of legislative deficiencies which in fact the previous Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, also agreed were deficient.  It is unfortunate that there are not any proposals to do that in this Bill but I hope that is something we could address on Committee Stage.  I very much welcome the proposals that are there and I am sorry there are not a few more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900049#DDD00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510249800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>My party has been calling for Garda reform for well over a decade and we have not been doing so from an ivory tower.  Our demand for reform is very much rooted in an understanding of why the communities we serve need policing and about who loses out if society is not properly policed.  It is not enough to say that poverty produces crime.  We need also to understand that our disadvantaged communities are also the biggest victims of crime.  From minor break-ins to more serious anti-social behaviour to the shocking level of gangland homicide, crime is concentrated where vulnerable people can least afford its consequences.  The reason we want reformed policing is because we want effective policing and the reason we want effective policing is because neighbourhoods in need are entitled to a policing service that safeguards their communities.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is a welcome contribution to the ongoing debate.  We support the general thrust of it, although naturally we have some concerns and would propose some changes.  At its heart the Bill proposes to grant enhanced powers to the Policing Authority in overseeing the performance of the Garda Commissioner and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That much is desperately needed.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party's Garda authority policy dates back to 2006.  We freely acknowledge that the legislation we enacted in government, which finally created a Policing Authority, is by no means perfect.  Fine Gael's commitment to meaningful reform of policing in Ireland was, to put it bluntly, questionable, as was the commitment of the permanent administration, the Department of Justice and Equality.  As an example, let us look at what happened to the 2015 report of the Garda Inspectorate.  It proposed a radical shake-up but it was given a speedy burial by the Garda Commissioner, the Minister and the Department.  The Department simply does not see securing Garda accountability as a core role.  Sometimes, the garda&iacute;'s best friends are in truth their worst enemies.  One cannot support and assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na today if one does not insist on holding it to modern standards of accountability.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to refer to one issue that continues to operate as an impediment to serious public debate about the design of the institutions of State.  I refer to the legal advice to the previous Government that under the Constitution policing belongs inherently to the Executive branch of Government, in other words, that it would be unconstitutional to remove the Minister and the Department from centre stage in the control of policing.  We have heard some echo of that advice again today.  We are told that the powers of the independent Policing Authority must, constitutionally, be circumscribed and core powers must be retained in the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  I am all in favour of a close and confidential role between the Government and its Attorney General but when it comes to legislating for the oversight of policing, the Government's legal advice about what the Constitution will and will not permit cannot be kept secret from the legislators.  One cannot stymie desperately needed legal reforms by relying on legal advice if one refuses to publish it.  I say that because other eminent lawyers do not see where this particular argument comes from.  It is, after all, asserted in the context of a constitution that makes no reference, even in passing, to policing and also in the context of a common law tradition where policing was more usually seen as a branch of administrative or local government law.  If we look at other countries with our legal system and similar written constitutions, we can see police forces operating at federal, state, county and municipal level.  None of those states has encountered the argument that is foisted on us here, namely, that, uniquely of all our services, it would be unconstitutional to remove policing from under the thumb of Government and place it under independent oversight.  In particular, in that home of the purest version of the doctrine of the separation of powers, the United States of America, there are more police forces than one could shake a stick at and no one would seriously argue that they are all constitutionally attached to the executive branch of government.  This perhaps obscure and home-grown legal argument is the reason our law says that the Garda Commissioner must be appointed, and may only be removed from office, by the Government.  We need to get to the root of this legal argument, which the Government relies on to insist that it must continue to remain central to the control and management of policing.<\/p><p>Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill does not seek to do this.  To the extent that it seems to accept the <i>status quo<\/i>, the Bill is a stopgap measure.<br\/><br\/>More generally, public confidence in the ability and credibility of Garda management has been seriously undermined.  In particular, Garda management has shown no ability to respond effectively to the modernisation agenda championed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  The problem here is not simply cultural - this is the expression senior garda&iacute; often use - but structural.  We still do not have any body with the power, duty or capacity to bring senior Garda management into the modern age.  This is an age in which effectiveness, efficiency, openness, transparency and accountability are expected and delivered.  Thus, we need the Policing Authority to take account of the series of impressive reports from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and to insist that they are implemented by the Garda Commissioner.  I do not mean simply that the authority should supervise the Commissioner - that is a vague concept to insert into statute.  The authority should have power, having adopted an inspectorate report, to direct the Commissioner, by order, to implement the report.<br\/><br\/>I do not believe all structural reforms must await the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Nor do I believe that the reports the inspectorate has already been published must be put on ice pending another review and report.  The reports make sense and they should be implemented now.  Moreover, the authority should be given the power to insist on it.<br\/><br\/>Of course, we also need the independent policing review.  I hope it will be both radical and comprehensive.  I say as much because the Labour Party's reform agenda was never simply about senior Garda management.  Our 2006 policy document called for a Garda authority and a new model of community policing to travel hand in hand.  These initiatives have been ostensibly adopted but they are both still very much works in progress.  We have far more to do before communities can say that they have a real sense of shared ownership of and input into the policing of their neighbourhoods.  I hope the commission will make proposals for structures and arrangements to promote policing that are effective and efficient as well as fair and impartial.  We need a policing service that is fully accountable to the law and the community.<br\/><br\/>The reform agenda is long.  We need new members recruited to a force that is efficient and effective, one that uses modern equipment and policing methods to ensure the best possible results.  We need a serious look at Garda formation and training.  For example, would the college in Templemore serve us better if it was merged into a multidisciplinary third-level institution?  More broadly, we need a wide range of educational, social and economic measures aimed at ending social deprivation and alienation.  We need far greater urgency in tackling now the conditions that will cause crime in future.  A serious concerted effort now can target young people most at risk.<br\/><br\/>Garda&iacute; are the primary guardians of the community.  They must be, and be seen to be, a part of the community.  As the first Garda Commissioner, Michael Staines, put it, &quot;The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will succeed not by force of arms or numbers but on their moral authority as servants of the people.&quot;  Our ambition should be for a transformed service that enjoys acceptance and support throughout the community.

Whether it is the second-lowest or the lowest, public confidence is low.  If the Minister can think of a time when it was lower, then he can instance it.  It is the case that public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is very low.  To be honest, I think the Minister is being pedantic.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the vast majority of garda&iacute; are held in high regard by the public and are committed and dedicated public servants.  What they have had to endure during much of this controversy is a cause of considerable frustration to each member.<\/p>  <p>  When Garda representatives were before the committee recently, I made the point that I have seen the value of good policing at first hand .  I have seen the impact that good-quality garda&iacute;, especially in the community policing mould, have made to my community.  They have made a substantial difference to the progress of the community in which I grew up.  I can instance people that I know now who are walking the streets and doing full-time work but who could otherwise have been in prison but for the work of good community garda&iacute;.  Unfortunately, that project and vision has been neglected in recent years.  I regret to say that I have also seen instances of poor policing and policing that has undermined public confidence in the locality in which I grew up.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that the Government realises the opportunity to begin the process of restoring confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The process must involve the right person being nominated and appointed to the position of Garda Commissioner.  It is our view that the person should come from outside the jurisdiction.  It would be very difficult for any person who is currently in the force to do the role in the current situation.  Furthermore, we believe that the Policing Authority must be empowered to recruit a commissioner and to recommend the removal of a commissioner.  Ultimately, we need a government that is not prepared to stand over major controversies, one that is committed to proper reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  It was telling that only a few weeks ago the chair of the Policing Authority, Josephine Feehily, effectively said it was apparently easier for garda&iacute; to give false information than tell the truth in respect of the issue of the breath tests.  This indicates an unhealthy culture and reveals that, whether direct or indirect, there was certainly pressure regarding the falsification of breath tests.<\/p>  <p>  It has long been our view that there was a need for a body along the lines of the Policing Authority.  We proposed the introduction of a Garda authority in 2014.  We have long proposed a process similar to that which unfolded in the North with Patten was required here.  Some of the steps that are necessary have been undertaken following political pressure from all sides of the House, and that is welcome.  Although the Policing Authority that exists is not everything I would like it to be, I am of the view that it is making a contribution at this point.  There is no doubt that it needs more powers.  Perhaps it was not said explicitly, but it was certainly implied from Josephine Feehily's remarks at the justice committee that she believed that the authority was likely to request additional powers.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill includes several of these additional powers.  The point has been made that this is pre-empting a process.  The Garda has stated that the force is undertaking reforms and pursuing reforms proposed under the Garda Inspectorate report.  The recommendations contained in that report need to be implemented.  The outstanding provisions of recent legislation that have yet to be enacted certainly need to be progressed.  There is no question but that everyone is of the view that Garda reform needs to continue.  We do not need to wait until the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland has finished its work.  The pace of reform has to continue.  That is likely to be flagged by the request of the Policing Authority for more powers.  Therefore, I do not believe that this is pre-empting anything or out of place in any way.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need for additional powers not only for the Policing Authority but also for various other bodies.  This includes having responsibility for determining the priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and working with the Garda Commissioner in the preparation of annual policing plans.  The authority should consult local communities and obtain their views and experience of policing and joint policing committees.  We also believe that the power and scope of the joint policing committees need to be expanded considerably.  The committees should have powers far closer in nature to those of the district policing and community safety partnerships in the North.<\/p><p>The authority should be empowered to conduct its functions without requiring the consent of the Minister.  It should hold the Garda Commissioner to account and the Commissioner should keep the authority fully briefed on relevant matters.  The authority should have full independent capacity regarding the appointments of the Garda Commissioner, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners following open competition based on best practice in recruitment.  It should also have the independent power to remove these senior officers and should be empowered to deal with complaints against them and discipline them.<\/p> <p> I have a slight reservation regarding section 3 and the proposal to apply the provisions of the section to all ranks.  However, I have an open mind on the issue and I am willing to listen to argument on Committee Stage.  As I indicated, Sinn F&eacute;in will support Second Stage of the Bill.  I fear the provisions of section 3 could result in the Policing Authority being clogged up with cases and consume time that could be better spent on oversight.  I draw a distinction between senior ranks and other ranks of the Garda because the former have significant influence over the culture of the institution.  I recognise, however, that the threshold in the section is set relatively high.  A balance needs to be struck in this regard and I am open to further exploring the proposal.<\/p> <p> On section 4, the supervisory powers provided in respect of policies and procedures are welcome.  I also welcome section 5 and the proposal to give the Garda Inspectorate powers to enter, inspect and review any Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na station or premises without prior notification to any member of the Garda.  Sinn F&eacute;in also supports giving a similar power to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  The strength and powers of GSOC are characterised by failings and weaknesses.  While we need to return to this issue, GSOC requires the power provided to the Garda Inspectorate if it is to adequately pursue its functions and responsibilities.  Sinn F&eacute;in will include a number of recommendations in its submission to the Commission on the Future of Policing.<\/p> <p> The Minister referred to the proposal to confer on the Policing Authority powers in respect of security, an area in which it does not have powers.  This issue needs to be examined by the Commission on the Future of Policing.  Many of the problems in the RUC arose because there was a force within a force.  The artificial distinction sometimes created between policing and security has the potential to create a similar dynamic.  For this reason, it is essential that the oversight and interrogation role of an oversight body such as the Policing Authority encompasses all matters relating to policing, including security matters.<\/p> <p> The legislation and other additional powers for the Policing Authority, which the authority is likely to seek in any event, are required to ensure full faith is restored in the police service and we have a service that is accountable, representative of the community it serves and enjoys the confidence of the general public.  Sinn F&eacute;in will, therefore, support this legislation as it proposes to give additional powers to the Policing Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900051#FFF00900","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510251000,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  Although I have indicated on behalf of the Government that I cannot support the legislation, I am pleased the House had an opportunity to debate this issue, for which I thank Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.<\/p>  <p>  I have always believed that we should have debates dealing with facts.  For this reason, I reject Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's comment in respect of public trust and confidence in the Garda.  I expected he would at least source that comment but it is in keeping with many of the utterances from many sections of the Opposition in recent times, particularly the Deputy's party, that statements are made in the D&aacute;il which have no basis in fact regardless of whether that matters.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this is a very difficult time for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I also acknowledge that many of the practices thrown up in independent and internal Garda reports are unacceptable.  This has also been acknowledged by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across all ranks.  Having met representatives of all the Garda associations in recent days, I acknowledge a stated intent on the part of the Garda to modernise and embrace the type of change envisaged by the Policing Authority and Garda Inspectorate.  All the representative associations indicated their intent to engage fully with the Commission on the Future of Policing.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate the Government's full support for the Policing Authority and for the authority having appropriate powers to carry out its oversight functions in an effective and efficient manner.  However, it is reasonable to propose that any extension of the powers of the Policing Authority or change to its fundamental role and function must take account of the views of the authority as to what additional powers it may wish to have.  Unfortunately, as far as the views of the authority are concerned and having regard to the existence of the Commission on the Future of Policing, I must repeat my view that the Deputy's Bill is pre-emptive.  That is a serious deficiency on the matter of our task here as we embark on the processing or enacting of legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also has the potential to create internal conflict with the existing legislative framework establishing the Policing Authority.  Perhaps the most serious area of potential conflict is the extension of the authority's remit into the area of national security.  In this regard, I am not surprised by the comments of the Sinn F&eacute;in speaker given the disposition of that party.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that while I welcome the sincere and genuine commitment of the proposer of the Bill to the reform programme of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I strongly believe we should allow the Policing Authority, having operated under the existing legislative framework, to tell the Oireachtas what it considers it needs and, perhaps more important, for the Commission on the Future of Policing to report.  The latest date for receipt of the commission's report is December 2018 but it is open to the commission to produce interim or earlier reports.  Having regard to the fact that the Oireachtas established the commission, Members have a duty to work closely with it in the matter of its work.  I invite Deputies, either at parliamentary party level or individually in the case of Independents, to engage fully and make appropriate submissions or observations in accordance with the stated wish of the commission.<\/p>  <p>  When we have the commission's report we will be in a position to consider a comprehensive package of proposals that will address the governance and accountability framework.  That the commission is not likely to report until next year does not in any way halt the ongoing process of reform in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge Deputy O'Callaghan's sincerity and commitment and the spirit in which the Bill was introduced.  However, having regard to the arguments I have made, it is the view of the Government that we will not accept further advancement of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900052#GGG00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1510251000,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate.  It is important that we continue to debate issues concerning An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the House.<\/p><p>Sometimes there is a tendency in Ireland for issues to boil up and then go off the boil, and we move from talking about the Garda to talking about the health services and on to some other topic.  It is important that we keep the focus of this House on issues which are of public concern.<\/p> <p> I will not get into the debate between the Minister and Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire as to the situation in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but I will simply state, and I think everyone in the House can agree on this, that public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been damaged by recent events.  I think we can also agree on the following statement, that it is the responsibility of everyone in this House to try to regain that public confidence and restore it to the very high level it was at before.  It is still important to note that the public has great faith in the police force.  It has been damaged, but we all have a responsibility in this House to try to see it improved again and to see it regain its proper place.<\/p> <p> I listened closely to the contribution made by every Member here.  In particular, I listened to the Minister.  He indicated there are three grounds upon which he is opposing the Bill.  The first is in respect of the timing.  He says we should await the outcome of the commission on policing before we start introducing any legislation in the House.  His second ground of objection was that he referred to section 62O of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, as amended, which requires the Policing Authority to deliver a report to the Minister in respect of its effectiveness.  He says we should await the outcome of that report.  Third, the Minister referred to the fact that the Policing Authority had indicated that it has some concerns with the legislation that we are discussing this evening.  The Minister then went on and looked at each of the sections in the Bill.  I will respond to the Minister.  By responding to him, I offer no disrespect to the other colleagues who spoke on the Bill, but since the Minister is opposing it, I wanted to concentrate on his arguments and submissions.<\/p> <p> The first point the Minister mentioned was that we should await the outcome of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Like the Minister and like most Members in this House, I welcomed the establishment of that commission.  I welcomed its membership and I look forward to reading its final report when that is published in September 2018.  However, simply because we have set up the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland does not mean that this House can go into a state of paralysis in which we twiddle our thumbs for ten months until the commission reports.  We cannot do that.  We would do a disservice to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if we simply abdicate our responsibility for lawmaking to another, albeit welcome, body whose report we look forward to.<\/p> <p> We cannot abandon our responsibility to make laws in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na simply by awaiting the outcome of the report from the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  We do not know to what extent the commission will make recommendations in respect of how all legislation should be dealt with.  It may make a recommendation that the law should be repealed or the law should be reformed, or it may make no recommendations in respect of legislative changes.  However, what we have to recognise is that there are problems in the systems within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, some of which can be resolved by legislative intervention by giving the Policing Authority more powers.  If that is a good idea today, let us do it.  Let us not simply postpone that on the basis that we will wait to find out whether the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland thinks it is a good idea.  On many occasions over recent years, and this is not the exclusive fault of the Minister's party, we have delegated our responsibilities to so many other statutory bodies that we get to a stage where we are nearly afraid to make laws because of whether these other bodies will support it or whether some review group we have set up agrees with it.  We are elected here to make laws.  Let us not be afraid to do it.  The fact that the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is considering what should be done on the future of policing should not be a bar on us now taking steps to improve the legislative basis upon which there can be oversight of the Garda.<\/p> <p> The second point raised by the Minister was that, under section 62O of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, as amended by the 2015 Act, the Policing Authority will prepare a report on its own effectiveness.  That is all very well and we look forward to reading that report, but that should not put us into a state of paralysis.  We have an obligation to pass laws and it should not be dependent upon what a statutory body will say to us in its annual report or annual review.<\/p> <p> The third point made by the Minister was that he had consulted the Policing Authority and it had some concerns in respect of the legislation.  I must say I was relatively optimistic when I heard it only had some concerns in respect of it.  That is generally Government or statutory body speak for there being some good ideas in it.  We need to recognise we have a responsibility.  I have no proprietorial ownership over this legislation.  I want to ensure that the legislation that is introduced is the legislation for the country.  When it gets to Committee Stage, let us table amendments, as no doubt every member on the Committee on Justice and Equality will do, to see whether they can improve the Bill.  If they do, I will be glad to agree to them.<\/p> <p> The Minister also mentioned that I had previously indicated that if this Bill had been in place, none of the difficulties in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have occurred.  I do not know if I said that.  If I did say it, that is not what I intended.  What I would have intended is that, given section 2 of the Bill, we would have had a different outcome in respect of the Garda breath test issue.  I was limiting my comments in respect of that test issue.  The reason I said that is because section 2 would have required An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to inform the Policing Authority, in 2015, when the authority came into existence, of the fact that there were audits going on into the Garda breath test issue.  Had that been done, it would have been to the advantage of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda could have shared this problem with the Policing Authority, and the authority could have directed how this should have been dealt with.  One of the reasons there was such concern about the issue of false breath tests was there was a public belief that the Garda did not handle the issue well when it first came to its attention in 2014 and also after that.  There was a slight public concern that the Garda was, in effect, hoping that the problem would go away.  If this legislation had been in place, the Garda would have been obliged to report the fact of the internal review to the Policing Authority.  That would have been to the benefit of this issue and it would have been to the benefit of the public.<\/p> <p> The Minister then went through each of the sections and made some comments, and I will briefly reply to that.  He said that section 2 probably is unnecessary because there is already legislation in place which allows the Policing Authority to seek information from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The purpose of section 2, however, is different.  It places an obligation upon An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to bring to the attention of the Policing Authority that there is an internal review, audit or examination of the functions or operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There was no reason the Policing Authority, in 2015 or 2016, would have asked the Garda whether it was conducting any audits or reviews into false breath tests.  The authority had no information about that.  If this law had been in place, however, the Garda would have been obliged to inform the Policing Authority about the internal review and audit.<\/p> <p> The Minister also referred to section 3, which would give the authority the power to dismiss a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is important to point out that, at present under the legal system, the Policing Authority can make a recommendation that a Commissioner be removed, and in that instance the Government has a responsibility to take into account that recommendation.  I do not see the legal obstacles that the Minister says would exist in respect of giving the power to the Policing Authority to remove a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a power that, I suspect, would be used only in exceptional circumstances by the Policing Authority.  Nonetheless, it is a power that should exist, as otherwise we are dependent upon the Garda trying to put its own house in order, and sometimes that can be very difficult when there are disciplinary issues involved.<\/p> <p> The third point that the Minister mentioned was in respect of section 4.  He said that this in a way would put the Policing Authority in a position whereby it would be managing the Garda Commissioner's office.  I do not think so.  The word that is used is \"supervision\".  It is important that the Policing Authority establishes policies and procedures for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that it keeps an overview of the functioning of the Garda Commissioner's office.  That would be to the long-term benefit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p> The final issue was in respect of the Garda Inspectorate.  As Deputy Clare Daly mentioned, that is a recommendation that was made previously and it would be one that would assist the inspectorate.<\/p> <p> I thank Members for their contributions to the debate.  It is important that we do not merely decide to put ourselves into cold storage until September 2018 when we get the report from the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  We should all contribute to that, but let us not forget what we are all elected to do.  We are elected to make laws.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900052#GGG00300","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510251600,"counter":521,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510251600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 16 November 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110900053#HHH00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510251600,"counter":523,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 7.40 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 14 November 2017.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
