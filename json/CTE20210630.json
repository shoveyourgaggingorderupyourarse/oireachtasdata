I remind the committee that apart from me and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and from within the confines of the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Deputy David Stanton.  <\/p> <p>  Today, the select committee is required to consider the Further Revised Estimates for Vote 32 - Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to the meeting.  We appreciate the comprehensive briefing material provided by the Department for today's discussion.  It has been circulated to all members.  <\/p> <p>  To give a brief overview of the reason for this meeting, following the formation of the Government in 2020, certain functions were transferred to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment from other Departments, principally the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Social Protection.  The gross allocation in the Estimates for the Department in 2021 is &euro;1.142 billion, comprising more than &euro;796 million in capital funding and more than &euro;345 million in current funding.  This is some &euro;765 million less than the Department's Estimate allocation in 2020 of &euro;1.907 billion, which included significant once-off amounts for certain measures.  The allocation in 2021 represents an increase of some &euro;387 million on the Department's expected core allocation for 2021 of &euro;755 million, taking into account the funding implications of the restructuring to which I referred.  The Estimates also provide for a carry-over of &euro;106 million in unspent 2020 capital appropriations for use in 2021.  The allocation provides for measures to deal with the ongoing impact of the pandemic and the new trading relationship we have with the UK.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege in the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.<\/p><p>Members are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defense against any defamation act for anything that they say.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that privilege is not abused.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person, persons, or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  I now invite T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to make a brief opening statement or comment on Further Revised Estimate, FRE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#A00300","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for taking my Department&rsquo;s 2021 FRE this morning.  I appreciate that it has a busy agenda.  My officials provided the secretariat with a detailed briefing on the elements of the FRE, which I hope was of assistance to members.  The 2021 Estimate, which I present this morning, provides my Department with a gross allocation of &euro;1.142 billion.  This is broken down between &euro;796.647 million in capital funding and just over &euro;345 million in current funding.<\/p><p>A <i>prima facie<\/i>comparison indicates that the 2021 Estimate is &euro;765 million less than &euro;1.9 billion provided to my Department in the 2020 FRE approved by the D&aacute;il last November.  Members will recall that 2020 included significant once-off moneys to assist business dealing with Covid-19, in the form of restart grants, which have been superseded by the COVID-19 restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which accounted for through Revenue and the Department of Finance Vote.  Comparison with last year is also complicated by the financial consequences of the various functions that were transferred to and from the Department in the course of 2020 and 2021.  The most significant of these in monetary terms was the transfer of science and research functions, including responsibility for the Science Foundation Ireland to the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science in January of this year.  Significant once-off Covid-19 and Brexit funding provided to our Vote again for this year further complicates year-on-year comparisons. <\/p><p>Nevertheless, the &euro;1.142 billion being provided to our Vote represents an increase of almost &euro;400 million on the Department&rsquo;s pre-pandemic 2020 core allocation as per the original 2020 Revised Estimates Volume.  The Estimate also provides for the carryover of &euro;106 million in unspent capital appropriations for use by the Department this year.  These unspent capital moneys arose due to a number of reasons, not least the almost doubling of our Vote in 2020, which for proper governance and due diligence reasons meant that it was not possible to expend the full amount of this additionality in the year.<\/p><p>Significant additional moneys beyond our core allocation continue to be provided to our vote to ensure the Department and our agencies can continue to assist businesses, consumers, and workers as we get through this pandemic.  The committee will be aware of the various business and enterprise measures provided by my Department since Covid-19 took hold of our country.  The briefing provided by my officials includes details of the uptake of these schemes and, therefore, I do not propose to go into them in any further detail at this stage.<\/p><p>I will say a few words about our intentions in relation to the additional beyond core funding being provided in the Estimate before the committee this morning.  The majority of the additional funding is capital funding.  The allocation of &euro;162.6 million being provided to IDA Ireland will allow it to build an advanced manufacturing centre, which will be a national facility for multinationals and SMEs to trial, adopt, deploy, and scale digital technologies.  An additional &euro;10 million is being provided to the IDA Ireland's regional property programme, which is a critical element of the foreign direct investment, FDI, offering when it comes to regional enterprise development.  The Covid-19 products scheme, which IDA Ireland administers jointly with Enterprise Ireland, EI, will receive further funding of &euro;25 million to invest in projects in 2021.  This will fund research and development of Covid-19-related products in Ireland with significant economic and societal benefits.<\/p><p>The FRE also provides additional beyond core moneys to fund particular Covid-19 activities by Enterprise Ireland in 2021.  The &euro;322.2 million in capital funding will allow the agency to provide &euro;175 million to the sustaining enterprise fund, as well as the &euro;48.5 million small business assistance scheme for Covid-19, SBASC.  This is a financial support to help businesses with fixed costs associated with running a business, including rent, utilities, security, and storage.  EI&rsquo;s Brexit and related schemes will also receive additional funding.  Some &euro;15 million will be allocated to the ready for customs scheme; &euro;5 million for a further call under the online retail scheme; &euro;25 million for the regional enterprise development and transition schemes; and &euro;7 million for a food transformation scheme.  Food transformation will develop wider market opportunities for continued growth since Britain&rsquo;s departure from the EU. <\/p><p>I know the committee appreciates the role that the local enterprise offices, LEOs, play in assisting and promoting local indigenous businesses, which is even more important now.  The FRE provides the offices with a capital allocation of &euro;40.8 million for 2021.  This will ensure that programmes such as the trading online voucher, micro exporters assistance grant, preparing your business for customs workshops and targeted mentoring can continue to be accessed by small businesses throughout the country. <\/p><p>Ready access to finance has long been a live concern for many enterprises, particularly SMEs.  It has become even more of an issue in the light of Covid-19 and Brexit.  In response, my Department has implemented a range of targeted low-cost loans.  Members will be familiar with these at this stage.  Our 2021 Estimate will ensure that these schemes can continue to be available to the SME community.  A new initiative for 2021 will be the Brexit impact loan scheme, which has been designed to provide easier access and a wider range of financing.  Some &euro;25 million will be provided for contingent liabilities under the &euro;2 billion Covid-19 guarantee scheme, which was launched last year.  Additional funding will also be provided for schemes such as the future growth loan. <\/p><p>The focus of my Department&rsquo;s enterprise, innovation and commercialisation programme is to help enterprises commercialise innovations from investment in research and development.  Initiatives such as the disruptive technologies innovation fund, DTIF, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s research commercialisation programme and our membership of international research organisations, such as the European Space Agency, are key elements of this.  The 2021 Estimates will provide further funding of &euro;32 million to the DTIF programme, which will allow for a further call to be made under the fund as envisaged in the programme for Government.  An additional &euro;12 million will fund capital equipment under EI&rsquo;s research commercialisation programme, helping innovative enterprises, particularly SMEs, to attain critical, cutting edge equipment and infrastructure. <\/p><p>Aside from our capital allocation, the current allocation of &euro;345 million in the FRE represents an effective increase of 6.5% on the pre-pandemic Estimate of 2020.  The additional funding will ensure our enterprise agencies, including EI, IDA and the LEOs, have the necessary resources to meet the increasing demand for their services and expertise.  Additional funding is also being provided to beef up the staffing and resources of our regulatory agencies.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will benefit from increases in the order of 20%.  This will ensure that the agencies have the necessary staffing and related resources to continue their response to Covid-19 and Brexit. <\/p><p>The unprecedented challenges of Covid-19 underline the need for strategies and policies to ensure the recovery encompasses all elements of our society and economy.  The Government&rsquo;s national recovery plan charts the path for the reopening of the economy, which is predicated on rebuilding sustainable enterprises, supporting the domestic economy and leveraging the strength of the FDI sector.  Funding for my Department in 2021 is targeted at implementing these priorities.<\/p><p>Any recovery must take account of the new realities, the longer-term changes to our economy and society in areas such as digitalisation, decarbonisation, remote working, and increased automation, which undoubtedly have been accelerated by the pandemic.  The committee will be aware of the work going on across government to stop climate change.  My Department is fully engaged in the intensive preparations for the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, which is a statutory catalyst for moving to a climate-resilient and climate-neutral economy by 2050. <\/p><p>We are also working closely with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on our contribution to the next iteration of the climate action plan.  It is expected to be published later in the year.  Together with our enterprise agencies, we are working on actions to promote and facilitate decarbonisation of the enterprise sector and also avail of the economic opportunities that arise from it.An example of this is EI's climate enterprise action fund, which will help companies to build the capabilities they need to develop sustainable products, services and business models.<\/p><p>Digitalisation also represents a totemic challenge for our enterprise base and my Department is working at national  and EU level to drive digital transformation of Irish businesses.<\/p><p>The EU proposals for a digital services and digital markets Act are focused on optimising the conditions for the provision of digital services in the Internal Market, including in online safety, illegal content and fundamental rights, as well as setting rules for platforms that act as gatekeepers in the digital sector. <br\/><br\/>At the national level, the national recovery and resilience plan, for which funding is being sought from the EU recovery and resilience facility, includes proposals for a competitive fund led by my Department to drive digital transformation in Irish business over the next decade.  Complementary digital transformation initiatives, which continue to be priorities for my Department and our enterprise agencies include the advanced manufacturing centre in Limerick, further calls under the disruptive technologies innovation fund, DTIF, and implementation of Ireland's Industry 4.0 Strategy 2020-2025. <br\/><br\/>The changes that have been wrought by the pandemic and the challenges ahead affect both businesses and their employees.  It is important, therefore, the new work environment of the future equally respects the welfare of workers.  My Department has a number of specific initiatives in the area of employment rights that we intend to progress over the course of this year.  In the area of collective bargaining, a high-level working group under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, has been established to review collective bargaining and the industrial relations legislative landscape in Ireland.  The group intends to produce an interim report by the end of July and complete its work as soon as possible thereafter. <br\/><br\/>As regards remote working, the national remote work strategy was published in January.  It sets out the actions we need to take to ensure remote work is a permanent feature in the Irish workplace in a way that maximises economic, social and environmental benefits. <br\/><br\/>In terms of the right to request to work remotely, 175 submissions were received as part of the public consultation in April and May.  My officials are currently reviewing those submissions and they will help us to frame the legislation, which I hope to bring to Government later this year.  The right to disconnect is particularly important in helping employees to strike a better work-life balance and to switch off from work outside of their normal working hours. <br\/><br\/>The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, published its code of practice on the right to disconnect on 1 April 2021. The code is designed to provide guidance for the resolution of workplace issues arising from the right to disconnect both informally and formally.The committee will be aware of the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the Zalewski case<i>. <\/i>While the court found that the WRC&rsquo;s adjudication service represents the administration of justice in accordance with Article 37 of the Constitution, it also found certain aspects of the WRC&rsquo;s procedures were incompatible.  The necessary legislation to change the WRC&rsquo;s procedures on foot of the court&rsquo;s decision is currently being drafted as a matter of priority under the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy English. <br\/><br\/>On statutory sick pay, following consultation with the public, unions and employer groups, an interdepartmental group and an international review of best practice, a statutory sick pay scheme has been designed to cover almost all employees.  Work is now progressing to draft legislation to introduce the scheme.  I remains my intention to have it in place by the start of 2022. <br\/><br\/>The committee will also be aware of the commitment in the programme for Government to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government.  The Low Pay Commission, LPC, is currently commissioning research on this proposal and that is due to be completed before the end of the year.  The research will examine international evidence on living wages, the different calculation methods and the policy implications of moving to a living wage in Ireland.  The Low Pay Commission will outline a process by which Ireland will progress towards achieving this.  Separately, the commission has also been requested to examine the issue of a universal basic income with a view to bringing forward recommendations on how a pilot in Ireland could be designed.  It will take account of the annual recommendations on the national minimum wage, which is a separate matter. <br\/><br\/>The area of insurance reform is one which I know is of keen interest to the members of the committee.  The action plan for insurance reform, which is overseen by a committee of the Cabinet, is on track with Ministers reporting progress on implementing reforms.  That committee will meet later this afternoon.  For my own Department and the reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, following a public consultation which received more than 240 responses, work has commenced on the heads of a Bill with a view to bringing proposals to Government as soon as possible.  That is being led by the Minister of State, Deputy Troy. <br\/><br\/>Finally, I want to mention work that is ongoing in the area of company law and, in particular, the restructuring processes for small companies.  My Department has been working intensively to develop a simplified and effective statutory process to assist viable companies to restructure and remain in business.  The drafting of the legislation is near completion and we expect to introduce it in the House soon and, hopefully, have it enacted before the summer recess.  <br\/><br\/>Work on a Bill to establish a new corporate enforcement authority as an independent statutory agency is also near completion and it is intended to bring it through the Houses of the Oireachtas from the start of the autumn legislative session with a view to establishing the new agency in law on 1 January 2022.<br\/><br\/>I hope members of the committee have a flavour of what is being funded by my Estimate before them and of what the Department is doing with the money they vote to it.  I am happy to hear members' views and take any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#B00200","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I invite members to discuss the Estimates with the T&aacute;naiste.

My time is tight and I apologise in advance as I will have to leave to speak in the Chamber shortly.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Enterprise Ireland funding, there was unspent capital in 2020; a capital appropriation of &euro;40 million was carried over to be used specifically to help smaller counties but it cannot be used to help counties in the Border, midlands and western region.  I have been advised in replies to parliamentary questions that Offaly has only 63 supported companies, Laois has 52, Sligo has 74 and Leitrim has only 23.  To take one of two examples of the volume of funding involved, the T&aacute;naiste will note Leitrim is getting &euro;117,079, Sligo is getting &euro;707,044 and so on.  Those are not large amounts of money.  Are there any plans or could consideration be given to diverting some of that money?  When one looks at the picture of the allocations on a map, the counties in that region seem to be disproportionately disadvantaged.  I would not suggest taking money from another county but given that &euro;40 million has been carried over, would it be possible to distribute that to the Border, midlands and western region?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#C00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The Deputy was right to say some of the capital funding both from the regional enterprise development fund, REDF, and the Border fund was unspent last year.  We set up a Border fund exactly for that reason.  My predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, felt the Border area was not getting its fair share of funding and was able to produce evidence to prove that.  Much of the funding was not spent because of Covid-related delays when construction was paused.  Things just did not happen.  The Deputy will appreciate when construction is stopped one cannot simply turn it back on again.   We intend to spent that money.  The short answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question is \"Yes\".  We can certainly give consideration to diverting that to those areas but what we always need are projects that have come through planning and all the rest of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#C00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I do not think there would be any shortage of projects if people understand there is cash available to support them.

It is good to know the T&aacute;naiste is open to it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the working group that is reviewing collective bargaining, as I do not have the time to vocalise all the views I have on this subject, I will not do so.

It probably has not been written yet but I would hope the working group would complete its work in the autumn or certainly before the end of the year.  It is a complicated area, as the Deputy will be aware.  I have brought together the employers, the unions and the Government to review our collective bargaining legislation and industrial legislation both in light of the recent Supreme Court judgment and European developments with regard to collective bargaining rights to decide what we can do and how we can move forward.  Ideally, I would prefer to move forward in partnership with the unions and employers agreeing on a way forward.  The recent Supreme Court decision is helpful in upholding the right and authority of the democratically elected Parliament to have sectoral employment orders.<\/p><p>The areas that are least organised, where people are probably most vulnerable to low pay and insecure employment, are in those kinds of sectors where there would, traditionally, have been joint labour committees, JLCs, and sectoral employment orders, SEOs.

I encourage workers to do that.  It would be helpful if a deadline was set.  It is a complicated area.  The chances are that the report will present a range of options, a little like the Duffy Cahill report did.  A conversation will then stem from the report.  There is a need for this work to be done and I appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste has recognised that.  Without a deadline, I would be concerned that this work will drift.  It is necessary and important work, and a deadline would help to focus people's minds.<\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the code of practice on the right to disconnect.  It is only a code of practice and no one has the right to disconnect.  To vindicate that right, one must go to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, there are delays involved in going to the WRC, some of which relate to personnel and some of which are Covid-19-related.  Even before Covid, going back a number of years, I remember that one could be left waiting for anything up to a year.  Workers are being tormented when their phones keep beeping and they cannot get away from work.  Addressing that will, effectively, be delayed by another year because those workers have to go to the WRC.  I know the T&aacute;naiste has talked about funding and the achievements of the commission in the report, which is welcome.  The WRC will be provided with a gross allocation of &euro;15.405 million for 2021.  Is it going to get additional funding under these Estimates to recruit additional inspectors?  Figures given to me show that &euro;18 million in wages has been withheld since 2011.  That is not being withheld from people with big money.  Those figures possibly comprise modest enough sums to each individual but massive sums in terms of the overall budget.  We know the WRC does good work but we also know there are delays.  It is grand once a case goes before the WRC but the delay in access and the lack of inspectors are the problem.  With the level of inspectors there has been over the past ten years, &euro;18 million has been recovered.  The chances are that is the tip of the iceberg.  The inspectors cannot be in every workplace but it seems that where they do inspect, they find that a high level of companies inspected in one year, nearly 50%, were guilty of breaches of employment law.  Will funding be provided specifically for additional inspectors?  The T&aacute;naiste and I have discussed this matter on the floor of the D&aacute;il in the past.  Will there be funding for additional inspectors and does the T&aacute;naiste have a figure in his mind?  He knows that I want to see an additional 90 inspectors, as was agreed under Towards 2016.  I appreciate that agreement was a long time ago but the world of work has not changed.  If anything, there is more need for inspectors.  Is funding going to be available specifically for inspectors?  They do fantastic work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#D00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked about the code of practice on remote working.  That is a ministerial code but, as she rightly said, is not contained in statute.  However, the Organisation of Working Time Act is enforceable by law.  The interplay of the Act and the code of practice is important because as people increasingly work remotely via the devices we all know and love, working hours are no longer confined to the time one spends in one's workplace.  People can end up doing a lot of work from home and that should be counted as part of their working hours.  The interplay of the two needs to be enforced.<\/p> <p>  We have 53 inspectors in the WRC at the moment, 48 of whom are executive officers, EOs, and five of whom are higher executive officers, HEOs.  There are three assistant principals and one chief labour inspector.  We have sanction for 60 inspectors so we are already below the number for which we have money.  A recruitment campaign is now under way to recruit additional inspectors at both EO and HEO levels.  That will get us up to 60 inspectors and we intend to go beyond that and increase the number of inspectors over the next number of years.  We have not agreed a figure with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform yet but with somewhere between 2 million and 2.3 million people at work in Ireland, 60 inspectors is not an awful lot.

More and more people are going to be reliant on the WRC to vindicate their rights under the law.  The T&aacute;naiste said that one can go to the WRC under the Organisation of Working Time Act, which is true, but one must still wait a long time.  The WRC needs an overall increase in staff.

Some people in business have raised with me the fact that some of the schemes are working and others are not.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have a view as to which ones are working and why it is the case that others do not seem to have a high take-up rate?  In this environment, the take-up rate should be huge but some of the schemes do not have a high take-up rate.  I do not know if that is because of an associated administrative burden.  Business owners tell me they want to engage but it is not always easy.  Is the T&aacute;naiste minded to divert moneys from schemes that are not working into schemes that are working?

They are available in all areas, even beyond business.  The Microfinance Ireland loans for very small companies seem to be very popular.  Many companies are unable to repay but the loans help a lot.  The future growth loan scheme is very popular.  That is probably down to the fact that it is ten-year money.  The interest rate is approximately 4% but it is ten-year money, which is attractive when compared to five-year or six-year money, as the Deputy knows.  The Brexit and Covid schemes are less popular although uptake is increasing all the time, particularly for the &euro;2 billion Covid guarantee scheme.  That is six-year money at an interest rate between 2% and 3% but there has been less uptake of the scheme.  I think that is because people find ten-year money more attractive, even though the interest rate is slightly higher.  We are limited by state aid rules in that regard and cannot change that from six-year to ten-year money.  The future growth loan scheme is largely availed of by businesses that are doing well and want to expand whereas the Covid schemes are more targeted at businesses that are in difficulty because of Covid.  Even businesses that are in difficulty are quite risk averse.  Most businesses in Ireland do not have any debt, which is unusual but they do not like to have debt.  There is a reluctance to take on debt.  We met representatives of business groups and banks last week to discuss exactly this matter and go through the modifications we might be able to make to those schemes to make them more attractive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#D00500","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Reilly's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#D00600","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I have one more question, if I might be allowed to ask it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#D00700","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Do so quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#D00800","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>My question relates to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and its funding.

The supports to business have been significant, as have the changes in sick pay, remote working, the living wage and small company rescue.  The Department is showing signs of a real capacity to respond.<\/p> <p>  Many people were quite winded by reports on Monday that the Delta variant could result in 700,000 new cases and 13,000 hospitalisations in the next three months and more than 2,000 deaths.  Many businesses and other organisations depending on public patronage will be very interested in the evidence that will be put forward in that regard.  Are thresholds beginning to emerge in this new analysis at which we can expect to see a capacity to make decisions so that people know that if cases remain at X, Y or Z level in July or in the first two weeks of July, the modelling relating to extreme cases is not accurate and, therefore, they can proceed?  I am interested to know that because people are quite taken aback.<\/p> <p>  What contingency planning is being done in the Department with regard to the significant challenge coming down the track in respect of the corporate tax regime?  <\/p> <p>  I wish to probe the preparations in respect of climate within the Department.  I get the sense that the Department believes that because climate action relates to transport, energy use and so on, it is not really for the sectors.  I think that is misleading.  What is being done in the area of freight in particular, which will be a difficult problem?  I refer to design and packaging in sectors that supply consumer markets.  Is the Department planning to promote reuse, repair and refurbishment in a way that could see a different approach, that is, the so-called circular economy, where products have a longer life and there is less waste?  I would be interested to see that.  Specifically, are IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland now planning for a very significant offshore sector?<\/p> <p>  How are companies being supported to respond to the need for significant growth in apprenticeships?

I will try to cover as many of his questions as I can.  As regards the Delta variant, we anticipate that we will review the situation again in the run-up to 19 July.  The key question on which we do not yet have full answers is that of transmissibility and how much more transmissible is it relative to the Alpha variant or the original Wuhan or wild strain.  They will say it is more transmissible by 40% to 60%.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is going for 55%.   There is a significant difference between the models at 40% and those at 60%.  It is to be hoped that we will have a better idea how much more transmissible it is in a couple of weeks time.<\/p> <p>  Probably more important than that is the conversion rate, that is, the extent to which cases turn into hospitalisations and deaths, because obviously what we are trying to avoid is not the elimination of the virus, which is not possible or realistic.  It is not about getting rid of all cases of the virus - that is not going to happen.  It is about making sure our hospitals do not get overwhelmed and that we do not have large numbers of deaths as a consequence of Covid again.  It seems to me that in England and Scotland they are taking a much more optimistic approach than we are.  The Taoiseach spoke to Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, yesterday, just to get a steer from her as to what they think there.  They seem to be more optimistic even though they are seeing record case numbers in Scotland and 20,000 cases a day are now being detected in Britain.  They are saying that although the link between cases and hospitalisations is not broken, it is so weakened that they believe they can keep indoor dining open and may even be able to ease restrictions further on 19 July.  We have our fingers crossed and are hoping and praying that they turn out to be right because if they are right, it means that the pessimistic projections of NPHET are not the ones that will be realised and it will be something closer to optimistic or central case projections which may allow us to make different decisions.  However, I think we have made the right decision to pause until we have more information precisely because this is the kind of virus that spreads quickly.  We found in December that we rolled back on the liberalisation of restrictions too late - the horse had bolted before we heard the stable door slam.  We do not want to take that risk on this occasion.  I hate saying this because people are sick of hearing it, but the next couple of weeks will tell a lot in terms of how much of a problem Delta will be for us.  It is seeded across Europe and north America, as all present are aware, so we will be able to see data from that.<\/p> <p>  On the international corporate tax position, that is an area that is being led by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  Obviously, I keep across it as I need to.  We are now approaching the point where there may well be agreement at OECD level on Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, both of which could cost Ireland in terms of revenues because if profits are reallocated away from Ireland or if there is a higher rate, we will probably see a reduction in taxation and revenues.  That is a potential problem for us.  On balance, we think it is better to be inside the tent.  Ireland is not a tax haven and we do not wish to be one or to be seen as one.  That is why we think it is better for us to be inside any agreement that may be reached at international level or OECD level.  We are at a very tight point on that at the moment and obviously the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is taking the lead on it but I am very much across it.  <\/p> <p>  The issue relating to freight will probably be more for the Department of Transport than for my Department but obviously we will be across it.  I know the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is very ambitious about moving to hydrogen and using renewable wind to generate hydrogen which we could then use in freight, but it will take time to make that a reality, quite frankly.<\/p> <p>  On the circular economy, I am familiar with the report on it, by the way, and there are significant opportunities there.  The circular economy is actually very labour intensive.  Footwear, clothes, bikes and other products being renewed to extend their life cycle is good environmentally but it is also very labour intensive and there are really good opportunities for job creation in the domestic economy in embracing the circular economy.  Legislation on that will be forthcoming quite soon.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of offshore, that is exactly where we see significant opportunities as well.  If we can get the planning system sorted - we will do that with the marine legislation that is finally a reality - then we can really exploit enormous offshore wind opportunities which will allow for import substitution and importing less oil and gas and probably more price stability as well because the price of wind does not go up and down in the way that the price of fossil fuels does.  We see that as an enormous opportunity economically and environmentally but we are really way behind where we ought to be or in comparison with England, Scotland or Portugal.  That is largely down to planning issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#E00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for attending the meeting.

Can I again highlight the extra CT scanner at SEAM Gateway at WIT?  This project was approved in 2018 but has yet to be funded.  Could the T&aacute;naiste use his offices with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to see that this gets funded?  It is a very important project for enterprise development in the south east.<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste also referenced the allocation of &euro;162 million to IDA Ireland to build an advanced manufacturing centre and the allocation of &euro;10 million to IDA Ireland's regional property programme.  Can I point out to the T&aacute;naiste that there is no IDA Ireland office in Waterford, which is the regional gateway to the south east in Project Ireland 2040?  Could the T&aacute;naiste speak to IDA Ireland about this issue?  <\/p><p> I reference what Deputy O'Reilly called the Border-midlands region.

Again, this is something the T&aacute;naiste's office can develop.  I am happy to see ISME is now getting a seat on the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council but it must be on the Labour Employer Economic Forum to represent smaller businesses, which are not being properly represented.  <\/p><p> Regarding the reform of PIAB, does the T&aacute;naiste have any concerns about the attachment of post-traumatic stress disorder claims to soft tissue injuries, which would basically allow those claims to proceed from PIAB to the Circuit Court where the claims will be much higher?  Does the T&aacute;naiste have any plans to track that ongoing development?  <\/p><p> Regarding the situation with the hospitality industry, we must get back to some kind of large pilot testing using antigen testing.

The Deputy raised the matter with me on a few occasions and I know he will not give up until it is purchased.  I spoke to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science about it.  The way I understand it works is that there is an approved list of things Science Foundation Ireland has but it must work down that list.  It is working down the list but the item is still a bit of a way down the list.<\/p> <p>  I would be supportive of an IDA Ireland office in the south east but these are decisions for the CEO and board of IDA Ireland.  It is not really my role to say where offices should be located and who is in them but I would be supportive of IDA Ireland doing that if it can as its staff complement increases.  Our real focus for the south east is the regional economic plan for the south east.  The south east has been one of the better regions in that regard.  The local authorities have come together, are very much behind it and have appointed a programme manager to make sure it is implemented.  The Deputy will have seen the kinds of things that were done during the period of the last strategy such as an advanced building solution in Waterford; an upgrade of the business and technology parks in Kilkenny, Wexford and Waterford; and investment in Belview, which we hope will turn out to be very useful if the Glanbia-Royal A-ware project goes ahead.  Over the next three years, we plan to have a third advanced building solution in Waterford so that will facilitate a further significant FDI investment there along with a new one in Carlow.  Obviously, we are working with Wexford County Council to get planning permission for an advanced technology building in Wexford.  What we find is that when it comes to getting FDI into all regions of Ireland, which is the objective, the most successful aspect so far in getting it to go places other than the big cities is having an advanced building solution into which companies can get quickly.  Seven of the 11 buildings we built are occupied.  We need to build more, including in the south east.  <\/p> <p>  I appointed somebody from ISME to the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council.  I took that decision because I thought it was important to have somebody from the small business sector that would focus on the cost of regulation and cost competitiveness, which is an important aspect of competitiveness that we might have drifted away too much from.  Small business is represented on the Labour Employer Economic Forum through IBEC and the Small Firms Association.  The difficulty with adding more and more bodies is the question of where one stops.  At the moment, Chambers Ireland and IBEC are there as the umbrella bodies for all business organisations.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the issue of post-traumatic stress disorder and I think it is something we will have to monitor.  There always seems to be a new frontier when it comes to tort law and compensation.  We have significantly reduced awards for physical injuries.  We see that coming through with average awards in PIAB in the past while down 50%, which is what we hoped would happen.  Of course, when that happens, some people and some lawyers will look for new angles.  Psychological injuries may be the new angle when it comes to compensation and we need to monitor this very closely.<\/p> <p>  I am keeping an open mind on the testing question.  I am very aware that other European countries which operate a green pass or Covid pass system allow for vaccinated, recovered and recently tested.  NPHET is not recommending the third one.  It is recommending the first two but I think Government must keep an open mind on whether we extend the pass to people who have recently tested negative for all sorts of reasons that the Deputy will understand, particularly around non-discrimination, which appears to be done in European countries that operate these passes like Germany, Denmark and Austria.  We did not plan to do this so we are starting to work out what we can do over the next while.

We asked NPHET about this point when we met it as part of the Covid sub-committee.  The medical, scientific and public health advice from NPHET is that this will be a low risk as is the case with workers in hotels at the moment.  They would be wearing masks and there would be PPE.

The commission has examined this on several occasions and has removed some of the sub-minimum rates in recent years.  The theory or argument behind it is that having sub-minimum or lower rates ensures that people who have no experience or who have never worked before can have the opportunity to get employment.  That is the thinking behind having a lower rate.  It is to create opportunities for people to get work experience and employment who otherwise would not if they were paid at the same rate as younger workers who are a little older.  I am unsure whether I agree with that, frankly, but that is the rationale or theory behind it.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to the Deputy on ventilation but I am keen to correct myself.  There is a legal basis to it.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 require employers to ensure an adequate supply of fresh air ventilation in enclosed areas of the workplace.  This can be done through three means.  One is natural ventilation, relying on passive airflow through windows, doors and air vents that can be fully or partially opened.  That is the simplest way to do it.  Mechanical ventilation involving fans, ducts and window fans can be used to bring in fresh air from the outside.  The third means is a combination of natural and mechanical ventilation, for example, where mechanical ventilation relies on natural ventilation to maximise fresh air.  There is a legal basis to it, but I will come back to the Deputy with more detail about the practical enforceability thereof, which, I think, is what the Deputy is asking about.<\/p> <p>  I note that this time last year indoor dining was open.  People were working in that setting protected with masks.  None of the customers at that point were vaccinated.  It is now being proposed by NPHET that we move to a situation whereby all customers would be vaccinated or immune.  Notwithstanding the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant it would be a far safer scenario than the one we asked hospitality workers to work in this time last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#G00600","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I would point out that we have the Delta variant and we have higher case numbers than we had this time last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#G00700","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>My thanks to the T&aacute;naiste for coming to the committee this morning.  I want to raise one thing if that is okay.  I appreciate it straddles a number of Departments but it is very much in the T&aacute;naiste's area.  It relates to the UK high-level border operating model for produce of animal origin.  Several companies in my region are going to be adversely affected if the current situation pertains when the new stipulations come into effect from 1 August.  As the T&aacute;naiste will be aware, many of the companies operating in value added food products are going to be affected by the third country issue.  The plants operate 24 hours per day and many operate for six or seven days per week.  They have trucks departing their facilities in real time with a short window to make ferry connections.  Several of these plants already have sister facilities in the UK.  They have seen first-hand the impact of these new regulations and have been flagging for several months that we need to try to put in place a procedure, possibly a workaround or some other mechanism, that can safeguard the operation of these businesses.<\/p> <p>  Several of the companies are engaging with the office of the chief veterinary officer and it has been a positive engagement so far.  One of the suggestions is that technical officers could be brought in to supervise the loading and that a vet will sign off later on.  That has been shot down by the companies on the basis that countries, including France, have a loose interpretation of the guidelines.  In contrast, Rotterdam Port officials insist on the full rigours of the requirements.

Would the T&aacute;naiste consider establishing a climate and circular economy unit in his own Department?  If the sectors do not drive change, it will not happen, and I can give an example.<\/p> <p>  Food waste is equivalent to  million extra cars on the road and two thirds of plastic is not recyclable, which equates to the equivalent of another 500,000 cars on the road.  Commercial users are the worst offenders in misplacing waste and putting it all into the equivalent of the black bin going for incineration or landfill.  We need to get change embedded in sectors.<\/p> <p>  Offshore is an option where the State will award an option to the lowest bidder.  Does that preclude, in any way, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland from supporting the sector in the traditional way they might?  How will IDA Ireland and EI approach the opportunities in that sector?<\/p> <p>  I am still interested in the matter of apprenticeship and management development within the companies for which the T&aacute;naiste is responsible.  Enterprise Ireland produced a fantastic management development initiative and although tiny numbers go through it, it has transformed the internationalisation of some domestic businesses, which have become multinationals.  We are missing an opportunity in not developing that more widely.  If we want to shift away from the dominance that university education has had over the opportunities in practical apprenticeships - participants in which can go on to get a degree if they wish - we must see the big blue chip companies having substantial apprenticeship programmes.<\/p> <p>  It did not come as a surprise but in this day and age the fact that working right permits are tied to individual employers seems to be something from an earlier age.  We must recognise that we need support from foreign workers here so should we not move away from the idea of being tied, effectively for five years, to one employer?  It is not good for either worker rights or civil rights.  Is it time to change that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#H00900","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  We have a dedicated climate team headed by a principal officer in the Department.  There is a question of whether we should expand it, perhaps rebadge it and develop it into a climate and circular economy unit.  I had not thought about it but now the Deputy has said this to me, I will give it some thought and reflect on it.  We will have a new climate action plan in the next couple of months and, with new climate legislation, he knows how carbon budgeting will work.  A certain amount of the carbon budget and carbon reduction measures will be assigned specifically to my Department and it puts it up to us.<\/p> <p>  The idea of the legislation is to put it up to individual Departments to drive down emissions and waste in their sectors.  That is something we must do and the philosophy behind the legislation is that each sector of the Government and Department becomes responsible for the emissions ascribed to it.  If we are going to make progress, we must make this a big part of our work over the next couple of decades.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about EI and IDA Ireland helping companies involved with offshore development.  I am advised they work across the supply chain, including those developing proposals and investing.  As he said, it is a competitive auction process and, therefore, I am not sure to what extent they can provide grant aid and so on.  I will revert to him on that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy will be aware that apprenticeships fall under the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, which is led by the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris.  Many good things are happening and much progress is being made in recruiting apprentices and getting companies to take on apprenticeships and all new forms of apprentices.  The target is to have 10,000 each year by 2025 and we are going to work with the Minister on that.<\/p> <p>  Management development is a valuable area and we know well-managed companies are more competitive and productive and perform better.  We have a number of programmes to improve the quality of management in companies and perhaps it is an element we should scale up over the next couple of years, particularly if we want to close the productivity gap between domestic firms and SMEs on the one hand and the multinationals or other big firms on the other.  They are generally able to do these sorts of things for themselves but we probably need to help smaller and domestic companies to help themselves in that regard.<\/p> <p>  We are doing a review of the legislation on work permits and there will be a new consolidated law on that.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, is taking the lead on that project.  Currently, work permit holders can change their employer within 12 months if they are made redundant or there is a fundamental change in the employment relationship.  A person is not necessarily tied to one employer for five years and one can change after 12 months.  I often wonder whether a better system for Ireland might be something like a green card system where we allow in a certain number of people with full access to all parts of the labour market.  The advantage of an employment permit system is it can plug particular skills gaps in particular areas.<\/p><p>It might be a fruit farm in north Dublin or a mushroom farm in Monaghan.  The reason employment permits are given is to fill such skills gaps.  If this were not done, would it be possible to fill those gaps?  People might get work permits but not want to work in the relevant sector or part of the country.  We would then have a new problem to solve.  That is the difficulty.  Instinctively, I do not like the idea of people being invited into the country to work and being told they may only work for a particular employer because that creates a power relationship between employers and permit holders, who are migrants and who may not have many connections here or know their way around the system.  They would be more open to exploitation in those circumstances.  Instinctively, I would go the way the Deputy is going but, if we did that, would we not create a whole different problem?  We would then be issuing work permits without being able to use the work permit system to fill skills gaps that exist in particular sectors. which are often in particular parts of the country.  I do not know how to square that circle but I am open to suggestions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#H01000","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>We hope to issue a report on that matter shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#J00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I will return to the issue of ISME and the Labour Employer Economic Forum.

I ask the T&aacute;naiste to seriously consider allowing ISME to be represented on the LEEF.  It is very important that its voice is heard and I am not sure the voices of those it represents are being properly heard in the forum.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the marine legislation the T&aacute;naiste mentioned, I will ask about the development of offshore wind.  What kind of community quotient will be included in the legislation?  I refer particularly to any economic benefits that would accrue to our coastal regions and communities.  As part of this paradigm, I will ask about the issue of data centres.  Has the Government given any consideration to the percentage of the new wind generation capacity to be developed offshore that will have to be given over for data centres?  That also raises questions around the viability of the grid and the additional infrastructure we will have to develop to accommodate data centres.  I struggle to understand the relationship that requires us to build so many data centres and the economic benefits they present overall.<\/p> <p>  Again with regard to the marine legislation, I am interested in the issue of carbon sequestration.

On the issue of data centres, they present a real dilemma.  There has never been more data in the world.  There is going to be more and more data in the world over the coming years and decades and they have to be stored somewhere.  It is of real strategic advantage for Ireland to be a place where data are stored.  They are a really valuable commodity, like gold or diamonds.  Why would one not want them to be stored in one's country?  It is not just about the jobs in construction, the supply chain or maintenance.  The real value in large companies and big employers keeping their data in Ireland is that they are much more likely to bring other operations here and to keep them here.  It is the company's safe and one never moves too far away from one's safe.  That is why there is an advantage to us in having these data centres in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The problem is that data centres' demand for energy is extraordinary.  I have seen figures suggesting that as much as one third of all the electricity we produce will be needed for data centres.  This comes at a time when we are having some trouble with the grid and have a couple of power stations down.  This will present a difficulty over the next few years.  In the medium term, opportunities will arise from renewable energy, including offshore wind which will produce gigawatts of electricity.  Being the country where one can build a data centre powered by green energy could be a real plus.  Customers and consumers are becoming more environmentally aware all of the time.  They may want that from companies.  It is a real dilemma in the short term given the shortage of electricity but will also present a real opportunity in the medium term.<\/p> <p>  With regard to campaigns, we launched the Made Local campaign the other day.  The Deputy will probably have heard the advertisements on the radio.  Rachael Blackmore is our ambassador for the campaign, which encourages people to buy things made by Irish makers, designers and craftspeople.  Separate from that, there will be a campaign about buying locally which will encourage people to consider shopping locally and buying products that are made locally, whether in Ireland or in their own region or county.  We will launch that campaign in the near future and fund it well.  We are very happy to work with Guaranteed Irish as partners in that campaign.  However, what we discussed before with regard to the rules governing the Single Market must be borne in mind.

I am happy to present the 2019 annual report of the European Court of Auditors as well as other relevant publications to them today.  I would like to thank the joint committee for this invitation.  It is a pity I cannot be there in person, especially as it is a new composition of the committee since I was last there.  I would like to note that I am presenting exceptionally late this year.  However, it is still a pleasure to be here virtually.<\/p> <p>  When I presented to this committee previously, I was responsible for the annual statement of assurance on cohesion policy in Chamber II, which is one of the major EU policy areas along with natural resources.  Since that time I have been appointed the dean of Chamber V and the member responsible for the annual report.  Chamber V deals with financing and administering the Union.  In my role as the member responsible for the annual report, I am responsible for this product, which is the core product of the court.<\/p> <p>  As my time is brief, I would first like to speak about the 2019 key figures of the European Union and findings of the court&rsquo;s 2019 annual report, as well as illustrating how Ireland features in this respect.  I will then briefly touch on recently published special reports of the court.  In addition to these, I will provide members with a glance of our published opinion on the Brexit adjustment reserve for which I was a reporting member.  Finally, at the committee&rsquo;s request, I will also briefly discuss the next generation of EU funding in relation to the ECA.  I hope members find the information pack helpful.  It provides more detailed information on the aforementioned topics.<\/p> <p>  To begin with the key figures for 2019, revenue totalled &euro;163.9 billion, of which Ireland contributed &euro;2.3 billion.  Expenditure on the other hand was &euro;159.1 billion and in this regard, Ireland received &euro;2.1 billion in the form of natural resources.<\/p> <p>  As members can see from the maths here we are now a net contributor to the tune of about &euro;200 million.  To put this into perspective, I would say that this expenditure of &euro;159.1 billion represents 1% of EU GNI and, as we often mention, it is around &euro;350 for each EU citizen.  The main takeaway from that is that Ireland is a net contributor with a total of &euro;229 million.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the 2019 annual report.  As I said earlier, this is the core product of the court.  We are required to give a statement of assurance which includes opinions on the reliability of the EU accounts and on the legality and regularity of the underlying revenue and expenditures.  This is our obligation under the treaty, and these opinions are considered by the Europe Council and the European Parliament in the framework of the discharge procedure.<\/p> <p>  On our overall findings for these opinions, we concluded that the EU accounts present a true and fair view.  Revenue for 2019 was legal and regular.  Our opinion on expenditure however, is adverse.  The reason for this is that we found a level of error in 2019 of 2.7% across the whole EU budget.  Our materiality threshold is 2%.  It was just a slight increase compared to the previous year but this is the first year in three or four years that we have had an adverse opinion.  The reason for this was that we had a material error in a substantial part of our audit population.  Some 53% of our audit population is what we consider to be high risk, and we had an error rate here of around 4.9%.  On the basis of this material error in a substantial part of our population, we also had weaknesses in exposed checks and these obviously are a critical element of the control and assurance framework.  This led us to give for the first time in a number of years an adverse opinion on EU expenditure.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, legality and regularity are very important, but performance is also an issue which we cover.  For the first year in 2019, we issued a separate performance report where we tried to assess the Commission's systems in place for assessing the impact of the different EU funds in the policy areas.  Legality and regularity are sort of a compliance audit where we check compliance, that the money is being spent properly and in compliance with the rules and regulations.<\/p> <p>  We also produce a number of special reports across a broad range of topics.  In 2019 we published 25 such special reports.  We had 26 in 2020, and so far this year we have published 12 out of a potential 40 which are planned to be published this year.  They cover a multitude of topics such as food safety policy, renewable energy, e-commerce, border controls, fiscal governance and child poverty.  Examples of how our reports can be used at the national level include, for example, our report, Combating Child Poverty for which I was the responsible member.  It was mentioned in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann during a Private Members' Bill on child poverty.<\/p> <p>  In addition our report on energy efficiency was widely publicised in Ireland and considered in a call to review energy efficiency grant schemes.  Our most recent published reports that include Ireland, both of which were published just last week, relate to climate and the CAP and to dairy market disturbances and the support provided by the EU to farmers.  Ireland was a sampled member state in both of these reports.<\/p><p>In addition, yesterday we issued a Covid-19-related passenger rights audit.  This may also be of interest.<\/p><p> Members of the committee were specifically interested in INTERREG.  A report on INTERREG will be published tomorrow.  Ireland was included, but only marginally, in the overall audit scope.  It was part of an extended desk review and, as I said, the results will be published tomorrow.  Other upcoming reports that may be of interest include: the procurement of vaccines for Covid-19, which is a topical issue; fraud and the CAP; migrant return policy; and INTERREG.<\/p><p> I will move on to the Brexit adjustment reserve.  We are required to give opinions on draft legislation, when asked by legislators.  We were asked to comment on the regulation that was being set up to implement the Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR.  Our comments mainly related the exceptional architecture and design of the BAR.  It was welcome in several ways in that it gave much flexibility to the member states and it allowed for a swift reaction to this exceptional situation.  This was all positive.  However, we wanted to raise that there was a risk that the proposed timing and structure created a lack of certainty.  We also had specific issues that were more technical in terms of auditing accountability.  The eligibility period has since been extended but we had some issues about how narrow the eligibility period was.  There were other issues on eligibility of expenditure, reporting and evaluation.<\/p><p> The topic that is exercising the court at the moment is the NextGenerationEU, NGEU.  If we take it with the traditional multi-financial framework, we have a total overall budget for the next seven years of &euro;2 trillion.  This is the largest stimulus package ever financed.  The objective is to help rebuild a post-Covid-19 Europe.  The effective management poses an immediate challenge for all stakeholders, including ourselves.  The recovery facility accounts for 90% of the overall resources of the NGEU, of which Ireland should receive approximately &euro;915 million.  Compared to the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, the basis for payment is different.  The basis for payment is conditional on the achievement of milestones and targets, rather than on costs reimbursement.  It is, therefore, a big change from what was there in the past.  It will cause many challenges for our audit mandate and scope.  In that context, we are currently developing our audit strategy and approach for this.<\/p><p> To conclude, as auditors, we spend much of our time looking back, so I would like to close by looking forward.  We are going through an unprecedented and difficult time.  The EU is currently shaping its response to the current crisis with NextGenerationEU.  As stated earlier, managing the EU's finances in a sound and effective manner will thus become even more important for all stakeholders, including the European Court of Auditors, ECA.  My hope is that later this year I will be able to present our 2020 annual report in person, rather than virtually.  For now, I thank the committee for its attention.  We welcome any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021063000002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tony Murphy for his introduction.

It is a shame that we have to do it this way, but such is life at the moment.  We look forward to seeing him in Dublin for next year's report.  Hopefully, there will not be any more delays, which were unavoidable on everyone's side of things.  I give credit to Mr. Tony Murphy, Mr. Brian Murphy, and Ms Niamh Mahon, as well as the wider team in the European Court of Auditors on their work.  We discussed before how it is some of the most important work of the European Union, although it is not necessarily the most glamorous, so perhaps it does not always get coverage.  When we talk about anything European, it is easy to focus on the simple, controversial and negative, and avoid the 99.9% of hard, rewarding work that so many people do.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch on two points in the report specifically.  I have a third general point, which would be good to touch on, considering this is the first time Mr. Murphy has addressed a committee of this D&aacute;il.  Unsurprisingly, I will ask first about the Brexit adjustment reserve fund.  I would like clarity on two small issues in relation to the reporting.  Can Mr. Murphy give an indicative timeline on when reporting is expected within that process?  On the audit of the funds, is that done on a member state basis or on the package as a whole? <\/p> <p>  NextGenerationEU, NGEU, is a monumental departure for the European Union, not just to agree funding of this nature, but to be able to develop own resources and floating eurobonds.  I do not think the gravity of that has been taken into account yet.  That is probably understandable when you bear in mind the gravity of so much happening in the world.  In his presentation, Mr. Murphy referred to milestones and targets.  Could he elaborate further on that?<\/p> <p>  My third question has absolutely nothing to do with the report but it has everything to do with the work that Mr. Murphy, Ms Mahon and Mr. Brian Murphy are doing in relation to Irish people working in the European institutions.  The Government has been working on EU jobs.  This committee has had hearings with various stakeholders, including European Movement Ireland and the IEA.  If the Chair does not mind, could we take some liberty and talk about the possibilities for Irish people to work in the European Court of Auditors and its related institutions?  Many people think first of Brussels, but obviously, Mr. Murphy is in Luxembourg.  I hope the Chair does not mind me taking that small liberty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021063000002#C00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>We are taking two members at a time, so Mr. Murphy can bundle his answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021063000002#C00400","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Tony Murphy, Mr. Brian Murphy and Ms Niamh Mahon.

If my mistakes were of such a magnitude, I would be happy enough, in particular if dealing with such huge funds.  Much of the ECA&rsquo;s work is to check due diligence and to ensure everything has been done correctly in reports.  However, if we deal with something like INTERREG funding, is all the ECA's involvement after the fact?

What exactly happened as regards the 2.7%?  Like I said, it is not an error of magnitude.  I would be interested to know about it.  I refer to the European Union and the solidarity shown as regards the vaccines bought for every member state.  While we would like it to be further on, it has been somewhat successful.  Once again, I assume that reports will ensure due diligence.  I suppose from the European Union's point of view a bang for its buck was received.<\/p><p>There could be some interesting reporting relating to certain companies with which there were dealings.  Obviously, the European Union has taken out a considerable amount of loans in the past while and we welcome stimulus programmes throughout Europe and see the necessity to keep this going in order that we do not enter a period of recession.  What is Mr. Murphy's view of where Europe stands?  <\/p><p> A significant conversation is taking place on taxation.  People have voiced opinions on what is almost Europe-wide taxation.  What is the payback and methodology regarding some of those loans?  Where is that conversation at?  I would like to address INTERREG funding.  We had good news recently regarding the likes of Narrow Water Bridge, which is a vital infrastructural project that would connect north Louth with south Down.  It meets many needs regarding connectivity opening the whole area to tourism.  Five or six years ago, INTERREG funding of in or around &euro;17.9 million was allocated.  Other moneys were also allocated North and South.  Obviously, as not all of the i's were dotted and not all the t's were crossed, there was a shortfall and that money was lost.  We are at a particular point in that process and everybody is worried about a false dawn and ensuring that all the resources are in place.  Has there been much communication from a governmental point of view regarding the possibility of the likes of INTERREG funding?  I know the difficulties post Brexit but I imagine that this type of cross-Border project would still fall into that general realm.  Can Mr. Murphy give me an update on that?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021063000002#C00900","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>If I go back to Deputy Richmond's questions, as far as I know, it is 80% pre-financing.  This was one of the benefits for the member states.  Getting 80% pre-financing is unheralded.  It is basically giving countries most of the money upfront in order that they can address the urgent issues straightaway.  In terms of reporting, this is one of the issues we raised.  As the first claim member states will make to the Commission will not be made until September 2023, the first time we actually get the related claims in will be 2023.  As for whether we will audit on a member state basis, the answer is \"No\".  We do a sample of payments across the whole budget area.  The BAR will be just one more element of that.  While it is a lot of money, it is &euro;5 billion in terms of &euro;160 billion in expenditure.  It is very important, particularly so for Ireland because we are getting around &euro;1 billion in the first tranche.  That is more or less it in terms of the BAR.<\/p> <p>  On the NGEU, obviously these plans are being assessed by the Commission and are basically being approved.  What we have seen in the sample we looked at is that milestones could be something like a particular law being passed or reforms in specific labour areas.  This is where we would have a difficulty.  It would be easy to audit them because if the law is implemented, it is implemented and it is fine.  As for targets, a hospital in Spain, for instance, has stated it will create 60,000 places in residential homes for elderly people, so that is a target.  They are not linked to costs at all, which is the big issue for us.  In a way, they are easy to audit from a purely compliance point of view because they can show us that the target has been met.  Our issue then, however, is whether it has been met using EU funds in the best possible way and with the NGEU, it is not clear.  Are they national funds once they leave the Commission or are they still EU funds?  We are looking at the strategy.  It is very complicated and is a real challenge for us.  <\/p> <p>  On the point on Irish people, I thank the Deputy.  As he is aware, I am constantly trying to promote the EU to the Irish people.  We were visiting universities and were doing everything we could until the pandemic stopped us in our tracks.  We try to sell the European project and not just the Court of Auditors because the Court of Auditors is a small institution in the overall scheme of things.  In particular, it is of vital importance that we get Irish people into the Commission in particular where, basically, policies are shaped.  We follow the strategy for EU jobs, which was announced a couple of weeks ago by the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne.  We are constantly working on this and have been quite successful.  The easiest way to get people in is through a traineeship, which gives them an opportunity to see if they are really interested.  That is a good opportunity.  In 2019, before the pandemic, we were doing quite well.  We had seven trainees here out of a total of about 55 for the whole court.  Only Germany had eight so we were quite successful and we hope to continue that when things pick up again.  There were still five for 2020 so it is still not bad given the circumstances.  They are virtual traineeships, which do not really give the trainees the same insight into working in an EU institution and whether they would like to do that or invest in language skills if needed to do that.  On a positive note, we have been successful and have three detached national experts who will start in the court in September.  We have been pushing that a lot here.  Only 12 are being taken on by the court and we have been successful, in that three are Irish.  The big opportunities for Irish people in the institutions involve the Irish language.  There are a lot of opportunities in that sphere.  The problem the institutions have is that they are all chasing the same people.  They have derogations to extend the period and are now at the end of it so they must start getting people in.  We have one temporary agent who will start here around September also.  We are quite happy that we will have a mini-influx of Irish people into this institution because there are only about 15 or 16 Irish people here, so four coming in even if it is only on a temporary basis is still quite significant.  We will try to keep working on that.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding questions about the error and whether it is significant, that is all relative.  It is a matter of opinion.  Our threshold is 2.7%, which does not seem like a lot.  In terms of money, to put it into perspective we are talking about &euro;3.4 billion out of the budget.  What I said earlier was that we consider 53% of our policy areas to be high-risk expenditure mainly because they are cost reimbursement.  As we have an error rate of 4.9% there, it is quite far away from 2%.  Where we have fewer errors is in places like natural resources because direct payments are entitlement-based.  You have an area of land and are entitled to X amount.  It is far less prone to risk.  Obviously, there are other issues - perhaps not so much in Ireland -  with direct payments in some member states but that is another issue.  Perhaps that is the link to what the Chairman asked about CAP and fraud.  That is an ongoing report that will not be issued until next year.  There we are looking at things like land grabbing in some member states.  It is a bigger issue in some member states than others.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding whether we always look after the facts, auditors tend to come after the event, that is, after the horse has bolted, if you want to put it like that.  Regarding the BAR and the NGEU, because of the set-up in the EU institutions, we are often asked to give an opinion so we have a chance.  It does not mean that they will take on board what we ask for or what we raise but at least, we have the opportunity to contribute to the process.  If things materialise afterwards that we already had warned about, we can say \"we told you so.\", so there is a role there.<\/p><p> Regarding loans, I used to work at the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs, DG ECFIN, which at that time was the only treasury loan and borrowing functioning in the Commission.  It will oversee this significant lending activity for the NGEU.  It has just started.  I think it was on the market yesterday or the day before.  We will have an audit of debt management by the Commission, which will start quite soon.  As these audits take some time because of the procedure, it will be late next year before that is finalised.<\/p><p> On INTERREG, we are auditors and we look at the whole budget.  I understand that INTERREG is important in Ireland but in respect of materiality, the Deputy mentioned &euro;18 million, which, in the overall scheme of things, is not a big part of the EU budget.  On Government interactions, we are auditors and we are not driving policy.  We are purely coming along after the legislation and budgetary decisions have been made to make sure that they are implemented in line with the decisions which were taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021063000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I accept that.

We know what is going on with the loan.  It makes sense for the member states to do it in this way because it means that their balance sheets are not carrying this money.  It has been transferred centrally to the Commission and is being guaranteed by the member states.  It makes sense for member states.  All of this is new.  It is a significant challenge for us.  Are the loans really EU funds that we should audit?  The member state has to repay the loan.  We can check that the conditionality for giving the loan has been met and then check the repayment schedule and that the repayments come.  Apart from that, we can look at the debt management arrangements put in place by the Commission to make sure they are properly set up and that we get the best rates we can.

People often talk about the dry work of auditors.  I am new to this committee.  My experience is at the other side of the table, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would have been looking at ways to spend money in accordance with rules and trying to find mechanisms to do that.  It will not surprise the witnesses that my questions will centre around that perspective.  I was responsible for cohesion, INTERREG and PEACE, and co-chaired the special EU programme bodies for five years.  In all our interactions, we always had to be concerned about the perspective of the Court of Auditors and the view on the expenditure of European funds in particular.  I want to talk to the witnesses about the flexibilities, as they see them, and how the Court of Auditors applies them, especially with the new social challenges.  Clearly, the fiscal rules that were holy writ for a long time, by which we were in many cases nailed to the wall, as others were, have evaporated with the pandemic.  What was not doable is now doable, with absolute justification.  My concern is that this will change back to old habits and that we will be faced with serious social and economic challenges post pandemic.  Will we have the flexibilities to deal with that or not?  The witnesses might say that it is an entirely political decision but I would be interested in their perspective on it as much as they can give it.<\/p> <p>  The biggest social challenge for us prior to the pandemic was the housing crisis.  We have to provide a significant number of social and affordable houses in this country.  What is the definition of a service of \"general economic interest\", which is excluded from general state aid rules?  There seems to be a divergence of views of how that is applied across the Union and the degree of flexibility.  I am anxious that it would be clear that investment in social and affordable housing, which is a social imperative for us, would be excluded from state aid rules and would be a service of general economic interest.<\/p> <p>  The fiscal rules generally have been set aside for the pandemic.  Will that flexibility be maintained or will there be a reaction to the level of indebtedness that the Union has?  There was always a morbid fear of collective borrowing in Germany, in all my interactions over the years, and it did not want to mutualise debt.  We have overcome that.  It is an important underpinning of solidarity across the Union.  Do the witnesses think that will be maintained and sustained into the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021063000002#E01300","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Before calling Deputy Haughey, I want to say that Deputy Howlin has asked pertinent questions which are probably on all our minds.

We all knew that was the case in recent years but it is interesting and no doubt it will increase in future, all things considered.  My first question is a throwback to one from the Chairman of this committee in the last D&aacute;il, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.<\/p><p>I recall him quizzing Mr. Murphy about grant application forms, criticising the jargon on them, the amount of information sought, the fact that they are not very citizen-friendly and so on.  I appreciate that auditors have their job to do but is there any recognition of this problem?  Many citizens do not have master's degrees and so forth in applying for various forms of funding, particularly, I suggest, farm payments.  Is Mr. Murphy aware of the conflict between the need for efficiency and avoidance of fraud on the one hand and making these grant schemes accessible, from a form-filling perspective, on the other?  <\/p><p> As other speakers said, NextGenerationEU is unprecedented.  It is a major European Union initiative and is groundbreaking in many respects.  Mr. Murphy stated that the European Court of Auditors is developing an audit strategy for NextGenerationEU.  Presumably he will say that his organisation will have the capacity and resources to take on this challenge but I ask him to expand on that a little more.  What work is being done in that regard?  Is Mr. Murphy confident that the European Court of Auditors will be able to monitor, audit and keep close control of NextGenerationEU funding?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021063000002#E01500","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Howlin for the very interesting and thought-provoking questions.

There is an awful lot of flexibility because every member state will propose its own plan tailored to its own needs.  It will not be like a diktat coming from Brussels where we want something implemented across the board.  It is very specific.  In that regard, if it is done well, it should be more effective than having a one-size-fits-all approach.<\/p> <p>  The housing crisis comes up every time I am in Ireland and I fully appreciate the gravity of the situation.  All I can say is that state aid is not included in NGEU.  It will not feature at all so there is some scope there in that NGEU is not applicable.  As members of the committee will know, some of our errors referenced by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, such as the 2.7%, are in fact related to state aid.  We have state aid issues in different member states.  There is very thorough system in place in the Commission.  There is a whole Directorate-General, DG, for Competition, that follows all this.  Any time we have a problem, we have to sit down with DG members and talk out each individual case.  A very serious process is in place.  State aid issues are not taken lightly, even in the Commission.  It is an issue but, hopefully, NGEU may give some leeway as we move forward, specifically on housing.<\/p> <p>  I was asked what I thought about as we go forward.  In my opinion, there is now no turning back.  The tap has been turned on and there is no way to go back.  We will not go back to former days.  It seems that even the German mentality has changed in that regard, which was one of the bigger obstacles to the idea of borrowing to fund current expenditure.  There will be a lot of flexibility in future.  It brings problems because we need to get the balance right between flexibilities, and Deputy Haughey also asked about this, and making sure EU funds are spent reasonably.  We mentioned figures of &euro;2 trillion over the next seven years for NGEU and MFF.  There is also an awful lot of money still to come from the 2014-20 period, which has not been absorbed yet.  All these funds are available and, in a way, projects are competing for different funding sources that are now available.  There are also issues of urgency and the exceptional nature of some projects.  All these things, unfortunately, lead to a higher risk of fraud, for instance.  There is no getting away from the fact that the risk is there although I am not saying it will materialise.  We have to be aware of that.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Haughey's point, we are a net contributor and without a shadow of a doubt our contributions will increase.  That is why the work of this committee and the work we do should be more important from an Irish perspective.  We do not put systems in place for forms and grants but we criticise them and sometimes state that systems are overly complex.  In some cases, member states actually go over and beyond what is required by the EU, which is so-called gold plating.  There are many valid reasons for this.  As Deputy Howlin said, they possibly want to be deadly sure that the EU will not come along later and ask for money back.  Members states are possibly being overcautious.  Where we see some potential for progress, and we always talk about simplification, is in grants being replaced by, for instance, simplified cost options or lump sums, where the application process is much easier.  If certain criteria are met, a member state is entitled to a certain amount of money.  It happens, for instance, with Erasmus grants and all sorts of other areas.  It makes things much easier.  I fully agree that, at the end of the day, forms should not discourage beneficiaries.  We want them to benefit from available EU funding. <\/p> <p>  Deputy Haughey also asked about the audit strategy and whether we will have capacity in resources.  It will depend on the scope of the audit we can do.  As I said, we are looking to see what we can do now.  There is also the complexity of other funds competing with NGEU funds.  It is different from the MFF, for which we give an opinion on the overall budget.  For the NGEU, we will be validating claims from each member state.  To return to Deputy Richmond's question at the start on whether there would be auditing of the bar for member states, there will not be auditing of the bar but there will be for NGEU because there are specific claims for each member state and they are all different.  The plans are established by dealing with these milestones and targets and the claims are then submitted for payment.  We will have to look to see that the Commission has done enough work to be able to validate those payments so we can give assurance, in some shape or form, that the money has been spent in compliance with the rules, even if these may be very limited.<\/p> <p>  To finish on Deputy Howlin's point, there is room for optimism in future in terms of the current mentality being maintained.  As he said, there is a big awareness of the social issues throughout Europe, generally, and the problems they have caused in the political dimension too.  It is not from a lack of awareness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021063000002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>There are no members indicating at the moment.

Absorption of funds is still an issue in the overall terms of the budget, but Ireland is performing above average in that regard.  At the end of 2019, we had 60.6% of cumulative payments spent, which was the second highest in the EU after Finland.  The Finns obviously learned something from their visits here.  The average would be nearer 50%.  The newer member states, in particular, have problems in terms of their administrative capacity to draw down funds.  In addition to the &euro;2 trillion, there is also still a lot of money left from the 2014 to 2020 period that has to be absorbed.  To answer the Deputy's question simply, we still are fairly near the top of the class in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021063000002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>My question is something of a follow-up one and I am interested to hear Mr. Murphy's response.  We have talked about how there can be a deficit in capacity when it comes to applying for funds.  There is a crossover between ensuring there is proper accountability and transparency and facilitating ease of access for people to put in proposals.  I see this in some of my meetings with the special EU programmes body, SEUPB, and in respect of particular projects.  At one stage, my wife worked on a project that had INTERREG funding and was operating on a North-South basis and in Scotland as well.  She experienced the same issue.  That project involved programmes for early childhood education training, the changing lives initiative and training of parents, teachers, etc. in certain methodologies.  I have been told by groups and organisations over the years about the very rigorous stuff that sometimes needs to be done involving multiple receipts and so on.  It would be a three prices on a light bulb type of scenario.  In fairness, the last time I met with the SEUPB, the people there told me that some of the problem is to do with home-grown laws, particularly stuff that relates to health.  It is sometimes the case, for example, that it is the northern health boards or the HSE creating a level of difficulty.<\/p> <p>  What sorts of conversations are happening in Europe in regard to streamlining?  I recognise some of that conversation will have to take place at the domestic level.  I also accept we need overall transparency and for someone like Mr. Murphy, whether at European or domestic level, to make sure it is not a case of \"one for you and two for me\" and all the rest of it.  However, we also need to make sure projects can be delivered and people are not caught up in bureaucracy.  Sometimes when proposals are put in and people are trying to access money for services, they get hamstrung on the basis of incredibly difficult procurement scenarios.  I am wondering what the conversation is in regard to streamlining and whether the Court of Auditors is party to it.  As I said, I accept that much of this probably needs to happen at a domestic level.  It is like every other situation in that we need to get all the stakeholders in the room and ask them to come up with a workable solution, which does not always happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021063000002#G00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>We are not a main party to those negotiations or talks.  If we come across something in an audit, we raise it as a potential area that should be looked at as we move forward and we will follow up on it in that context.  The Deputy mentioned the HSE and other bodies.  One of the principles of the EU is subsidiarity, under which certain matters are the prerogative of member states.  Going back to what Deputy Howlin said, many social policy areas are still within the prerogative of individual member states.  The EU, in effect, gives an amount of money to try to influence policy or improve things in certain areas, but the main driver, as Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, is at national level.<\/p> <p>  An issue that can arise in this context is what I refer to as gold-plating.  The problem is even worse for us in this regard.  If we go to a member state and find it has national rules that are even more onerous than those of the EU, we also have to check those national requirements.  Even if the country is okay from an EU rules point of view, if it is not fully respecting its own national rules, then that causes us a problem and may create a formal error.  It is not an easy scenario.  I think everybody agrees we should try to make it as simple as possible for beneficiaries to benefit from EU funds, respecting, as the Deputy said, that we cannot just give them out without any controls or accountability.  We have talked a good deal today about flexibility.  Another issue is balance.  It is important to get the balance right between the formality of forms, checks and whatever else and having flexibility.

It comes back to some member states having a fear about compliance and wanting to be 100% sure there will not be any comeback later on.  It varies between member states, where mentality, culture and everything else has an impact.  What happens in Ireland is totally different from what we see in some of the eastern and southern member states and even more so in Scandinavia.  That is what we find and we try to deal with it.

Over the past week I have been struck by the horrific situation unfolding in Miami which was getting all this attention, but houses are crumbling and falling because of this.  Literally as we speak, a homeowners' group has gathered with Department officials to try to work through a plan.  We are looking to Europe as well in terms of standards and joining us to stand up for homeowners.  I know it is not necessarily an ombudsman thing but as the Chairman said, Mr. Murphy may be able to direct us.  It has been raised at the petitions committee that European citizens are watching their homes, that they have worked incredibly hard for, crumble beneath them for no reason other than that they were unfortunate enough to buy concrete blocks from a particular place.

We very much welcome this opportunity to give the committee an overview of the bank's progress during the time of colossal trauma and change in the world.  We will endeavour to answer all of the members' questions and to take on board their views today.  Our direct engagement with the committee is a valuable means of understanding its expectations, while allowing us to explain the bank&rsquo;s position in terms of supporting the economy and our 2.8 million customers in current and future challenging times.  With me today are Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and Ms Helen Dooley.<br\/><br\/>While the human misery caused by the Covid-19 pandemic can never be calculated, the ultimate cost of the enormous shock to the global economy has yet to be fully assessed.  As with the rest of the country, the pandemic crisis, coupled with the uncertainty created by Brexit, tested the resilience of the banking sector at every level.  It was a time for AIB to prove that it could focus its resources on playing a major and positive role in helping the country through the crisis and be part of the solution.<br\/><br\/>Fortunately, the bank had robust capital strength, a good quality balance sheet and digital capability when the pandemic took hold, facts that allowed us to take immediate actions to mitigate the economic impact of lockdown on our customers.  With banks deemed by Government to be an essential service, we were required to mobilise our response at speed.  We provided almost 80,000 payment breaks with nearly 90% of those customers now having returned to full repayment of principal and interest.  More than 80% of our employees moved to working from home, while hundreds of our team members remained in their locations keeping more than 99% of our branches open and dealing with a 400% increase in contacts to our call centres.  As the Government introduced unprecedented supports across the economy, AIB rowed in behind the State&rsquo;s Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, with an allocation of &euro;746 million to help businesses through the crisis.<br\/><br\/>As Dr. Michael Ryan of the WHO said during the pandemic, &quot;speed trumps perfection&quot;.  In the face of the deepening crisis, the bank embarked on compressing what would normally take years of organisational and systems changes into weeks and, in some instances, into days<i>. <\/i>There were occasions when I wished we could have moved even more swiftly but, within the prevailing constraints, a quick fix was simply not always appropriate.  However, at all times, we sought to ensure the best protections were provided to our customers.<br\/><br\/>As AIB harnessed its resources to help deal with the short- to medium-term effects of Covid-19 on our customers and the wider economy, we also embarked on a longer-term programme to facilitate the bank&rsquo;s future growth.  In December 2020 we updated our three-year strategy to specifically address gaps in our product and service offerings to customers.<br\/><br\/>Members are all very much aware that one of Ireland&rsquo;s oldest financial institutions, Ulster Bank, is preparing to exit the market in the Republic of Ireland.  When it became apparent that its parent, NatWest, was conducting a review of its Irish operations, we began a process that ultimately led to AIB signing a deal earlier this week to acquire Ulster Bank&rsquo;s &euro;4 billion portfolio of performing corporate and commercial loans.  This will involve the transfer of approximately 280 employees to AIB Group from Ulster Bank.<br\/><br\/>AIB is currently in the process of seeking regulatory approval for the acquisition of Goodbody Stockbrokers, which will allow it to merge the expertise of both companies and broaden its range of customer offerings.  Let me again use this opportunity to nail the canard that the acquisition of Goodbody was a means of circumventing the Government's pay restrictions.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The remuneration arrangements at Goodbody are entirely separate and ring-fenced from those at AIB and the Government's restrictions on pay remain fully intact at the bank.<br\/><br\/>In order to streamline and avoid duplication of services, a very small group of employees from the bank will transfer to Goodbody.  None of these can receive remuneration that exceeds the Government pay cap.  In addition, apart from this group, Goodbody will not be permitted to hire anybody who has worked for AIB in the course of the previous two years.<br\/><br\/>Last week also we formally announced to the Stock Exchange a joint venture with Great-West LifeCo to augment our life, pensions and savings propositions, providing comprehensive choices for customers and diversification of the bank&rsquo;s income streams at a time of sustained low interest rates.<br\/><br\/>Covid-19 has accelerated customers move to digital and this is reflected in our strategy for branches and offices.  For example, we have seen branch transactions fall to 39,500 per day compared with a rise to, on occasion, 2.3 million daily interactions with our mobile app &ndash; developments that have led us to examine how to best balance the need for traditional local banking services and customer adoption of new technologies.  Banking is evolving but be assured that AIB will maintain its very strong branch presence throughout the country, continuing our personal and business customer relationships in the local community while increasing sales and advisory services.<br\/><br\/>We have recently amalgamated five branches in Dublin, Cork and Galway that were in close proximity to each other and plan to further review a small number of locations in mainly urban areas where overlaps occur.  Our almost 20 year old relationship with An Post continues to deepen to the point where 4 million AIB banking transactions are conducted in post offices every year.<br\/><br\/>Due to the majority of our employees&rsquo; preference for a hybrid working model that allows them to work outside of the urban centres, our need for large office space in Dublin has also shrunk.  As a result, we have decided to exit three of our main office buildings in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>As we emerge from the pandemic, it is imperative that AIB remains resilient and well-positioned to support Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  In spite of the fallout of Covid-19 and the sustained low interest rate environment, the group returned to profitability in the first quarter of 2021.  We are confident this recovery will continue as the wider population is vaccinated and the economy returns to solid growth.  A robust balance sheet, strong digital capability and an extensive community-based branch network all combine to facilitate the bank&rsquo;s credit flow to Ireland&rsquo;s homes and businesses as well as underpinning critical national infrastructure such as renewable energy projects and home building.<br\/><br\/>Addressing the housing supply deficit is of course one of the country&rsquo;s most urgent social and economic imperatives.  AIB is able to play a crucial role in funding the construction of social, affordable and private homes.  We are currently the primary lender to schemes delivering 10,000 new units.  Last year, we launched a &euro;300 million social housing fund to deliver more than 2,000 new sustainable energy-efficient social housing units across the country.  I am pleased to confirm that this fund has been fully allocated and AIB is about to launch an additional &euro;500 million social housing fund, leading to a build of more than 3,000 homes.  Meanwhile, the bank has been providing more than 400 suitable vacant properties to the Housing Agency in what has become a very successful relationship.<br\/><br\/>The immense challenge of climate change is something that confronts us all and, again, the financial sector has a key role in supporting measures to counter it.  Supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy, reducing our own carbon footprint and helping our customers to invest in green projects, such as retrofitting, are now intrinsic to our business model.  Green lending amounted to almost &euro;1.5 billion last year, the strongest performing part of our book.  Our ambition is that that will account for 70% of overall new lending by 2030.<\/p><p>Green lending amounted to almost &euro;1.5 billion last year.  That is the strongest performing part of our book.  Our ambition is that it will account for 70% of overall new lending by 2030.  In this space, AIB has a &euro;5 billion climate action fund for lending into the Irish economy.  We have raised &euro;1.75 billion in green bonds to fund projects with clear environmental and climate change benefits.  We have the lowest green five-year fixed-rate mortgage in the Irish market and discounted green retrofitting and car loans.  <\/p><p> While AIB operates in a shrinking banking market, competition remains intense, and is set to increase with the arrival of more digital payment companies.  We must be equipped to deal with competition from non-traditional lenders.  It is for these reasons that I am unwavering in implementing strategies to put the bank on the strongest possible footing, so that we continue as a stable contributor to the economy and Irish society.<\/p><p> We are cautiously emerging from the pandemic.  I am glad to say that AIB was able to withstand an economic shock the likes of which we just experienced yet managed to protect our customers from the most severe financial impacts.  We remain strongly positioned to contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth and employment, helping households, communities, farming, and businesses to meet their financial and social needs.  Our entire focus now is on proactively supporting these customers, particularly those facing financial difficulty. <\/p><p> AIB is a central part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic infrastructure.  To give the committee an idea of the scale of the bank&rsquo;s activities, our total balance sheet is over &euro;110 billion; new lending was &euro;9.2 billion in 2020, in spite of the pandemic; and AIB processes over &euro;870 billion in payments for our business and personal customers annually.  These are just snapshots of the extent of our reach.  AIB will continue to be a key financial enabler in the economy and in the communities that we serve, contributing positively to our society and working to return the taxpayers&rsquo; investment when Government decides the time is right.  I thank the committee for its time and we look forward to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021063000002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colin Hunt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021063000002#B00200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I welcome all our guests from AIB to the committee.  We will start with the issue Dr. Hunt raised about Goodbody stockbroker.  He mentioned that there was a work-around with the remuneration.  Previously, AIB, in its annual publication of its accounts, suggested it would look at an enhanced remuneration, where bonuses would be reintroduced.  As CEO of the bank, Dr. Hunt will know that that can only happen with the consent of the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas would have to change the law to get rid of the 45% additional USC surcharge that we apply to bankers&rsquo; bonuses.  Can Dr. Hunt say whether he has any intention to revisit that issue, that he had previously announced, but set to one side?  Can he also explain to me the letter he sent to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, under the terms of the State agreement on the completion of the transaction Gold which is Goodbody?  He asked that it would be deemed a group company of the AIB, to which the remunerations provisions would apply.  He said in writing he was seeking the consent of the Minister for Finance that, on the acquisition of Goodbody, it would be excluded from the definition of group company, solely for the purpose of the remuneration provisions and that none of the remuneration provisions will apply to Gold or Goodbody.  To summarise, he acknowledged in that letter that the acquisition of Goodbody would be deemed a group company.  He asked the Minister to designate it as not a group company, but solely for the purposes of remuneration.  This is to work around the law that we have passed in the Oireachtas.  What is Dr. Hunt's understanding of how the Minister is simply able to exempt Goodbody from this law, by redefining it outside of a group company?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021063000002#B00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  On the first part of his question, the Government pay restrictions in relation to the banking sector remain in place.  I have no expectation that they will change in the near term.  The Government&rsquo;s restrictions, as they apply to AIB, post the acquisition of Goodbody, will remain in place.  They will remain a feature of the remuneration arrangements within AIB.  There will be no return to variable pay in the absence of agreement in advance from the State.  It is not anywhere near the top of my agenda.  It is not even on the first page of my agenda items, as CEO at this point in time.<\/p> <p>  On the Goodbody issue, when I became CEO of the bank, I was conscious of the fact that this is a pillar bank.  We have an ambition to provide a full suite of products and services to our customers at every stage of their lives.  We had a number of product gaps.  These were in investments, wealth management, and capital markets.  In a move to eliminate those gaps, we engaged in discussions with Fexco and with Goodbody, with a view to bring that company into AIB Group.  The remuneration arrangements within Goodbody are different from their remuneration arrangements within AIB.  Those remuneration arrangements, for example, variable pay, are a feature of the industry in which Goodbody competes.  I would not have wanted to acquire the business in the absence of us having the ability to continue with the pre-existing remuneration arrangements within Goodbody, because if I was not able to continue with them, I would run the risk of the business being significantly damaged by an outflow of talent and staff members.  We have put in place a clear set of restrictions to ensure the continued application of the restrictions on remuneration that apply to AIB.

Before the financial crash, it was 15% to 20%.  Obviously, the capital requirements applied by the ECB are having an impact on the banking sector.  It would be argued by AIB and others that these are contributing to high interest rates, a low return on equity and, hence, a limited appetite for investment and new entrants.<\/p><p> The rate of risk-weighted assets, which are a measure of risk and influence the capital that must be held against a mortgage like any other loan, is high in Ireland compared with other European countries.  This means that additional capital must be held against mortgages in Ireland.  The rate in Ireland is a multiple of what would be found in, for example, the Netherlands and Germany.  The calculation of risk-weighted assets is influenced not only by future risk, but by a look-back provision.  I am looking at the Department of Finance's report, according to which Ireland's rate is approximately 37% whereas Britain's is in or around 11% or 12%.  AIB has an average of 30% risk-weighted assets.  What can be done to bring that number down closer to the European average?  Is it the case that there needs to be more transparency in how these rates are calculated at ECB level?  Is there anything that AIB can do itself?  If we were to reduce our average to closer to the European average, what impact would it have on interest rates?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021063000002#B01100","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct, in that the risk weights applying to Irish banks are significantly greater than they are elsewhere in the eurozone.  The primary driver of that is the losses that were experienced in this sector in Ireland during the global financial crisis.  The loss experience of Irish banks was significantly greater than that of the average European bank.  The models that are used to determine the risk weights that are applied to our capital today are a reflection of the decisions that were made in the 2000s and the events of 2008 to 2013.  It is a reflection of historical experience.  Those very severe default records and losses will remain part of our modelling framework in perpetuity.  We do not control that.  They are there because of the history of the Irish banks and the losses that we reported.<\/p> <p>  The best way that we can influence this is by ensuring that the lending we engage in today is prudent, appropriate and sustainable and that we never again return to the sort of imprudent lending practices that created the environment in which we had those significant loan losses.  I expect that those risk weights will reduce over time.<\/p> <p>  We have just had an extraordinary crisis and we are still emerging from it at a pace that is uncertain.  It has been a global crisis that has impacted on businesses and households around the world.  Those data points will factor into the model-generated risk-weighted assets, so there may be a significant relativity change over the course of the next number of quarters.  I assure the committee that, as those risk weights reduce and the benefits of years and years of prudent, sustainable and appropriate lending are felt, it will have a compressing impact on the spread between the average European mortgage rate and the average Irish mortgage rate.

Will Dr. Hunt update the committee on the progress made in compensating this cohort of 5,900 customers and the average amount of compensation that is being paid out of them?

Even within the grouping, when one compares others with AIB&rsquo;s front book and back book pricing, we will find that AIB stacks up favourably.

I have looked at cases, as I know the Chairman and all the members of the committee have, in which not in a month of Sundays would I have considered awarding to some of the people concerned the kind of facility that was given to them.  It clearly undermined their ability to have any freedom for the rest of their lives.  People were engaging in most unwise borrowing, and it proved so.  My request at this stage is that the lending conditions operated by the banks be of such a nature as to protect the borrower as well.  I ask that this nonsense of extended interest-only loans, which mysteriously matured in the middle of the crash, not continue.  It may suit speculators but it does not suit the long-term customers who want to live their own lives in their own way and in security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021063000002#F00900","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I am very conscious of how important it is that all the activities in which we engage from a lending perspective are sustainable and in the best interests of our customers and the best interests, ultimately, of the bank itself.

I represent Galway city and the area of Connemara, which is an extremely rural area.  There is a local knowledge when there are bricks and mortar banks.

Yet, when we talk to the customers, and I have spoken to people who are affected by this, they tell us that in many senses they are often forced into these new ways of banking since there are no staff only machines.

Obviously this would vary over the course of a day.  Some days are busier but on average it was 50,000 customers.  Post-pandemic that number is probably fewer than 40,000 people now.  It is still, however, 40,000 people coming into our branches.  Every day on average we have 1.5 million interactions with our customers using our digital technology.  That is an average and some days it goes as high as 2.3 million transactions, as I said in my opening statement.  For everyday transaction banking the strong preference of our customers is to use our digital technology.  This is just statement of fact. <\/p> <p>  I recognise, however, that the branch network is very important to us.  I regard it as a key differentiator for us.  As part of our strategic pillars we have a commitment to sustainable communities.  It is our strong view that in order to be committed to our communities we have to be embedded within those communities.  Notwithstanding that we have had an amalgamation of five overlapping branches in urban centres, and we may well see further amalgamations of overlapping branches in urban centres, we are very committed to having a strong physical presence of an AIB branch on the main streets of Ireland.  That is a major serious commitment on our part for very good business reasons.  What goes on in the branches will evolve over time.  We are going to see less in the way of everyday transaction banking.  That is shifting onto the digital platforms.  It is quicker, one can access it 24-7, but what goes on in the branches is going to change.  <\/p> <p>  Over time we will see more of a gradual evolution towards sales and advice.  When people come to the big financial decisions they will make in their lives such as the mortgage, life insurance and savings for the future, we will have people right across the group and across the country employed giving that advice.  We will continue to have a really strong physical presence in branches that we serve.  I believe that the very best brand ambassadors we have are, without question, the people who wear the AIB uniform and who serve on the front line in every single part of the country.  They are incredible and they do a wonderful job.  I am extraordinarily proud of the fact that it is those people who, in the face of this extraordinary pandemic, went out of their way and worked very hard to ensure that we could keep more than 99% of our branch network open.  We thought it was very important that at a time when so many of our customers were forced to close their doors, we wanted to keep our doors open.  We could not have done this without the commitment, energy, professionalism and dedication of the very best brand ambassadors we have, who are our staff in the branches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021063000002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colin Hunt"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>My final question is about the announcement of the closure of another head office building in Dublin over the past few months.

To lead into it, over a period of time on the mortgages side, as we all know and committee members have heard us speak about it at a number of meetings, we had a lot of restructuring to do.  We have restructured and put solutions in place for approximately 47,000 mortgage customers over a lengthy period of time.  The good news is that of those we have in place more than 93% are performing and operating as agreed.  This was a hugely important piece of work.  As we discussed previously, alongside it we had some loan sales of other types of assets.<\/p> <p>  In addition to this, a few years ago with the organisation the Chair mentioned, iCare, we put in place and supported an enhanced mortgage to rent scheme.  This has worked very well.  At the point it was put in place, the entire industry had managed to complete only 250 cases in the preceding years.  As of today, we have done as many as the entire industry had done at that period of time.  This is hugely beneficial for AIB's customers.<\/p> <p>  We still had a group of mortgages that were not co-operating or engaging with us so we could restructure them.  Within the residual mortgage population was a group of customers who, to be fair to them, were co-operating with us but we could not find a sustainable solution.  There was no way we could amend their mortgages to make them sustainable.  One of the options was to move to mortgage to rent and the Chair knows how this operates.  Because we could not get engagement with the wider group of mortgage customers as we were agreeing to move forward on portfolio sales we created a separate portfolio.  This broadly had customers who were co-operating with us but we could not identify a banking solution for them.  We felt one of the most appropriate options might be mortgage to rent.<\/p> <p>  This was something we discussed at length with the committee the last time we came before it.  I was looking at my notes.  The Chair and others favoured an alternative approach to this issue.  We agreed we would embrace and engage with the process, which we have done.  We identified a group of approximately 650 mortgage holders in this category.  We sought partners who would purchase these loans on the basis they would work with the customers to find sustainable solutions.  A number of organisations came forward and we worked through it in a commercial and customer-centric fashion.  We agreed to sell the loans to one of the consortia.  This took place earlier this year.  During the process, we worked to ensure the mortgages to rent in the pipeline were concluded.  There was probably a difference because we were so advanced with mortgage to rent activity.  It was something we had to embrace, unlike some others.  In the round, this is what the portfolio looked like.  It probably was groundbreaking not just for Ireland.  It was probably groundbreaking internationally in terms of what we achieved.  The customers who went as part of it should benefit from a good outcome.  I hope this gives the Chair some clarity on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021063000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Is is possible for Mr. O'Keeffe to give us the name of the company or financial institution that bought the loans?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021063000002#K00300","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>It was a consortium of Everyday Finance.

I believe there is general acknowledgement now that the 25-year leasing model of social housing is not a positive model for the State.  It has been identified as poor value for money for the State.  Effectively, it is the paying of mortgage and profit.  When we talk about social housing we need to be clear that it is very much a for-profit enterprise and one where the homes are not for life but become an asset after 25 years.  Again, it has been identified as something that is poor value for the State.  I wonder whether the model is being reflected on or changed in terms of the engagement or investment approach of the bank.<\/p> <p>  It would be useful to get information on the properties made available to the Housing Agency.  Are they permanently made available to the Housing Agency or leased?  What are the arrangements for the vacant properties made available to the Housing Agency?  How permanent is the arrangement?  That is one part.<\/p> <p>  The key point I wanted to touch on is the question of the agents, which has been discussed.  I have no wish to reiterate the point but I note that when we talk about stakeholders, it is hard to see.  EBS tied agents are clearly stakeholders.  In many cases customers are key stakeholders.  If we are talking about shareholders as stakeholders, the State is the majority shareholder.  I am curious about who the stakeholders are.  Whose interests are being balanced against EBS tied agents in this case?  Who are they?<\/p> <p>  I realise am asking the questions in reverse order but this is the question I would like answered first.  It is in respect of another judgment made by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Last year the ombudsman upheld a complaint against AIB relating to failure of the bank to offer a tracker mortgage to a customer in line with the mortgage contract.  The judgment was that the difference between the amount of interest paid from 10 April to date and the amount of interest that would have been paid at the reduced capital balance would be repaid to the complainant.  That arrangement is now being rolled out to 6,000 customers who had the same contract.  This is one of the largest refund programmes under the tracker mortgage scandal.<\/p> <p>  I would like one question specifically answered.  Is it correct that AIB paid simple interest instead of compound interest in making those returns to those 6,000 borrowers?  Was calculating the interest refund based on simple interest or compound interest?  In that sense, is it consistent with the approach taken in the charging of interest to customers in the first place?  I call on the bank representatives to answer that specific question first and then come to the other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021063000002#L00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Dr. Hunt may wish for me to take that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021063000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Keeffe can address the issue relating to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021063000002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colin Hunt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>In fairness we touched on this briefly earlier with Deputy Jim O'Callaghan in respect of the question on simple interest.

The Senator referred to stakeholders earlier.  How do we define stakeholders?  If we went back 20 years, the stakeholders would have been a reasonably narrow group of people.  However, I am conscious that alongside our regulatory licence to operate, we have a social licence to operate.  We have a duty to a broad array of stakeholders, who are our customers, our staff, our regulators, our shareholders and the wider public.  This is because of the extraordinary role that this bank has in the well-being of this country.  I am conscious, as I said, of the social licence to operate.  We warmly welcome the expected introduction of the SEAR legislation.  We believe it will be supportive of the best management of the banking industry and of the ultimate restoration of our reputation and of trust across the banking system.  I have not had any specific discussions with Government on this.  It is a matter for Government and for the regulator to arrive at the legislation.

In the past number of years, we spent a lot of time on looking at the code of conduct and building what we believe will be the foundations of the SEAR legislation.  We took learnings from other jurisdictions and based our regime on what the Central Bank of Ireland has advised to date.  These will be the cornerstones of that regime.

That is attended to in the Bill, although I am not certain of that.  It is the abruptness with which the whole thing happens that frightens the people concerned.  Whether they have been running a small business such as a little shop on the corner, a small farm or any kind of business, all these things come at a time when the family is vulnerable.

Even as recently as last November, a statutory instrument was introduced that backdated provisions to the beginning of October.

The Government decision to address these particular anomalies within the fair deal scheme was taken three years ago.  Only a handful of people would now be impacted by this particular provision but in those instances, some of them have substantial bills accruing against their family home and estate for someone who went into a nursing home more than three years ago.  This issue needs to be addressed for those families.  The issue will be addressed going forward.  In cases where costs have accrued prior to the Government decision three years ago, the people concerned do not have a legitimate claim.  However, the Government took a decision three years ago next month to exempt the family farm or business after three years.  It has been a tortuous process to bring forward this legislation.  It has taken three years.  I accept that.  However, should individuals be penalised and forced to sell the family farm or business because of the delay in implementing the Government decision by drafting this legislation?

I thank the Minister of State for her engagement this morning.  This is positive legislation.  I have been following the discussion here in Leinster House and also remotely.  The Minister of State is hearing from members about the need to shape this legislation in the right way.  Overall, it is an excellent Bill.<\/p> <p>  On leasing and the point made by Deputy Healy-Rae, for many people leasing out is a transitional arrangement where a farm is handed over to somebody but the person may not be in a position to take it on immediately.  This could be owing to a person's work, family circumstances, etc.  There needs to be a degree of cognisance of that.<\/p> <p>  I have also seen an anomaly occur on a few occasions in County Clare.  Land valuations have typically remained static over the past ten years or so.  Agricultural land, by and large, is of a similar value to what it has been a decade ago.  In the previous two Clare county development plans, the forward planning unit of the council has zoned large tracts of land without first getting the consent of the landowner.  It is all done on the basis of town and village shaping.  Normally, one would expect a person to be quite happy to see his or her land zoned and its value increase.  However, I know of scenarios where people were not happy.  They have seen the value of landholdings they had planned to farm or perhaps pass on to a younger generation of the family increase exponentially without their knowledge.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if the legislation can cater for all these scenarios but it is arising more and more often.  Prior to 2009, county development plans were only based on the submissions received from individuals but I am now increasingly seeing planners make decisions in unison with councillors that may not always have the consent of the landowner.  That is fine and dandy until people start looking at the fair deal scheme or something like that and suddenly find that the land they are sitting on has a very different value from what they or the people around them believed it to be.<\/p> <p>  In the vast majority of cases that I can recall, land is passed on to the next generation and the value it generates year on year in a beef scenario in County Clare would be from cattle sales and whatever comes in by way of EU grants and payments.  Beyond that, there are outlays and the people hold on to the land for 40 years or so in the hope that a son or daughter, niece or nephew, as the case may be, will take it on.  The land also needs to be gauged on that basis and for anything punitive to be factored in decimates the value and benefit of the farm for the generation coming afterwards.  <\/p> <p>  Members should plough on with the legislation and I will tune in and make further contributions later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#E01400","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I will put a scenario to the Minister of State.

John went into long-term nursing home care in January 2015 because he got pneumonia in Christmas 2014.  Because the farm had not been signed over for the full five years in advance of John going into long-term nursing home care, Michael has had to pay the 7.5% per annum top-up that is required between that date and now.  The Minister of State is now saying that John, in order to ensure that Michael gets the relief set out in this legislation, must declare Michael as the successor.  However, Michael has been the successor and has been farming the land for the past 11 years.  If this is enshrined in law, I think it will be open to legal challenge.  This legislation could be struck down because it is unconstitutional that John is not in a position to declare anyone a legal successor because Michael has already been the legal successor of that holding for the past 11 years.

She transferred the farm to another son, who did not get the benefit of agricultural relief because he did not have the certificates.  He had to pay a full round of tax on the farm.  The mother ended up in a nursing home within 12 months of transferring the farm to the second son, and they have now been caught by the 7.5% per annum.  She has been in a nursing home for some time now.  The question arises, from when do the three years start running?  I still do not have clarification on that question.

The first response I will give is to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.  He raised his concerns on Second Stage and I have spoken to him in person.  The Deputy's concern is that by including a farm or business asset in the financial assessment at all, it could challenge the future viability of the farm or business as a productive asset that could provide an income for future generations.  The proposed amendment would fundamentally diverge from the fundamental principles of the legislation that has been in place since 2009.  This change proposes that the family home should be included in the financial assessment of the scheme but that the farm and the business assets would not be assessed at all.  It would introduce a clear unfairness that would make the scheme less equitable and more open to legal challenge.  It is not accepted that the productive assets are a class of assets that should receive unique treatment under the Act and that they should not be subject to any financial assessment for any period of time.  If that were the case, we could have somebody who just lives in a principal private residence, who might have a pension, for example, and who might want that to be excluded.  The whole premise of the fair deal scheme is to make access to nursing home as fair as possible.  To put it simply: the more you have, the more you pay; the less you have, the less you pay.  In this Bill, we are correcting the anomaly, in place since 2009, that anybody who has a small farm or a small business will be treated the same as somebody who just owns their own home, for example, or who has a private pension.  This is to respond to that anomaly.<\/p> <p>  There is no prohibition on leasing arrangements in the Bill.  However, assets that are leased will not be covered by the Bill, and both the value of these assets and the income derived from the leasing arrangements will be assessed as part of the financial assessment for the scheme on an ongoing basis.  The whole premise of what we are trying to do is to protect farm families, keep them intact and make sure that farms stay within those families.  What we have been told over many years - and what my officials were told - is that because the cap was not there, many farmers were afraid to enter nursing homes and were being treated differently from the people who avail of the scheme.  Let us call it the original scheme.  That is what we are trying to rectify.  The policy intent of this amendment is to protect farm families and businesses that will remain within the family as a source of employment and income into the future.  The policy would not be advanced if income from leasing arrangements were included in the cap.  That is where we are in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Some Deputies raised the issue of the cost if the assets are there for three, four or five years.  When a person's assets include land or property, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred.  This is an optional benefit of the scheme.  It is effectively a loan advance by the State which can be repaid at any time but which will ultimately fall due for repayment on the person's death.  It is called the nursing home loan scheme.  That is available to people as well.<\/p> <p>  As for the specifics raised by Deputies Naughten and Colm Burke, we will have to come back to them because there will always be individual cases that are not as straightforward.  The case Deputy Colm Burke raised is the third one I have heard of today, and I am aware of some as well.  If it is okay with the Deputies, we will refer back to them later.  I know Deputy Colm Burke is unsure about one issue and I probably have not given him a very clear answer.  If he leaves it with us, though, we will definitely come back to him on it if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#F00400","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

This section has not caused any problems for the HSE when operating the scheme and the time span of ten days is consistently used throughout the Act, at the period in which notifications are made to the executive of changes in circumstances of an individual in care or a care representative.<\/p> <p>  I used the same example as Deputy Naughten, in that if some tragic accident were to happen to the successor, this applies in the circumstances of the third party who is the successor and, as such, there may be additional delays in providing information to the executive.<\/p> <p>  I accept the principle and I will bring an amendment on Report Stage which lengthens this notification period to 20 working days, which is one month.  If Deputy Naughten is happy to accept that, we will bring an amendment on Report Stage.  I see exactly where Deputy Naughten is coming from and I had the exact same worries myself, with regard to a tragic accident.  Trying to inform the executive and put your ducks in a row within two working weeks is too short.  It is still one month but it is four working weeks, so if Deputy Naughten is happy for us to bring the amendment on Report Stage, that would state 20 working days.  Can Deputy Naughten accept that?  I fully accept the principle of what he seeks to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#G00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I am quite happy to accept the Minister of State's suggestion and will withdraw the amendment on that basis.

I wish to speak to the principle of the three amendments in the context of section 21 because I do not want to come back in later and delay proceedings.<\/p> <p>  This is an issue about which I am very passionate.  There are a substantial number of vacant properties around the country in circumstances where older people have gone into long-term nursing home case.  I estimate that approximately 4,500 homes are left empty every year because people go into long-term nursing home care.  In the region of 400 of those are rented out.  This means that more than 4,000 homes are being left vacant each year.  Once a home is vacant, by the time it has gone through the whole process, namely, probate and being sold and refurbished, there is, on average, a six-year timeline.  As a result, up to 25,000 homes could potentially be locked out of the system at any one time.  These are homes in established communities where broadband is available, they are close to schools and the necessary infrastructure is already in place.  At the height of a housing crisis, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever not to treat the rental income from a family home in these circumstances in the same way as it is treated by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p> <p>  There is a perverse system laid out in the existing legislation whereby if such a home is rented out, a person will pay for it three times.  The capital value of that asset is paid for at 7.5% for the first three years.  On top of that, the rental income is considered a source of income and 80% of that is calculated as means.  If that rental income is lodged into the older person's bank account, that is considered capital on deposit and charged at 7.5% as well.  People are paying three times for a single asset when that kind of property is rented out.  The Department of Social Protection has a system for dealing with capital assets.  It either takes the capital value of the asset or the income that is generated from that asset into account, but not both.  In the situation to which I refer, both are taken into account.  This acts as an artificial barrier to the renting out of the homes in question.<\/p> <p>  I listened intently to some of the comments made by the Minister of State.  I have spoken to her privately on this matter and explained that I am not looking for special treatment.  All I am seeking is equity in the context of the system.  I know the argument has been made by some people in the Department of Health that an older person may be forced into a nursing home in the circumstances we are discussing because the family may want to rent out the property.  There is no significant financial incentive for a family to do that.  The incentive is that it ensures that the house will not require the substantial maintenance that would be required in the case of a vacant property.  There are many families who would love to see their former family homes providing accommodation for, perhaps, some of their relatives or neighbours.<\/p> <p>  It is disingenuous to say that an older person could be forced into long-term nursing home care.  As the Minister knows, under the fair deal scheme, a person can only be deemed eligible to require long-term nursing home care on the basis of an independent medical assessment.  Unless the Minister is suggesting that an independent medical assessment is flawed, then that safety net is already there.  This is a safety net which, believe it or not, is not present in the social welfare system and this has not caused a problem up to now.<\/p> <p>  I am looking for equitable treatment in the context of the renting out of these properties.  I am not seeking preferential treatment.  I want the properties in questions to be treated in the same way as they would be by the Department of Social Protection.  If the latter happens, there would no longer be a barrier to the renting out of these 25,000 or so family homes in established communities throughout the country at a time when we are in the midst of a housing crisis.<\/p> <p>  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il on 5 May.  He informed me that the Departments of Health and Housing, Local Government and Heritage are working together on developing the policy on the treatment of rental income and have agreed a process that is in train.  It seems that, in principle, the Government has accepted the argument I have been putting forward and that this committee put forward in the previous D&aacute;il at pre-legislative scrutiny stage, when it clearly stated that this anomaly needed to be addressed.  It seems, however, that we are not going to do it now and that we will do it at some point down the road.  It took approximately three years to get the Government to decide to bring forward the Bill.  It has taken a further three years for it to be published.  If it takes six years for this anomaly to be addressed, there will be more than 150,000 homes locked out of the housing market while we consider a solution to this problem.<\/p><p>That is not good enough.  It is abhorrent when we are in the middle of a housing crisis.  If the Minister of State cannot accept my amendments, I plead with and urge her to come back on Report Stage with a constructive amendment to deal equitably with this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#H01000","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Before I let the Minister of State respond, other members wish to contribute.

My amendment proposes that a report be produced on this issue and that it would come back to this committee at an early stage for a decision.  Deputy Denis Naughten has made many of the points in this regard already.  Some of us have been talking about this issue for years.  Its impact is really brought home to us at election time when we are going door to door.  We see many vacant houses where nobody is listed on the electoral register.  It is possible to see all the signs, such as an access ramp or a handrail outside a house, and know that the person who did live there has gone into a nursing home.  The result is a perfectly good house lying idle.  It makes no sense whatsoever from anybody&rsquo;s perspective.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the housing crisis it is madness for us to leave thousands of good-quality houses vacant simply because the Department has not been able to find a way of dealing with this situation equitably and fairly.  There are many ways this issue could be addressed and some suggestions have been made in this regard.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dea introduced a Private Members' Bill in the previous D&aacute;il.  It referred to the possibility of approved housing bodies, AHBs, taking over the management of houses in these circumstances.  The hard line taken by the Department on rental income being assessed against a person in the context of the fair deal scheme, resulting in a euro-for-euro loss, is crazy.  It is in nobody&rsquo;s interest to take that hard-line view of this situation.<\/p> <p>  We need some creative thinking in this regard.  We cannot defend houses lying idle.  They do not add anything to an area, because vacant houses can be broken into and there are also other issues regarding their management.  The main aspect, though, is the length of the housing lists and the great demand from local authorities and the public to find accommodation while thousands of houses are lying idle.  It is not possible to defend such a situation on any level.  My proposal, therefore, is that a report be produced and quickly brought back to this committee to enable us to examine how we will address this situation and what is the most effective way of doing it.  There is something to be said for the proposal made by Deputy O'Dea in respect of having an agency involved that could take over the responsibility for the management and letting of properties in these circumstances.<\/p> <p>  There are different ways of looking at this issue, but it makes no sense to do what we are doing now.  Strict rules across Europe apply to houses being left vacant.  We should be doing that here as well in respect of all vacant houses.  It should not be possible to leave houses lying vacant for any reason beyond six months.  There are many houses in circumstances like that now.  This is something the Minister of State can have direct control over.  Taking such an approach makes absolute sense.  In that context, I urge her as strongly as I possibly can to accede to this request from all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#J00300","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I re-emphasise the double whammy that exists in this regard.  This issue can be addressed when the financial assessment is being done under the auspices of the fair deal scheme.  It is simple enough to do.  We must find a way of doing it rather than stating we cannot do it.  I put it as bluntly as that.  In the cases of at least four vacant houses in rural areas of my parish, the families involved are paying the associated insurance costs, the standing charges for electricity supply and for oil to heat the houses.  Family members go into those houses to light fires over the winter to keep them habitable.  The houses in question are not being utilised, however.  That is wrong.  To describe what we are doing as an anomaly is being kind.  These situations should not be treated in this way.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Denis Naughten stated, when a property is being evaluated, it should be the case that a capped value is taken and a notional income devised in that regard or the rental income should be taken, but not both.  In these cases, we are taking money from the most vulnerable.  Returning to what Deputy Shortall said, this situation is resulting in many houses in towns and villages around the country being left empty.  It is costing people money to keep them repaired and inhabitable, while at the same time we are foostering around trying to find a solution.  The solution is very simple.  When a financial assessment is made, the fair deal scheme criteria should accept either the capital or rental value, but not both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#J00400","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Following on from what the three previous speakers said, I have advised people in recent years in situations where a family wanted to sell a house and the person in the nursing home agreed that it should be sold.  The 7.5% had already been deducted, however.  If the house was sold in those circumstances and the money lodged into a bank account, there would then be a further reassessment.  This means that there is a disincentive to sell houses and this must be examined.  I ask that this aspect be considered in the context of the legislation.  This situation is preventing families from selling houses in situations where they know that one member of the family will never use a house again.  They do not want to sell the house until the person concerned has passed away because a further penalty will be applied if they do.  This situation must be addressed to encourage people to sell off houses and ensure that people who do so are not penalised a second time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#J00500","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I speak in support of the general thrust of what has been said by previous speakers, including Deputy Colm Burke.

No impediments should be placed in the way of families wishing to rent out a house for a good purpose.  It would meet somebody else's housing requirements.  I refer to a situation where there is agreement among the members of a family, including the person in the nursing home.  Circumstances may arise where the person in a nursing home may not agree to sell a house but might agree to lease it or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  I strongly support addressing whatever issues may arise in this regard, insofar as we can, to allow the greatest possible utilisation of vacant houses, whether that concerns a house on a farm, one associated with a business or whatever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#J00600","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Deputy Denis Naughten&rsquo;s amendment was ruled out of order by the Bills Office.  I did not have any part in that.  I will address some of the Deputy's points and then will speak in general regarding Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s amendment, which will allow me to address almost all of the points that have been made.  When an asset includes an inherent and-or sale value and generates an income, it would be inequitable not to include both the value and the income in the assessment.  It is important to note that nursing homes support scheme contributions are not a tax.  They are a payment toward the cost of care for the person paying.  No one in the scheme will pay more than the cost of their own care and that situation must be recognised.<\/p> <p>  Turning to amendment No. 7 in the names of Deputies Shortall and Cian O'Callaghan, regarding an annual report concerning relief in respect of a farm or relevant business, I accept Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s contention that we need creative thinking in this regard.  She is dead right.  We have been doing much work in the Department on this aspect.  I will be introducing an urgent amendment regarding this matter on Report Stage to remove the present disincentive in the scheme regarding the sale of a home in respect of the three-year cap.  This amendment is being introduced in large part to address concerns about homes temporarily left vacant when their owners enter residential care.<\/p><p>There are two issues here.  They concern the sale of the home and the fact that if the home was sold while the person was in the nursing home, there was no cap and the 7.5% charge still applied.  Regarding the cap at three years, that amendment is ready and is with the Attorney General.  My team has been doing a significant amount of work on that.<\/p><p> As Deputy Naughten noted, this has been going on for three years.  I was anxious to get this Bill through.  We are working very closely on a second amendment, which will not be ready in time, regarding renting out homes.  The Department is continuing to engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on an agreed plan to develop a definitive policy position relating to the treatment of rental income.  It is a complex and intricate matter that requires considered analysis and research to avoid unintended consequences for residents.  The two Departments have been working on this for many years and have not managed to crack the nut.  I attended a meeting of a Cabinet sub-committee relating to this and how we can bring it forward.  I have genuine concerns, which must be dealt with before we can move it forward.  However, we are working really hard on it.<\/p><p> I have concerns relating to safeguarding, capacity issues and premature entry into nursing homes.  Approximately 70% of people in nursing homes have dementia.  The income of the average person in a nursing home is his or her State pension, which is &euro;248.30 per week.  We could say it is &euro;1,000 per month but if the house is rented out, the rental income could be between &euro;2,000 and &euro;2,500 per month with current prices.  Notwithstanding the safeguards that are in place, I am concerned that we could see people enter nursing homes prematurely.  However, I recognise the urgent issues around housing supply.  We all want to see people moving into empty houses.  <\/p><p> As I said, 37% of people who enter nursing homes stay for only six weeks.  The average length of stay in a nursing home is two and a half years.  We also have a lot of houses that are caught up in probate and wills relating to a person who might have died in a nursing home.  The Minister and I and as the Secretary General will have a high-level meeting next week.  We really want to move this matter along but that particular aspect will not be ready.  Otherwise this Bill, which we have been dealing with for three years, would be delayed for another six months.  <\/p><p> In respect of the Deputy's amendment, he is asking for a report after 12 months.  A report will be ready much sooner than that.  I can give assurances that the work involving recommendations relating to rental income will be done.  I expect it will be done well in advance of the timeline set out in the Deputy's amendment so I hope he will withdraw it.  We have already given a commitment to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and to the Taoiseach that this will be done within a six-month timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#J00700","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":442,"content":"<p>We have lost sound.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#K00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Can the Chairman hear me?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#K00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#K00400","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":445,"content":"<p>We are giving every consideration to Deputy O'Dea's Bill and have been interacting with him regarding approved housing bodies and rental.

There are 21,000 people in the scheme.  When someone ticks the box indicating whether he or she is single or married, those are the only two boxes that available.  If someone was widowed and had an adult dependant living at home, this is not taken into account.  From the data we have, my understanding is that we could be talking about 4,000 houses.  Not everybody will want to rent out his or her home but there could still be a significant number of houses that could be used to accommodate people.

The figure is not 150,000 houses.  That was a slip of the tongue.  It is 50,000 houses.  That is based on the figures provided to me by the HSE.  There are approximately 14,000 people in long-term nursing home care at any time who have an asset, of whom 4,000 have a spouse who would normally be resident in the home.  Some of those spouses may in long-term nursing home care and there may be other people residing in those homes.  The HSE conducted a survey of these properties in 2016.  I know getting the figures arising out of that survey is like finding out the third secret of Fatima.  The Minister of State has them and might publish and furnish them to the committee, which would be helpful.  Based on the figures available to me, up to 9,000 homes at any one time fall into this category.  This is 4,500 homes per year based on average nursing home stay of two years.  We are arguing about whether it is 50,000 or 25,000 homes.  The reality is that we are still talking about a large number of homes, particularly if it will take another six years to address this anomaly in the same way as it has taken a long time to deal with the current capital issue.<\/p> <p>  These homes are in established communities.  They are family homes in the main that are beside schools.  Infrastructure is already in place.  There is a clear commitment in the programme for Government to address the issue of vacant properties.  Here is the first litmus test for the Government with regard to this.  What we are talking about here is a treble tax.  I accept that this is a complex area.  I do not dispute that and I know the Minister of State may need time to bring forward a detailed amendment regarding how to deal with it.  All I am asking is that she does not discriminate against people.  She is saying it would be inequitable not to take the value of the home and income into account.  The Department of Social Protection makes payments to people based on a means assessment and what they need to meet their day-to-day income needs.  The Department is a social income support body and it is saying that it is wrong to take the capital and income into account and that only one should be taken into account.  Not only is the Minister of State taking both into account here, she is also charging for the money being lodged into the bank account.  A treble tax is being charged on people if they rent out.  I accept that this is a complex area and there is a need to bring forward detailed amendments but what I am asking for that the Minister of State clearly reflect in this legislation what is the law in the Department of Social Protection regarding means assessment, apply equity across the board and not raise a false and unjust barrier to people renting out their homes.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is bringing forward an amendment relating to selling the family home but she is undermining her own argument about people being forced into nursing home care.  In respect of an option for older people in long-term nursing home care who will not return home to either sell or rent out their home, I know it is a psychological issue but they do not want to give up their home.  What the Minister of State is doing is providing an incentive to sell the family home and a disincentive to rent it out.  This in itself will cause duress for older people and is an inequitable approach in terms of the forced sale versus the renting out of the family home.  I urge the Minister of State to reconsider the means assessment before Report Stage and come back with a further amendment.  She should at least ensure she does not put in place a barrier to the renting out of these properties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#K00600","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Deputy on a number of points.

If I could say with tongue in cheek, the Deputy told me that the litmus test will be what I can do regarding housing.

We all want to get people into empty houses.  That is the most important thing.  When we were working with the Department, it had two asks of us.  One was that the cap would be included at three years on the sale of a house.  That is done.<\/p> <p>  The second part is much more complex.  I take on board that Deputy Shortall asked that we come forward within 12 months.  We will do it in a much shorter timeframe.  I am happy to meet the committee again to discuss this but it will not be in this particular legislation because we just do not have the time.  This is going to Report Stage on either 13 or 14 July and I will be bringing it to the Seanad after the D&aacute;il goes into recess.  It is important that this Bill goes through now and that amendment regarding the sale of the houses and the cap at three years will be included.<\/p> <p>  I will make one final point on the social protection means test and assessment under the fair deal scheme.  They have some similarities but they serve different purposes.  It is not desirable for the system to work in the exact same way.  I am just pointing out the specifics here.  Some 37% of people who enter nursing homes are only in a nursing home for six months.  The problem is that we do not have the data regarding how many houses are empty for six months or 12 months.  We just do not have it.  That is part of the problem and why it is so difficult to bring this forward.<\/p> <p>  As I said already, 70% of people already have capacity issues.  They have dementia in nursing homes.  We want to give them a voice and a choice.  Some people will never rent out their home.  Deputy O'Dea brought forward a proposal with regard to including approved housing bodies, AHB, and having a system in place where a person only rents out the house and can have access to it if he or she leaves the nursing home, which I know is unusual.  We are trying to work through every single aspect we can, however.<\/p> <p>  I would like to hear from Deputy Shortall, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#L00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State very much for that response.  I agree with the points made by Deputy Naughten about using similar rules to the Department of Social Protection.  It also crossed my mind that there is an incredible contrast in the approach to rental income for people in nursing homes and the treatment of rental income for investment funds.  We need to get our priorities right in that regard.  There is, therefore, an element of small-mindedness about this and about going after every euro that a person earns.  That needs to be removed because we need to consider the bigger picture.<\/p> <p>  I welcome what the Minister of State said about the sale of houses.  It is disappointing, though, that she will not have anything ready with regard to rental income.  That is actually an easier issue to address.  I am not sure that the Minister of State's concerns about people coming under pressure to go into nursing homes are well founded given the fact there are tests in that regard as it is.  I do not believe there is any issue about those; they work fairly well.  If people are in nursing homes who should not be there, it is much more likely to be down to the fact that funding was not provided for home care.  Anyway, there are tests and they stand up reasonably well.<\/p> <p>  In light of what the Minister of State said, I am happy to withdraw the amendment now on the basis of expecting an update from her when we come back to deal with Report Stage of this Bill.  I will consider whether I will retable that amendment with a shorter timescale in terms of getting a report, at a very minimum.  This issue has gone on for years on end and we need to see action very soon.

This proposed amendment provides that the Bill is brought into operation no more than 30 days after it is enacted.  My firm intention is that this legislation amendment is enacted and commenced as quickly as possible.  A number of matters need to be considered carefully before this can happen, however.  The changes to the scheme are complex and significant work needs to happen at operational level to ensure that the system works smoothly from day one of these changes coming into effect.<\/p> <p>  The recent cyberattack has had a significant effect on the HSE's capacity.  The attack impacted both the national nursing home support scheme office and the 15 national nursing home support offices.  I commend the excellent work of the nursing home support scheme's team and staff.  The HSE managed to put a manual processing system in place, ensuring that the attack did not affect funding releases to clients and patients and payments to private nursing homes.<\/p> <p>  A significant body of work is currently required to bring all systems up to date, however, while continuing to ensure there is no delay to dealing with the new applications or their processing.  The nursing home support scheme IT system is currently being rebuilt on new servers.  Once this is completed, significant testing will be required before the system is transferred to a live environment.  The testing is crucial when considering that the nursing home support scheme controls and processes &euro;1 billion in public money annually.<\/p> <p>  We are not, therefore, in a position to fully commence the provision within the 30 days proposed.

While I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment as drafted, which proposes a period of 30 days, I will bring an additional amendment to the Bill on Report Stage committing to commencement of the Bill within 90 days.<\/p><p>That would make the date of commencement the start of October.

These revised standards contain some further, notable changes towards strengthening the standards in Irish in ITE programmes.  Having relatively high minimum entry requirements in the core subject areas of Irish, English and Mathematics is one of the key policy levers that help ensure quality teaching and learning in primary schools.  Following recommendations in the literacy and numeracy strategy and having considered advice provided by the Teaching Council, the Department of Education has in recent years raised the minimum entry requirements in Irish for the Bachelor of Education and the professional Master of Education ITE programmes.<\/p> <p>  There are now new revised subject criteria for post-primary, published by the Teaching Council in late 2020.<\/p><p>A common set of criteria now applies in the revised subject criteria for all languages, which includes a revised, strengthened, residency requirement set for persons seeking to register to teach languages, including Irish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021063000002#A00500","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al, a Chathaoirligh, de bheith ag cur isteach ar an Aire-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021063000002#B00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Ceart go leor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021063000002#B00300","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":496,"content":"<p>-----ach n&iacute; thuigim an f&aacute;th go bhfuilimid athraithe go B&eacute;arla.

Following on from the publication of the teacher supply action plan, since 2019 higher education institutions, HEIs, have put in place a number of new four-year undergraduate initial teacher education, ITE, programmes, which aim to increase the supply of post-primary teachers of targeted subjects, including Irish.  These programmes provide 120 new places for students annually who on graduation will be qualified to teach Irish in post-primary schools with the first graduates expected in 2023.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the new four-year programmes, the Department of Education is currently planning for the introduction during 2021-22 of a new flexible programme to upskill post-primary teachers to teach Irish.  I am also pleased that a new level 9 part-time certificate course for post-primary subject teachers in Irish-medium schools, aonaid l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge or Gaeltacht schools, has recently commenced in Mary Immaculate College.<\/p> <p>  We must also provide flexible shorter-term supports to allow our teachers maintain and improve their standard of Irish on an ongoing basis.  I am pleased to say that these supports are available through our national teacher education support services, courses in local education centres and through the provision of summer courses for primary teachers.<\/p> <p>  Baineann an dara m&iacute;r ar chl&aacute;r oibre an lae inniu leis na deontais do mh&uacute;inteoir&iacute; faoi oili&uacute;int chun tabhairt faoi na socr&uacute;ch&aacute;in foghlama sa Ghaeltacht at&aacute; mar chuid d&aacute; dturas foghlama.  Mar Aire, bh&iacute; an-&aacute;thas orm go raibh ar mo chumas i mbuis&eacute;ad na bliana seo sol&aacute;thar a dh&eacute;anamh chun an deontas Gaeltachta a thabhairt ar ais chun tac&uacute; le mic l&eacute;inn agus iad ag &iacute;oc as costais an tsocr&uacute;ch&aacute;in Gaeltachta.  This provision also included an additional &euro;2 million in Gaeltacht grant funding in 2021 towards the cost of placements postponed from 2020 as a result of Covid-19 restrictions.  The rate of the grant for 2021 was set at an average of &euro;650 which covered the cost of undertaking a two-week online programme.  Due to the prevailing public health guidelines which made it impossible to have the normal Gaeltacht placement experience it was clear that an alternative had to be found for those students affected to enable them complete their teacher education programme and graduate as planned.  This alternative, which was developed in collaboration with all of the relevant stakeholders, was an adaptation of the existing Gaeltacht course and delivered online by Gaeltacht Colleges.  C&eacute; gurbh &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad rogha do gach duine a raibh baint acu leis seo n&aacute; freastal ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht mar a bh&iacute;odh i gceist go traidisi&uacute;nta, is mian liom tr&eacute;asl&uacute; leis na p&aacute;irtithe go l&eacute;ir, go h&aacute;irithe na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeltachta agus na hinstiti&uacute;id&iacute; ardoideachais, as teacht le ch&eacute;ile ar r&eacute;iteach chomh tapa sin ionas go bhf&eacute;adfadh mic l&eacute;inn riachtanais an chl&aacute;ir oideachais m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; a chomhl&iacute;onadh agus a mbliain acad&uacute;il a chr&iacute;ochn&uacute;.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has opened the consultation process on the new L1 and L2 leaving certificate curriculum draft subject specifications for Irish.  Mindful of the challenging circumstances the education sector is facing due to Covid-19, the NCCA council has recently decided to extend the period for consultation on draft subject specifications and it will now run until the end of November 2021.<\/p> <p>  Mar fhocal scoir, n&iacute; mian liom athr&aacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an bhfaisn&eacute;is at&aacute; leagtha amach sa n&oacute;ta faisn&eacute;ise a cuireadh ar f&aacute;il.

It was an extraordinary achievement le linn na paind&eacute;ime, to be able to provide oideachas ar l&iacute;ne for students.

That is where the greatest emphasis needs to be placed now.  We need to have teachers who have confidence in the teaching of Irish and we are making particular provision for that.

What is the position?<\/p> <p>  The second question is connected to the standard, an caighde&aacute;n agus leis an gc&eacute;ad chuid eile den chruinni&uacute;, a Chathaoirligh.  A very significant amount of work is underway, and clearly the Department is working hard, but it is all happening in bits.  The Minister mentioned putting down seeds.  The seeds need to go into a garden and I bring the Minister back to the recommendation of the committee that was communicated to her which is that we need a full strategy on education from preschool to third and even fourth level and all of the work that is underway should be within that strategy.  In the Minister&rsquo;s opening remarks she mentioned that was part of the Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge, the Irish language 20-year strategy.  T&aacute; fuinneamh iontach ann i l&aacute;thair na huaire faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  There is tremendous energy there now and much of this is coming from education, from that sector organically it has to be said, starting with the na&iacute;onra&iacute; ag dul go dt&iacute; na Gaelscoileanna agus na Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;.  That energy should be used to grow not only the Gaeltacht schools which were mentioned by the Minister but also the non-Gaeltacht schools where there is interest in speaking Irish.  Education is the foundation of reinvigorating our knowledge and that is the lived experience that we are seeing from so many communities around the country.<\/p> <p>  I put it to the Minister that what we need is an overall overarching strategy and a garden for all of those seeds from preschool to fourth level which seeks to address the challenges.  I see in the Minister&rsquo;s remarks that she mentions that the initial analysis shows that there has been a very significant increase in standards.  An overall strategy would also address the standards issue for teachers.  I therefore put it to the Minister that we need an overall education strategy, not as a sub-strategy of the 20-year strategy for Irish.  Things have changed enormously for the better in education sa Ghaeilge agus sa Ghaeltacht &oacute; 2010 go dt&iacute; anois.  There is a different and much more ambitious energy and we need to see a departmental strategy that reflects that on-the-ground energy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021063000002#C01000","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta.

These are private colleges which, as the name suggests, are just that.<\/p><p>Significant accommodation was made in that the colleges were given flexibility to create their own courses in respect of the tr&eacute;imhse sa Ghaeltacht.  At this point, the provision of the grant represents a significant cost.  I welcome the fact that I was able to restore the grant in the budget but there is a significant cost attached to that.  Aonta&iacute;m leis an Teachta &oacute; thaobh na b&eacute;ime at&aacute; curtha ar an nGaeilge sna scoileanna.  I agree with the Deputy with regard to the emphasis being put on Gaeilge in the schools and the progress we can see in that regard.  He is right; there has been significant progress in respect of cur chun cinn na Gaeilge leis na blianta beaga anuas.  I am very pleased to say that we now have a Gaeltacht education unit.  We also have a significant policy on Gaeltacht education and are working on a strategy for Irish-medium education.  The Deputy makes an excellent point with regard to the overarching strategy.  I hear what he is saying in that regard.  With regard to achievements in the area of Irish education, it is worth noting that we now have more than 250 Irish-medium schools in the country at primary level and 49 at second level.  When a new school is being built and there is no Gaelscoil within the area, that is provided for.  Where there is any indication of interest in the promotion of Gaeilge and the provision of education through Gaeilge, and where there would be sufficient uptake of such education, we will provide an aonad.  It is not an ideal circumstance, but it is acknowledgement of the importance of the issue and the b&eacute;im or emphasis being placed on it.  We have been very proactive in advancing Irish.

I understand the difficulties in respect of Hibernia College, which have already been articulated by others.  To be very clear, the tr&eacute;imhse sa Ghaeltacht is an integral part of the qualification.  I know the Deputy appreciates that.  It must be achieved.  Notwithstanding the difficulties for the individuals themselves, there is a difficulty in making provision in this regard.  It was a significant financial undertaking to reintroduce the grant of &euro;650 to students, which I was pleased to do in this year's budget.  There are enormous considerations involved.  As I said to previous speakers, I hear the point the Deputy is making.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the availability of teacher supply, to be fair, t&aacute; an-obair ar fud curtha chun cinn.  An awful lot of work is being advanced in the Department.  I referenced this earlier in my opening remarks.  I referred, for example, to the Irish-medium bachelor's degree in education, which more than 100 students are now undertaking in Marino Institute of Education.  That is a very generous scheme.  There is a bursary of &euro;1,000 available in the first year, on-site accommodation in the Irish block, placement in Irish-medium schools and so on.  That is a small number in the context of the greater picture the Deputy is talking about but it is a significant advancement.  We are also talking about the master's degree in education in Mary Immaculate College, which provides an additional qualification for teachers and principals.<\/p><p>We have a significant number of smaller courses for upskilling and continuing professional development.  I refer to courses on Gaeilge Bheo! and opportunities of that nature.  The Deputy made reference to subjects in which the supply of teachers is limited, such as physics.  There are now very innovative programmes involving such things as satellite connections and comhoibri&uacute; between schools.  It is not ideal but it is an interim measure until provision can be increased to the necessary level.  Significant steps are being taken and considerable resources are being put in place to attract native Irish speakers to consider teaching as an occupation.  Obviously, we encourage students to choose whatever option they wish but there are opportunities in this area as 10% of places in teacher training colleges are made available to Irish speakers.  It is a job of work.

Therefore, it is enormously beneficial we have been in a position to extend the consultation period further, until the end of November and out of that, put together the report that will emanate from it and make a considered judgment on where we go from here.<\/p> <p>  The bottom line is that the objective is to enhance, protect, grow and nurture the Irish language, but also to be mindful of the caighde&aacute;n sa Ghaeilge, which many of the members have referenced, and the importance of growing that.  Equally, it is important to acknowledge we want Irish to be accessible and there is a balance that needs to be done here.  For that reason, the process will continue until the end of November and we will, at that stage, at least have had the views of all those with vested interests and those with none, which is important as well - those who are outside and beyond the immediate area - because the wider consultation we have on this, the more beneficial it is for having a policy going forward that everyone feels part of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021063000002#J00200","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":565,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l mise ag iarraidh freagra ar na point&iacute; a rinne m&eacute; inniu mar go dtuigim nach f&eacute;idir leis an Aire freagra a thabhairt dom inniu ach ba mhaith liom mo dhearcadh ar an gceist seo a dh&eacute;anamh soil&eacute;ir.

It is important that I hear all the other points and opinions that will come my way through the consultation process.  I have a few points in relation to that.  The consultation process was extended largely because of the impact of Covid which did not allow engagement and discussion around this proposal.  Why this proposal is on the table is largely due to the fact that the differentiated Irish language curricula for Irish in Irish-medium and English-medium schools have been in place at primary level for a long time and at junior cycle since 2017.  It is, therefore, an addition which has progressed from that, and why we are referring T1 agus T2.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the review of the junior cycle, I acknowledge it was impacted by Covid.  It is intended that there will be a review of T1 agus T2 from the junior cycle point of view before the end of the year.  This will inform further considerations of the process as well.  I appreciate the points made by different speakers in terms of the impetus or encouragement for people and all of that, but that is part of a later discussion.  What is out for consultation here is the essence of T1 agus T2, which will conclude at the end of the year, notwithstanding the break caused by Covid.  It will be at that point an jab a beidh agam n&aacute; na tuairim&iacute; go l&eacute;ir a bhaili&uacute; le ch&eacute;ile, to gather them all and to consider what will have come through the process and all the other people with whom I will have engaged with.

I thank our guests.<\/p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that I will invite witnesses to make their opening statements, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  As the witnesses will be aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before I invite them to deliver their opening statements, which are limited to three minutes each, I wish to advise them about parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply.  As the witnesses are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, I ask them to note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present in the confines of Leinster House or the convention centre to participate in the public meeting.  I cannot permit a member to attend if he or she is not adhering to the constitutional requirements.  I also ask members to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the Debates Office staff who are preparing the Official Report.  Microphones must be muted when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.  I ask members and witnesses to use the raise-your-hand function on their screen if they want to contribute.  I remind those participating in the meeting to ensure their mobile telephones are on silent mode or, better still, switched off.<\/p> <p>  Without further ado, I will call on the witnesses in the following order: Ms Anna Walsh; the joint delegation; and the Arts Council.  I remind them that they have three minutes each for their opening statements.  I will again advise them about parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.

As we emerge from this crisis, which has affected everyone and every sector, there is an opportunity not just to reopen the arts and culture sector, but to build it better and more sustainably.  It is crucial to protect our arts sector and artists, and ensure that years of investment, experience and artist support infrastructure in arts venues are not lost.  This committee has an opportunity to influence the alignment of arts and culture policy with the national development plan, NDP, to draw together a capital and programme investment plan to evolve arts venues as a key arts channel to contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s societal recovery and enrich all our lives.<\/p> <p>  For the sector's survival, the commitment from the Government and the Revenue Commissioners that the employer wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, will remain in place until the year end, when, hopefully, audience capacities and box office income are restored, is very welcome.  For its future viability, longer-term funding models with key funders, particularly local authorities and the Arts Council, would enable arts venues to better plan projects and programmes, deepen engagement with artists, audiences and their communities and foster collaborations with more communities of interest that would continue beyond the limitations of sporadic projects in a 12-month funding cycle.  Arts venues could also take a lead in how climate and environmental issues can be addressed, through promoting sustainability by energy efficiency changes to their buildings, working more sustainably as well as being places and spaces from which artists and communities co-create their sustainable futures.  Venues are also ideally positioned to offer quality work opportunities and pay artists and arts workers in their own locality.  If arts venues move to longer-term financial planning cycles, this would enable them to make the working lives of artists and arts workers less precarious and more sustainable.<\/p> <p>  Arts venues work purposefully for, in and with their communities.<\/p><p>Arts venues work purposely for, in and with their communities.  They can improve access, be inclusive and celebrate diversity in their programmes, activities and events.  A systematic approach to support arts venues to broaden and deepen their remit as safe workplaces for artists to engage with audiences of all ages, abilities, orientation and ethnicity would create the much-needed energy and vibrancy to help rebuild our society.  We ask the committee to lend and garner support for arts venues in a number of key areas.  These are aligning policy, purpose and investment, securing support to ensure the survival and future financial viability of arts venues, and promoting sustainability through arts venues.

The absence of a platform for performers and the plethora of people involved in the creative element of theatre and musical theatre has created a huge void in towns and villages all over the country.<\/p> <p>  Putting on stage activities in the autumn and winter periods is to a community what sporting activities are in the summer period.  These activities galvanise a community and not just local communities.  Neighbouring communities support each other, creating a complex web of social and cultural interaction and networking that is unique to Irish society.  All this has been put on hold and the numbers affected are staggering.  The Drama League of Ireland estimates there are approximately 700 drama groups on the island of Ireland with approximately 25,000 people directly involved.  These groups attract an audience, whether local or participating in amateur drama festivals of up to 1 million people every year.  The Amateur Drama Council of Ireland is the governing body of affiliated drama festivals on this Island.  In total there are more than 40 affiliated members between full length and one-act festivals.  They offer the opportunity to more than 50 drama groups to perform all over the country with the added bonus of getting professional adjudication on their work.<\/p> <p>  There are approximately 120 musical societies on the island of Ireland, with 14,000 members.  They offer an outlet to people of all ages to express themselves and participate in this very popular activity as they put on performances for local communities and participate in the very popular Association of Irish Musical Societies competitions.  These shows attract an audience of 1.2 million annually and are a vital part of our communities.  The impact of the loss of these activities in this sector cannot be overestimated.  The impact on the mental health of those involved, and of those who look forward so much to attending these events, cannot be overestimated.<\/p> <p>  We need to look forward positively but we need some assistance to stimulate the amateur performance sector and to entice our practitioners back to doing these ever so important cultural activities.  We would like a clear roadmap from the Government outlining exactly when we can get back to rehearsing and whether our theatres and community venues are to open up again with full houses and full casts.  The huge number of people who attend amateur performances need to know when they can come back to our performance spaces again.  They are the lifeline of our activities and the lifeblood of community support and involvement.<\/p> <p>  Because all activity in live performance ceased over the past 18 months, the income streams of our affiliated members and representative bodies have been severely depleted.  We gratefully acknowledge the support of the Arts Council&rsquo;s recent grant allocations for a pilot scheme to enhance mentorship between amateur and professional drama and musical theatre.  We require financial support to be made available to our organisations on an annual basis once this pilot scheme is completed.  This would ensure the survival of a dynamic and thriving amateur performance sector, which is so important to people in every town and village throughout the island of Ireland.  I thank the Chair and committee members for allowing us to make this presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021063000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ollie Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021063000002#B00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":616,"content":"<p>This is my third appearance at the Oireachtas committee with responsibility for the arts in my two years as chair of the Arts Council.  These engagements have been very useful and I welcome the opportunity to keep members updated and hear their feedback.  Today, I am joined by Maureen Kennelly, the director of the Arts Council.<\/p> <p>  The arts sector was one of the first to be hit and will be one of the last to recover from the Covid-19 crisis.  There was a 54% reduction in GDP in the arts sector in Ireland last year.  New Arts Council research, which will be published shortly, shows four in ten artists saw their income decline by more than 50% last year, with the vast majority seeing no improvement in 2021.  This is a sector where job security was already precarious and jobs are low paid.  The huge negative impact, which first hit in March last year is continuing.  We now know the situation will remain in crisis into 2022 for artists and arts organisations.<\/p> <p>  This time two years ago, the Arts Council's annual budget was &euro;75 million.  Today it is &euro;130 million, which is an historic high.  A political commitment to increase arts funding was made prior to the pandemic and the impact of this funding will be truly felt when the crisis has passed.  For now, the money is the means by which the Arts Council is working to protect the jobs and livelihoods of artists and to assist arts organisations experiencing financial difficulties.  The Arts Council used increased public funding to help the sector survive and adapt in 2020 and again in 2021.  We will continue to do so in the months to come.<\/p> <p>  A more detailed report on how the Arts Council has spent its budget will be provided to members shortly.  I will now go through some headline statistics.  There was a 90% increase in funding applications in 2020 over 2019.  Of these, 54% applicants were new to the Arts Council.  Almost 3,100 funding applications were approved last year.  This is an increase of 129% on 2019.  We also provided emergency funding to 190 arts organisations, many of them facing imminent closure, in mid-2020.<\/p> <p>  Despite the crisis, the Arts Council remains committed to its current strategy and key policies.  We continue to be guided by the principles outlined in Making Great Art Work, which is our strategy until 2025.  This has a focus on the role of the artist and public engagement with the arts.  Our key policies include equality, human rights and diversity.  This policy has been incorporated into all of our programmes, schemes and awards.  With regard to our pay the artist policy, new research will be published shortly on the experiences of artists dealing with pay and contractual arrangements.  A new policy on people, places and spaces will also be published shortly.  This builds on initiatives such as creative places and will provide further assistance to the 50 regional arts centres.  It will also advance new proposals for flagship artist studio projects throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  Increased funding in 2022 will allow the Arts Council to assist the sector emerge from the Covid crisis and develop beyond the crisis.  I hope 2022 will be a year of recovery.  In the meantime, funding will continue to be targeted at jobs and livelihoods as well as at assisting arts organisations in trouble.  Funding will assist in implementing our equality, human rights and diversity, pay the artist and spatial policies.  Key priorities in 2022 will include expanding the creative places programme in new regions, further assistance to regional arts centres, developing new artists' workspaces throughout the country and promoting new initiatives including arts and well-being.<\/p> <p>  Many people have been helped through the lockdown by the work of artists.  The arts have been the glorious light in the darkness of the Covid crisis.  Our world is now slowly emerging from lockdown restrictions notwithstanding the ongoing uncertainties.  Even with the capacity limits we are able to embrace the arts again in person.  I encourage people to visit our galleries, arts centres, theatres and cinemas over the summer.  Ms Kennelly and I will be available to answer any questions and queries committee members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021063000002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Kevin Rafter"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Rafter for the comprehensive overview of where the Arts Council is at and, more important, where our artists are at.

This follows on from Mr. Kenny's point about drama groups, theatre festivals and musical societies in local communities that will be involved in the rebuilding of all our communities.  What supports can the Arts Council make available to those groups to rebuild our communities?<\/p><p> I will put my second question to Ms Walsh, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. McGowan and Mr. Kenny.  There have been many concerns whenever Government announcements have been made about reopening.  There has, at times, been a lack of clarity for regulations around the arts and venues.

Arts centres, as we know, are a fantastic cradle for activity on the ground.  Our support to arts centres totalled over &euro;8 million this year.  The committee will know that the complexion of activity in arts centres is a combination of local, regional, national and sometimes international activity.  The Senator has also referenced the new pilot scheme which we were delighted to introduce.  That scheme links the voluntary sector with professional artists.  The support we can give is through those art centres and festivals which inject vibrancy into local communities.  We also give support to individual artists through the many bursaries, the agility award and all the individual schemes we have and in which we have been able to multiply our investment.  The support we can give is through the core infrastructure of the built environment where, of course, we work very closely with our partners in local authorities.  Professor Kenny referenced the fact that more than 50 arts centres are supported by the Arts Council.  That is achieved working closely in partnership with the local authority and reaching out to the community.  I know that many committee members have been involved in the creation and establishment of those arts centres.  They are powerful channels to audiences.  Even with the restrictions during the pandemic, arts centres have managed to open and be truly civic community spaces for their population.  We want to fund them to an even greater degree.  Multi-annual funding has been referenced and that is very much on our radar because we need to strengthen the core infrastructure and make sure it is there and in rude health for future generations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021063000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maureen Kennelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":622,"content":"<p>The Association of Irish Musical Societies, AIMS, has lost all its productions and shows since March last year.  I am sure the same is true of the drama organisations.  We have lost approximately 170 shows in the past year.  We obviously want to get back on stage.  As Senator Malcolm Byrne said, there has been a lack of clarity from the Government regarding the roadmap to allow us back on stage.  As a musical society, we have approximately 40 members on stage and up to 100 people working on each production.  We obviously cannot get those numbers of people into theatres and venues around the country at the moment.  We need clarity and a roadmap to address that issue.<\/p> <p>  There are also limits on audience numbers.  To stage a musical production in this country costs, on average, between &euro;30,000 and &euro;50,000.  That means we would need up to 80% capacity in theatres and venues around the country to break even.  We need a roadmap, guidelines and help so that we know when our societies can go back to rehearsals.  It normally takes approximately 12 weeks or three months for us to put a show together.  Our year starts in August and all our shows between August and Christmas have been cancelled because we cannot fit them within that timeline.

I do not think it will be a particularly easy path back to 80% capacity and bigger audiences.  Guidelines have been developed with the support of the Arts Council.

What is the potential impact of that announcement on our guests' sectors in terms of what they had scheduled in the weeks ahead?

It is obviously hugely frustrating for artists, arts workers and arts organisations but everything we have done has been minded by the national public health guidelines.

I hope that as we move through the year, and notwithstanding the uncertainty of the past couple of days, we will see greater relaxation of restrictions and more audiences in auditoriums.

We have been doing reach-out programmes to our drama groups.  The Amateur Dramatic Council of Ireland, ADCI, has had lockdown conversations online.  We very much appreciate the funding and the pilot scheme that were announced last week.  However, to put it into perspective, that &euro;250,000 is approximately 0.25% or 0.3% of the total allocation the Arts Council might get.  This is not any fault of the Arts Council and funding comes to the council from central Government.  If that 0.25% or 0.3% became 5%, it would allow us ample scope to repair the damage that has been done by Covid-19.

That indicates the great thirst and hunger for events.<\/p> <p>  Next week we will be running an event with the Irish National Opera in Cork Opera House.  We want to go up to 50% there, with the usual precautions, and we are expecting a good result there.  The health and safety standards met by our venues, festivals and everyone who works in the arts is exceptionally high.  We are in good hands.  These people have been accustomed to high standards of safety throughout their careers.  It bodes well for an early and safe reopening.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the supports needed.  The Government supports have been critical.  As times edges on and as the uncertainty continues we believe the EWSS in particular should continue into the new year.  As everyone has acknowledged the preparation time for reopening is critical.  It cannot simply happen out of air overnight.

This is the ongoing issue we have been facing during the past 18 months or two years.  People have productions ready that they started rehearsing two years ago.  They were ready to put them on in the spring and they were scuppered with the pandemic.  People in the amateur sector in every town and village throughout the country still do not know.

Some are ahead of the posse.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about the theatre forum.  The opening statement referenced how arts venues are in a unique position to offer quality work opportunities for artists and art workers in the locality.  Is there an anomaly or disparity between rural areas and urban areas in this regard?<\/p> <p>  My next question is for all three groups.  We see there is great inequality in terms of bigger venues being able to host socially distant shows while smaller venues are being left out.

We also hold an annual week-long residential summer school in Thurles for those aged between 16 and 18 years old.  Those young people and our members have lost out on that opportunity as well.  However, we still issued some bursaries and many people are still very interested in pursuing this profession.  It is a good time to do so, because many Irish people are now performing on the world stage, on television, in the West End and on Broadway.  The profession will be revitalised and re-energised once people see performances returning to the West End, for example, and these stars back working in London.  The important thing is to get a roadmap to enable people to get back performing.  In addition, given our numbers, we normally have about 40 people on stage in our productions.  When those productions restart, though, at least initially, they will be smaller and fewer people will be on stage.  Unfortunately, that will reduce opportunities for many people.

It is important to do so, however, because 2019 was the last summer and year in which these great events took place.  I was lucky enough to attend many of the events which were part of the Fit-Up theatre festival in west Cork then.  We saw Mikel Murfi&rsquo;s one-man show, which was incredible and that blew me away.  It was mad because we were able to go to these little villages like Ballydehob and attend one of these incredible drama productions in the community hall.  The same goes for other groups.  I am thinking of the Kilmeen drama group, which is again based in a small village between Clonakilty and Dunmanway.  It regularly put on these unbelievably well-produced and fantastically acted and written shows.  For those of us without access to theatres in cities such as Dublin or Cork, these groups provide incredible outlets.  We can go ten minutes over the road and experience these incredible shows.  It is important that we protect these groups, therefore to ensure such productions can be experienced in the future.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure who may be best placed to answer these questions, but how have these events been impacted?  I refer to those shows produced and based in rural areas.  What is the best way for us to ensure these types of shows can happen in the summer of 2022 and that we will be able to attend these events again?  I ask this question because some people live for these productions.  In addition, and taking the Fit-Up theatre festival as an example, a major part of that festival's funding was provided by the local authority.  We are lucky that Cork County Council has a proactive arts department which funds, and in many instances part funds, these events.  Must local authorities be better resourced to enable them to co-fund or provide supports in situations where the Arts Council may not be able to do so?  I am not sure who may be best placed to address those questions, but all the witnesses should feel free to respond if they can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021063000002#E00800","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I call Mr. McGowan, as he had his hand up first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021063000002#E00900","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":651,"content":"<p>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan asked how we have been impacted.

The opportunity for our local communities and groups to show their wares and continue with the production circuit was lost.  Many of those festivals had massive funding and had already spent it.  It has not been recovered.  Support will be needed to get those groups and events back up and running.<\/p> <p>  Without doubt, outside the Gaelic Athletics Association, GAA, the amateur drama community is the largest amateur community on this island.  It reaches into every community, every parish, every town and every city.  The contribution which amateur drama makes to the well-being of not only those people involved in the groups and the festivals but to communities in general is immeasurable.

That has been the case.  However, we now have new measures of social impact which will show us the absolute value of the arts.  It has now been proven that the arts are second to none in helping to develop empathy and many other good qualities.  Research has shown that 61% of people said the arts were critical for their well-being, and that speaks to the point made by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan concerning these productions and activities making people feel good and explains why people need them.<\/p> <p>  We absolutely understand the priority of keeping those small rural organisations and events going.  We recently presented Brightening Air, which was a season of events throughout the country.  One of those events involved sending a boat with a light show down the Shannon and it was experienced by communities across nine counties.  Turning to Cork, not that everything is about Cork, obviously, a fantastic scheme that was part of Cork Midsummer Festival gave arts gifts to more than 300 people.  For example, the opera singer Majella Cullagh might have greeted people on their doorstep with a beautiful aria, or it could have been a performance from John Spillane or many other artists.  Therefore, this question of access and inclusion is evident in events which get into the heart of communities.  This aspect also speaks to the point made by Ms Walsh regarding one of the possible benefits of the last 16 months.  It has been possible for people in Waterford, for example, to access the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, on a Sunday morning.  This last year, therefore, has shown us how much wider our reach and inclusivity can be.

It could be argued that is a good thing in that it is a reflection of the arts centre's role and position in its community but it is not a good thing when it comes to long-term financial planning and planning for the programme, the work with artists and the work within that community.  What we would call for is not an amendment to the Arts Act of 2003 but an interpretation of it that makes local authority funding for arts centre mandatory rather than discretionary as it is currently, and to combine that with service level agreements that run for three to five years with longer term multi-annual funding agreements from their other main funder, the Arts Council.  That combination, we believe, would provide a much more long-term considered and strategic platform for all the work arts centres do both with the artists in their communities and with those communities that want to participate and engage in whatever art form or practice they want to do ranging from musical societies to amateur performances to professional productions that go on to be performed at the festivals and events that Mr. McGowan spoke about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021063000002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":668,"content":"<p>I have a brief follow-up question.

I have my own hobby horse, as does everybody involved in the Arts, which is arts in education and it could apply to both the amateur sector and the professionals.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, made a big announcement of 400 arts in education residencies for schools across the country at the beginning of June.  I am passionate about the arts in education charter; it is a significant avenue that has not been fully explored yet.  There is much work to do in providing artists with that opportunity and, more important, providing our young people with the opportunity to engage in the arts in a school setting where we are growing our audiences.  That is the direction in which we need to be thinking ahead.  I am digressing a little from the topic under discussion.  I will first bring in our guests from the Arts Council.  That was a second tranche of arts in education residencies for schools, following the first such scheme having been a success.  Has the Arts Council had any feedback on this in terms of providing a glimmer of hope for artists in the sense of schools engaging in this and hopefully the take-up of this from schools will be good?  It is one avenue artists can look forward to and hopefully it will provide them with an opportunity to go into our schools.  Have our guests from the Arts Council any thoughts on that and how we can progress it?  That feeds into what the future of the Creative Ireland programme will be after 2022.  I also want to get the views of our other guests on that.  <\/p> <p>  As a former staff member of the Garage Theatre in Monaghan I am mindful of all these beautiful arts buildings having been empty for almost the past two years.  The arts come alive with people.  I dread to think of those beautiful buildings across the country lying empty not having had performances or audiences.  The same applies to our community centres or halls in rural parts of the country, the first of which comes to mind is Mullagh in County Cavan.  It is a community centre that is used for myriad events.  The drama group that use it is one aspect of the life of that community centre.  It is not a state-of-the-art theatre but it has a specific purpose.  I have attended countless performances at that centre and it would have been packed to the rafters in a previous life.  It is a specific attribute to a community in terms of the arts and what that brings, which is in a different light from what the Garage Theatre would bring.  Those are my rambling thoughts.  Will Ms Kennelly and Professor Rafter give their reflections on that announcement for arts in education residencies for artists and then I will get a response from the amateur sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021063000002#G00800","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1625007600,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I will saw a few words before Ms Kennelly deals with the specifics.

We run that and we want it to continue to be funded beyond 2022.  We support The Ark and while it is based in Dublin it has a national reach.

The theatre is excellently run by Mona Considine.  I am a lover of musicals in particular and I am in St. Mel's Musical Society.  The standard of the shows that are put on by the Backstage Theatre, the musical society or the Evolution Stage School is top class.  It rivals or is even better than the West End or Broadway.

Our board comes up with ideas on how to disseminate the development programme.  Our mission is development and training of the sector but we need administrative support and a back-up facility in the form of a properly staffed office.  We have one administrator who works 22 hours a week and we need something a lot more sustainable in the future to look at the deployment and creation of professional workshops and getting professional practitioners to engage with them.

I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the impact of Covid-19 on the restaurant industry.  Obviously, yesterday&rsquo;s announcements were not what we were expecting.  I want to give the committee a brief background on what has been going on in our industry since March 2020.  We closed on 15 March 2020, like pretty much every other restaurant, before we were told to.  We have traded for three out of the last 16 months.  Since then, it has gone downhill.  We had maybe six busy weeks last summer.  There was no spike or surge in the numbers at that time.<\/p> <p>  We were locked down again 5 October 2020, and we pivoted back as a pop-up deli, like most businesses which have been doing a take-away or whatever they have had to do to survive.  We did not reopen for the two-week gap at Christmas, because we thought we knew what was coming.  Also, suppliers had told us no credit would be given for this time and it was up to us if we were to reopen.  Therefore, we could not take the risk.  Yet, we were still blamed for the surge in hospitalisation, intensive care unit, ICU, numbers, and the number of deaths.  This is not a nice thing to be told, now that the data clearly state that this was not the case and all of this started beforehand.<\/p> <p>  Since then, we have not earned a single cent.  We are sitting here waiting.  To this day, we still have no idea when we are getting back to work.  Our staff are still asking me when they will be able to earn their salaries.  To say that this is utter carnage is an understatement.<\/p> <p>  Since January, 97% of cases were the UK variant.  The Delta variant has been in the country for the best part of two or three months.  I just heard it said in the D&aacute;il that this is one of the few countries that has mandatory hotel quarantine.  This beggars the question as to who is not doing his or her job.  We have done everything we have been told to do and yet these variants are getting into the country.  As I said, we are quite creative in the kitchen, but none of us knows the formula of any of these variants.  It was not us who brought them in.<\/p><p>They are coming from somewhere.  <\/p><p> I love my profession way too much to let this be the scapegoat for any longer.  We have to stand up and fight.  We sat and waited patiently.  We did everything we were supposed to do and yet it is so hard to keep doing it when up the road for me a different premises is allowed do indoor dining and I am not.  I just do not understand it.  Nobody in my industry understands how it is safe in one premises but not in another.  None of us expected what came out yesterday.  It was a dagger through our heart which is probably the sixth or seventh one we have taken in the last 16 months.<\/p><p> The tourism and hospitality industry is probably the most important pillar of the economy.  If that crashes, everything will crash.  We are only seeing the tip of the iceberg of the carnage that is coming down the road.  The biggest let-down by our Government, as far as I am concerned, is to be told we are non-essential to the society over which it wishes to govern and that our livelihoods are non-essential.  That is not easy to take.  Everyone in this industry works extremely hard.  We work 14- or 16-hour days.  We ensure people enjoy themselves and that they have a great time in a bar or restaurant.  We do it safely, and we have done that since day one.  As I sit here today, I still have no idea how it can be done somewhere else, but not in my premises, or in any other restaurant or bar around the country.<\/p><p> On 12 May, I launched what was known as &ldquo;the plan&rdquo;.  We contacted every single politician and there are quite a few here today.  We got some incredible support from members of this committee.  &ldquo;The plan&rdquo; was the right course of action.  I said to open up all hospitality on 2 June at the exact same time, with the same guidelines and conditions, otherwise we would face catastrophic disaster going forward.  Everything I said that was going to happen has happened, with staff issues, with cancellations, with people moving up North and with people going abroad on holidays.  Just yesterday I took 500 cancellations throughout the month of July and the first two weeks of August.  I had 500 cancellations in a six-week period.  That was just in Treyvaud&rsquo;s restaurant.  I have spoken to people in many other places who have faced the exact same thing.<\/p><p> At this stage, I do not know how far beyond trouble we are.  It is a disaster.

It was greatly appreciated.  On the surge in winter, the data show that it started before any restaurants or bars reopened.  What is coming out is that it seems to be a seasonal virus.  The big difference was that there is no vaccine, but there is now.  That is clear as day.  I am not a medical professional, but many medical professionals are saying this.  I might not be smart enough to digest everything, but I can digest much of the data.<\/p> <p>  It is a different country and society now.  We have 4.1 million people vaccinated.  When we compare the death rate in 2020 with that in 2019, it was pretty much on a par with the last five years.  It was actually less than in 2018.  If we take out the mistake that was made by taking the elderly out of hospitals and putting them in care homes, it would have been significantly less.<\/p> <p>  I cannot run my business based on speculative figures which, as far as I am concerned, are what have been given.  We were told the worst-case scenario was 700,000 cases.  I cannot understand that.  I hope politicians have nailed down the people giving them this advice and that they ask them how they can say that in the next three months we will have almost three times the number of cases we have had since this pandemic started.  I hope they ask them also how they can say we will have almost half the number of deaths we have had since this pandemic started in a three-month period when we have had 4.1 million people vaccinated.  The question has to be asked: what is the point of the vaccine if it will not have any effect?<\/p> <p>  Data coming from Europe says the Delta variant is a lot more transmissible but it is not as lethal by any means.  Anybody will tell you the history of viruses.  They always become more transmissible, but it does not mean they will become more lethal.  In fact, they do not normally become more lethal.<\/p> <p>  It is not up to me.  I can only do what I can for my industry.  That is why I am here today.  It is up to the committee to turn around to the people giving them the information and ask them to answer these questions.  I cannot prepare for 100 people in my restaurant tomorrow if I have only four booked.  Although I might pick up another 96, I have to go with the figures that are the facts.  There are facts on the death rates, vaccination rates and the Delta variant, as opposed to previous variants.  I refer to what is happening throughout Europe.  If it is dangerous, and I do not know if NPHET has given the committee this advice, then why do we not shut everything down?  Why do we not shut everything that is indoors?  I do not want to see another business closed.  It is hard enough having my business closed as well as all the restaurants.  I do not want to see a hotel or a hairdressers close.<\/p><p>If logic dictates that it is more dangerous in a bar or restaurant, then that logic also dictates that it must be just as dangerous within any other four walls.<\/p><p> With regard to subsidies, we do not know the situation because it chops and changes every day.  We hear that they will be pulled on a certain date, but that date is then extended.  The single most important subsidy for restaurants and bars at the moment is the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  The day that stops is the day there will be absolute carnage.<\/p><p> We have to open.  It is still not too late for members of the committee to go back to their political parties and independent alliances and say that we got this wrong and we have to open up on 5 July.<\/p><p> I have had Treyvaud&rsquo;s restaurant for 20 years and I have been in hospitality for 35 years.  If you want medical advice, go to medical experts, but if you want hospitality advice, trust me and come to me.  I know what I am talking about.  I can bring members to hundreds of people who know what they are talking about.  This is going to explode on this Government.

He mentioned that he would like for us to go back to our respective leaders and ask for the opening of indoor dining on 5 July 2021.  In the absence of that happening, which I imagine in all likelihood will be the case, what measures would he like us to take between now and 19 July to try to save the industry?

Has he any suggestions there?<\/p> <p>  On the vaccine passport, I have had more representations from 22-year-olds in the last 24 hours than restaurateurs, cafe owners, and publicans.

We will not get that this year.  We are already down 50% of that 70% to 80%.  It will get worse given the number of people who have cancelled hotels, guest houses and restaurants.  They say they cannot take the risk of staying in Kerry, much as they would love to, because we still might not be open and, with the greatest respect, they do not want to spend a week in a hotel.

I have a slightly different view from Mr. Treyvaud in relation to the domestic green certificate.  Restaurants could have been trading for the last four weeks had calls that I made in March to move on such an idea had been acted on.  Now we are heading into July and we are starting to look at this.  As far as I can see, it is far too late.  I do not like the idea of domestic green certificates.  However, other countries are using the system and it is working well.<\/p> <p>  Throughout this pandemic, we have taken a different approach to different age cohorts at different times.  If we cast our minds back, there was a time when elderly people were being asked to cocoon.  That was an age-specific measure.  They were the ones who really lost out in that regard.  However, as a stepping-stone to reopening and to a sustainable, long-term approach, in that we could have future variants and we want to avoid future lockdowns, we should pursue this.  Of course, it would have to be worked out with industry.  I welcome that is happening today, but it is far too late.  Mr. Treyvaud said he was uneasy about this.  On antigen testing, which is also delving into someone's personal health issues, would he feel comfortable with checking on entry to restaurants?<\/p> <p>  I have shared his view for a long time.  I do not get the logic of allowing people to dine indoors in a hotel, but not allowing them to dine indoors in the restaurant next door.  I have called on NPHET to brief all backbenchers.  So far, only Ministers have been getting these briefings.  To me, the figures do not add up.  These figures are a doomsday scenario, considering that 40% of people are fully vaccinated, and 23% or 24% have had one vaccination.<\/p> <p>  NPHET should brief all of us in the Oireachtas.  I want to ask it if it can point to any particular spikes or outbreaks as a result of indoor dining.  Unless there is overwhelming evidence that this is a problem, it is over-reacting to make the type of recommendation that was made yesterday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021063000002#M01400","speaker":"1581"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I will keep it brief.

I will give Mr. Treyvaud the final word on this.  Yesterday in the D&aacute;il I made the point that I feel strongly about this.  We are talking against ourselves given yesterday&rsquo;s restrictions.  I live in a Border county but I have been to Killarney.  When I went last summer, Mr. Treyvaud&rsquo;s restaurant was fully booked up, which is a big accolade, and I could not get in.  However, we are talking against ourselves and are creating a mass exodus of people who are going a couple of miles up the road to Belfast.  It is wonderful that we can travel so freely across the State.  However, when there are different rules in different parts of the island, we are talking against this idea of a staycation.  Of course, 19 July is coming towards us.  There will be airplanes full of people flying aboard for the simple reason that they can try the cuisine in various places right across Europe.  It is really sad to see us on a different step from everywhere else in Europe.  I agree with my colleagues that the figures do not stack up.

The next time she is in Killarney she should give me a shout and I will find room for her.<\/p> <p>  I will start off by answering Senator Malcolm Byrne&rsquo;s important question on whether we should ignore NPHET&rsquo;s advice.  My answer is \"No\" that we should not ignore its advice.  It is up to politicians and political parties decide.  That is where the public sees the biggest problem.  It does not seem to be advice, but orders.  There is a fine line and balance, which is what I said back in May.<\/p> <p>  To answer Senator Carrigy&rsquo;s question about percentages, I said we should have opened at 50% occupancy in June to get us back to normal.  This would have stopped the hotels - I mean no offence to them - poaching all our staff and robbing us.  We could have opened and started cooking.  We have not done this in nearly nine or ten months at this stage.  If we had done that, we would probably have seen what we are seeing today, which is no spike or surge in the numbers since four or five weeks of hospitality being reopened.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Brendan McGowan.  He had huge support for the plan earlier on in the year.  Again, it highlighted everything we are saying today.  I also agree with him about starting off with a potential pass coming in and people being vaccinated.  We were so desperate in June to get back open and we could see what we needed.  At this stage, we need to do whatever it takes.  It is going to upset certain people, of course.  I would find it difficult to ask people if they are vaccinated but that is just me.  However, if means that businesses can open, then that is exactly what we have to do.<\/p> <p>  On what is coming down the line, we will see huge closures of restaurants and bars and not only that, but the sweet shop across the road depends on me.  We are all a package in tourism.  That is why I said it is the most important pillar of the economy.  Tourists will not come to Killarney if they can only stay in a hotel and walk around a national park, stunning though it is.  They want to experience a pint, go to the local restaurant and go into a shop to buy an Aran jumper, or whatever it is they want.  If my restaurant goes, then the next business goes and the next one after that.<\/p> <p>  I am lucky.  As the committee can probably tell, I am strong-minded.  I can handle most of what is going on.  However, over the last couple of months, the people to whom I speak, which is in the thousands, have gone beyond the brink.  They have spoken to their bank managers to tell them to stop sending them letters, because they do not have a single cent left, because they have not traded.  <\/p> <p>  What do we do?  The committee probably will not like this.  We need to open straight away.  Is the public confidence there?  It is 100% there.  How do I know?  I have to telephone so many people to cancel their reservations.  They have said to me that they will still come in and that they want to support me.  I said that I have no problems going against anything, but they will be fined and I cannot have that happening to them.  What are we going to do fix this?  Nobody wants a subsidy.  I would gladly give every cent of my subsidies over the last 16 months back, if we could have stayed open.  We knew to close when it was dangerous.  As I said, we closed before anybody told us to do so because that is what hospitality does; it takes care of the customers who come into our restaurants.  The committee might not like to hear this, but it might be lump sum pay-off to keep businesses afloat.  The committee might not like to hear also that there might need to be a tax amnesty, because that is how bad this is.  I am not making this up.<\/p> <p>  Over the coming months we will see closure after closure, particularly in rural areas.  I cannot see Dublin city getting back any time soon.  I think the city will be wiped out as well.  The problem is that when we open up all these problems will come up.  Then we will have bills, rents and landlords to pay.  That is when we will see issues.<\/p> <p>  I would ask committee members to please go back to all their political parties and leaders to tell them that NPHET advises, but that they must decide.  We cannot have Covid-19 as the only game in town here.  People are sick, dying, stressed, and mental health has gone off the walls.  We must look at everything together and take an entire industry at face value and say that we cannot allow 200,000 people in hospitality to sink.  It feels as though we literally have a knee on our neck at the moment.  I still have no idea when I will be able to open up my business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021063000002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Treyvaud"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":723,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Treyvaud for his passionate plea to this committee.

Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name, or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially inflammatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses who are attending remotely from outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence that they give.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will reluctantly be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, they confirm that they are on the grounds of Leinster House campus.  For anyone watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chair, and the necessary staff essential to running the meeting are present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances, and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask for everyone's forbearance should any technical issues arise.<\/p> <p>  I now call on the Minister to make his opening statement.  He will appreciate that we are confined to two hours.  I know he has quite a long statement.  He might, in his own way, perhaps give an abridged version of his large opening statement.  We will cover the main points and then we can get into questioning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#A00400","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I will try to do that.  I thank the committee for inviting me here today to talk about our road traffic Bill 2021.  As the Chairman said, I am joined today by my assistant secretary, Mr. Ray O&rsquo;Leary, and other officials involved in the delivery of this legislation.<\/p> <p>  Safety in all areas of transport has always been the highest priority of my Department.  In the area of road safety, Ireland has made significant strides in the past but we need to do more to reduce deaths and serious injuries on our roads.  The Bill will address a number of important issues that will add to road safety.  I am sure the committee will want to see this moved on from pre-legislative scrutiny to publication as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  This Bill began life under the previous Government and was delayed first by the election and then the pandemic.  As a result, issues have arisen since it began and preparation can now be addressed, in particular some commitments in our programme for Government.  Some of these additional matters may be included in the published Bill, while some may have to be introduced as amendments on Committee Stage.  What I propose to do here is outline the main issues to be addressed in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the master licence record, my Department holds the legal records of driving licences and vehicle ownership.  At present, these records cannot be linked.  This has created difficulties in linking road traffic offences to specific licence records, particularly in cases which come before the courts.  As a result, people's penalty points and disqualifications, which should be marked on people&rsquo;s records, are not, and these people may continue to drive on our roads while disqualified.  The Bill will address this by requiring people registering vehicle ownership to provide a unique identifier allowing a link to a driver licence record.  This will mean that even if people fail to produce a driving licence in court, we will be able to identify their driving licence record from their vehicle and apply the appropriate points or disqualification.<\/p> <p>  Further legislation is included to enhance the motor third-party liability database for all motor insurance policies in the State.  The aim is to tackle uninsured driving, reduce the risk to law-abiding motorists and cut the cost of insurance.<\/p> <p>  With regard to traffic management, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is investing in a project to allow for what is called dynamic traffic management on the M50 motorway.  This will involve varying speed limits to manage traffic flow as well as lane closures where appropriate.  The Bill will contain measures to make regulations to provide the signage and allow it to set the speed limits.<\/p> <p>  The committee has expressed an interest, as have many other Members of the D&aacute;il, in how we plan to legislate for e-scooters.  I will be proposing to define a new class of vehicles called powered personal transporters, PPT, which will include e-scooters.  Once PPTs are vehicles legally usable in public, it will become possible to make regulations for standards and safety.  I know there are different views on this and I would be happy to discuss it further with the committee.<\/p> <p>  Scrambler motorbikes are again an issue of significant interest to a large number of our colleagues within the Oireachtas.  The Government has committed to act against people who engage in anti-social use of scramblers, quads and other vehicles with legislation to enhance Garda powers if necessary.<\/p><p>The Government has also committed in its programme to act against people who engage in antisocial use of scramblers, quads and other vehicles, with legislation to enhance Garda powers if necessary.  The antisocial use of these vehicles ruins the enjoyment of public amenities for everyone else, and risks causing death or serious injury.  We will legislate to create a new ministerial power to make regulations which will address the use of scramblers and similar vehicles in places where they are not appropriate, such as parks and amenity areas.  The Garda will be empowered to detain and dispose of vehicles used contrary to the new legislation.  It will also have power to enter premises where vehicles are kept, so that they can seize vehicles suspected of having been used contrary to the new regulations.<\/p><p> With regard to the testing of automated vehicles, AVs, we are going to legislate to allow for the safe testing of automated vehicles on our roads.  It is likely to be a good many years before AVs are widely available on the market, but a great deal of development work is under way, and this inevitably means they will have to be tested in real-life situations.<\/p><p> Members of the committee will be familiar with the planned BusConnects project.  It was originally my intention to have a separate Bill which would introduce legislation needed to underpin BusConnects, but this would not be possible in the available time.  My officials are therefore working with the Office of the Attorney General to introduce amendments to the present Bill to provide the necessary legislation to enable BusConnects to go ahead.  This is still in progress, and at this point the precise provisions have yet to be settled.<\/p><p> The Bill also covers an extensive range of other areas that are far too numerous to mention in this opening statement.  In the current timeframe, very near the summer recess, it is unlikely the Bill will be before the Houses before the autumn.  However, I would very much appreciate if the committee could reach its conclusions on pre-legislative scrutiny quickly in order that we can publish the Bill for Deputies and Senators to consider and then proceed to debate it in the Houses as soon as possible after the summer recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#A00500","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":731,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for accommodating us on the time.

The Minister is bringing forward important legislation.  It is trying to include as much reform as is possible in one piece of legislation.  The area in which I have a particular interest is the issue of scrambler bikes.  I thank everybody who has been involved in campaigning on this issue, primarily the communities throughout the country who have been impacted.  Whether you are in Ballyfermot, Ballymun, Finglas or parts of Limerick, you will be impacted by this issue.  While it has been dealt with many times in the D&aacute;il, the Minister is bringing forward legislation that will comprehensively deal with it.  I thank people in the communities who campaigned.  I also thank the other Opposition parties who brought forward Bills in this area, including us when were in opposition.  I thank all the parties that will support this.<\/p> <p>  I urge the committee to do everything it can to support the Minister to get this legislation through.  The changes in this legislation will save lives.  It does two things.  In essence, it gives garda&iacute; the powers to seize these vehicles without having to pursue the person involved.  Often, the person involved is a child and we do not want to put that person at risk.  Even though he or she might be creating terror in his or her community, we do not want a situation where that child is injured in a pursuit by garda&iacute;.  This is a significant change in policy.  Garda&iacute; would have the power to go onto the curtilage of someone&rsquo;s property to take a vehicle they believe has been used illegally as a scrambler.  That will significantly assist garda&iacute; in our communities.  The legislation also brings forward a change which will mean that certain places where we would not have been able to limit or prohibit the use of scramblers because they were not covered by the road traffic Acts now will be covered.<\/p> <p>  It was always the case that changing this provision would be difficult because of the common law casebook that so finely balances the definition of a public place.  The Minister and the Attorney General have been creative in how they have brought forward this amendment that designates a new category of vehicles.  I thank the Minister for both of those provisions.  He has been joined in it by the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, who has brought both carrot and stick with proposals to allow youth services to deal with this issue by providing alternative diversion activities as well as for the safe use of scrambler bikes in designated places.<\/p> <p>  I ask the Chair, members of the committee, and Minister, Deputy Ryan, to do whatever they can to get this legislation through, because while I accept the focus is more wide-ranging than the issue of scrambler bikes, I know many communities throughout the country will thank them for getting it through because this legislation will save lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#B00500","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":733,"content":"<p>Maybe in the Minister&rsquo;s response he might address something he touched on briefly in his opening address and give more details on the timeframe in terms of publishing the full legislation, when he expects it to go to Second Stage and Committee Stage, and put a bit more flesh on the timeframe.

I realise this is a critical issue for their communities, for protecting our local environment and our people.  The positive side is creating facilities to give our young people outlets to use these devices safely.  Both carrot and stick are important, and we need the legislative constraints.  The programme for Government commitment came from a number of Deputies, and there is urgency in terms of getting legislation through on that as well as a number of other permissions.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of publication, my interest for this and a number of other issues which are in the legislation is for as much speed as possible.  My understanding is we have to get through the pre-legislative scrutiny process, so that, in a sense, is the first hurdle we need to get over.  Publication would be soon as possible after that.  If it were possible to do it before summer recess, I would do it.  It is probably more likely to be published early in the return.  My expectation is to go straight into the D&aacute;il.  This legislation is needed for a variety of different reasons: for scramblers, e-bikes, variable speed limits, for BusConnects - I could go on.  There is time urgency.  My expectation is we publish it as soon as we can after pre-legislative scrutiny, and then into the D&aacute;il as soon as we can.  It is unlikely we will get it before the recess.

A large number of people are currently using these scooters in a way that is not regulated.  Several countries have introduced regulation in this area, which means we are able to look at best practice.  There is an interesting paper, to which I refer members before we get to Committee Stage, in which the Road Safety Authority looks at the experience in other jurisdictions.  It provides a very useful background to the regulations we intend to introduce.  In effect, we are looking at regulations that are similar in many regards to those relating to bicycles.  It is about issues like the appropriate place on the road to use e-scooters and advice regarding helmet use.  Helmets are not mandatory for e-scooter users because they are not licensed vehicles.  In that sense, they are more akin to a bicycle than a motor car.<\/p> <p>  There is a need for regulations on speed and we can look to international examples in this regard.  Typically, 25 km or so is the speed limit set for on-road use.  The power output of the vehicles can be set as part of the regulations.  Occasionally, scooters may be used on the pavement for particular local reasons.  In those circumstances, the scooter is more akin to a pedestrian vehicle and speeds must be brought down to pedestrian levels.  There are good examples of international best practice on regulation.  Another aspect to consider is that in cities where an unregulated scooter hire system has been introduced, the vehicles have, in effect, ended up littering the streets.  E-scooters certainly have key benefits but their unfettered use under unregulated hiring arrangements creates problems.  That has to be part of the regulation.  The most important part of the legislation, however, is the introduction of basic regulations on speed, place on the road and so on.  Passing this Bill will allow us to put those regulations in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#C00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":746,"content":"<p>In the context of efforts to replace the car, we are doing a very good job in terms of encouraging bicycle use and increasing public transport provision.

In regard to changes to the regulation of driving instruction, I encourage the Minister to engage with the sector.  The committee has met with representatives of driving instructors.  They are organised and engaged as they try to come out of the Covid period and deal with the significant backlog in driving tests and lessons.  I want to flag again that there are ongoing issues in regard to access to testing centres.  As I have been saying for many months, this issue is resolvable and it should be resolved at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p><p> The premise of this legislation is, of course, safety.  In that context I wish to raise the issue of driver theory tests.  We are back since 8 June and I hear from colleagues throughout the country of ongoing problems in accessing theory tests.  It is fair enough if these are online or other technological issues that are being addressed.  However, my local newspaper, which I picked up on the way to work this morning, as I do every week, featured an article on the theory test.  People from Donegal and Dublin, along with local people, travelled to the theory test centre in Navan on Saturday for scheduled appointments.  The testing centre never opened, for whatever reason.  There was no explanation from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, or anybody else.  It was very frustrating for people who had organised themselves to get the theory test done.  I ask for an update.

What is the issue and when will it be resolved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#C01000","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":754,"content":"<p>This Bill is full of examples, which I did not mention in my opening statement, of many legislative changes that are important in the sector.

The testers for those require regulatory powers and they are given in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  There is a very clear political imperative to scale up our abilities so that we can clear the backlogs in both the theory and driving tests.  Any cases where, for example, a theory test centre is not open when someone was informed it would be is obviously of real concern.  I do not have details on that.  I have some statistics for the three weeks to 21 June.  Some 21,176 tests were scheduled and 16,493 were undertaken, for which there was a pass rate of 12,871 and a failure rate of 3,622.  There were also no-shows, for a variety of reasons, numbering 3,061, which has been an issue, possibly because we are dealing with a backlog legacy.  We are very keen to clear that backlog.

I was speaking in the Chamber earlier.  I thank the Minister for coming to today's meeting.  I read his witness statement and will put a few points to him.  It is very important the legislation captures existing forms of e-transport but it is equally important that it future-proofs things as well.  As I understand it, the Road Traffic Acts date back to the 1960s.  That body of legislation has been overhauled over the years, but who would have foreseen two-wheeled hoverboards or e-scooters?  I remember seeing an e-scooter for the first time two years ago in Dublin and now they are everywhere.  It is very important we future-proof this legislation.<\/p> <p>  On e-bikes, the Minister will be glad to hear I have been cycling to the D&aacute;il lately.  I have subscribed to the Dublinbikes scheme, which I find fantastic for nipping around the city and getting to and from meetings.  It is of concern that half of the Dublinbikes fleet is e-bikes, yet the battery system has failed.  Batteries have gone back overseas to be checked - I am not sure where - but Dublinbikes tells me and many other users of its service that it could be several more months before all of these come back.  This has disenfranchised many people and set them back.  I ask the Department to intervene in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On e-scooters, I met with representatives of Ford Ireland and am delighted to hear that Ford, which has more than a century of prestigious history in building quality cars, is now entering the e-scooter market, although with a very different type of e-scooter.  Ford will offer e-scooters where there is a subscription service, similar to the e-bikes that operate in towns and cities.  You arrive, tap in, take the e-scooter and return it.  It is a fantastic idea.  Ford is looking to engage with our committee and with the Department.<\/p> <p>  I will propose something to the Minister.  More than a decade ago, the Government decided that County Clare would have Ireland's first e-town.  Miltown Malbay was equipped with broadband, Internet and information technology, IT, facilities that are now outdated, obviously.  I want the Minister to embrace the whole idea of an e-town once more and I invite him and his Department to look at Ennis as a way of trialling e-scooters.  Not everything should go to Ireland's cities.  Ennis is the largest non-city town in Munster and would be a great place to trial e-scooters.<\/p> <p>  On automated vehicles, a fabulous project has been going on in recent years in Shannon, where Jaguar Land Rover has a facility testing automated vehicles.  This has been industry-led in Ireland.  Once again, it is important the legislation is future-proofed.<\/p> <p>  I will come in on the other points in a moment, if that is okay.  I ask the Minister to respond initially and I will then ask another question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#D00500","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":758,"content":"<p>The Deputy is right that we have to set these regulations in a way that gives flexibility as new devices, such as Segways and hoverboards, and there will be others, come in.  We are deliberately calling this powered personal transporters, PPTs, rather than e-scooters legislation because there will be other examples of this form of transport and we have to set the regulations in a way that gives us flexibility in that regard.  That will be key.<\/p> <p>  I am very glad the Deputy is on the Dublinbikes scheme.  It is very unfortunate it has had a technical problem with batteries.  Any delay in those batteries being replaced may be due to the global supply chain for a variety of products being in severe constraint at the moment.  The availability of bicycles is still recovering from the disruption caused by the Covid pandemic.  I very much regret that but I am confident that, whenever the global supply chain recovers, we will see those bicycles back in operation and working well.<\/p> <p>  With regard to County Clare, I agree with the Deputy that a town like Ennis would be a perfect location for testing, promoting and creating a safe space.  It will be very much dependent on local councils creating a safe space for the infrastructure.  We need that, particularly for safe routes to schools and in the designation of space.  To go back to what I said at the very start, many of these PPTs will be in the same safe space occupied by bicycles, such as bike lanes.  This a real opportunity for any town, and this will be very good for our towns in improving accessibility without the huge problems of car parking and so on.  I might get the Deputy to talk to my colleague, Senator Garvey, who has done a lot of work over the years on the issue of safe schools and travelling in Clare.  There is good experience available.  Ennis would be a perfect town but it is not the only one.  A number of other towns around Clare would be ideal for this form of transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#D00600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":759,"content":"<p>I have one or two more points to make in my remaining time.

We will be working with the airlines and others, including NPHET, to look at suitable approaches so we can start introducing it.  Before that happens, I expect it to have more widespread application domestically in a number of different ways.

Similarly with Aer Lingus and Ryanair, at critical moments in this crisis, Aer Lingus was flying in personal protective equipment, PPE, at a time we needed it.

I have been in discussions with Aer Lingus and Ryanair but I do not see them as an obstacle.  I am aware they are very keen to start testing.  The real issue is to get our public health system comfortable and satisfied with how that works.

In regard to aviation, when Dr. Holohan appeared before this committee there was an element of pass the parcel, but he did say that the evidence he needed in regard to the use of antigen testing could only be gleaned from a pilot in the aviation sector and that that could be only put in place by the Minister of Transport, Deputy Ryan, with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  We must ensure that we have an operational digital Covid certificate for 19 July and that there will be ease of use in terms of people being able to have information regarding vaccination or testing uploaded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#G00400","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":789,"content":"<p>Without wandering too far from the Bill, I will comment briefly on the Narrow Water bridge.

I understand Louth County Council will have a central role in it.  I would not rule out the application of European funding.  The European Council recently held a debate on TEN-T connectivity, but I am not certain that this would apply.  Increasingly, funding under TEN-T is being focused in other areas. <\/p> <p>  In terms of the road safety aspect, there is huge potential for development of tourism in the Carlingford Cooley Peninsula and the Mournes in particular, both of which are stunning locations for walking and cycling.  How we create safe road conditions in Carlingford for cyclists and walkers will be critical.  To be honest, I am nervous about the increasing traffic volumes that sometimes come with new road connectivity.  While I understand fully the symbolic and other importance of this project, my intention, on a road safety basis, would be to examine how we can make the Mournes and Carlingford Cooley Peninsula a haven for active travel tourism.

My understanding from a conversation I had with Dr. Holohan was that he was putting the use of antigen testing back into the lap of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, from the point of view of a pilot.  I accept that in regard to aviation we are far down the road in relation to when we should have done testing.  That said, given the circumstances and current difficulties, antigen testing should be looked at as a means of facilitating the opening of the hospitality sector.

I thank the Minister for attending the meeting.  This will, probably and hopefully, be our final pre-legislative session on this Bill and the committee can then produce a report based on the evidence of the witnesses with which it has engaged, including Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority, NTA, and the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  We will make suggestions and observations based on the evidence of those witnesses and the Minister's responses today so that we can allow this Bill to proceed to the next Stage as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  The Bill is wide-ranging.  It covers many areas that needed to be addressed.  It brings clarity to a number of areas of road traffic interaction with pedestrians and other road users and public transport, in particular the varied speed limits which I know are being trialled on the M50.  I am aware that TII has been talking about that for many years.  As somebody who is often caught on the M50 in tailbacks that seem to develop out of nowhere, I can see the real advantage of that.  Often there is no apparent reason for a tailback and it is just a cascade effect at junctions.  The varied speed limit will address that issue.  It will reduce the likelihood of crashes or conflicts because when traffic is moving, drivers tend to be more satisfied than when they have to continually, stop, start and jump lanes.  That provision is a welcome addition to the legislation.<\/p> <p>  The issue of e-bikes was raised and discussed.  There are a variety of them being used on our roads.  Some of them resemble motorbikes more than battery-operated bicycles.<\/p><p>I saw one the other day and I could not work out whether there was a key to start it or what it was.  We need to tighten up on that and give clarity to people on what exactly an e-bike and a propelled vehicle propelled by pedal and battery assistance are.<\/p><p> The regulation on scramblers is needed.  Scramblers and quads have no place in public parks or amenities, unless it is for maintenance by authorised people.  We have seen terrible accidents happen in public places.  It is time to tighten up on that as well as on the ownership and use of such vehicles.  I welcome that.<\/p><p> I am interested to see the opportunity for automated vehicle testing.  We always think that automated vehicles are something that are way off in the future and we will not see them here, but we have seen the speed of technology in various things throughout Covid.  It is only a matter of time before we start seeing them here.  I welcome their inclusion in the Bill.  It is something we can expand on in the future.  It is good to get it into primary legislation so that, when we start to address it, we are ready to move, up to speed and able to address it in a timely fashion.<\/p><p> I am glad the issue of fines has been addressed.  I note the third option whereby people will get a prompt and a penalty payment and be told they will be going to court in seven days.  It gives people an option to get out of it at that stage, pay a fine and not clog up the courts system.  That is of benefit.  All in all, I am fairly satisfied with the Bill and range of items it covers.  I look forward to the committee compiling our pre-legislative scrutiny report and putting forward our submissions and observations that the Minister may take on board for amendments to the Bill when it is drafted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#G00700","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":793,"content":"<p>Can I come back on what Deputy Matthews said?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#H00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":794,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#H00300","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":795,"content":"<p>On his last point, we did not have a chance to discuss that earlier.  He is right.  The ability to avoid clogging up the courts is important.  People would have to pay double in those circumstances, but that is better than a court hearing.  It is also better for the courts.  It is a welcome provision in the Bill.  I also agree with Deputy Matthews on scramblers, e-bikes and automated vehicle testing.  They are all future orientated, in particular bikes and automated vehicles.<\/p> <p>  I want to make a comment on the M50 in response to what Deputy Matthews said.  This is a critical Bill.  It is very local in a sense, but the M50 is used by a lot of people every day.  I speak as someone who spent three weeks at the oral hearings on the widening of the M50.  I had an interest in it at the time as a transport campaigner.  Various things stood out.  It has been expanded as far as it can go.  We cannot add any additional capacity.  It is at capacity, even during Covid. It will become increasingly a traffic management issue in terms of how we deal with a road which is clogged and at capacity.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what the Deputy experienced whereby a traffic jam came out of nowhere, it has some unusual flow and engineering characteristics.  There can be a traffic jam 2 or 3 km away from an incident or junction which causes a change to traffic flows.  We have to manage the motorway.  The speed regulations will help that.  Based on my personal experience - others may have different experiences - I find it a difficult road to drive on and navigate because there are many lanes joining and complicated junctions.  For people coming from the N7 to the Red Cow interchange, getting into the right lane is not an easy job.  It is a nervous experience, and even though I am a fairly experienced driver, I find it challenging.  A lot of people do.<\/p> <p>  We have real safety issues.  There have been accidents on the road.  Smaller accidents that occur daily can often be expensive in terms of the congestion they create.  More than anything else, in terms of safety, the variable speed system will give us the ability, if there is an accident, to slow everything down straight away and help to avoid further accidents.  If we have to close a lane, it will give us lane management capability.<\/p> <p>  The TII control centre, which is run on a full-time 24-7 basis, provides advanced monitoring of what is happening on the road.  I happened to be there when a car broke down on the fast lane, as it were.  I said, \"God Almighty, that is a dangerous situation.\"  Cars were going by at 100 km\/h.  I wondered whether the person could get out and how we would get to the car and so on.  The variable speed capability would allow us to manage that system safely.  The control centre would watch the road morning, noon and night.  It would be able to determine there was a problem, slow everything down and instruct on the use of a lane.  One of the most significant elements of the Bill is that it gives us the capability to manage the M50.<\/p> <p>   There may well be other instances around the country where we need to do the same.  TII is ready to go.  It will start with a trial period before the Bill is enacted.  This is important because many people probably share what I experienced.  It is a difficult road to drive, even at the best of times.  I am sorry for the long contribution but it is an important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#H00400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":796,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Matthews wish to make a further comment in respect of the Minister's response?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#H00500","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":797,"content":"<p>No.  I thank the Chair and Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#H00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":798,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.

In the past 30 or 40 years we have seen a significant improvement in road safety, as I said earlier.  Much of that is down to legislative provisions on drink-driving, safety belts, airbags and a range of different measures which have helped us to reduce the terrible carnage that used to occur on our roads.  In some ways, we in the political system can take credit for that.<\/p> <p>  There is another truth when it comes to road safety.  One of the changes that has occurred in the past 40 or 50 years is that there has been a significant reduction in the number of young people walking and cycling to school, in particular, as well as in everyday life.  That has had a very deleterious effect on their health as well as on the ability of parents to allow children to go outside and not have to drive them everywhere.  In truth, much of the reduction in road fatalities is because we have taken people away from the roads.  There has been a significant increase in car traffic volumes.  It is safer in terms of accidents per kilometre and so on, but we have created an environment that is inherently unsafe for young people and pedestrians and cyclists, in particular.  That needs to change.<\/p><p>This can be the situation in rural and urban areas.  Country roads can be very difficult to walk on and some towns may not have the same resources as others.  Therefore, this is an issue for the whole country.<\/p><p> Our next step forward in road safety must be in trying to change the basic characteristics of the transport system.  I refer to a modal shift and a reduction in travel overall.  We cannot continue to increase the amount of travelling undertaken all the time.  More than anything else, though, we must create a safe space.  It is especially important we do so for our younger people and enable them to walk around their areas, get to know their own neighbours and be able to visit their friends.  I met representatives of the RSA last week and the point I made was that what is important is the necessity for wider change in the whole transport system to make it safer, in addition to the provisions being made here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#H01000","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":803,"content":"<p>Is there a formalised rule book for cyclists?

They are regulated in the same way as any other motorbike when they are on the road in a public place and subject to the road traffic law.  As was also pointed out earlier, this legislation will bring in a kind of parallel system mechanism under which these scramblers can be regulated when they are in spaces not traditionally covered by road traffic law.  The legislation also increases the capacity of the Garda to follow up after events involving these scramblers.<\/p> <p>  A subset of vehicles exists in which the machines concerned are not considered as mechanically propelled vehicles, MPVs, because they do not meet the standards that MPVs are required to have to be used on the public road.  We could call these the pure sports scrambler motorbikes.  Some of those vehicles are also abused, but the point here is that those machines will still be subject to the same enforcement tools.  Those motorbikes can be legitimately used, such as by people who participate in motocross and who do scrambling perfectly legitimately in that context, as well as being abused.  It is almost a parallel sphere of operation.  Those vehicles, however, regardless of whether they are subject to road traffic law as mechanically propelled vehicles on the road, will be subject to this legislation.  Any form of vehicle, mechanically propelled or otherwise, being abused in these circumstances will be subject to these enforcement tools.<\/p> <p>  In addition, a group chaired by a representative from the Department of Justice is examining the wider mechanism of registration.  That is because scrambler motorbikes being used as sports vehicles are not required to be registered now, in the same way as other sports equipment is not required to be registered.  The owners of vehicles are registered in our vehicle database because their vehicles are used on the road.  This situation goes back to 1921 when legislation regarding vehicles was first introduced.  Scrambler motorbikes used for sports purposes are not road vehicles but sports equipment, albeit very powerful sports equipment.  Therefore, the question arises as to how they will be regulated.<\/p> <p>  The current vehicle registration system is linked to the payment of vehicle registration tax, VRT.  In turn, that is linked across to the type of approvals for road vehicles set at European Union level.  It is the case, then, that these scrambler motorbikes are powerful sports equipment and not road vehicles.  Therefore, they are not suitable for registration as road vehicles because they are not covered by VRT and there is now a need to look at a parallel system of registration which would cover these kinds of sports vehicles.  The system will need to discourage the abuse of these vehicles while not discouraging their legitimate use for sporting purposes.  A balance must be struck in this regard, therefore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#J02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray O'Leary"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I have two general questions for the Minister.

However, there may be situations where people, through no fault of their own, will not be able to be vaccinated and, for example, there may be family gatherings where there are teenagers or others who are not fully vaccinated.  In the context of what is being put forward by Professor Ferguson and his review group, and the Minister referred to the screening aspect, between now and 19 July, will the Government put something in train that would look at antigen as a screening tool for the people who are not vaccinated and that would see it used an addition to vaccination and PCR, although it would not replace them?  The Minister might comment on that final point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#J02400","speaker":"1593","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":826,"content":"<p>I will take that away from the committee and share it with Government colleagues but without committing.

I do not think I ever got a 37-page briefing before from a Minister for an opening statement so I thank him for that.  All of the information on road safety is very welcome.  I am around long enough to remember when Seamus Brennan introduced the start of penalty points with just three offences, and there was huge reluctance at the time by the Department and by people asking, &ldquo;Are you sure, Minister?&rdquo;, and all that kind of thing.  That massively reduced the number of road deaths, although every road death is one too many.  I welcome all the measures on road safety in the Bill, particularly the really basic stuff that we would have thought had been done before.  For example, ensuring points automatically go on the driving licence, linking cars to driving licences and the measures on the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland and uninsured drivers are all very welcome.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of points that have not been touched on by other contributors.  One is a concept that applies in other countries.  I understand there is a project on the M7-M8 in regard to average speed, so the system knows if a driver is clocked at the Red Cow at 2:30 p.m. and is at the Jack Lynch tunnel within a certain time.  I know people can beat the system if they want by stopping somewhere along the way.  However, if there were decent gaps along the way, it would mean it is not necessarily just a camera here or there and that, over a reasonable distance, people would be clocked and, if they are going too fast, it would be picked up.  Is there any progress on that kind of project?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#K00600","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":830,"content":"<p>The Senator is right that it was those sorts of political decisions by those like the former Minister, Seamus Brennan, God rest his soul, and others that have seen such huge progress.  There is provision in law for average speeds, as the Senator said, and it applies in the port tunnel.  My understanding is the Road Safety Authority is keen and we will be looking at further applications of that to improve behaviour and get speeds working properly.  There is a wider review of speed limits and a range of different ways we need to consider as part of a revolution in our road safety process, including speed limits in suburban and urban areas, such as the rolling out of the 30 km\/h speed limit system and how we manage that.  There are a variety of different innovations coming and technology will help us in that, including the use of cameras for the average speed limit.  That exists within law and it is just a matter of us rolling it out and funding the cameras and other technology to back it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#K00700","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":831,"content":"<p>There is value in that.  There is also value in the use of cameras and technology more generally and to a greater degree than is currently the case.  Technology is moving very fast.  For example, in my area, which the Minister knows well, in suburban estates and on roads we have for years been building ramps which damage the fabric of cars and slow people down.  If we had technology within people's cars so they enter an estate or a particular area and some kind of technology system forces the car to slow down to that 30 km\/h limit, we could save an awful lot of money on people having to get their lights reset before going to the NCT and save on maintaining these awful ramps all over the place.  Equally, those who are not speeding would not be punished.  Sooner rather than later, I would like to see investigation of how much we can have telemetry in cars which means that, as a driver enters a town or village, the car is brought to a slower speed with technology, although it should not be a knee-jerk reaction.  I know not every car is the same age and it would take a while to do, but I would like to see those kinds of systems in place.  People generally react well when they know they are being watched and I think it would make a lot of sense.  There could be more cameras in place and the local authorities, or whoever would make the money out of it, could stop spending money on ramps, start collecting a few fines from those who were not complying, and let everybody else get on with their existence.<\/p> <p>  With regard to M50 demand management, there have been many Ministers for Transport who have been from Dublin, not just the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and Seamus Brennan, but also Shane Ross and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar.  When Deputy Varadkar was Minister, the reference to demand management on the M50 was more about multiple tolling.  Will the Minister confirm that demand management in this context is much more about speed, signage and so on, and not multiple tolling?  I know that at one stage, before TII, the National Roads Authority, NRA, was suggesting that if drivers got on at Sandyford and got off at Cherrywood, they would have to pay &euro;10, but if they got on at the airport and got off at Cherrywood, they would not be charged because the NRA did not want that first kind of traffic on the roads.  The difficulty is that if those people are taken off the M50, they are rat-running through residential roads in Foxrock, Sandyford and such areas.  The Minister might confirm there is no proposal in this legislation for road pricing within the demand management context of what is being referred to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#K00800","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":832,"content":"<p>No, there is not.  There will be a lot of management of traffic in our urban areas.  BusConnects projects will, by their nature, restrict car traffic capacity somewhat on each route and corridor, and that will have an effect on Dublin in particular.  As I said, the M50 and the approaches to it are at full capacity, and that traffic coming into the city will be constrained because of the Bus Connects routes within the M50 as they evolve and develop.  The same will apply in other cities and we have to make sure Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick get the same high-quality infrastructure we are going to put into Dublin.  In those circumstances, that, rather than road pricing systems, is going to be the most significant road management system in the coming years.<\/p><p>There are no plans to introduce new road pricing systems.

In the same way that Revenue publishes a list of tax defaulters, which is a deterrent for people to default on their taxes, the vast majority of the public would accept the use of cameras if people are blatantly breaking red lights and are a danger to everybody, including themselves.  This is the kind of area where data protection and the general data protection regulation, GDPR, get a bad name.  We should ensure whatever laws need to be in place for safeguarding are there, but the GDPR alone should not be a barrier to doing something.

There may be some local issues, therefore, in individual parts of the country but we are not aware of a general issue of significant backlogs at NCT centres.  There tends to be a challenge in July because many cars' registration dates are in that month.

I was involved in the opening of that bus corridor back in the day.  It transformed public transport at a relatively low cost and with significant benefit to the people of Dublin.  I think BusConnects will be the same.  The legislation contains largely technical provisions.  The NTA had some concerns about the definitions of carriageway and how it could get flexibility for putting in alternative parking or other arrangements.  This is largely technical, to give it the powers to be flexible in how it integrates with existing development plans and to allow it to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la with legal certainty about a variety of issues which will help with planning permission.  We have to get our BusConnects project into the planning system and this legislation will help that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021063000002#M01700","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":868,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Chairman.
