I remind the committee that apart from me and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and from within the confines of the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Deputy David Stanton.  <\/p> <p>  Today, the select committee is required to consider the Further Revised Estimates for Vote 32 - Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to the meeting.  We appreciate the comprehensive briefing material provided by the Department for today's discussion.  It has been circulated to all members.  <\/p> <p>  To give a brief overview of the reason for this meeting, following the formation of the Government in 2020, certain functions were transferred to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment from other Departments, principally the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Social Protection.  The gross allocation in the Estimates for the Department in 2021 is &euro;1.142 billion, comprising more than &euro;796 million in capital funding and more than &euro;345 million in current funding.  This is some &euro;765 million less than the Department's Estimate allocation in 2020 of &euro;1.907 billion, which included significant once-off amounts for certain measures.  The allocation in 2021 represents an increase of some &euro;387 million on the Department's expected core allocation for 2021 of &euro;755 million, taking into account the funding implications of the restructuring to which I referred.  The Estimates also provide for a carry-over of &euro;106 million in unspent 2020 capital appropriations for use in 2021.  The allocation provides for measures to deal with the ongoing impact of the pandemic and the new trading relationship we have with the UK.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege in the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.<\/p><p>Members are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defense against any defamation act for anything that they say.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that privilege is not abused.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person, persons, or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  I now invite T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to make a brief opening statement or comment on Further Revised Estimate, FRE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#A00300","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for taking my Department&rsquo;s 2021 FRE this morning.  I appreciate that it has a busy agenda.  My officials provided the secretariat with a detailed briefing on the elements of the FRE, which I hope was of assistance to members.  The 2021 Estimate, which I present this morning, provides my Department with a gross allocation of &euro;1.142 billion.  This is broken down between &euro;796.647 million in capital funding and just over &euro;345 million in current funding.<\/p><p>A <i>prima facie<\/i>comparison indicates that the 2021 Estimate is &euro;765 million less than &euro;1.9 billion provided to my Department in the 2020 FRE approved by the D&aacute;il last November.  Members will recall that 2020 included significant once-off moneys to assist business dealing with Covid-19, in the form of restart grants, which have been superseded by the COVID-19 restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which accounted for through Revenue and the Department of Finance Vote.  Comparison with last year is also complicated by the financial consequences of the various functions that were transferred to and from the Department in the course of 2020 and 2021.  The most significant of these in monetary terms was the transfer of science and research functions, including responsibility for the Science Foundation Ireland to the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science in January of this year.  Significant once-off Covid-19 and Brexit funding provided to our Vote again for this year further complicates year-on-year comparisons. <\/p><p>Nevertheless, the &euro;1.142 billion being provided to our Vote represents an increase of almost &euro;400 million on the Department&rsquo;s pre-pandemic 2020 core allocation as per the original 2020 Revised Estimates Volume.  The Estimate also provides for the carryover of &euro;106 million in unspent capital appropriations for use by the Department this year.  These unspent capital moneys arose due to a number of reasons, not least the almost doubling of our Vote in 2020, which for proper governance and due diligence reasons meant that it was not possible to expend the full amount of this additionality in the year.<\/p><p>Significant additional moneys beyond our core allocation continue to be provided to our vote to ensure the Department and our agencies can continue to assist businesses, consumers, and workers as we get through this pandemic.  The committee will be aware of the various business and enterprise measures provided by my Department since Covid-19 took hold of our country.  The briefing provided by my officials includes details of the uptake of these schemes and, therefore, I do not propose to go into them in any further detail at this stage.<\/p><p>I will say a few words about our intentions in relation to the additional beyond core funding being provided in the Estimate before the committee this morning.  The majority of the additional funding is capital funding.  The allocation of &euro;162.6 million being provided to IDA Ireland will allow it to build an advanced manufacturing centre, which will be a national facility for multinationals and SMEs to trial, adopt, deploy, and scale digital technologies.  An additional &euro;10 million is being provided to the IDA Ireland's regional property programme, which is a critical element of the foreign direct investment, FDI, offering when it comes to regional enterprise development.  The Covid-19 products scheme, which IDA Ireland administers jointly with Enterprise Ireland, EI, will receive further funding of &euro;25 million to invest in projects in 2021.  This will fund research and development of Covid-19-related products in Ireland with significant economic and societal benefits.<\/p><p>The FRE also provides additional beyond core moneys to fund particular Covid-19 activities by Enterprise Ireland in 2021.  The &euro;322.2 million in capital funding will allow the agency to provide &euro;175 million to the sustaining enterprise fund, as well as the &euro;48.5 million small business assistance scheme for Covid-19, SBASC.  This is a financial support to help businesses with fixed costs associated with running a business, including rent, utilities, security, and storage.  EI&rsquo;s Brexit and related schemes will also receive additional funding.  Some &euro;15 million will be allocated to the ready for customs scheme; &euro;5 million for a further call under the online retail scheme; &euro;25 million for the regional enterprise development and transition schemes; and &euro;7 million for a food transformation scheme.  Food transformation will develop wider market opportunities for continued growth since Britain&rsquo;s departure from the EU. <\/p><p>I know the committee appreciates the role that the local enterprise offices, LEOs, play in assisting and promoting local indigenous businesses, which is even more important now.  The FRE provides the offices with a capital allocation of &euro;40.8 million for 2021.  This will ensure that programmes such as the trading online voucher, micro exporters assistance grant, preparing your business for customs workshops and targeted mentoring can continue to be accessed by small businesses throughout the country. <\/p><p>Ready access to finance has long been a live concern for many enterprises, particularly SMEs.  It has become even more of an issue in the light of Covid-19 and Brexit.  In response, my Department has implemented a range of targeted low-cost loans.  Members will be familiar with these at this stage.  Our 2021 Estimate will ensure that these schemes can continue to be available to the SME community.  A new initiative for 2021 will be the Brexit impact loan scheme, which has been designed to provide easier access and a wider range of financing.  Some &euro;25 million will be provided for contingent liabilities under the &euro;2 billion Covid-19 guarantee scheme, which was launched last year.  Additional funding will also be provided for schemes such as the future growth loan. <\/p><p>The focus of my Department&rsquo;s enterprise, innovation and commercialisation programme is to help enterprises commercialise innovations from investment in research and development.  Initiatives such as the disruptive technologies innovation fund, DTIF, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s research commercialisation programme and our membership of international research organisations, such as the European Space Agency, are key elements of this.  The 2021 Estimates will provide further funding of &euro;32 million to the DTIF programme, which will allow for a further call to be made under the fund as envisaged in the programme for Government.  An additional &euro;12 million will fund capital equipment under EI&rsquo;s research commercialisation programme, helping innovative enterprises, particularly SMEs, to attain critical, cutting edge equipment and infrastructure. <\/p><p>Aside from our capital allocation, the current allocation of &euro;345 million in the FRE represents an effective increase of 6.5% on the pre-pandemic Estimate of 2020.  The additional funding will ensure our enterprise agencies, including EI, IDA and the LEOs, have the necessary resources to meet the increasing demand for their services and expertise.  Additional funding is also being provided to beef up the staffing and resources of our regulatory agencies.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will benefit from increases in the order of 20%.  This will ensure that the agencies have the necessary staffing and related resources to continue their response to Covid-19 and Brexit. <\/p><p>The unprecedented challenges of Covid-19 underline the need for strategies and policies to ensure the recovery encompasses all elements of our society and economy.  The Government&rsquo;s national recovery plan charts the path for the reopening of the economy, which is predicated on rebuilding sustainable enterprises, supporting the domestic economy and leveraging the strength of the FDI sector.  Funding for my Department in 2021 is targeted at implementing these priorities.<\/p><p>Any recovery must take account of the new realities, the longer-term changes to our economy and society in areas such as digitalisation, decarbonisation, remote working, and increased automation, which undoubtedly have been accelerated by the pandemic.  The committee will be aware of the work going on across government to stop climate change.  My Department is fully engaged in the intensive preparations for the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, which is a statutory catalyst for moving to a climate-resilient and climate-neutral economy by 2050. <\/p><p>We are also working closely with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on our contribution to the next iteration of the climate action plan.  It is expected to be published later in the year.  Together with our enterprise agencies, we are working on actions to promote and facilitate decarbonisation of the enterprise sector and also avail of the economic opportunities that arise from it.An example of this is EI's climate enterprise action fund, which will help companies to build the capabilities they need to develop sustainable products, services and business models.<\/p><p>Digitalisation also represents a totemic challenge for our enterprise base and my Department is working at national  and EU level to drive digital transformation of Irish businesses.<\/p><p>The EU proposals for a digital services and digital markets Act are focused on optimising the conditions for the provision of digital services in the Internal Market, including in online safety, illegal content and fundamental rights, as well as setting rules for platforms that act as gatekeepers in the digital sector. <br\/><br\/>At the national level, the national recovery and resilience plan, for which funding is being sought from the EU recovery and resilience facility, includes proposals for a competitive fund led by my Department to drive digital transformation in Irish business over the next decade.  Complementary digital transformation initiatives, which continue to be priorities for my Department and our enterprise agencies include the advanced manufacturing centre in Limerick, further calls under the disruptive technologies innovation fund, DTIF, and implementation of Ireland's Industry 4.0 Strategy 2020-2025. <br\/><br\/>The changes that have been wrought by the pandemic and the challenges ahead affect both businesses and their employees.  It is important, therefore, the new work environment of the future equally respects the welfare of workers.  My Department has a number of specific initiatives in the area of employment rights that we intend to progress over the course of this year.  In the area of collective bargaining, a high-level working group under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, has been established to review collective bargaining and the industrial relations legislative landscape in Ireland.  The group intends to produce an interim report by the end of July and complete its work as soon as possible thereafter. <br\/><br\/>As regards remote working, the national remote work strategy was published in January.  It sets out the actions we need to take to ensure remote work is a permanent feature in the Irish workplace in a way that maximises economic, social and environmental benefits. <br\/><br\/>In terms of the right to request to work remotely, 175 submissions were received as part of the public consultation in April and May.  My officials are currently reviewing those submissions and they will help us to frame the legislation, which I hope to bring to Government later this year.  The right to disconnect is particularly important in helping employees to strike a better work-life balance and to switch off from work outside of their normal working hours. <br\/><br\/>The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, published its code of practice on the right to disconnect on 1 April 2021. The code is designed to provide guidance for the resolution of workplace issues arising from the right to disconnect both informally and formally.The committee will be aware of the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the Zalewski case<i>. <\/i>While the court found that the WRC&rsquo;s adjudication service represents the administration of justice in accordance with Article 37 of the Constitution, it also found certain aspects of the WRC&rsquo;s procedures were incompatible.  The necessary legislation to change the WRC&rsquo;s procedures on foot of the court&rsquo;s decision is currently being drafted as a matter of priority under the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy English. <br\/><br\/>On statutory sick pay, following consultation with the public, unions and employer groups, an interdepartmental group and an international review of best practice, a statutory sick pay scheme has been designed to cover almost all employees.  Work is now progressing to draft legislation to introduce the scheme.  I remains my intention to have it in place by the start of 2022. <br\/><br\/>The committee will also be aware of the commitment in the programme for Government to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government.  The Low Pay Commission, LPC, is currently commissioning research on this proposal and that is due to be completed before the end of the year.  The research will examine international evidence on living wages, the different calculation methods and the policy implications of moving to a living wage in Ireland.  The Low Pay Commission will outline a process by which Ireland will progress towards achieving this.  Separately, the commission has also been requested to examine the issue of a universal basic income with a view to bringing forward recommendations on how a pilot in Ireland could be designed.  It will take account of the annual recommendations on the national minimum wage, which is a separate matter. <br\/><br\/>The area of insurance reform is one which I know is of keen interest to the members of the committee.  The action plan for insurance reform, which is overseen by a committee of the Cabinet, is on track with Ministers reporting progress on implementing reforms.  That committee will meet later this afternoon.  For my own Department and the reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, following a public consultation which received more than 240 responses, work has commenced on the heads of a Bill with a view to bringing proposals to Government as soon as possible.  That is being led by the Minister of State, Deputy Troy. <br\/><br\/>Finally, I want to mention work that is ongoing in the area of company law and, in particular, the restructuring processes for small companies.  My Department has been working intensively to develop a simplified and effective statutory process to assist viable companies to restructure and remain in business.  The drafting of the legislation is near completion and we expect to introduce it in the House soon and, hopefully, have it enacted before the summer recess.  <br\/><br\/>Work on a Bill to establish a new corporate enforcement authority as an independent statutory agency is also near completion and it is intended to bring it through the Houses of the Oireachtas from the start of the autumn legislative session with a view to establishing the new agency in law on 1 January 2022.<br\/><br\/>I hope members of the committee have a flavour of what is being funded by my Estimate before them and of what the Department is doing with the money they vote to it.  I am happy to hear members' views and take any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#B00200","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I invite members to discuss the Estimates with the T&aacute;naiste.

My time is tight and I apologise in advance as I will have to leave to speak in the Chamber shortly.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Enterprise Ireland funding, there was unspent capital in 2020; a capital appropriation of &euro;40 million was carried over to be used specifically to help smaller counties but it cannot be used to help counties in the Border, midlands and western region.  I have been advised in replies to parliamentary questions that Offaly has only 63 supported companies, Laois has 52, Sligo has 74 and Leitrim has only 23.  To take one of two examples of the volume of funding involved, the T&aacute;naiste will note Leitrim is getting &euro;117,079, Sligo is getting &euro;707,044 and so on.  Those are not large amounts of money.  Are there any plans or could consideration be given to diverting some of that money?  When one looks at the picture of the allocations on a map, the counties in that region seem to be disproportionately disadvantaged.  I would not suggest taking money from another county but given that &euro;40 million has been carried over, would it be possible to distribute that to the Border, midlands and western region?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#C00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The Deputy was right to say some of the capital funding both from the regional enterprise development fund, REDF, and the Border fund was unspent last year.  We set up a Border fund exactly for that reason.  My predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, felt the Border area was not getting its fair share of funding and was able to produce evidence to prove that.  Much of the funding was not spent because of Covid-related delays when construction was paused.  Things just did not happen.  The Deputy will appreciate when construction is stopped one cannot simply turn it back on again.   We intend to spent that money.  The short answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question is \"Yes\".  We can certainly give consideration to diverting that to those areas but what we always need are projects that have come through planning and all the rest of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#C00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I do not think there would be any shortage of projects if people understand there is cash available to support them.

It is good to know the T&aacute;naiste is open to it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the working group that is reviewing collective bargaining, as I do not have the time to vocalise all the views I have on this subject, I will not do so.

It probably has not been written yet but I would hope the working group would complete its work in the autumn or certainly before the end of the year.  It is a complicated area, as the Deputy will be aware.  I have brought together the employers, the unions and the Government to review our collective bargaining legislation and industrial legislation both in light of the recent Supreme Court judgment and European developments with regard to collective bargaining rights to decide what we can do and how we can move forward.  Ideally, I would prefer to move forward in partnership with the unions and employers agreeing on a way forward.  The recent Supreme Court decision is helpful in upholding the right and authority of the democratically elected Parliament to have sectoral employment orders.<\/p><p>The areas that are least organised, where people are probably most vulnerable to low pay and insecure employment, are in those kinds of sectors where there would, traditionally, have been joint labour committees, JLCs, and sectoral employment orders, SEOs.

I encourage workers to do that.  It would be helpful if a deadline was set.  It is a complicated area.  The chances are that the report will present a range of options, a little like the Duffy Cahill report did.  A conversation will then stem from the report.  There is a need for this work to be done and I appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste has recognised that.  Without a deadline, I would be concerned that this work will drift.  It is necessary and important work, and a deadline would help to focus people's minds.<\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the code of practice on the right to disconnect.  It is only a code of practice and no one has the right to disconnect.  To vindicate that right, one must go to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, there are delays involved in going to the WRC, some of which relate to personnel and some of which are Covid-19-related.  Even before Covid, going back a number of years, I remember that one could be left waiting for anything up to a year.  Workers are being tormented when their phones keep beeping and they cannot get away from work.  Addressing that will, effectively, be delayed by another year because those workers have to go to the WRC.  I know the T&aacute;naiste has talked about funding and the achievements of the commission in the report, which is welcome.  The WRC will be provided with a gross allocation of &euro;15.405 million for 2021.  Is it going to get additional funding under these Estimates to recruit additional inspectors?  Figures given to me show that &euro;18 million in wages has been withheld since 2011.  That is not being withheld from people with big money.  Those figures possibly comprise modest enough sums to each individual but massive sums in terms of the overall budget.  We know the WRC does good work but we also know there are delays.  It is grand once a case goes before the WRC but the delay in access and the lack of inspectors are the problem.  With the level of inspectors there has been over the past ten years, &euro;18 million has been recovered.  The chances are that is the tip of the iceberg.  The inspectors cannot be in every workplace but it seems that where they do inspect, they find that a high level of companies inspected in one year, nearly 50%, were guilty of breaches of employment law.  Will funding be provided specifically for additional inspectors?  The T&aacute;naiste and I have discussed this matter on the floor of the D&aacute;il in the past.  Will there be funding for additional inspectors and does the T&aacute;naiste have a figure in his mind?  He knows that I want to see an additional 90 inspectors, as was agreed under Towards 2016.  I appreciate that agreement was a long time ago but the world of work has not changed.  If anything, there is more need for inspectors.  Is funding going to be available specifically for inspectors?  They do fantastic work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#D00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked about the code of practice on remote working.  That is a ministerial code but, as she rightly said, is not contained in statute.  However, the Organisation of Working Time Act is enforceable by law.  The interplay of the Act and the code of practice is important because as people increasingly work remotely via the devices we all know and love, working hours are no longer confined to the time one spends in one's workplace.  People can end up doing a lot of work from home and that should be counted as part of their working hours.  The interplay of the two needs to be enforced.<\/p> <p>  We have 53 inspectors in the WRC at the moment, 48 of whom are executive officers, EOs, and five of whom are higher executive officers, HEOs.  There are three assistant principals and one chief labour inspector.  We have sanction for 60 inspectors so we are already below the number for which we have money.  A recruitment campaign is now under way to recruit additional inspectors at both EO and HEO levels.  That will get us up to 60 inspectors and we intend to go beyond that and increase the number of inspectors over the next number of years.  We have not agreed a figure with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform yet but with somewhere between 2 million and 2.3 million people at work in Ireland, 60 inspectors is not an awful lot.

More and more people are going to be reliant on the WRC to vindicate their rights under the law.  The T&aacute;naiste said that one can go to the WRC under the Organisation of Working Time Act, which is true, but one must still wait a long time.  The WRC needs an overall increase in staff.

Some people in business have raised with me the fact that some of the schemes are working and others are not.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have a view as to which ones are working and why it is the case that others do not seem to have a high take-up rate?  In this environment, the take-up rate should be huge but some of the schemes do not have a high take-up rate.  I do not know if that is because of an associated administrative burden.  Business owners tell me they want to engage but it is not always easy.  Is the T&aacute;naiste minded to divert moneys from schemes that are not working into schemes that are working?

They are available in all areas, even beyond business.  The Microfinance Ireland loans for very small companies seem to be very popular.  Many companies are unable to repay but the loans help a lot.  The future growth loan scheme is very popular.  That is probably down to the fact that it is ten-year money.  The interest rate is approximately 4% but it is ten-year money, which is attractive when compared to five-year or six-year money, as the Deputy knows.  The Brexit and Covid schemes are less popular although uptake is increasing all the time, particularly for the &euro;2 billion Covid guarantee scheme.  That is six-year money at an interest rate between 2% and 3% but there has been less uptake of the scheme.  I think that is because people find ten-year money more attractive, even though the interest rate is slightly higher.  We are limited by state aid rules in that regard and cannot change that from six-year to ten-year money.  The future growth loan scheme is largely availed of by businesses that are doing well and want to expand whereas the Covid schemes are more targeted at businesses that are in difficulty because of Covid.  Even businesses that are in difficulty are quite risk averse.  Most businesses in Ireland do not have any debt, which is unusual but they do not like to have debt.  There is a reluctance to take on debt.  We met representatives of business groups and banks last week to discuss exactly this matter and go through the modifications we might be able to make to those schemes to make them more attractive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#D00500","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Reilly's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#D00600","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I have one more question, if I might be allowed to ask it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#D00700","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Do so quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#D00800","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>My question relates to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and its funding.

The supports to business have been significant, as have the changes in sick pay, remote working, the living wage and small company rescue.  The Department is showing signs of a real capacity to respond.<\/p> <p>  Many people were quite winded by reports on Monday that the Delta variant could result in 700,000 new cases and 13,000 hospitalisations in the next three months and more than 2,000 deaths.  Many businesses and other organisations depending on public patronage will be very interested in the evidence that will be put forward in that regard.  Are thresholds beginning to emerge in this new analysis at which we can expect to see a capacity to make decisions so that people know that if cases remain at X, Y or Z level in July or in the first two weeks of July, the modelling relating to extreme cases is not accurate and, therefore, they can proceed?  I am interested to know that because people are quite taken aback.<\/p> <p>  What contingency planning is being done in the Department with regard to the significant challenge coming down the track in respect of the corporate tax regime?  <\/p> <p>  I wish to probe the preparations in respect of climate within the Department.  I get the sense that the Department believes that because climate action relates to transport, energy use and so on, it is not really for the sectors.  I think that is misleading.  What is being done in the area of freight in particular, which will be a difficult problem?  I refer to design and packaging in sectors that supply consumer markets.  Is the Department planning to promote reuse, repair and refurbishment in a way that could see a different approach, that is, the so-called circular economy, where products have a longer life and there is less waste?  I would be interested to see that.  Specifically, are IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland now planning for a very significant offshore sector?<\/p> <p>  How are companies being supported to respond to the need for significant growth in apprenticeships?

I will try to cover as many of his questions as I can.  As regards the Delta variant, we anticipate that we will review the situation again in the run-up to 19 July.  The key question on which we do not yet have full answers is that of transmissibility and how much more transmissible is it relative to the Alpha variant or the original Wuhan or wild strain.  They will say it is more transmissible by 40% to 60%.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is going for 55%.   There is a significant difference between the models at 40% and those at 60%.  It is to be hoped that we will have a better idea how much more transmissible it is in a couple of weeks time.<\/p> <p>  Probably more important than that is the conversion rate, that is, the extent to which cases turn into hospitalisations and deaths, because obviously what we are trying to avoid is not the elimination of the virus, which is not possible or realistic.  It is not about getting rid of all cases of the virus - that is not going to happen.  It is about making sure our hospitals do not get overwhelmed and that we do not have large numbers of deaths as a consequence of Covid again.  It seems to me that in England and Scotland they are taking a much more optimistic approach than we are.  The Taoiseach spoke to Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, yesterday, just to get a steer from her as to what they think there.  They seem to be more optimistic even though they are seeing record case numbers in Scotland and 20,000 cases a day are now being detected in Britain.  They are saying that although the link between cases and hospitalisations is not broken, it is so weakened that they believe they can keep indoor dining open and may even be able to ease restrictions further on 19 July.  We have our fingers crossed and are hoping and praying that they turn out to be right because if they are right, it means that the pessimistic projections of NPHET are not the ones that will be realised and it will be something closer to optimistic or central case projections which may allow us to make different decisions.  However, I think we have made the right decision to pause until we have more information precisely because this is the kind of virus that spreads quickly.  We found in December that we rolled back on the liberalisation of restrictions too late - the horse had bolted before we heard the stable door slam.  We do not want to take that risk on this occasion.  I hate saying this because people are sick of hearing it, but the next couple of weeks will tell a lot in terms of how much of a problem Delta will be for us.  It is seeded across Europe and north America, as all present are aware, so we will be able to see data from that.<\/p> <p>  On the international corporate tax position, that is an area that is being led by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  Obviously, I keep across it as I need to.  We are now approaching the point where there may well be agreement at OECD level on Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, both of which could cost Ireland in terms of revenues because if profits are reallocated away from Ireland or if there is a higher rate, we will probably see a reduction in taxation and revenues.  That is a potential problem for us.  On balance, we think it is better to be inside the tent.  Ireland is not a tax haven and we do not wish to be one or to be seen as one.  That is why we think it is better for us to be inside any agreement that may be reached at international level or OECD level.  We are at a very tight point on that at the moment and obviously the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is taking the lead on it but I am very much across it.  <\/p> <p>  The issue relating to freight will probably be more for the Department of Transport than for my Department but obviously we will be across it.  I know the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is very ambitious about moving to hydrogen and using renewable wind to generate hydrogen which we could then use in freight, but it will take time to make that a reality, quite frankly.<\/p> <p>  On the circular economy, I am familiar with the report on it, by the way, and there are significant opportunities there.  The circular economy is actually very labour intensive.  Footwear, clothes, bikes and other products being renewed to extend their life cycle is good environmentally but it is also very labour intensive and there are really good opportunities for job creation in the domestic economy in embracing the circular economy.  Legislation on that will be forthcoming quite soon.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of offshore, that is exactly where we see significant opportunities as well.  If we can get the planning system sorted - we will do that with the marine legislation that is finally a reality - then we can really exploit enormous offshore wind opportunities which will allow for import substitution and importing less oil and gas and probably more price stability as well because the price of wind does not go up and down in the way that the price of fossil fuels does.  We see that as an enormous opportunity economically and environmentally but we are really way behind where we ought to be or in comparison with England, Scotland or Portugal.  That is largely down to planning issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#E00300","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for attending the meeting.

Can I again highlight the extra CT scanner at SEAM Gateway at WIT?  This project was approved in 2018 but has yet to be funded.  Could the T&aacute;naiste use his offices with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to see that this gets funded?  It is a very important project for enterprise development in the south east.<\/p><p> The T&aacute;naiste also referenced the allocation of &euro;162 million to IDA Ireland to build an advanced manufacturing centre and the allocation of &euro;10 million to IDA Ireland's regional property programme.  Can I point out to the T&aacute;naiste that there is no IDA Ireland office in Waterford, which is the regional gateway to the south east in Project Ireland 2040?  Could the T&aacute;naiste speak to IDA Ireland about this issue?  <\/p><p> I reference what Deputy O'Reilly called the Border-midlands region.

Again, this is something the T&aacute;naiste's office can develop.  I am happy to see ISME is now getting a seat on the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council but it must be on the Labour Employer Economic Forum to represent smaller businesses, which are not being properly represented.  <\/p><p> Regarding the reform of PIAB, does the T&aacute;naiste have any concerns about the attachment of post-traumatic stress disorder claims to soft tissue injuries, which would basically allow those claims to proceed from PIAB to the Circuit Court where the claims will be much higher?  Does the T&aacute;naiste have any plans to track that ongoing development?  <\/p><p> Regarding the situation with the hospitality industry, we must get back to some kind of large pilot testing using antigen testing.

The Deputy raised the matter with me on a few occasions and I know he will not give up until it is purchased.  I spoke to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science about it.  The way I understand it works is that there is an approved list of things Science Foundation Ireland has but it must work down that list.  It is working down the list but the item is still a bit of a way down the list.<\/p> <p>  I would be supportive of an IDA Ireland office in the south east but these are decisions for the CEO and board of IDA Ireland.  It is not really my role to say where offices should be located and who is in them but I would be supportive of IDA Ireland doing that if it can as its staff complement increases.  Our real focus for the south east is the regional economic plan for the south east.  The south east has been one of the better regions in that regard.  The local authorities have come together, are very much behind it and have appointed a programme manager to make sure it is implemented.  The Deputy will have seen the kinds of things that were done during the period of the last strategy such as an advanced building solution in Waterford; an upgrade of the business and technology parks in Kilkenny, Wexford and Waterford; and investment in Belview, which we hope will turn out to be very useful if the Glanbia-Royal A-ware project goes ahead.  Over the next three years, we plan to have a third advanced building solution in Waterford so that will facilitate a further significant FDI investment there along with a new one in Carlow.  Obviously, we are working with Wexford County Council to get planning permission for an advanced technology building in Wexford.  What we find is that when it comes to getting FDI into all regions of Ireland, which is the objective, the most successful aspect so far in getting it to go places other than the big cities is having an advanced building solution into which companies can get quickly.  Seven of the 11 buildings we built are occupied.  We need to build more, including in the south east.  <\/p> <p>  I appointed somebody from ISME to the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council.  I took that decision because I thought it was important to have somebody from the small business sector that would focus on the cost of regulation and cost competitiveness, which is an important aspect of competitiveness that we might have drifted away too much from.  Small business is represented on the Labour Employer Economic Forum through IBEC and the Small Firms Association.  The difficulty with adding more and more bodies is the question of where one stops.  At the moment, Chambers Ireland and IBEC are there as the umbrella bodies for all business organisations.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the issue of post-traumatic stress disorder and I think it is something we will have to monitor.  There always seems to be a new frontier when it comes to tort law and compensation.  We have significantly reduced awards for physical injuries.  We see that coming through with average awards in PIAB in the past while down 50%, which is what we hoped would happen.  Of course, when that happens, some people and some lawyers will look for new angles.  Psychological injuries may be the new angle when it comes to compensation and we need to monitor this very closely.<\/p> <p>  I am keeping an open mind on the testing question.  I am very aware that other European countries which operate a green pass or Covid pass system allow for vaccinated, recovered and recently tested.  NPHET is not recommending the third one.  It is recommending the first two but I think Government must keep an open mind on whether we extend the pass to people who have recently tested negative for all sorts of reasons that the Deputy will understand, particularly around non-discrimination, which appears to be done in European countries that operate these passes like Germany, Denmark and Austria.  We did not plan to do this so we are starting to work out what we can do over the next while.

We asked NPHET about this point when we met it as part of the Covid sub-committee.  The medical, scientific and public health advice from NPHET is that this will be a low risk as is the case with workers in hotels at the moment.  They would be wearing masks and there would be PPE.

The commission has examined this on several occasions and has removed some of the sub-minimum rates in recent years.  The theory or argument behind it is that having sub-minimum or lower rates ensures that people who have no experience or who have never worked before can have the opportunity to get employment.  That is the thinking behind having a lower rate.  It is to create opportunities for people to get work experience and employment who otherwise would not if they were paid at the same rate as younger workers who are a little older.  I am unsure whether I agree with that, frankly, but that is the rationale or theory behind it.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to the Deputy on ventilation but I am keen to correct myself.  There is a legal basis to it.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 require employers to ensure an adequate supply of fresh air ventilation in enclosed areas of the workplace.  This can be done through three means.  One is natural ventilation, relying on passive airflow through windows, doors and air vents that can be fully or partially opened.  That is the simplest way to do it.  Mechanical ventilation involving fans, ducts and window fans can be used to bring in fresh air from the outside.  The third means is a combination of natural and mechanical ventilation, for example, where mechanical ventilation relies on natural ventilation to maximise fresh air.  There is a legal basis to it, but I will come back to the Deputy with more detail about the practical enforceability thereof, which, I think, is what the Deputy is asking about.<\/p> <p>  I note that this time last year indoor dining was open.  People were working in that setting protected with masks.  None of the customers at that point were vaccinated.  It is now being proposed by NPHET that we move to a situation whereby all customers would be vaccinated or immune.  Notwithstanding the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant it would be a far safer scenario than the one we asked hospitality workers to work in this time last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#G00600","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I would point out that we have the Delta variant and we have higher case numbers than we had this time last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#G00700","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>My thanks to the T&aacute;naiste for coming to the committee this morning.  I want to raise one thing if that is okay.  I appreciate it straddles a number of Departments but it is very much in the T&aacute;naiste's area.  It relates to the UK high-level border operating model for produce of animal origin.  Several companies in my region are going to be adversely affected if the current situation pertains when the new stipulations come into effect from 1 August.  As the T&aacute;naiste will be aware, many of the companies operating in value added food products are going to be affected by the third country issue.  The plants operate 24 hours per day and many operate for six or seven days per week.  They have trucks departing their facilities in real time with a short window to make ferry connections.  Several of these plants already have sister facilities in the UK.  They have seen first-hand the impact of these new regulations and have been flagging for several months that we need to try to put in place a procedure, possibly a workaround or some other mechanism, that can safeguard the operation of these businesses.<\/p> <p>  Several of the companies are engaging with the office of the chief veterinary officer and it has been a positive engagement so far.  One of the suggestions is that technical officers could be brought in to supervise the loading and that a vet will sign off later on.  That has been shot down by the companies on the basis that countries, including France, have a loose interpretation of the guidelines.

Would the T&aacute;naiste consider establishing a climate and circular economy unit in his own Department?  If the sectors do not drive change, it will not happen, and I can give an example.<\/p> <p>  Food waste is equivalent to  million extra cars on the road and two thirds of plastic is not recyclable, which equates to the equivalent of another 500,000 cars on the road.  Commercial users are the worst offenders in misplacing waste and putting it all into the equivalent of the black bin going for incineration or landfill.  We need to get change embedded in sectors.<\/p> <p>  Offshore is an option where the State will award an option to the lowest bidder.  Does that preclude, in any way, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland from supporting the sector in the traditional way they might?  How will IDA Ireland and EI approach the opportunities in that sector?<\/p> <p>  I am still interested in the matter of apprenticeship and management development within the companies for which the T&aacute;naiste is responsible.  Enterprise Ireland produced a fantastic management development initiative and although tiny numbers go through it, it has transformed the internationalisation of some domestic businesses, which have become multinationals.  We are missing an opportunity in not developing that more widely.  If we want to shift away from the dominance that university education has had over the opportunities in practical apprenticeships - participants in which can go on to get a degree if they wish - we must see the big blue chip companies having substantial apprenticeship programmes.<\/p> <p>  It did not come as a surprise but in this day and age the fact that working right permits are tied to individual employers seems to be something from an earlier age.  We must recognise that we need support from foreign workers here so should we not move away from the idea of being tied, effectively for five years, to one employer?  It is not good for either worker rights or civil rights.  Is it time to change that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#H00900","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  We have a dedicated climate team headed by a principal officer in the Department.  There is a question of whether we should expand it, perhaps rebadge it and develop it into a climate and circular economy unit.  I had not thought about it but now the Deputy has said this to me, I will give it some thought and reflect on it.  We will have a new climate action plan in the next couple of months and, with new climate legislation, he knows how carbon budgeting will work.  A certain amount of the carbon budget and carbon reduction measures will be assigned specifically to my Department and it puts it up to us.<\/p> <p>  The idea of the legislation is to put it up to individual Departments to drive down emissions and waste in their sectors.  That is something we must do and the philosophy behind the legislation is that each sector of the Government and Department becomes responsible for the emissions ascribed to it.  If we are going to make progress, we must make this a big part of our work over the next couple of decades.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about EI and IDA Ireland helping companies involved with offshore development.  I am advised they work across the supply chain, including those developing proposals and investing.  As he said, it is a competitive auction process and, therefore, I am not sure to what extent they can provide grant aid and so on.  I will revert to him on that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy will be aware that apprenticeships fall under the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, which is led by the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris.  Many good things are happening and much progress is being made in recruiting apprentices and getting companies to take on apprenticeships and all new forms of apprentices.  The target is to have 10,000 each year by 2025 and we are going to work with the Minister on that.<\/p> <p>  Management development is a valuable area and we know well-managed companies are more competitive and productive and perform better.  We have a number of programmes to improve the quality of management in companies and perhaps it is an element we should scale up over the next couple of years, particularly if we want to close the productivity gap between domestic firms and SMEs on the one hand and the multinationals or other big firms on the other.  They are generally able to do these sorts of things for themselves but we probably need to help smaller and domestic companies to help themselves in that regard.<\/p> <p>  We are doing a review of the legislation on work permits and there will be a new consolidated law on that.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, is taking the lead on that project.  Currently, work permit holders can change their employer within 12 months if they are made redundant or there is a fundamental change in the employment relationship.  A person is not necessarily tied to one employer for five years and one can change after 12 months.  I often wonder whether a better system for Ireland might be something like a green card system where we allow in a certain number of people with full access to all parts of the labour market.  The advantage of an employment permit system is it can plug particular skills gaps in particular areas.<\/p><p>It might be a fruit farm in north Dublin or a mushroom farm in Monaghan.  The reason employment permits are given is to fill such skills gaps.  If this were not done, would it be possible to fill those gaps?  People might get work permits but not want to work in the relevant sector or part of the country.  We would then have a new problem to solve.  That is the difficulty.  Instinctively, I do not like the idea of people being invited into the country to work and being told they may only work for a particular employer because that creates a power relationship between employers and permit holders, who are migrants and who may not have many connections here or know their way around the system.  They would be more open to exploitation in those circumstances.  Instinctively, I would go the way the Deputy is going but, if we did that, would we not create a whole different problem?  We would then be issuing work permits without being able to use the work permit system to fill skills gaps that exist in particular sectors. which are often in particular parts of the country.  I do not know how to square that circle but I am open to suggestions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#H01000","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>We hope to issue a report on that matter shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#J00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I will return to the issue of ISME and the Labour Employer Economic Forum.

I ask the T&aacute;naiste to seriously consider allowing ISME to be represented on the LEEF.  It is very important that its voice is heard and I am not sure the voices of those it represents are being properly heard in the forum.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the marine legislation the T&aacute;naiste mentioned, I will ask about the development of offshore wind.  What kind of community quotient will be included in the legislation?  I refer particularly to any economic benefits that would accrue to our coastal regions and communities.  As part of this paradigm, I will ask about the issue of data centres.  Has the Government given any consideration to the percentage of the new wind generation capacity to be developed offshore that will have to be given over for data centres?  That also raises questions around the viability of the grid and the additional infrastructure we will have to develop to accommodate data centres.  I struggle to understand the relationship that requires us to build so many data centres and the economic benefits they present overall.<\/p> <p>  Again with regard to the marine legislation, I am interested in the issue of carbon sequestration.

On the issue of data centres, they present a real dilemma.  There has never been more data in the world.  There is going to be more and more data in the world over the coming years and decades and they have to be stored somewhere.  It is of real strategic advantage for Ireland to be a place where data are stored.  They are a really valuable commodity, like gold or diamonds.  Why would one not want them to be stored in one's country?  It is not just about the jobs in construction, the supply chain or maintenance.  The real value in large companies and big employers keeping their data in Ireland is that they are much more likely to bring other operations here and to keep them here.  It is the company's safe and one never moves too far away from one's safe.  That is why there is an advantage to us in having these data centres in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The problem is that data centres' demand for energy is extraordinary.  I have seen figures suggesting that as much as one third of all the electricity we produce will be needed for data centres.  This comes at a time when we are having some trouble with the grid and have a couple of power stations down.  This will present a difficulty over the next few years.  In the medium term, opportunities will arise from renewable energy, including offshore wind which will produce gigawatts of electricity.  Being the country where one can build a data centre powered by green energy could be a real plus.  Customers and consumers are becoming more environmentally aware all of the time.  They may want that from companies.  It is a real dilemma in the short term given the shortage of electricity but will also present a real opportunity in the medium term.<\/p> <p>  With regard to campaigns, we launched the Made Local campaign the other day.  The Deputy will probably have heard the advertisements on the radio.  Rachael Blackmore is our ambassador for the campaign, which encourages people to buy things made by Irish makers, designers and craftspeople.  Separate from that, there will be a campaign about buying locally which will encourage people to consider shopping locally and buying products that are made locally, whether in Ireland or in their own region or county.  We will launch that campaign in the near future and fund it well.  We are very happy to work with Guaranteed Irish as partners in that campaign.  However, what we discussed before with regard to the rules governing the Single Market must be borne in mind.  These do not allow national governments to promote national brands as such.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#J00600","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#J00700","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1625007600,"counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021063000002#J00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 101, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Select Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment has considered the Further Revised Estimates for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. <\/blockquote> <p>Under Standing Order 100(2), the message is deemed to be the report of the committee.

That is attended to in the Bill, although I am not certain of that.  It is the abruptness with which the whole thing happens that frightens the people concerned.  Whether they have been running a small business such as a little shop on the corner, a small farm or any kind of business, all these things come at a time when the family is vulnerable.

My amendment has been ruled out of order because there is potential charge on the State.  I listened quite intently to what the Minister of State said on Second Stage.  She said she did not want to backdate it because it would create a precedent, but it would not.  We have had numerous precedents, particularly relating to issues of compensation where payments have been backdated.  Even as recently as last November, a statutory instrument was introduced that backdated provisions to the beginning of October.  It is quite common in these cases.<\/p> <p>  There are many precedents whereby a Government brought in legislation that implemented provisions from the date of the relevant Government decision.  The Government decision to address these particular anomalies within the fair deal scheme was taken three years ago.  Only a handful of people would now be impacted by this particular provision but in those instances, some of them have substantial bills accruing against their family home and estate for someone who went into a nursing home more than three years ago.  This issue needs to be addressed for those families.  The issue will be addressed going forward.  In cases where costs have accrued prior to the Government decision three years ago, the people concerned do not have a legitimate claim.  However, the Government took a decision three years ago next month to exempt the family farm or business after three years.  It has been a tortuous process to bring forward this legislation.  It has taken three years.  I accept that.  However, should individuals be penalised and forced to sell the family farm or business because of the delay in implementing the Government decision by drafting this legislation?

It needs to be made clear so that everybody understands that those who have been in care for more than three years prior to the Bill being commenced will be advised to appoint a family successor quickly, once the Bill has been commenced.  If they do so, they will avail of the relief very quickly.  Let us take the example of a person who has been in a nursing home for the past two years.  If that person appoints a successor as soon as the Bill is enacted, those two years will stand as time served in the nursing home.  We are trying to make it as workable as possible.

It is wrong they are caught in that position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#D00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>The premise of the new scheme is contingent on the family successor being appointed, which cannot happen until the amendment is enacted and commenced.

I thank the Minister of State for her engagement this morning.  This is positive legislation.  I have been following the discussion here in Leinster House and also remotely.  The Minister of State is hearing from members about the need to shape this legislation in the right way.  Overall, it is an excellent Bill.<\/p> <p>  On leasing and the point made by Deputy Healy-Rae, for many people leasing out is a transitional arrangement where a farm is handed over to somebody but the person may not be in a position to take it on immediately.  This could be owing to a person's work, family circumstances, etc.  There needs to be a degree of cognisance of that.<\/p> <p>  I have also seen an anomaly occur on a few occasions in County Clare.  Land valuations have typically remained static over the past ten years or so.  Agricultural land, by and large, is of a similar value to what it has been a decade ago.  In the previous two Clare county development plans, the forward planning unit of the council has zoned large tracts of land without first getting the consent of the landowner.  It is all done on the basis of town and village shaping.  Normally, one would expect a person to be quite happy to see his or her land zoned and its value increase.  However, I know of scenarios where people were not happy.  They have seen the value of landholdings they had planned to farm or perhaps pass on to a younger generation of the family increase exponentially without their knowledge.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if the legislation can cater for all these scenarios but it is arising more and more often.  Prior to 2009, county development plans were only based on the submissions received from individuals but I am now increasingly seeing planners make decisions in unison with councillors that may not always have the consent of the landowner.  That is fine and dandy until people start looking at the fair deal scheme or something like that and suddenly find that the land they are sitting on has a very different value from what they or the people around them believed it to be.<\/p> <p>  In the vast majority of cases that I can recall, land is passed on to the next generation and the value it generates year on year in a beef scenario in County Clare would be from cattle sales and whatever comes in by way of EU grants and payments.  Beyond that, there are outlays and the people hold on to the land for 40 years or so in the hope that a son or daughter, niece or nephew, as the case may be, will take it on.  The land also needs to be gauged on that basis and for anything punitive to be factored in decimates the value and benefit of the farm for the generation coming afterwards.  <\/p> <p>  Members should plough on with the legislation and I will tune in and make further contributions later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#E01400","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I will put a scenario to the Minister of State.

John went into long-term nursing home care in January 2015 because he got pneumonia in Christmas 2014.  Because the farm had not been signed over for the full five years in advance of John going into long-term nursing home care, Michael has had to pay the 7.5% per annum top-up that is required between that date and now.  The Minister of State is now saying that John, in order to ensure that Michael gets the relief set out in this legislation, must declare Michael as the successor.  However, Michael has been the successor and has been farming the land for the past 11 years.  If this is enshrined in law, I think it will be open to legal challenge.  This legislation could be struck down because it is unconstitutional that John is not in a position to declare anyone a legal successor because Michael has already been the legal successor of that holding for the past 11 years.

She transferred the farm to another son, who did not get the benefit of agricultural relief because he did not have the certificates.  He had to pay a full round of tax on the farm.  The mother ended up in a nursing home within 12 months of transferring the farm to the second son, and they have now been caught by the 7.5% per annum.  She has been in a nursing home for some time now.  The question arises, from when do the three years start running?  I still do not have clarification on that question.

The first response I will give is to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.  He raised his concerns on Second Stage and I have spoken to him in person.  The Deputy's concern is that by including a farm or business asset in the financial assessment at all, it could challenge the future viability of the farm or business as a productive asset that could provide an income for future generations.  The proposed amendment would fundamentally diverge from the fundamental principles of the legislation that has been in place since 2009.  This change proposes that the family home should be included in the financial assessment of the scheme but that the farm and the business assets would not be assessed at all.  It would introduce a clear unfairness that would make the scheme less equitable and more open to legal challenge.  It is not accepted that the productive assets are a class of assets that should receive unique treatment under the Act and that they should not be subject to any financial assessment for any period of time.  If that were the case, we could have somebody who just lives in a principal private residence, who might have a pension, for example, and who might want that to be excluded.  The whole premise of the fair deal scheme is to make access to nursing home as fair as possible.  To put it simply: the more you have, the more you pay; the less you have, the less you pay.  In this Bill, we are correcting the anomaly, in place since 2009, that anybody who has a small farm or a small business will be treated the same as somebody who just owns their own home, for example, or who has a private pension.  This is to respond to that anomaly.<\/p> <p>  There is no prohibition on leasing arrangements in the Bill.  However, assets that are leased will not be covered by the Bill, and both the value of these assets and the income derived from the leasing arrangements will be assessed as part of the financial assessment for the scheme on an ongoing basis.  The whole premise of what we are trying to do is to protect farm families, keep them intact and make sure that farms stay within those families.  What we have been told over many years - and what my officials were told - is that because the cap was not there, many farmers were afraid to enter nursing homes and were being treated differently from the people who avail of the scheme.  Let us call it the original scheme.  That is what we are trying to rectify.  The policy intent of this amendment is to protect farm families and businesses that will remain within the family as a source of employment and income into the future.  The policy would not be advanced if income from leasing arrangements were included in the cap.  That is where we are in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Some Deputies raised the issue of the cost if the assets are there for three, four or five years.  When a person's assets include land or property, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred.  This is an optional benefit of the scheme.  It is effectively a loan advance by the State which can be repaid at any time but which will ultimately fall due for repayment on the person's death.  It is called the nursing home loan scheme.  That is available to people as well.<\/p> <p>  As for the specifics raised by Deputies Naughten and Colm Burke, we will have to come back to them because there will always be individual cases that are not as straightforward.  The case Deputy Colm Burke raised is the third one I have heard of today, and I am aware of some as well.  If it is okay with the Deputies, we will refer back to them later.  I know Deputy Colm Burke is unsure about one issue and I probably have not given him a very clear answer.  If he leaves it with us, though, we will definitely come back to him on it if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#F00400","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Under the legislation as it stands, the person or person's care representative who is subject to the fair deal application support scheme or is being provided with financial assistance shall give notice in writing to the executive, of any material change in circumstances, no later than ten working days after the material change in circumstances has come to the knowledge of that person.

Sadly, we have all dealt with tragic farm accidents and someone could be on a life support machine for a period.  Surely, we cannot have people with this legal threat hanging over them.

I wish to speak to the principle of the three amendments in the context of section 21 because I do not want to come back in later and delay proceedings.<\/p> <p>  This is an issue about which I am very passionate.  There are a substantial number of vacant properties around the country in circumstances where older people have gone into long-term nursing home case.  I estimate that approximately 4,500 homes are left empty every year because people go into long-term nursing home care.  In the region of 400 of those are rented out.  This means that more than 4,000 homes are being left vacant each year.  Once a home is vacant, by the time it has gone through the whole process, namely, probate and being sold and refurbished, there is, on average, a six-year timeline.  As a result, up to 25,000 homes could potentially be locked out of the system at any one time.  These are homes in established communities where broadband is available, they are close to schools and the necessary infrastructure is already in place.  At the height of a housing crisis, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever not to treat the rental income from a family home in these circumstances in the same way as it is treated by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p> <p>  There is a perverse system laid out in the existing legislation whereby if such a home is rented out, a person will pay for it three times.  The capital value of that asset is paid for at 7.5% for the first three years.  On top of that, the rental income is considered a source of income and 80% of that is calculated as means.  If that rental income is lodged into the older person's bank account, that is considered capital on deposit and charged at 7.5% as well.  People are paying three times for a single asset when that kind of property is rented out.  The Department of Social Protection has a system for dealing with capital assets.  It either takes the capital value of the asset or the income that is generated from that asset into account, but not both.  In the situation to which I refer, both are taken into account.  This acts as an artificial barrier to the renting out of the homes in question.<\/p> <p>  I listened intently to some of the comments made by the Minister of State.  I have spoken to her privately on this matter and explained that I am not looking for special treatment.  All I am seeking is equity in the context of the system.  I know the argument has been made by some people in the Department of Health that an older person may be forced into a nursing home in the circumstances we are discussing because the family may want to rent out the property.  There is no significant financial incentive for a family to do that.  The incentive is that it ensures that the house will not require the substantial maintenance that would be required in the case of a vacant property.  There are many families who would love to see their former family homes providing accommodation for, perhaps, some of their relatives or neighbours.<\/p> <p>  It is disingenuous to say that an older person could be forced into long-term nursing home care.  As the Minister knows, under the fair deal scheme, a person can only be deemed eligible to require long-term nursing home care on the basis of an independent medical assessment.  Unless the Minister is suggesting that an independent medical assessment is flawed, then that safety net is already there.  This is a safety net which, believe it or not, is not present in the social welfare system and this has not caused a problem up to now.<\/p> <p>  I am looking for equitable treatment in the context of the renting out of these properties.  I am not seeking preferential treatment.  I want the properties in questions to be treated in the same way as they would be by the Department of Social Protection.  If the latter happens, there would no longer be a barrier to the renting out of these 25,000 or so family homes in established communities throughout the country at a time when we are in the midst of a housing crisis.<\/p> <p>  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il on 5 May.  He informed me that the Departments of Health and Housing, Local Government and Heritage are working together on developing the policy on the treatment of rental income and have agreed a process that is in train.  It seems that, in principle, the Government has accepted the argument I have been putting forward and that this committee put forward in the previous D&aacute;il at pre-legislative scrutiny stage, when it clearly stated that this anomaly needed to be addressed.  It seems, however, that we are not going to do it now and that we will do it at some point down the road.  It took approximately three years to get the Government to decide to bring forward the Bill.  It has taken a further three years for it to be published.  If it takes six years for this anomaly to be addressed, there will be more than 150,000 homes locked out of the housing market while we consider a solution to this problem.<\/p><p>That is not good enough.  It is abhorrent when we are in the middle of a housing crisis.

My amendment proposes that a report be produced on this issue and that it would come back to this committee at an early stage for a decision.  Deputy Denis Naughten has made many of the points in this regard already.  Some of us have been talking about this issue for years.  Its impact is really brought home to us at election time when we are going door to door.  We see many vacant houses where nobody is listed on the electoral register.  It is possible to see all the signs, such as an access ramp or a handrail outside a house, and know that the person who did live there has gone into a nursing home.  The result is a perfectly good house lying idle.  It makes no sense whatsoever from anybody&rsquo;s perspective.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the housing crisis it is madness for us to leave thousands of good-quality houses vacant simply because the Department has not been able to find a way of dealing with this situation equitably and fairly.  There are many ways this issue could be addressed and some suggestions have been made in this regard.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dea introduced a Private Members' Bill in the previous D&aacute;il.  It referred to the possibility of approved housing bodies, AHBs, taking over the management of houses in these circumstances.  The hard line taken by the Department on rental income being assessed against a person in the context of the fair deal scheme, resulting in a euro-for-euro loss, is crazy.  It is in nobody&rsquo;s interest to take that hard-line view of this situation.<\/p> <p>  We need some creative thinking in this regard.  We cannot defend houses lying idle.  They do not add anything to an area, because vacant houses can be broken into and there are also other issues regarding their management.  The main aspect, though, is the length of the housing lists and the great demand from local authorities and the public to find accommodation while thousands of houses are lying idle.  It is not possible to defend such a situation on any level.  My proposal, therefore, is that a report be produced and quickly brought back to this committee to enable us to examine how we will address this situation and what is the most effective way of doing it.  There is something to be said for the proposal made by Deputy O'Dea in respect of having an agency involved that could take over the responsibility for the management and letting of properties in these circumstances.<\/p> <p>  There are different ways of looking at this issue, but it makes no sense to do what we are doing now.  Strict rules across Europe apply to houses being left vacant.  We should be doing that here as well in respect of all vacant houses.  It should not be possible to leave houses lying vacant for any reason beyond six months.  There are many houses in circumstances like that now.  This is something the Minister of State can have direct control over.  Taking such an approach makes absolute sense.  In that context, I urge her as strongly as I possibly can to accede to this request from all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#J00300","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I re-emphasise the double whammy that exists in this regard.  This issue can be addressed when the financial assessment is being done under the auspices of the fair deal scheme.  It is simple enough to do.  We must find a way of doing it rather than stating we cannot do it.  I put it as bluntly as that.  In the cases of at least four vacant houses in rural areas of my parish, the families involved are paying the associated insurance costs, the standing charges for electricity supply and for oil to heat the houses.  Family members go into those houses to light fires over the winter to keep them habitable.  The houses in question are not being utilised, however.  That is wrong.  To describe what we are doing as an anomaly is being kind.  These situations should not be treated in this way.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Denis Naughten stated, when a property is being evaluated, it should be the case that a capped value is taken and a notional income devised in that regard or the rental income should be taken, but not both.  In these cases, we are taking money from the most vulnerable.  Returning to what Deputy Shortall said, this situation is resulting in many houses in towns and villages around the country being left empty.  It is costing people money to keep them repaired and inhabitable, while at the same time we are foostering around trying to find a solution.  The solution is very simple.  When a financial assessment is made, the fair deal scheme criteria should accept either the capital or rental value, but not both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#J00400","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Following on from what the three previous speakers said, I have advised people in recent years in situations where a family wanted to sell a house and the person in the nursing home agreed that it should be sold.  The 7.5% had already been deducted, however.  If the house was sold in those circumstances and the money lodged into a bank account, there would then be a further reassessment.  This means that there is a disincentive to sell houses and this must be examined.  I ask that this aspect be considered in the context of the legislation.  This situation is preventing families from selling houses in situations where they know that one member of the family will never use a house again.  They do not want to sell the house until the person concerned has passed away because a further penalty will be applied if they do.  This situation must be addressed to encourage people to sell off houses and ensure that people who do so are not penalised a second time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#J00500","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I speak in support of the general thrust of what has been said by previous speakers, including Deputy Colm Burke.

No impediments should be placed in the way of families wishing to rent out a house for a good purpose.  It would meet somebody else's housing requirements.  I refer to a situation where there is agreement among the members of a family, including the person in the nursing home.  Circumstances may arise where the person in a nursing home may not agree to sell a house but might agree to lease it or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  I strongly support addressing whatever issues may arise in this regard, insofar as we can, to allow the greatest possible utilisation of vacant houses, whether that concerns a house on a farm, one associated with a business or whatever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#J00600","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Deputy Denis Naughten&rsquo;s amendment was ruled out of order by the Bills Office.  I did not have any part in that.  I will address some of the Deputy's points and then will speak in general regarding Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s amendment, which will allow me to address almost all of the points that have been made.  When an asset includes an inherent and-or sale value and generates an income, it would be inequitable not to include both the value and the income in the assessment.  It is important to note that nursing homes support scheme contributions are not a tax.  They are a payment toward the cost of care for the person paying.  No one in the scheme will pay more than the cost of their own care and that situation must be recognised.<\/p> <p>  Turning to amendment No. 7 in the names of Deputies Shortall and Cian O'Callaghan, regarding an annual report concerning relief in respect of a farm or relevant business, I accept Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s contention that we need creative thinking in this regard.  She is dead right.  We have been doing much work in the Department on this aspect.  I will be introducing an urgent amendment regarding this matter on Report Stage to remove the present disincentive in the scheme regarding the sale of a home in respect of the three-year cap.  This amendment is being introduced in large part to address concerns about homes temporarily left vacant when their owners enter residential care.<\/p><p>There are two issues here.  They concern the sale of the home and the fact that if the home was sold while the person was in the nursing home, there was no cap and the 7.5% charge still applied.  Regarding the cap at three years, that amendment is ready and is with the Attorney General.  My team has been doing a significant amount of work on that.<\/p><p> As Deputy Naughten noted, this has been going on for three years.  I was anxious to get this Bill through.  We are working very closely on a second amendment, which will not be ready in time, regarding renting out homes.  The Department is continuing to engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on an agreed plan to develop a definitive policy position relating to the treatment of rental income.  It is a complex and intricate matter that requires considered analysis and research to avoid unintended consequences for residents.  The two Departments have been working on this for many years and have not managed to crack the nut.  I attended a meeting of a Cabinet sub-committee relating to this and how we can bring it forward.  I have genuine concerns, which must be dealt with before we can move it forward.  However, we are working really hard on it.<\/p><p> I have concerns relating to safeguarding, capacity issues and premature entry into nursing homes.  Approximately 70% of people in nursing homes have dementia.  The income of the average person in a nursing home is his or her State pension, which is &euro;248.30 per week.  We could say it is &euro;1,000 per month but if the house is rented out, the rental income could be between &euro;2,000 and &euro;2,500 per month with current prices.  Notwithstanding the safeguards that are in place, I am concerned that we could see people enter nursing homes prematurely.  However, I recognise the urgent issues around housing supply.  We all want to see people moving into empty houses.  <\/p><p> As I said, 37% of people who enter nursing homes stay for only six weeks.  The average length of stay in a nursing home is two and a half years.  We also have a lot of houses that are caught up in probate and wills relating to a person who might have died in a nursing home.  The Minister and I and as the Secretary General will have a high-level meeting next week.  We really want to move this matter along but that particular aspect will not be ready.  Otherwise this Bill, which we have been dealing with for three years, would be delayed for another six months.  <\/p><p> In respect of the Deputy's amendment, he is asking for a report after 12 months.  A report will be ready much sooner than that.  I can give assurances that the work involving recommendations relating to rental income will be done.  I expect it will be done well in advance of the timeline set out in the Deputy's amendment so I hope he will withdraw it.  We have already given a commitment to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and to the Taoiseach that this will be done within a six-month timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#J00700","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>We have lost sound.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#K00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Can the Chairman hear me?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#K00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#K00400","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>We are giving every consideration to Deputy O'Dea's Bill and have been interacting with him regarding approved housing bodies and rental.

If someone was widowed and had an adult dependant living at home, this is not taken into account.  From the data we have, my understanding is that we could be talking about 4,000 houses.  Not everybody will want to rent out his or her home but there could still be a significant number of houses that could be used to accommodate people.  We are hugely conscious of the housing issue and will continue to work on this.  I would be interested in hearing what Deputy Shortall has to say regarding her amendment.

The figure is not 150,000 houses.  That was a slip of the tongue.  It is 50,000 houses.  That is based on the figures provided to me by the HSE.  There are approximately 14,000 people in long-term nursing home care at any time who have an asset, of whom 4,000 have a spouse who would normally be resident in the home.  Some of those spouses may in long-term nursing home care and there may be other people residing in those homes.  The HSE conducted a survey of these properties in 2016.  I know getting the figures arising out of that survey is like finding out the third secret of Fatima.  The Minister of State has them and might publish and furnish them to the committee, which would be helpful.  Based on the figures available to me, up to 9,000 homes at any one time fall into this category.  This is 4,500 homes per year based on average nursing home stay of two years.  We are arguing about whether it is 50,000 or 25,000 homes.  The reality is that we are still talking about a large number of homes, particularly if it will take another six years to address this anomaly in the same way as it has taken a long time to deal with the current capital issue.<\/p> <p>  These homes are in established communities.  They are family homes in the main that are beside schools.  Infrastructure is already in place.  There is a clear commitment in the programme for Government to address the issue of vacant properties.  Here is the first litmus test for the Government with regard to this.  What we are talking about here is a treble tax.  I accept that this is a complex area.  I do not dispute that and I know the Minister of State may need time to bring forward a detailed amendment regarding how to deal with it.  All I am asking is that she does not discriminate against people.  She is saying it would be inequitable not to take the value of the home and income into account.  The Department of Social Protection makes payments to people based on a means assessment and what they need to meet their day-to-day income needs.  The Department is a social income support body and it is saying that it is wrong to take the capital and income into account and that only one should be taken into account.  Not only is the Minister of State taking both into account here, she is also charging for the money being lodged into the bank account.  A treble tax is being charged on people if they rent out.  I accept that this is a complex area and there is a need to bring forward detailed amendments but what I am asking for that the Minister of State clearly reflect in this legislation what is the law in the Department of Social Protection regarding means assessment, apply equity across the board and not raise a false and unjust barrier to people renting out their homes.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is bringing forward an amendment relating to selling the family home but she is undermining her own argument about people being forced into nursing home care.  In respect of an option for older people in long-term nursing home care who will not return home to either sell or rent out their home, I know it is a psychological issue but they do not want to give up their home.  What the Minister of State is doing is providing an incentive to sell the family home and a disincentive to rent it out.  This in itself will cause duress for older people and is an inequitable approach in terms of the forced sale versus the renting out of the family home.  I urge the Minister of State to reconsider the means assessment before Report Stage and come back with a further amendment.  She should at least ensure she does not put in place a barrier to the renting out of these properties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021063000002#K00600","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1625007600,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Deputy on a number of points.

One was that the cap would be included at three years on the sale of a house.  That is done.<\/p> <p>  The second part is much more complex.  I take on board that Deputy Shortall asked that we come forward within 12 months.  We will do it in a much shorter timeframe.  I am happy to meet the committee again to discuss this but it will not be in this particular legislation because we just do not have the time.  This is going to Report Stage on either 13 or 14 July and I will be bringing it to the Seanad after the D&aacute;il goes into recess.  It is important that this Bill goes through now and that amendment regarding the sale of the houses and the cap at three years will be included.<\/p> <p>  I will make one final point on the social protection means test and assessment under the fair deal scheme.  They have some similarities but they serve different purposes.  It is not desirable for the system to work in the exact same way.  I am just pointing out the specifics here.  Some 37% of people who enter nursing homes are only in a nursing home for six months.  The problem is that we do not have the data regarding how many houses are empty for six months or 12 months.  We just do not have it.  That is part of the problem and why it is so difficult to bring this forward.<\/p> <p>  As I said already, 70% of people already have capacity issues.  They have dementia in nursing homes.  We want to give them a voice and a choice.  Some people will never rent out their home.  Deputy O'Dea brought forward a proposal with regard to including approved housing bodies, AHB, and having a system in place where a person only rents out the house and can have access to it if he or she leaves the nursing home, which I know is unusual.

I agree with the points made by Deputy Naughten about using similar rules to the Department of Social Protection.  It also crossed my mind that there is an incredible contrast in the approach to rental income for people in nursing homes and the treatment of rental income for investment funds.  We need to get our priorities right in that regard.  There is, therefore, an element of small-mindedness about this and about going after every euro that a person earns.  That needs to be removed because we need to consider the bigger picture.<\/p> <p>  I welcome what the Minister of State said about the sale of houses.  It is disappointing, though, that she will not have anything ready with regard to rental income.  That is actually an easier issue to address.  I am not sure that the Minister of State's concerns about people coming under pressure to go into nursing homes are well founded given the fact there are tests in that regard as it is.  I do not believe there is any issue about those; they work fairly well.  If people are in nursing homes who should not be there, it is much more likely to be down to the fact that funding was not provided for home care.  Anyway, there are tests and they stand up reasonably well.<\/p> <p>  In light of what the Minister of State said, I am happy to withdraw the amendment now on the basis of expecting an update from her when we come back to deal with Report Stage of this Bill.

The changes to the scheme are complex and significant work needs to happen at operational level to ensure that the system works smoothly from day one of these changes coming into effect.<\/p> <p>  The recent cyberattack has had a significant effect on the HSE's capacity.  The attack impacted both the national nursing home support scheme office and the 15 national nursing home support offices.  I commend the excellent work of the nursing home support scheme's team and staff.  The HSE managed to put a manual processing system in place, ensuring that the attack did not affect funding releases to clients and patients and payments to private nursing homes.<\/p> <p>  A significant body of work is currently required to bring all systems up to date, however, while continuing to ensure there is no delay to dealing with the new applications or their processing.  The nursing home support scheme IT system is currently being rebuilt on new servers.  Once this is completed, significant testing will be required before the system is transferred to a live environment.
