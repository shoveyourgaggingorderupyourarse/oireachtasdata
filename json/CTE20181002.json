The reality is that a venture capital company is the bidder for one of the largest infrastructural projects this State has ever offered, and probably ever will offer.  I find it somewhat troubling that the Minister is still expressing absolute confident in an \"iterative\" procurement process, as he has described it in the past.  It has been through every machination.  We have seen some of the biggest companies, those which normally roll-out this kind of infrastructure, including Eir, the ESB, Vodafone, John Laing plc and SSE, and which are all household names and recognised for their capacity to roll-out this type of infrastructure, pull out of this process.  We are left with one venture capital company based in the United States which is now fronting up to deliver this infrastructure.  I hope it happens.  I do not want to pour cold water on the desire of the Minister to roll out this project.  I share his desire to see that happen.  However, I have serious reservations and concerns about a process that goes on for such a long time and the stated intention of which - to roll-out the service - has been delayed so many times, yet at the end of the process a venture capital company that is accustomed to taking high risks for high reward and which will suffer no real reputational loss if it does not work is the sole bidder.  My real concern is that the companies I have mentioned - ESB, Vodafone, Eir, SSE and John Laing plc - have departed the scene because they did not see a value proposition for them.  If that does not send a signal to the Minister and his Department that there is potentially something very wrong here, that leads to more questions.  The Minister now has an opportunity to explain to us why he believes we are still on track.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018100200002#N00300","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1538487000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>As I have said on numerous occasions in the House and at this committee, this is not a normal tender or procurement process.  I have explained that in detail.  This is a competitive dialogue procurement process.  It is unusual in an Irish context to have such a process.  It is unusual to have such a large project here.  A competitive dialogue procurement process is the only type of procurement that is available when one does not know what the final solution will be.  When this process started on 22 or 23 December 2016 we did not know what the final solution would be.  We did not know if there would be a wireless-based solution or fibre-based solution.  Three bidders suggested a fibre-based solution, and each has withdrawn at different times during this process, for one reason or another.<\/p><p>They have given their reasons.  They are all commercial companies and have to make their own decisions.  However, I am confident that this process will provide us with a bidder and a final solution that will deliver high-speed broadband to every home in Ireland.  That evaluation is ongoing.  I await the completion of that evaluation.

The Minister stated that the process was unusual.  The competitive dialogue was certainly unusual.  It could be well argued that it has delivered a rather unusual result.  All of the commercial companies I have mentioned which have such vast amount of experience in rolling out such infrastructure, Vodafone, ESB, SSE and John Lang, have fallen by the wayside.  The unusual result is that a venture capital company is now the sole bidder and the company charged with delivery.  If the Minister does not consider that an unusual result, he should.  It should create very considerable concern for the State, which has so much money and reputation tied up in this and which has responsibility for rolling out this broadband.  I know it will take time to establish whether this is the right decision, but grave concerns have been expressed by myself and others during this process.  It is incumbent on the Minister and to think very seriously about where he is going from here and whether there is the capacity to roll out this really important service within the expected timeline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018100200002#O00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1538487000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Several Deputies need to go to the D&aacute;il.

I will try to cover them as concisely as possible.  By the end of June, &euro;3.941 million had been spent under subhead A3.  The total Estimate was just over &euro;19 million.  What proportion of that has been spent on the national broadband plan?  Why has there been such a large underspend in that regard?  That is one question.<\/p> <p>  The Minister's answers on the broadband plan to date have been strange.  I am not sure how a Government can plan its functions and budgeting for the next several years without having some ballpark figures for what has been earmarked for this, that and the other under the capital plan.  How much is the Government budgeting for the national broadband plan?  The Minister has submitted some figures.  Surely to God the Minister for Finance has asked him to pencil in a range of figures for what is needed from the coming years' capital budgets to fund the national broadband plan.  Is it between &euro;250 million and &euro;500 million, between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion or between &euro;1 billion and  &euro;1.5 billion?  I do not know, but the taxpayer would like to know and, as a Member of Parliament, so would I.<\/p> <p>  There have not just been dropouts in this process.  The day that Eir was allowed to choose the richest 300,000 pickings out of 840,000 was one of the days when this process went under and got into trouble.  I said it to the Minister on the day of that press release.  I was being constructive.  My red lights were flashing and the Minister's should have been flashing too.  The Minister has followed this very closely.  I do not doubt that he wants to get broadband into every home in the country.  I do not doubt his sincerity.  However, I have said to him many times that this plan is in serious financial, legal and logistical trouble.  As Deputy Dooley stated, it is in the hands of venture capitalists.  Two venture capitalists are making mincemeat of the Department and the 80 officials involved, whether they are direct employees of the Department or were subcontracted to help with this.<\/p><p>One is the French owner of Eir, which was sold off by Deputy Dooley's party in 1999.  That was unfortunate because if we owned the infrastructure, as the ESB now owns its infrastructure, we would be in a completely different place.  We need to be in that place but we are not there.  Many right-wing commentators even starting to say it is where we should be, and that we should use infrastructure controlled by the State.   However, we are where we are.<\/p><p> I have believed for a long time that we are in serious trouble.  I want jobs to be created in rural areas.  I represent a rural constituency, as does the Minister, and I do not want people driving to Dublin every day when they could work in towns such as Timahoe, Coolrain, Camross, Mountrath and Rosenallis in County Laois and towns in County Offaly.  Are the costs accelerating?  Are the delays in announcing when the tendering process will be complete being caused by legal difficulties as we try to join up the impossible?  We are dealing with newcomers to the consortium now, people who have been in and out of the High Court more often than some barristers, such as Senator McDowell.  These people have the best legal advice, not just in this country but in the western world, and the Minister is up against the big guys here.  The State and the taxpayer will be casualties as might part of the rural broadband scheme.<\/p><p> Is the cost increasing because of the cherry-picking and because SIRO, ESB, Vodafone and several components of the Enet consortium have now jumped ship?  Are we not now in a much more precarious situation because of the dropouts?  We are caught between two venture capitalists - the owner of Eir and the owners of the Enet consortium, which is still in the bidding process.<\/p><p>  The cost to the Department is &euro;19 million.  Why is it so low?  What proportion is being spent on the broadband plan?  I hope the Minister does not tell me that the Government has not put in a ballpark figure for the capital expenditure on the NBP.  There has to be a range and some official, the Minister or his deputy must put a figure on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018100200002#O00400","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538487000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>The spend under subhead A3, ICT programmes, to the end of June was &euro;3.9 million.  The spend to the end of September was &euro;6.7 million, of which &euro;5.6 million related to the NBP.  The &euro;15 million that was allocated was for the national broadband plan.  The variation is due, in the main, to the lower than anticipated expenditure levels on the NBP, which reflected the stage and the complexity of the procurement process.  The variance also relates to the timing of payments relating to Eircode postcodes.  The significant aspect relates to the plan, and not just this year.  In previous years, there was also an underspend because procurement was a complicated process.<\/p> <p>  On funding, an initial stimulus allocation of &euro;275 million for the State-led intervention under the NBP is in the Government's six-year capital plan.  It was always acknowledged that further Exchequer funding would be needed over the lifetime of the plan.  Funding in principle of &euro;500 million from the European Investment Bank was announced in April for the plan and &euro;75 million was also committed under the European regional development fund.  Following discussions and subject to the completion of the assessment by my officials, and their presentation to me, there will be further engagement with the Department of Finance.<\/p><p>On Deputy Dooley's point, over the past five years &euro;2.75 billion has been invested in building our high-speed broadband networks across the country, the vast majority of which are a direct result of the national broadband plan and of people wanting to get ahead of the plan.  Deputy Stanley highlighted one aspect of that, but there are other companies.  Deputies Dooley and Stanley, in particular, have spoken to private telecoms companies, and I am sure Deputy Eamon Ryan has also, and it has been explained to them that the investment being put in here is not just in relation to market share in Ireland, but it is being used as a test bed for other parts of Europe because of our unique circumstances, our national broadband plan and the broadband task force which has facilitated the speedy deployment of infrastructure across the country.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, has assisted me with that.  There is no doubt that there is now a far more friendly and positive atmosphere to direct investment in this country.  There is direct engagement with a senior official in each local authority, which facilitates the roll-out of infrastructure, telecommunications and broadband infrastructure around the country.<\/p><p> I would say to Deputy Dooley that this is a unique project, and there is nowhere else we can compare this to because nowhere else has decided to bring this scale of speed of broadband to rural areas.  Nowhere else in Europe has the type of isolated rural communities and homes that we have here.  The objective and scale of this project are unique.

Over what period of time does the Minister expect the &euro;500 million from the EIB and the &euro;75 million from the EIF to be spent?<\/p> <p>  I think the Minister is nervous of this process.  If I was in his shoes and sitting in his seat, I would be nervous of it because of the precarious situation.  He said it was an unusual process.  It is the most unusual process I have ever heard of.  I am not an expert in commercial activity but I am around long enough, as are most people in this room, to know that if one is bidding for anything, or if one plans to build a house, a bungalow or an extension, one does not run with the first person to put in a bid.

That was strange, because one would think they would generate a lot of money from using their poles, but they could not have been clearer in saying that does not make any sense.  Why would there be two sets of poles?  They said it would be much better to use the ESB poles because they are connected to every house whereas the telephone poles are not.

I am not directly involved in this procurement process.  I am relaying the information I have received from the procurement team to the Deputy.  The bidder, Granahan McCourt, issued a statement on 18 September outlining the people involved in this bid and their role.  Any alteration to the make up of the consortium must go through an approval process within the Department and the procurement team.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator O'Reilly's questions about the preparatory work by councils, some councils are very good.  However, I think the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, would agree with me that we are disappointed with some local authorities.  We have been engaging with these local authorities.  It is important that every local authority is ready to roll this out.  The current roll-out with regard to the Eir network is happening across the country at the same time.  The same thing will happen with regard to the roll-out of this.  There will be timelines involved and targets to be achieved in the same way as Eir has had targets to meet.<\/p><p>At present, they have built out to 220,000 premises.  The recent data submitted by Eir to the Department indicates the company has passed 180,000 premises nationwide as part of the rural deployment.  However, the information received from Eir on its overall fibre deployment indicates that close to 220,000 premises have been passed throughout the country.  That is the current state of play.<\/p><p> Senator Joe O'Reilly asked me whether those on the final phase of the national broadband plan will be the poor relation in terms of speed.  In fact, the exact opposite is the case.  The standard delivery that we are looking at is 150 Mb of download speed and 100 Mb of upload speed.  A business would be able to avail of up to 1 Gbit of download speeds.  These are very significant numbers.  The reason is that at the start of this process the target for the definition of high-speed broadband was 30 Mbps.  As I have consistently said throughout this, what we did not want is a situation when we awarded the contract that we would have a technology that was obsolete.  That happened with the national broadband scheme previously.  If we had been looking for a 30 Mbps download speed it would effectively be obsolete by the time we would complete the build-out.  We have written into the procurement process that it must meet the changing demand.  As the committee will be aware, the European Commission is setting demands of a gigabit society.  We can accommodate this within the infrastructure that we are rolling out and we are determined to do that.  I think I have answered those questions.<\/p><p> Senator Joe O'Reilly asked me about setting year-by-year targets.  The draft NBP contract includes extensive governance and oversight mechanisms to ensure the efficient and effective roll-out of the network.  These measures include monitoring of build-out milestones and key performance indicators on both a time and deployment area basis.  Monitoring and reporting will occur monthly, quarterly and annually, a bit like the ongoing monitoring of the Eir contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018100200002#S00800","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538487000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Minister's predecessor, former Deputy Pat Rabbitte, talked about only people in caves not having some form of such things and then we got the celebrated cave tax, as was proposed.  If we are being honest about it, there is a very simple mechanism, which is to impose a sum per household regardless of whether they have a big yoke up on the wall or are looking at laptops around the house, however they are looking at this material.  It should be possible to extend it to bedrooms in hotels or something like that.  How many hotels would let rooms without making broadcasting available in them?  We know what the catchment area for the licence fee is.

I think the Minister's Department pays for the advertising on RT&Eacute; that tries to persuade people to buy their licences.

We will bring the director general before us and challenge her and her management team on what they are not achieving.<\/p><p>Undoubtedly the retort will be that they do not have the wherewithal to do it because politicians have sat on their hands and not grappled with the funding issue.  We took the challenge from the Minister.  He is good at giving us challenges and he has referred quite a lot to the committee.  We carried out a detailed piece of work.  We did not shy away from making tough enough recommendations that are not necessarily politically advantageous to any of us or to our parties but we did so in the best interests of public service broadcasting.<\/p><p> As are others, I am frustrated that it will continue to take another working group until quarter 1 or quarter 2 of next year.  Where is this going?  There was plenty of scope in the document provided by the committee to give the Minister the wherewithal to draft a memo and take it to the Government.  For some reason the Minister chose not to do this and he has passed it on to another committee.  That is disappointing.<\/p><p> This cannot be taken in isolation.  There is a real crisis here.  We do not have to get into the background of it.  I have my views on the way in which the Government is looking at this.  The Taoiseach, in particular, seems to be infatuated to some extent with the personalities and aura of money that revolves around the social media companies.  He is adept at getting selfies with the presidents of the various social media companies and we know his desire to promote himself through fake accounts or others on social media.  There is an important foundation that our State broadcaster provides in holding all of us to account in a really independent way.  It is an important cornerstone of our democracy.  It is under challenge and attack because of the way in which social media companies are developing and evolving.  They are getting the advertising spend and the eyeballs and, sadly, RT&Eacute;, TG4 and other broadcasters are not able to keep pace.  We really need action and no more procrastination.<\/p><p> Independent broadcasters, in particular independent radio broadcasters, that do excellent work and under their licence carry out public service broadcasting, have also been under significant attack as a result of the shift away from more mainstream media activity.  They also need support in developing public service content.  I appeal to the Minister to look at what support can be provided to them.  We published a Bill to assist local radio stations, in particular, and regional radio stations in the production of public service content through a mechanism similar to the sound and vision fund.  In an overall context, will the Minister look at providing the appropriate funding?  It really is important in terms of the preservation and protection of our democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018100200002#V00400","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538487000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Senator McDowell is right that &euro;52 billion is there.  It is part of what we are looking at, with regard to whether there is a far more effective way of collecting it, in terms of the broadcasting (amendment) Bill.  We will bring forward primary legislation on this issue.  The working group is specifically looking at how we could implement in practical terms some of these measures.  The Senator raised the issue of bedrooms in hotels.  If we look around the room we see four televisions.  Each colleague has a television in his or her office.  There are more than 1,000 televisions in Leinster House for a single TV licence.  It is very hard to justify this.  Many areas need to be examined with regard to how the television licence applies.  With regard to Senator McDowell's question on who funds advertising, it is funded by RT&Eacute; itself.<\/p> <p>  To answer Deputy Dooley, what we are trying to do is come up with how to implement it in practical terms.  If I came forward with a proposal that we could not implement on the ground, he would be the very one who would come in here and tell me he had told me so, that I would not be able to implement it and that I had got it wrong.<\/p><p>The working group, which comprises various Departments and agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners, will examine how we will implement this practically and maximise the return on television licence collections.<\/p><p> Senator McDowell is correct.  If a significant amount of money was raised, we could consider a reduction in the overall cost of the licence to consumers.  I am glad that the Senator has changed his approach to this matter.  Before the committee hearings, he was critical of the fact that people would have to pay for television licences for their second homes, perhaps in County Roscommon or elsewhere.  Instead of calls for incremental increases, there is the potential for a reduction in the overall licence fee once we determine how to implement this.<\/p><p> Deputy Dooley asked about local radio stations.  Through the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill and due to the important role that they play, we intend to reduce the fees that such stations pay to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  This will provide them with a financial benefit.  If anyone doubts the public service role that local radio plays, he or she should remember how, when electricity went out around the country during Storm Ophelia, the only way the emergency services and National Emergency Co-ordination Group could get messages out to the public was through local radio.  It was an effective tool, as were the national radio services provided by the private and public sectors.  We want to see that role acknowledged through the Bill.  We also want to provide bursaries for young journalists in the broadcasting sector.  My preference is to see those bursaries extended into print journalism, but we must start somewhere and this legislation provides for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018100200002#W00200","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538487000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Before the Minister gets away with what he just tried to do, he may recall that I indicated my concern that someone who, for instance, lived in Tallaght and had a caravan in Courtown was being asked by the Minister to pay for two television licences per annum.

On top of this, every purchaser of a new EV or second-hand EV registered since 1 January of this year will be entitled to a grant of up to &euro;600 to support the installation of a home charger.  We have also provided a grant of up to &euro;7,000 for the purchase of EVs as taxis, hackneys or limousines.  We have reduced the benefit-in-kind to 0% for battery EVs since the beginning of 2018 and they now attract a low tax rate.  The issue that is continually raised by, thankfully, rural colleagues is the charging network.  Additional significant money is being invested in the network this year and we intend to replicate or increase that next year.  We accept that the infrastructure built over the past number of years requires upgrade and modernisation, some of which we cannot even get spares for now.  There has been a time lag in this regard because of the decision of the CRU regarding the ESB's ownership of the network.  We now have a roadmap.  When I was in San Francisco three weeks ago, I met people from a company that is working on new technology that could help to extend the roll-out of EV charging points throughout the country.  This company is currently engaged with the ESB in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018100200002#X01600","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1538487000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>That is good news because I know from my engagement with people on the use of EVs that one of the greatest inhibitors is the bad experience of those who are using them because of the lack of charging points, particularly in suburban, rural and semi-rural areas.

There is need for a rethink in regard to the roll-out of this network and its rapid delivery.  Another issue which I have been pushing with the Department of Finance through Fianna F&aacute;il's negotiators from a budget perspective is the tax relief on the hybrid model.  I understand the Minister is a user.  The current relief expires this year but it needs to be rolled out for a further term.  There is little doubt that people have range anxiety and, like the Minister and others, distance issues in regard to the electric vehicle.  It is not a suitable mode of transport for many people owing to the current range.  To get people to move towards the hybrid model, the tax relief needs to be extended.  I am sure this has been identified by Department and it will continue to pursue it.  Hopefully, it will come to pass in the forthcoming budget.<\/p> <p>  As I said the greatest issue regarding the EVs is the roll-out of the fast-charging network, which when available will act as a good advertisement for moving to these vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018100200002#Y00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1538487000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>There are two cohorts of people.

For Deputy Dooley and I, an electric vehicle, because of range, is not suitable.  The hybrid model is the solution in this regard.  As stated by the Deputy, I drive a Toyota hybrid.

What measures is the Government taking to try to address the big problem of transport in general?  There are, of course, domestic vehicles but then there are also the large trucks.  There is a desire to try to move some of the commercial vehicles more towards compressed natural gas.  Looking at our public transport fleet, what can be done there?  A dreadful decision was taken recently to purchase 110 buses, I think, it was last year, in exactly the same format as before.  They are just diesel buses.  That was really regrettable and I know it is something the Minister has a strong view on.  What can he do from his Department to ensure that does not happen again and to try to promote a move away from petrol and diesel within the semi-State commercial area and in the commercial sector generally?  In addition, the whole area of heating needs to be looked at as a way of reducing our emissions.  I see there is some money for the deep retrofit programme under a pilot programme.  We have looked at our targets in the past and we have to ramp up the deep retrofits to get to where we would expect to be.  Forget about 2020.  We would really have to accelerate activity to get there even by 2030.

The big challenge for me at the moment is not actually more money.  It is to actively encourage people to carry out these upgrades now.  The other challenge is to get contractors to do it because many of the contractors are not prepared to get into this sector.  We are going to see a significant ramp-up in the next few years in the funding that is going to be available but it is important we have the capacity within the system to carry out the work and the demand as well.  What we have done with the warmer homes scheme is expanded the range of work that will be carried out.  It is extended now, effectively, to a deep retrofit.<\/p> <p>  We are wrapping homes with external wall insulation if they do not have cavity walls, doing the attics and looking at whether the windows and doors need replacing as well as the heating system.  We are talking about a significant investment.  It is free of charge to anyone in receipt of the fuel allowance, anyone long-term unemployed with children, anyone receiving the carer's allowance, where the carer is residing with the person being cared for and anyone receiving the domiciliary care allowance.  There is a significant amount of money there now.  It would really assist me if colleagues would encourage their own constituents to apply to the SEAI for that.  The application form is very simple and the SEAI takes it from there.  It is funded directly by my Department to provide this service to the public and I encourage people to do that.  That is based on the knowledge and understanding we have gained from the deep retrofit pilot here in Dublin. <\/p> <p>   On the issue of trucks and heavy goods vehicles, I do not disagree with Deputy Dooley's point on public transport.  As and from the middle of next year, all public transport vehicles purchased will be low emission vehicles.  That is set out in the national development plan.  In respect of the commercial semi-State sector, An Post has now announced it is transitioning its fleet to one that will be completely zero emissions in the next decade.  That is right across the country, starting initially inside the canals in Dublin over the next 18 months and then extending beyond.  The Garda has purchased electric vehicles as has the Defence Forces.  We are actively encouraging other State and semi-State bodies to do the same.  Electric vehicles can deal with some of the heavy goods vehicle demand.  In fact, we are launching a new electric light goods vehicle in Dublin tomorrow morning.  The other side of it then is compressed natural gas and biogas.<\/p><p>We hope we will be in a position to make an announcement soon regarding the supports for biomethane.  A paper on that, which would allow for Bio-CNG in the market is due.  It is operational in the Deputy's constituency.

I had to go to the D&aacute;il for Questions to the Taoiseach and am glad to come back in on this.  I have a few questions about energy.  How is the &euro;500 million climate fund being managed?  What are the timelines for spending it?  How does it fit into the budget process?  There is a risk that in response to just about everything the Minister asks for, the Minister for Finance will say that it will come from the climate fund.  How does that integrate with the standard budget process?<\/p> <p>  With regard to EVs, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Climate Action last week, the ESB said that we should have a public fund for fast-charging points in recognition that of the problem in this regard.  If two or three charging points are installed in car parks in every hospital, Garda station, library, council office, primary healthcare centre or Department building, there would be a significant network.  Most of the public car parking in Dublin city centre comprises public service car parking places.  We got a sense that approximately &euro;25 million would be needed for an immediate quick injection of charging points.  I am interested in whether the Minister is considering that.  How do we deal with the legacy investment?  We made an investment of approximately &euro;25 million ten years ago.  What happens to that?  Is it written off?  Is it just transferred to the ESB as its asset and the new CRU process continues?  <\/p> <p>  In respect of the deep retrofit programme, is it not time to make a switch and say that we will no longer do small jobs?  There is a risk that if we do a small job and come back five years later believing that we need a bigger job, it will be harder to do.  Perhaps the Minister would be correct to say at this point that the axe will fall and that from hereon, they will all be big jobs; with the financing securitised and the construction standardised in order that contractors can do 100 or 500 jobs.  Then we will get the contractors to engage.  Surely now is the time to do that.  The scale is so significant that it must involve retrofitting every house.  To make that happen, perhaps it is time to switch to deep retrofitting everything.  <\/p> <p>  Following on from the meeting of the joint committee last week, we were told by the Secretary General that in the next day or two, we would have a copy of the consultation paper the Minister is presenting on the national energy and climate plan.

The Deputy is right about a deep retrofit.  What we are trying to do now is move away from carrying out small works on homes to ramping up the warmer homes scheme.  We have also launched a pilot deep retrofit scheme for people who are not fuel poor to look at the type and scale of work that needs to be done on individual houses so that we have a template to ramp that up.  Significant capital funding is available through the national development plan to do that.<\/p> <p>  I have also been in discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, who has been engaging with his former colleagues and Teagasc with regard to how we could use the agricultural advisory network throughout the country to assist in encouraging people to carry out deep retrofits of their homes and upgrade them.  We have had some engagement with the EIB about funding to see whether we could put a structure in place that would encourage people to pay as they save in respect of energy.<\/p><p>Only last week, I wrote to all of the commercial banks asking them to look at bringing in incentives for people who carry out energy upgrades of their homes or who buy an electric or low-emission vehicle.

That is a significant step forward.  <\/p><p> The climate action fund was launched on 9 July.  Yesterday was the closing date and a total of 100 applications were received.  One of those applications is from An Post, which is considering rolling out charging points to post offices and where it has public car parking spaces in the State.  A number of those parking spaces are accessible to the public.  The intention is that the climate action fund will drive the agenda to roll out some of this infrastructure because the funding will come from motorists and that will be invested in the alternative infrastructure that is needed to drive innovation.  We require primary legislation to formally establish the fund.  The fund will be continually replenished over time.  It will be a separate fund that will be drawn down from through proposals and bids.  In the short term, the intention is to ensure we can start to invest immediately in the building and upgrading of infrastructure.  We have a comprehensive network but we need to upgrade it so that we cab gave timely repairs and more fast chargers available at locations.
