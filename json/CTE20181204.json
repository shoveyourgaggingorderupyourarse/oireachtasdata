This section amends 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Section 851A provides the basis for confidentiality of taxpayer information.  It also provides the basis for the circumstances in which such information can be disclosed by the Revenue Commissioners, including the limited circumstances in which such information can be disclosed to the Department of Finance.  The proposed amendment will address a conflict between the legislative provisions of section 851A and those of the Freedom of Information Act, which currently prevents the Department of Finance from providing records to the Office of the Information Commissioner even when it is statutorily required to do so in the context of the operation of the freedom of information legislation.<\/p> <p>  This change in law is necessitated by a specific issue which has arisen.  This issue arose during the course of a review of the freedom of information decision by the Information Commissioner which, in part, involved records which are taxpayer confidential.  Under the current provisions of section 851A, officials in the Department of Finance are precluded from providing these records to the Information Commissioner as to do so would constitute a criminal offence.  However, on the other hand, under the Freedom of Information Act, there is a statutory requirement to furnish this information to the Information Commissioner and failure to comply may constitute a criminal offence.  This results in a highly unsatisfactory legal position with conflicting legislative provisions and this prevents the Department from providing the records to the Information Commissioner as it wishes to do so.<\/p><p>The proposed amendment to section 851A should address this legislative conflict and remove the anomaly.  It will ensure that the requisite records can be provided to the Information Commissioner so that the commissioner can conduct a review and fulfil his statutory function without further delay.<\/p><p> Department of Finance officials had initially explored the possibility of including this amendment in this year's Finance Bill.  However, the Department was advised that the proposed amendment was inappropriate for inclusion in a money Bill given that it did not have money Bill status.  Therefore, it is necessary to use an alternative, such as this Bill, to bring forward the amendment.  Under the measure, the Department of Finance can receive confidential taxpayer information from the Revenue Commissioners solely for specific limited purposes, namely, in the context of policy formulation and in connection with state aid matters.  It is important to note that any Revenue officer or any person, including Department of Finance officials, to whom taxpayer information is disclosed and who knowingly provides to any person any taxpayer information or uses any taxpayer information otherwise than in the course of administering or enforcing the tax Acts shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to criminal sanction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120400002#B02400","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543932000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Do I take it that the information is provided by an official in the Department of Finance as opposed to the Revenue Commissioners?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120400002#C00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1543932000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance officials may have information relating to the tax status of a company.

This is to cover costs incurred by the OPW for the papal visit and an estimated additional spend of &euro;4 million on new works, alterations and additions for a number of projects including emergency work, ancillary works on energy retrofit projects, lift replacement programme, work on Leinster House and the Department of Justice and Equality rationalisation programme.<\/p> <p>  The main part of this Supplementary Estimate, at &euro;18 million, relates to costs of the work undertaken by the OPW on the visit of Pope Francis to Ireland.  On request from the Taoiseach's office earlier this year, the OPW fully committed to providing its resources to plan and assist in organising this event.  However, it should be noted that there were no funds allocated to the OPW within its 2018 Estimate for an event of this magnitude.  There was an understanding that additional funds would be provided on completion of the work by the OPW and I am here to request that the committee approves this Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  A number of queries arose at the last meeting regarding the procurement of goods and services for this event.  The first aspect that needs to be acknowledged is the extremely short timeframe from the date the Department of the Taoiseach requested the OPW to plan for this event to the actual date of the papal visit.  Hence, the OPW used a combination of tendering competitions where possible and existing multi-year frameworks for a number of contracts that had been put in place, together with the Office of Government Procurement for the decade of centenaries.  All suppliers on the existing framework had successfully been through the rigours of a public request for tender process and have to date fulfilled all obligations as laid out in their respective contracts.<\/p> <p>  At the last committee meeting, Deputies were very considerate and complimentary of the excellent work carried out by the OPW on this event.\u00a0 I would like to reiterate my thanks for the hard work the OPW put into ensuring that this event was carried out in a highly professional and effective manner.  To put into perspective the magnitude of the event, it was viewed by 1.1 million viewers from 159 countries, with 1,200 journalists from 31 countries accredited for the event.\u00a0 We, as Deputies, and our colleagues in government can be proud of how Ireland was portrayed nationally and internationally by this event.  Hence, it is my opinion that we should support <\/p> <p>  Before I conclude, I remind members that the OPW is consistently available to Government to respond to these large-scale infrastructural projects and will do everything in its power to obtain value for money in carrying out its function, which is a very wide remit spanning from flood risk to estate and heritage management.  I am happy to recommend this Supplementary Estimate for approval by the committee and to answer any questions that may arise.  We circulated answers to the questions put to us last week.  I have also circulated the figures required by the committee.  I am happy to take questions relating to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120400002#G00400","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1543932000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State but, unfortunately, the information came in very late.

The public would not do that for a similar private event by a political organisation, social movement or the organisers of a concert or football match.  In the cases of all those major events, the costs would be covered by the private organisation in question.  This raises a fundamental question about the relationship of church and State.  The public is made up of Catholics and non-Catholics, and everybody has their absolute right to practise their religion.  However, the public is being asked <i>en masse<\/i>to pay for a private religious event of one private religion, in this case the Catholic Church.

Some of this is quite complicated because there is so much detail involved, as the members can see from figures such as 2,916 stewards.  There are many queries, checks and cross-checks until we are satisfied that the invoices can be paid.  In some cases we are dealing with multiple small suppliers and the main contractor cannot invoice the Office of Public Works until it in turn is invoiced by multiple smaller suppliers, some of which are voluntary organisations.

First, we had to go out to tender for the gates.  This does not come about by just sending out a tender; there were different people involved in heritage issues from other Departments to look at how we would go about this.  The gates are a protected structure and are part of the Phoenix Park.  In order to get the gates properly in place for the event and afterwards, and for money to be spent on them, it is not just a case of repainting the gates and putting them back up.  I shall outline what goes along with that.  In taking the gates down originally, some stonework and pillars had to be removed.  They had to be rebuilt and put in place.  Steelwork had to be in place.  We also had to incur costs on tarmacadam and archaeologists because to put these gates back into place we were interfering with the road works.  Included in those costs are the collective costs in putting the gates back where they belong.  As members are aware, the park has won awards and gold medals recently and is vital to the people of Ireland.  It is hugely important to the people and we had an opportunity, when doing those gates and bringing them back, to put them into use again that will do for centuries to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120400002#K01700","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1543932000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>The two figures are &euro;244,025 to take down the gates and to put up temporary gates.

To go back to Deputy O'Brien's query, we have to accept that the witnesses will write in to us and explain the &euro;400,000, even though that should have been dealt with as part of the Estimate.  I am saying that to the Minister of State's colleagues as much as I am saying it to him.  On another occasion, if that were to happen, we might ask that we would not deal with the Estimate on the day we have it, and that we would come back again.  I believe in having all of the figures here but, on this occasion, we have spent two meetings at it and I certainly would not be satisfied that all of the information was here.  I ask the OPW to reply to the committee on that as soon as possible and to note that, in future, we expect all information to be provided early and previous to the meeting itself.<\/p> <p>  I raised the issue of Durrow Abbey with the Minister of State last week.

In the meantime, I am asking again for all of the information relative to that issue, including dates, times, facts and figures, dating back to the time when this was first discussed with the Arts for Peace project.  I intend to suggest to members, when I get that information, that we have a special meeting with the OPW, and to include the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, who was then Minister of State in the Department with Deputy Moran.  I want to put on record that I attended meetings with the OPW and officials and it was my understanding that we were discussing the surrender of the lease of Durrow Abbey back to the State for a figure.

We made the point in the D&aacute;il earlier during parliamentary questions that there seems to be no sanction for people who engage in a process to scam people, fraudulently secure money by false means, present false evidence to courts, lie under oath or view the system as an opportunity for scams.  In my role as spokesperson in this area, I will seek to ensure measures are put forward that oblige the Judiciary, the prosecution services and the investigative services to be as hard as possible on persons who are non-co-operative or who use the system in an abusive way to secure funds through fraudulent means or the pretence of being injured.

The effect of the amendment is to remove the discretion of the court as to what order it may make on what costs, if any, it will allow a claimant or respondent, taking into account the failure by the claimant or respondent to comply or submit in the manner specified in subsection (1).  It raises constitutional concerns because it would cut across the constitutional principle of the separation of powers and the discretion of the courts to make an order for costs.<\/p> <p>  Section 8(1) lists the circumstances under which the court can consider an adverse costs order: where the assessors have requested the claimant under section 23(1) to furnish additional information or documents relating to his or her claim for special damages and the claimant has not complied with the request; where the assessors have requested the respondent or respondents under section 23(2) to furnish additional information or documents and the respondent or respondents have not complied with the request; where the assessors have requested the claimant or respondent or respondents under section 23(4) to assist or co-operate with retained experts, and the claimant or respondent or respondents have not complied with that request; or where the assessor has requested the claimant to submit himself or herself to a medical examination arranged by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and the claimant has not submitted himself or herself to the medical examination.<\/p> <p>  The section provides that the court may order certain matters, taking into account the failure to comply or submit in the manner specified in subsection (1).   The word \"may\" in the section refers to the order a court may make on what costs, if any, it will allow a claimant or a respondent.  The making of an order is, and must remain, a discretionary matter for the judge.  The court must take the matters referred to in subsection (1) into account when deciding on whether to make an order.<\/p> <p>  When the general scheme of the Bill was published in June 2017, it was proposed under head 7 that a court shall have regard to the failure to respond to a request for further information, documents or medical reports in determining the admissibility of evidence in subsequent proceedings and that a court shall have regard to a failure to attend an independent medical examination in determining what medical evidence is admissible in the court case.  <\/p> <p>  The Bill was drafted in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, which was involved directly in the wording of the section.  It was decided that a proposal to limit a court's discretion as to the admissibility of evidence would raise constitutional issues because it would cut across the constitutional principle of the separation of powers.  It is the function of the court and the constitutional duty of a judge to hear all the available evidence, arrive at a decision on foot of that evidence and determine issues of liability and quantum.  Furthermore, the plaintiff has a right to tender evidence before the courts.  The court must retain discretion in any given case to ensure constitutional rights are vindicated and fair procedures are followed.  By providing for potential financial consequences to be applied for non-compliance with requests by PIAB assessors, the section, as drafted, should have the desired effect to change behaviour and encourage parties to adhere to the requirements set out in the Act.<\/p> <p>  For the reasons I outlined, I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment because I cannot support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018120400002#B00300","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948800,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I asked a question in the D&aacute;il earlier about the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy's, proposals to bring forward next year a constitutional referendum to allow for a cap on awards.

We were told at the time that the awards made in Ireland could not be compared with those made in other countries.  I would like an explanation as to why we cannot benchmark the awards made in Ireland across the norms.  We benchmark the cost of medicines in Ireland with the cost of the same medicines in OECD countries.  In the context of personal injuries, we would want to draw a comparison of awards in Ireland with those in common law jurisdictions.<\/p><p>I make this point because the awards made in our nearest neighbouring country, which has a similar legal system, are much lower.  For example, the award for whiplash in the UK is about &pound;4,000 compared with a figure of &euro;20,000.  I know that we have a problem when it comes to awards <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other countries.  I wonder at the reason for the great difference in the level of awards.  I would like to see an explanation in the review of the book of quantum as to how a particular figure is arrived at.  It is fine to publish the details as to what awards should be for various injuries, but there must be some broader assessment as to why a specific figure is arrived at as opposed to the arbitrary announcement that an amount should be paid out when a person suffers a personal injury.  The people as well as the Judiciary have a difficulty with the large disparity between awards across jurisdictions.<\/p><p>The book of quantum will be a discretionary tool for the Judiciary.  There needs to be research and analysis and a broad assessment of the figures that are awarded for specific injuries.  This is an important point and goes beyond the scope of this Bill.  The Judicial Council Bill 2017 is under consideration, which will in effect take its potential instructions from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, in terms of assessing awards.  I am led to believe that PIAB will assist the Judicial Council in assessing what should be the broad benchmark.

The proposed change contained in section 11 would remove the power of ICTU to nominate two people to the board and replace it with one nomination from Insurance Ireland and one nomination from the Central Bank.

Seeking expressions of interest for board appointments through the PAS process allows for appointments to be made from a greater number of potential candidates with the desired skill sets, which can vary over time, depending on the skills available to the board.  Board members are appointed as individuals by the Minister where, in the opinion of the Minister, they have the expertise in a field relevant to the board's functions.<\/p> <p>  The code of practice for the governance of State bodies published in 2016 provides that board members should have the appropriate skills and knowledge appropriate to the activities of the State body to enable them to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively.  The code of practice also requires that, in determining the criteria for board vacancies, the Minister consult the chairperson of the board to identify the appropriate and collective mix of experience, knowledge and skills required to oversee the board's performance of its functions successfully.  All applicants who meet the criteria may apply to PAS and be assessed.  Corporate governance standards require that the board members act in good faith and in the best interests of the State body.  The duty of the board member is owed to the agency and not to any specific stakeholder.<\/p> <p>  Under the Bill, it was proposed that five board positions would be filled through PAS, through open advertisement operated by PAS, which since 2014 has been responsible for putting in place an open, accessible, rigorous and transparent system to support Ministers in making appointments to State boards.<\/p> <p>  I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the current board consists of a Chairperson, the chief executive of PIAB, and nine ordinary members, of whom six are nominated by external bodies designated under legislation.

Trade union members are not the only people who slip and fall coming out of a shop.  Maybe there is a particular focus on employee and employer injuries but I believe that the PIAB is far more wide reaching.  The inclusion of ICTU and IBEC strikes me as a hangover from the days of social partnership, which the Minister mentioned.

The inclusion of ICTU and IBEC may no longer be appropriate but I am open to persuasion.  I remain unconvinced that we should continue with something just because we always did it like that.  Perhaps the board needs a different composition but I suggest that we do not make it too big or too prescriptive.

This money was collected for the purpose of assessing injury claims, as provided for under legislation, and for no other purpose.  Perhaps the reserve should go back to the policyholders who paid it in either directly or through their insurance premiums, which has already happened to an extent.  For example, the fixed fee for an assessment has reduced from &euro;1,500 in 2004 to &euro;600 currently for respondents and their insurers.  In addition, the Exchequer has been repaid a loan of &euro;5 million for set-up costs.

I am seeking a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;139 million for 2018.  Primarily, the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to fund the Christmas bonus for Vote 37 social assistance recipients.  The Christmas bonus will be paid this week.  For the first time in many years, it is being paid at 100%, which we all very much welcome.  It is being paid over the course of this week to approximately 1.2 million customers.  The bonus is a welcome contribution for people in receipt of long-term social welfare payments in the run-up to Christmas - because it finds its way into communities, local businesses and economies - and for families and individuals to allow them to prepare for the festive season, which is its overall aim.<\/p> <p>  The Christmas bonus is estimated to cost approximately &euro;266 million.  This cost is broken down into just over &euro;120 million for Vote 37 recipients and nearly &euro;146 million for Social Insurance Fund recipients.  The Social Insurance Fund is providing for the cost of the bonus being paid to people on contributory payments such as the State pension contributory, invalidity pension, and so on.  Accordingly, this element of the bonus does not impact in any way on this Supplementary Estimate application.  The Social Insurance Fund is in surplus this year.  In contrast, the bonus paid to people in receipt of payments from Voted schemes is met entirely by the Exchequer.  The bonus is not included in the original Estimates for the Department and, unless savings are made that will meet the entire cost, a Supplementary Estimate is required in order to ensure that the bonus will be paid.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman suggested at a previous meeting that it is difficult to compare like with like when comparing the original Estimate with the Supplementary Estimate because of the inclusion of the bonus in the outturn position for the relevant schemes.  For this reason, I have included an additional table, beginning at page 3 of the committee's brief, which shows the variance before the bonus is paid and the effect of the bonus on the outturn position.  I hope the committee finds this approach helpful.<\/p> <p>  The income from pay-related social insurance, PRSI, receipts during 2018 will result in a Social Insurance Fund income of an estimated &euro;10.6 billion.  This will be &euro;252 million or 2.4% ahead of profile for this year and will be &euro;793 million or 8.1% ahead of the position in 2017.  This position is a reflection of the continuing improvement in employment levels in the economy and continues the welcome trend that I presented to the committee here last year.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on Social Insurance Fund schemes and administration, including payment of the Christmas bonus, is expected to cost approximately &euro;9.5 billion.<\/p><p>This is &euro;187.6 million, or 2% above profile, and &euro;145.5 million of this is due to the payment of that Christmas bonus.  Even with the payment of the Christmas bonus to social insurance schemes, the surplus of the fund is still expected to be around &euro;1.1 billion at the end of 2018.  The accumulated surplus in the fund at the end of the year is estimated at &euro;2.32 billion.  While all of this is good news, and it is welcome to see the social insurance fund in such a healthy state, it is worth noting that the fund was also running a significant surplus of &euro;3.6 billion at the end of 2007, but that surplus was exhausted by 2010 when Exchequer subvention was again required because of the economic climate of the time.<\/p><p> The overall expenditure of the Department's schemes, services and administration in 2018 is expected to be &euro;20.33 billion and this will be &euro;320 million, or 1.6%, more than provided for in the original 2018 Revised Estimates.  As I mentioned earlier, &euro;266 million of this is due to payment of the Christmas bonus.  The total expenditure for the Department, which includes expenditure from the Vote and the social insurance fund, comprises overspends on some schemes and underspends on others.  For example, on the social insurance side there has been higher than anticipated expenditure on treatment benefits, which is very welcome, but lower than expected expenditure on invalidity pension.  On that Vote, there has been higher expenditure on administration and on illness and disability payments but lower expenditure on the working age employment supports.  When taken together, and excluding the Christmas bonus, the Department's expenditure on such schemes and services is expected to be &euro;54 million ahead of the profile, less than 0.3%.<\/p><p> The live register is expected to average at around 221,300 in 2018, a reduction of over 39,000 on the average for 2017.  Most of the estimated costs of paying the Christmas bonus of &euro;25 million to jobseekers is being offset by an underspend of over &euro;22 million in the jobseeker's allowance allocation.  The ongoing strong performance of the live register is evidence that growth is continuing and that more people are continuing to make the move into employment.  The live register is now well under 200,000, the first time it has been at that level in ten years and the CSO figures that came out this morning are welcome indeed.  We will continue to work with jobseekers to ensure they are adequately prepared to enter the workforce and can benefit from the recovering economy.<\/p><p> In 2018, the Supplementary Estimate referred to the committee and the briefings provided to committee members list the schemes for which additional sums are being sought, as well as some of our underspends.  We can go through the positions of individual schemes as required by members.  The amount of the Supplementary Estimate is derived by estimating the outturn across all voted schemes, which includes underspends on some schemes and overspends on others and adds in the cost of the Christmas bonus.  Nearly all the Department's expenditure is demand led and, as people apply for income supports when they meet particular circumstances such as ill health or unemployment or when they reach pension age, demographic trends, economic and societal changes and developments in the labour market all play a role in expenditure incurred by our Department.<\/p><p> Any estimate of expenditure for any scheme for the following year is published in December as part of our annualised Revised Estimates volume.  The individual Estimates are constructed on a scheme by scheme basis using data on trends in recipient numbers, average payment values and other relevant information that is available at the time the Estimate is calculated.  It is appropriate to note that the outturn position of the Department in the absence of the payments of the Christmas bonus would be &euro;20.7 billion, or just 0.3% above our original Estimates.  In this regard, I am satisfied that the Estimates process is working well.  It takes account of all key trends and expenditure patterns and provides an accurate picture of the following year's expenditure.  Trends can and do, however, change over the course of a year, resulting in expenditure being higher or lower than originally provided for.  The actual expenditure on most of our schemes can probably never be precisely predicted and the extent of an overspend or underspend only becomes fully apparent at the end of a year when the outturn of the year has been confirmed.<\/p><p> I hope my opening statement, along with the briefing material which I sent over yesterday, provides the necessary information to the committee and supports the reasons given for the Supplementary Estimate.  I am happy to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#B00200","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her opening statement.

I also welcome the 100% return of the Christmas bonus, which is made possible by the lower payouts under the jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit schemes thanks to the increase in the number of people working.  However, that is offset to some extent by increases in payments of illness benefit and so on.  There seems to have been a marked increase in payments under the different disability and illness headings and while I know that all of these things are demand led, I would like the Minister to comment on that.<\/p><p>On page six of the briefing note there is a payment of &euro;21.3 million for agency services.  I ask the Minister to outline what exactly is involved there.  I note that under the exceptional and urgent needs payments category, the number of such payments is 16,000 over profile, which is a significant number.  While that has been provided for, it indicates that the Department seriously underestimated the demands on that particular fund.  On the other hand, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is around<b><\/b>5,000 below profile.  I appreciate and accept that there have been some changes to that scheme around rates and so on but does the Minister have any plans to change or relax the rules?  I have been contacted by a significant number of people who are just on the margin and who do not qualify for the allowance.  There are 3,000 fewer people availing of the school meals scheme and I ask the Minister to explain that.  Spending on community employment is slightly below profile.  I made the point to the Minister in the D&aacute;il last week during Question Time that the rules relating to community employment, CE, schemes should be relaxed.  I do not say that because I want people to spend 12 years on a CE scheme but because some people in their mid to late 50s find it hard to get work and it would be better for them to be doing something.  Furthermore, sometimes it is easier to get a job when one is actually doing something.  On T&uacute;s, I note that the decline in numbers has been reversed and the reason for that is that in most of those community type schemes, increasingly T&uacute;s members are replacing CE participants.  <\/p><p>Spending on rent supplement is down by &euro;9.5 million.  Does the Minister have any figures for the corresponding increase in spending on the housing assistance payment, HAP?  I know that the latter payment comes from a different Department but it would be useful to have that data to get the total picture in this area.  The back to education allowance payments are 579 over profile.  A report was prepared in recent years on the back to education allowance scheme which indicated that it was not working particularly well and that the results were not very impressive.  On carers, I note that the Minister can make more than &euro;13 million in savings due to the fact that there are 1,300 fewer people qualifying for the carer's allowance.  The figure for the carer's support grant is approximately &euro;2,500, which is surprisingly high.  All of the statistics show that the number of carers in Ireland is gradually increasing.  What I detect from these figures is that because of the rules, a bigger percentage of people who are actually caring are not entitled to the carer's allowance or carer's benefit.  Certain changes have been recommended by the various organisations representing carers that would make quite a significant impact and introduce much needed flexibility into those schemes.  <\/p><p>The back to work family dividend payments are 541 below profile.  The working family payment, previously known as family income supplement, FIS, is just short of 3,000 below profile.  There were suggestions that a lot of people were not aware of their entitlement to FIS.<\/p><p>Has any action been taken by the Department to increase awareness of this scheme?<\/p><p> On illness benefit, I refer to the figures for disability allowance in particular.  Disability allowance is nearly &euro;2.4 million above what was anticipated.  Is there a proposal to employ additional medical assessors in the Department?  If so, how many and at what level and salary scale will they be employed?<\/p><p> I take it that the increase in treatment benefits is due to the extension of the benefit to those who are self employed.<\/p><p> On pensions, I noticed that the figure for non-contributory pensions is only up 3%, even taking the actual increase into account and it is something similar for contributory pensions.  Does the Minister have any actual figures on the extra number of pensioners we had to pay over and above last year and over and above the previous year?<\/p><p> Has the Minister studied the recent Supreme Court decision on pension entitlements for somebody who is incarcerated and what are the implications of that decision for the system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#D00200","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I welcome the Christmas bonus payout of &euro;266 million to 1.2 million needy people.  It has to be warmly welcomed.  It also has to be welcomed from the point of view of the injection of money it brings to local economies because I said it at a previous committee meeting - probably last year's Estimates - how important the Christmas bonus is for individuals and for the local economy because very few, if any of those people will be heading abroad to spend that money.  Every penny of that money will go directly into the local economy.  It is an invaluable injection into businesses and retailers at this time of year.<\/p> <p>  On the figures and community employment, CE, under heading A12, there is a massive underspend of &euro;7.2 million in 2018.  I went online today and I saw that there are 1,678 vacancies for CE places across the State.  I have said before that this is a serious problem and I will say it again.  I ask the Minister what her views are on why there are so many vacancies on CE schemes across the board.<\/p> <p>  On heading A31, which is the working family payment, again there is a really large fall in the spending for this.  Could the Minister give additional information on why exactly that is the case?  Has there been a fall in applications or has there been a serious change in people's circumstances which means that they are no longer entitled to the working family payment?  It would be useful if we could get that information.  I appreciate that the Minister might not have all of the information to hand today but it would be useful.<\/p> <p>  I refer to heading A32, which is on the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  Again, there is a fall in the number of recipients and the money being paid out for this allowance.  Given the increasing cost of sending a child back to school which is only going up, does the Minister have the actual number of applications that were refused to hand?  I know we have the numbers that were granted and I know that many people do apply and there are many criteria that have to be met.  Does the Minister have the exact figures for how many people have been refused?<\/p> <p>  I raised it with the Minister that there were a lot of delays in people getting payouts and I know she said that it was because people applied late but that is not the full reason there were late payments.<\/p><p>People were getting payouts in September and October when kids were long back at school.  There are problems there.  <\/p><p> The underspend on school meals is a little strange.  The Minister said it is due to a lower uptake from schools.  Is there an explanation for that?  Has she considered that?  Is there a reason schools are not drawing this money down?  It is badly needed and if there is a reason, that needs to be examined.  Will the Minister elaborate on that a bit? <\/p><p> Under subhead A2, administration non-pay, there is a sum of &euro;4.2 million for \"Office Equipment and External IT Services\".  Over the past few months, there have been major difficulties with the payout of illness benefit for many thousands of people and it transpired that there were problems with the IT system being rolled out by consultants.  Was some of that money for the roll-out of that system supposed to be for illness benefit or where are those figures to be found?  There are issues in this regard and the Minister said they related to the IT system.  Has that money been paid to consultants for the roll-out of that system, which caused massive difficulties for many people? <\/p><p> There is a reduction in the amount for rent supplement, which is understandable because people are being moved onto HAP.  That falls under a different Department but the intention is to ultimately move everyone off rent supplement onto HAP.  Is there a timeframe for that?  How many people have transferred from rent supplement to HAP?  There are difficulties with some landlords who refuse to sign the HAP lease.  That is putting people in serious difficulty because their rent supplement payment is being cut.  Claimants are being told their landlord has no choice, he has to sign HAP or the rent supplement will be cut.  Could the Minister give an overview of that?  There are concerns that there are higher standards for HAP, which is brilliant because a minority of landlords have been getting away with blue murder in respect of the conditions they have been providing through rent supplement.  Much of that goes back to local authorities that failed to carry out inspections.  Landlords do not want to go to the additional cost of having to carry out refurbishment and upgrade works to meet the HAP criteria.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could outline the figures in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#E00200","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":442,"content":"<p>The Christmas bonus is welcome.

It also gives them the opportunity to have a decent Christmas.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea's contribution was comprehensive and he went through most of the subheads so I will not add to that.  However, there are two figures in subhead A2, administration non-pay, which I would like the Minister to explain.  One is payments for agency services at an additional &euro;21.3 million.  That is a lot of money.  What was the original Estimate and what additionality did the Department get for the &euro;21.3 million?  Under the same subhead, there are allocations for training and development and incidental expenses.  There were savings of &euro;6 million under training and development   What had the Department intended to do and what training programmes were forgone to make that saving?  It is also a substantial figure.<\/p> <p>  Members referred to savings in the carer's allowance.  More and more people are presenting at our clinics seeking supports for caring for somebody, though I do not suggest everybody is eligible for the allowance.  However, while many of the target Estimates have been good, there has been a saving in this area and the figure is lower than the profile figure.<\/p><p>Could any of that be attributed to the time it takes to process those applications rather than the number of applicants?  Carer's allowance can take quite a period to be processed.  Rather than saying there are fewer people on it, are the savings more attributable to other factors?  The Minister knows what I am getting at and I ask her to comment on that.<\/p><p> As an example, the working family payment was lower than expected with 2,800 fewer people on it.  There was also a smaller number in receipt of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  This is a bugbear of mine.  Does the Minister future-proof existing schemes when she is doing her Estimates and budgets?  Are people falling out of some of the schemes from an eligibility point of view based on increases they might have received from the Minister or tax increases or whatever else?  Does the Department use future-proofing?  In our clinics we do not notice a significant reduction in people who are looking to join such schemes.

I have one further question.  This is a small point but it is interesting.  I refer to subhead A40, the grant to the Citizens Information Board, CIB, which made a small saving.  Despite the rationalisation, the budget year-on-year for 2018 versus 2017 is still up a couple of million euro.  Are there any efficiencies to be generated given that the Minister is no longer servicing 90 or so boards?  However, the savings are in areas where we might have expected to see pressure for increased spending.  There was an underspend of &euro;400,000 on the mortgage arrears services being provided by the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  Another &euro;100,000 was saved on Abhaile staff.

The first point relates to the step-up effect.  There is a bit of work to be done with regard to some other Departments in terms of changes that are made in the budget and the impacts of those changes.  In the main, there were increases.  If payments under any scheme increase by &euro;5 or &euro;3.20 or whatever it happens to be, then the qualifying conditions have to be cognisant of that.  One cannot suddenly no longer get access to a back to school allowance just because an increase has been provided.  That is called the step-up effect and that is reflected in the legislation.  Everything gets stepped up in line with the increases provided by the Department.  However, that is not true of some other Departments.  The Chairman and I have had conversations about medical cards and Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, and a body of work needs to be done in that regard, in particular in terms of positive changes that can be made to welfare payments.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons the CIB's budget has increased is it has been asked to provide additional services.  One of the Chairman's party colleagues was responsible for increasing the services provided to the deaf community.  I put in a few million euro more to ensure the CIB could through its funding streams give money to the organisations that provide additional signing services and additional access to information, and to increase the availability of the service on a daily basis to people in the deaf community.  That is very welcome.  I accept that there are some reductions in the anticipated spend on the CIB and it is because there is genuinely not the same requirement for them that we anticipated.  One can reflect on that and conclude that, thankfully, the number of people in long-term arrears on their mortgages are reducing.  That means we must now change and reflect the services to suit the needs of the people.  One of the changes that has been made in the past year is that to provide mentors to attend court sittings with people.  That is  positive and has been well received and we might further roll out that service.  Some of the Abhaile services and the work with PIPs in the community have not entirely fulfilled some people's expectations of getting a deal and providing them with a long-term route to deal with their longer-term debt.<\/p><p>It might be time to consider putting in place some internal performance improvement plans, PIPs, in that service to ensure they do not have to use vouchers, but the Chairman is right.  Some of the underspend is due to the fact that the number of people accessing the services is reducing.  It is time to examine those services and make small changes and tweaks so that we can help the people equally as well as we have done in recent years.<\/p><p> I will come back to the training shortly.  <\/p><p> On the administration, the original Estimate for 2018 was &euro;119,820,000.  The actual Estimate is &euro;141,141,000, so it is an increase of &euro;21,321,000.  That is to pay our agents who carry out the work on behalf of the Department.  To give some examples of that, An Post is paid for making scheme payments to customers and, thankfully, that is up this year.  I believe we are the largest customer and user of An Post, and long may that last, and its services with us have increased this year, which is very welcome.  Doctors are paid for certifying illness in respect of illness benefits and that figure is up this year, notwithstanding the difficulties we experienced.  They did not come from the certificates but there is an actual increase in the number of people making applications for illness benefit this year and therefore the doctors have to be paid.  I have the figures now if they are any good to the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#H00600","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Yes, please, for An Post.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#J00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I have told the Chairman a dirty lie; the figure for An Post is actually down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#J00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Now, Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#J00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

It is difficult to extend those subheads with 100% or even 99% accuracy.<\/p> <p>  Training savings of &euro;665,000 were incurred in this particular area.  That was primarily as a result of lower costs than were initially anticipated.  We got our training courses last year for less than what we thought we would have to pay.<\/p> <p>  With regard to additional information on learning and development, savings were incurred.  The Department has provided extensive training for all our staff in 2018.  To date, there have been 13,416 staff attendances at instructor-led classroom training, and 2,678 staff received this training in 2018.  There have been 2,447 e-learning modules and front-line serving training areas were completed in 2018.  Other internally delivered staff training outside the scope of these programmes was provided to 2,796 staff and another 1,799 staff received an externally delivered training programme.  The Department arranges approximately 100 one day learning courses across a range of subjects, and those are available to all our staff.  Those are the training and administration figures.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Joan Collins raised the issue of school meals, as did the other two Deputies.  Most, if not all, of our schemes are demand led.  We can put out an offer, as we did in this year's budget, to extend a hot school meals pilot scheme, which we hope to take on board at the beginning of next year, but we cannot make schools take up that offer.<\/p><p>A significant amount of additional money was provided, at a sitting of this committee at which I was present in October or November 2017, for the year 2018 but there was not the level of uptake that we expected for which there is a variety of reasons.  I would not have viewed the matter in the same way as the Deputy concerned who sounded  frustrated and wondered why schools would not avail of such a good scheme.  <\/p><p> We had an issue with one particular area.  I refer to instances where school meals were distributed by staff or volunteers who were over and above the staff in the school.  In the past year something happened to the provision of those staff members so schools could no longer deliver the school meals programme.  Thankfully, we have resolved the issue but it would have meant the non-delivery of school meals for a number of months in a small cluster of schools.  There are other schools where the staff are not available in the schools to take in meals and distribute them on a daily basis over and above the normal day-to-day running of the schools.  Again, we are trying to work with individual schools to break down whatever barriers exist that prevent schools from availing of the programme.  When we added the extra money last year, it was probably before we addressed the matter and we added people to the list thinking nobody would say \"No\".  Some schools have different issues.  We have to break down those barriers school by school because the barriers are not the same in each school.  Again, we are working with people.<\/p><p> Let me give the example of a school that has difficulties with the items listed on the school meals programme as suggested by Healthy Ireland in its health eating guidelines.  The school is a special needs school.  Some of the children will not eat what is listed on the school meals programme and, therefore, pulled out of the school.  We worked with the school and decided that we needed to be more flexible about recommendations.  We brought in a nutritionist and considered what should be provided to the children to ensure that we can continue to deliver.  Reasons vary in schools.  We have an incredible division located in Sligo that looks after the scheme and they are very proactive.  If there are issues, we visit the schools and work with them to make sure that we break down the issues, where we can, and bridge any gaps.  We are intent on ensuring that the school meals programme is fully up to spend.  We will also add the hot school meals pilot programme next year.  Please God it will go well and we can add another string to our bow in terms of school meals.  <\/p><p> In terms of the carers' allowance, there has not been a decrease in the number of people applying for the allowance.  I know it probably looks like there was a decrease.  Last year, we anticipated that more people would apply than applied because there had been an increase year-on-year.  For example, at the end of last October as many as 17,406 applications had been received and we received 20,852 last year.<\/p><p> There is a new carers' form planned.  Deputy Joan Collins suggested that it is a very difficult scheme to apply for and the Chairman suggested that one of the reasons for a reduction in the number of applicants is due to the process taking so long to complete.  My answer is no as the process took equally as long the year before and the year before that, unfortunately.  As a result we have worked very closely with the Carers' Association of Ireland in the past year and come up with a new application form.  As Deputy O'Dea will be aware, particularly with our work with the domiciliary care allowance and DCA Warriors in the past number of years, we have similar issues because it is a very similar scheme.  Obviously, one scheme is for adults while the other scheme is for children.  It was a difficult application to navigate and we did great work with the DCA Warriors.  The organisation and the parents helped us enormously to make the application a much simpler process.  We have done exactly the same work with the Carers' Association of Ireland and we will release a new form at the beginning of next year.  I hope that the new form will mean that far more people will be successful with their first application.  <\/p><p> To answer the question posed by Deputy O'Dea, we have a new recruitment campaign for medical assessors planned for January.  It is not just to extend the service.  A  number of medical assessors left over the course of the year and we got new replacements this year.  The new recruitment campaign will help us to continue and extend that employment recruitment drive.  We want to make sure that the application is as easy as possible and people give us all of the information.  The reason it takes a while to process applications is not that the qualifying, from a condition perspective, is onerous.  One must meet the conditions outlined in the means test, which are relatively simple.  Out of all of the schemes, they would have the highest conditions to reach.  One's income threshold and all of that kind of stuff on the carers' allowance would be much higher than some of our other schemes.  Due to the fact that people need to be medically assessed and the bar for a full and half carer's allowance - the threshold of the care that has been given has to be fully detailed and examined by medical assessors, which takes a little bit of time.<\/p><p>We all accept that it has taken too long, but I hope the new application form and the employment of additional medical assessors next year will bring a drastic reduction in the numbers.  I believe, and management share my view, that there is a need for more staff in that area, and we are awaiting staff arising from efficiencies in other areas to move into this area.  It will then benefit from a double whammy of getting the attention and new initiatives it deserves.  The annualised figures for the number of carers at the end of October 2018 were 78,681 an increase from 74,881 in the same period the year before.  The rate of increase has slowed down.<\/p><p> Deputy Carey raised the issue of treatment benefits.  We increased the allocation for treatment benefits this year and allowed both the self-employed and employees to claim under this scheme.  We expected the uptake to increase, but never to the level received.  This is good, as it means that people perceive this scheme as a genuine benefit.  When people think about their social insurance contribution, all they think about is the pension that comes when they reach 66 years, which in their case is donkey's years away.  We wish to instill the value of the social insurance contribution and treatment benefits are one clear way that resonates with the people and there has been a significant increase in the number of applications this year.<\/p><p> Deputies Brady and O'Dea raised the issue of the CE scheme.  There are 1,600 and odd vacancies on this programme.  The scheme is entirely different from T&uacute;s, the community work placement initiative.  Under T&uacute;s, the employment official in consultation with the unemployed person and with his or her co-operation send him or her on a T&uacute;s scheme whereas under the CE scheme, one has to apply for a place on the scheme.  People on the live register visit the Intreo office on a weekly basis and they choose to apply for the CE opportunities.<\/p><p> The number of people applying for places on a CE scheme is reducing for two reasons.  First, there are fewer people on the live register than there used to be so fewer people are available to apply for the scheme in the first instance.  Based on the contributions of the members who were of the view that JobPath was hampering people in applying for CE places, we allowed anybody who was on JobPath this summer to do both.  That has not resulted in a significant increase in the number of people applying for the CE programme from this summer.  The only factor I can put my finger on is that because there are jobs in the community, people are looking for full-time employment as opposed to work experience.  We work with all of our CE sponsor schemes which do tremendous work on a monthly basis and we try to improve their access to people and help them to advertise their positions<\/p><p>.  As unemployment numbers reduce, the number of positions on CE schemes should reduce by a percentage in line with the reduction in the live register because the CE programme is purely an activation model.  I do not subscribe to the fact that it is an activation model because a raft of people on community programmes are not there just to be trained to move on to the next job as they see what they do as a fulfilling and worthwhile activity.  Members share my view that this work is of significant value to our communities.  We need to reflect on that and change how it is viewed.  Sometimes it is more than just a work experience or training opportunity for people but the reasons the numbers are falling is that the unemployment figures are reducing and it is reflected in that.  The falling numbers is not due to anything we are doing differently in the Department, as the scheme is entirely demand-led.  The places are available because of the reflected numbers that we expected to be on the live register this year.  That number will reduce next year as the number on the live register comes down again.  Nobody is preventing anybody from applying for a place on a CE scheme anymore.  Anybody who is on the live register can apply to be on a scheme.  They are choosing not to and we will reflect on that.<\/p><p> The working family and the back to school allowance payments are demand-led schemes.  People are benefitting from the fact that the economy is recovering.<\/p><p>This relates to the back to school allowance as well.  Nothing has changed.  I view the changes in the back to school allowance and the working family payment as positive for those who receive these payments.  We introduced a disregard into the working family payment.  People who rely entirely on the working family payment to top up their incomes now have a weekly disregard for their rent payments.  Back to school payments for next year were increased significantly in the budget.  I know we have not finalised that yet.  Deputy O'Dea is right when he says that this increase reflects the fact that the cost of going to school is increasing.<br\/><br\/>The number of people who are accessing both of these schemes is a reflection of the fact that the economy is recovering.  Many people are moving into full-time employment at a level where they do not reach the means test, do not need the working family payment or do not qualify for the back to school allowance anymore.  The number of new applications for the working family payment received so far this year - the figure was 23,803 at the end of October - is relatively similar to last year's number.  I have mentioned the introduction of the disregard.  It is a good thing that the numbers are slowly decreasing.  It is not something to be worried about.  As I have said, this will always be a demand-led scheme.  I want to be able to allow people who are currently on the scheme to earn more and to take home more of the money they are actually earning.  I hope this will incentivise and encourage them to earn more and keep more of their own money.  The scheme will always be led by demand.  If there is an increase in the need for the scheme next year, we will respond to that.<br\/><br\/>I have spoken about school meals.  I will come back to illness benefit in a second.  Deputy Brady mentioned the overspend of &euro;4.2 million under the heading of Office Equipment and External IT Services.  Our list of ongoing schemes is continuing to grow.  Every time I introduce a new scheme, I have to get into the queue to get an entirely new platform developed.  Thankfully, we are introducing new schemes.  We introduced the paid parental leave and the self-employed jobseeker's schemes this year.  These brand new schemes need brand new IT platforms.  We are investing in our online digital services.  We are about to go live with <i>mywelfare.ie<\/i>, which is a new and hugely positive method of interacting with the Department.  It is so user-friendly that even I am totally impressed by it.  This new system is incredibly easy to use.  We have 6,000 staff and 70 schemes.  This means that our IT platforms are constantly being upgraded and new systems are constantly coming on board.  The only difficulty we have as a society, a country or an economy at the moment is that there are so few software developers on the Government procurement list.  They are all busy.  They are already doing stuff for all the other Departments.  This will probably slow down our ability to deliver on some of the new schemes we would like to deliver on.  It is possibly something that needs to be looked at.  That accounts for the &euro;4.2 million overspend.<br\/><br\/>I think Deputy Brady is under the impression that there is a programme to move people off rent supplement and onto HAP.  I say that because I am making an assumption.  I hope I am wrong.  No one in the Department is working off a list with a target of getting 100 people off rent supplement.  Rent supplement is a short-term measure to bridge a gap in the housing need of a family or couple.  The State has to make sure it provides long-term sustainable solutions for people.  Ideally, we would like to see people not being on rent supplement for any more than about a year.  That has not been the reality in recent years because we have given people rent supplement for more than 12 months.  It was always intended to be a short-term stop for people as they come in and out of need.  Over recent years, HAP has been introduced, there has been a move away from RAS and a long-term requirement for HAP leases to be five or ten years has been introduced.  As a result, people have moved gradually from rent supplement to HAP.  There is no agenda of getting officials to hurry through a list of 10,000 people.  It will happen as people come.  Therefore, I am disappointed to hear from the Deputy that people are being told they will lose their RAS if they do not take up HAP.  It is definitely not coming from the Department.  People will get RAS for as long as they need it.  Rent supplement is provided because there is a need for it.  When somebody moves onto HAP or into a social house, or wins the lotto and buys his or her own house, he or she will come off rent supplement because it is no longer required.  Nobody is actively pushing people off rent supplement.  All of our schemes are led by demand.  If someone has a need and the conditions apply to him or her, he or she will get what comes from the Department.  There is nobody telling that person that he or she should or should not be here.<\/p><p>I have just been given the figures.  At the end of October, we had 25,654 people on rent supplement, 19,196 people on RAS through the local authorities and 41,693 people on HAP.  I might be wrong, but I think the Deputy is asking how many people came off rent supplement and went onto HAP.  Is that what he is asking?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#J01300","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#N00200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I do not have that figure with me, but I will come back to the Deputy with it.

The Department will need to correspond with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I will get back to the Deputy.  Again, nobody is pushing anybody out the door.<\/p><p>We are recruiting medical assessors to work across a number of schemes, including the illness benefit scheme.<\/p><p>Deputy O'Dea asked about the FIS or working family payment awareness scheme.  We have a new interactive platform for engaging with our clients, customers or citizens.  There is a conversation that I would love to have around this table one day.  I am going off script slightly at the moment, not that I have a script.  I am going off on a tangent.  Every time we announce something, we get a barrage of responses from people asking why we have a &quot;customer&quot; charter.  We decided to draw up the charter a number of years ago because we wanted to provide the most excellent level of customer service.  That irks people because they are not really customers.  Then we called them &quot;clients&quot;, but they are not really clients.  We cannot call them &quot;citizens&quot; because we look after many people who are not citizens.  I am not sure what the correct language is.  Someone told me one day that I should just call them &quot;people&quot;, but sometimes that does not quite fit into what I am talking about.  I would love some advice on this.  The last thing we want to do is to upset somebody by saying &quot;citizens&quot; when we look after people who are not citizens or by saying &quot;customers&quot; when they are not really customers.  If I could get some advice on this issue, that would be deadly.  Similarly, it was noted this week that some people do not like the idea of us calling the Christmas bonus a &quot;Christmas&quot; bonus.  It was suggested that we should think about calling it something else.  We are all gone very politically correct lately.<\/p><p>We are making people aware of the new <i>mygovid.ie<\/i>and <i>mywelfare.ie<\/i>platforms, which are very interactive.  All of our people in the Intreo offices and all of our front-line staff are well aware of the conditions around FIS.  The idea behind FIS when it was introduced a number of years ago was to try to encourage people who depend entirely on welfare to go out, take a chance and try to do work.  We were trying to give them comfort that they would not lose the supports they previously enjoyed.  We are trying to make sure the transition period is well supported by the Departments of Health and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  That is what is there.  We are consistently trying to help people to get into employment.  We are certainly not shy about telling people that FIS is there.  The new &euro;95 disregard for rent payments will certainly be well advertised in all of our offices next year.  It is not something that we are keeping secret.  I genuinely believe that it is because people's fortunes are improving that these schemes are not required anymore.<\/p><p>I have covered the issues of community employment, school meals, back to school payments and agencies.<\/p><p>I have not yet responded to Deputy O'Dea's question about the court ruling during the week which deemed that our withholding of contributory pension payments to a particular gentleman under section 249 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 was unconstitutional.  The report from the court is very lengthy.  We are probably still assimilating it without jumping to any conclusions.  I know what my gut is telling me to do, but obviously I have to get some advice before I can do that.  The Attorney General has the report.  I expect to have a meeting before the end of this week, or early next week, at which a final decision can be made.  The Deputy is well aware that this is not something that can be put on the long finger.  We need to decide soon whether we are going to appeal or make alternative arrangements.  I will be looking for the co-operation of all parties in the House when the time comes to rectify the position we currently find ourselves in.  Even if it is not of our making - I hope it is not - it is not very satisfactory.<\/p><p>The final point I would like to make in response to Deputy O'Dea relates to pensions.  He was looking for the actual numbers for the year-on-year increases.  This year, an additional 17,300 people are receiving the contributory State pension, an additional 500 people are receiving the contributory widow's pension and an additional 130 people are receiving the non-contributory State pension.<\/p><p>The total pensions additional this year are 17,930.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#N00300","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Which brings the total to what?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#O00200","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I do not have that figure.
