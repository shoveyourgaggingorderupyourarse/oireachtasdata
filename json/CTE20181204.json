It represents the interests of over 150 food, drink and non-food grocery manufacturers and suppliers.  We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee and acknowledge the committee's ongoing focus on Brexit as it impacts on agrifood.  Our submission to the committee on Brexit should be read in conjunction with the submissions from fellow IBEC associations such as the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, which is present today, Dairy Industry Ireland and Meat Industry Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Looking first at trade flows, there has been a very strong food and drink performance in 2017 that saw overall exports increase by 11% to just over &euro;12 billion.  Within these numbers, the UK is our largest single export market.  The export exposure of the various sectors within agrifood to the UK is thus high and includes beef at 51%, dairy at 24% - within that, half of all cheese exports go to the UK - and prepared consumer foods at 62%.  In addition to absolute exposure, there are several other factors of note.  While the UK as a percentage of our overall exports has dropped in recent years and now stands at 35%, in value terms it continues to increase and now stands at &euro;4.5 billion, which is a 32% increase since 2010.  This demonstrates the importance in the medium to long term of maintaining our market position in this high-value, high-quality market that currently has a substantial food deficit.  In value terms, Irish exposure is like that of other large exporters to the UK and it is not surprising that they are geographically close by as well.  I refer to countries like France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and Italy.  However, in percentage terms it is four to five times higher.  Typically, for those other countries, less than 10% of their agrifood exports are to UK.  This clearly highlights the unique circumstances faced by Irish agrifood and the need for exceptional mitigation measures.  It also is worth noting that total agrifood trade flows between the EU 27 and the UK are &euro;46 billion, with approximately &euro;35 billion into the UK and the balance coming out of the UK.  While a no-deal scenario next March will result in extensive disruption and product displacement, a future trading relationship that contains non-tariff barriers also may impact negatively on supply chains.  Therefore, the objective must be a trading environment that is as frictionless as possible. <br\/><br\/>Looking initially at a no-deal scenario, in the event of such an outcome, WTO most-favoured nation, MFN, tariffs could increase Irish and other EU food and drink export prices to the UK significantly after 29 March 2019.  Higher trade prices will therefore cause export volumes from the EU to the UK to drop significantly.  The disruptive impact of this possibility, combined with further currency turbulence and likely gridlock at ports, must be avoided for the sake of Irish agrifood.  Even if this scenario is avoided, there will still be many important issues to consider in the future trading relationship. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Turning to trade and customs challenges, the UK is a member of the Single Market and the customs union at present and it applies the EU common external tariff and trade policy  If any or all of these things change, there will be an impact on trade and customs.  No third country has a customs-free border with the EU.  We acknowledge the relatively low level of customs checks currently, which results from pre-authorisation of traders, advance lodgement of declarations and an extensive system of post-clearance checks.  However, a key objective in negotiating the future trading relationship with the UK must be to minimise even further the trade cost impact of custom checks by ensuring a customs relationship with as little friction as possible.  The alternative is embedding additional trade costs into the business model of Irish agrifood exporters.  There would be a large question mark over our ability to recover those costs in the marketplace.<br\/><br\/>The other big issue for us is regulatory divergence.  Food products, particularly those of animal origin, face additional veterinary checks as well as customs controls.  There are over 2,000 EU laws affecting agrifood and this body of law is highly dynamic.  This dynamism is not just related to new legislation but also to reviews and recasts of existing regulations and directives such as, for example, the recast of the renewable energy directive, RED II, which can see substantial changes to the law.  In addition, in agrifood, food safety incidents such as the recent fipronil residues in eggs issue can often result in a policy or regulatory response or both.  Finding the right approach to managing regulatory divergence of food standards between the EU and UK will be essential for maintaining future trade as frictionlessly as possible.  This will require establishing a mechanism that will allow EU and UK food standards under the scope of veterinary legislation, as well as under food law in general to remain as closely aligned as possible; a mutually acceptable food inspection system regarding imports from third countries; and a continued close relationship between the UK and the European Food Safety Agency, EFSA, which is key to continued future alignment of food standards.<\/p><p>The objective must be to continue joint risk assessments with a common database to minimise divergence in standards and avoid trade impediments, and to reach an agreement on common rules on key drinks-related regulations which my colleagues will touch on in detail later.  Our submission also refers to a number of technical issues, rules of origin, inward and outward processing relief and the land bridge.  These are all critical and key issues which will need to be considered from an Irish agrifood perspective as they will have a major bearing on the future trading relationship.<\/p><p> The measures required by industry to respond to Brexit can be summarised as follows: a transition period of sufficient duration; a comprehensive and frictionless future trading relationship; regulatory convergence, not regulatory divergence; and additional support measures for agrifood, particularly in the areas of exceptional state aid supports, market diversification and market access.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear today and would welcome any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018120400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543942200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland is also part of IBEC and we represent drinks manufacturers and distributors within the State.  Unusually within IBEC, we are an all-Ireland trade body and we also represent member companies in the North of Ireland, with a total of 48 companies.  The ABFI comprises five category trade associations looking after category-specific issues, including the Irish Brewers Association and associations for cider, spirits, whiskey and wine.<\/p> <p>  The Irish drinks industry operates on an integrated all-island basis with a particularly entwined sector in terms of production processes and supply chains.  We have three cross-Border geographic indications, which means Irish whiskey, Irish Cream and poteen are protected by the EU in a similar manner to champagne in that they can only be made on the island of Ireland.  We had four distilleries in 2014 but, following much investment, we now have 21 operational distilleries with another becoming operational in the coming weeks and a further 26 in planning.  That global protection means the investment is much stronger.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing a rise in fake products being sold in third markets along with the rise of Irish whiskey as the fastest growing spirits category in the world.  It was welcome to see in the withdrawal agreement that this protection will be replicated by the UK because we will rely on both jurisdictions to help us enforce that.  Members will have received our position paper with the title, Brexit and the Irish drinks industry, in which we focus on future priorities and the future relationship.  It is premised on the presumption that we will end up with an agreement rather than a no-deal scenario.<\/p> <p>  Some &euro;1.6 billion of drinks products were exported from the island of Ireland in 2017, with &euro;1.2 billion coming from this State.  According to the Central Statistics Office, the aggregate value of trade in drinks products between the UK and Ireland in 2017 was &euro;364 million, one third of which, &euro;121 million, was the aggregate value of North-South trade.  The spirits sector is a very big part of the economy of the North of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The integrity of glass is essential for our products from a food safety perspective and more than 130 million glass bottles are imported into the State from the UK every year.  In the event of no deal, tariffs would apply to these imports.  Businesses are stockpiling, which means there are already shortages in core products.  We physically cross the Border with more than 23,000 truck movements annually, over 5,000 of which are alcohol tanker movements with products made in one jurisdiction and bottled in another.  The growth brought about by investment in the industry means we are using bottling sites across the country.<\/p> <p>  We are watching the vote in the House of Commons very closely and we have been liaising directly with the British Government and representatives of our Northern Irish members.  While not perfect, the withdrawal agreement represents the best possible approach to Brexit and we are strongly of the view that no deal would be seriously damaging to the Irish and UK economies, including the all-island drinks industry.  The potential consequences include the lack of continuity in legal protection for Irish cross-Border geographic indicators in the UK; immediate tariffs on cream, barley, malt, glass bottles, apples, finished cider and other supply chain inputs; and regulatory and custom checks at the Irish Border leading to additional delays and costs, with each one-hour delay for a truck costing &euro;100.  There will also be a requirement for upfront VAT payments at point of entry on cross-Border trade, which would have massive cashflow implications for business.  We currently have a very sophisticated excise control movement around the EU and if the UK does not replicate that, it poses very serious challenges as we are required to pay excise as we cross borders and face physical checks.  We would also see regulatory divergence across a range of standards, from labelling to bottle sizes.  The benefit of being in the EU Single Market is that those costs are reduced for businesses.<\/p> <p>  The adoption of the withdrawal agreement, therefore, represents the surest way to avoid these impacts.  The Government and State agencies have done a great job and members in the North have had nowhere near the amount of supports, education, awareness and proactivity that members here have received from the likes of Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners and InterTrade Ireland.  With historical listings in the European Investment Bank, distilleries and spirit producers have so far not been able to access the Brexit loan schemes the Government introduced.  The application last year was completely prohibited because European investment funding was involved and the spirits category is blacklisted for this purpose.  We understand the Government is working very hard to ensure its future growth loan schemes and the scheme announced in this year's budget will be available to members.  We look forward to a satisfactory resolution of this issue.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has benefited greatly from access to EU-backed free trade agreements globally.  Scotch whisky is a key element of these agreements because so much is exported and it is very important for putting the drinks sector at the heart of its many agreements.  Once outside the agreements, however, Irish whiskey and Irish cream will be the second and third biggest exports in this sector.  We need to work very hard to ensure the EU continues to prioritise us in free trade agreements.  The recent EU agreement with Canada abolished outstanding tariffs on Irish cream liqueur and Irish gin.  All alcohol is bought by the state in Canada and specific tenders have been issued, meaning many of our smaller members, such as in the Irish gin sector, are being listed.  It is a fantastic boost to them and it is working really well for us.  We are positive about global trade agreements and have been inputting with European colleagues into potential free trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam and the Mercosur bloc, all of which is very positive.  We are in 140 markets globally but we want to expand that number.<\/p> <p>  Free trade agreements, on their own, do not increase exports.  We also need to upskill our companies.  In our industry, cider has the greatest exposure to the UK, with 85% of all cider exports going to the UK in 2017 according to CSO export volume figures, compared to 71% for beer.  They are the two areas on which we need to focus for product diversification into new markets and this needs to be done with direct supports, such as participation in trade shows, and the provision of sales and marketing staff in international markets.  Having feet on the ground and having global brand ambassadors are essential for growing brands and we would like to see more investment by the Government in these areas.<\/p> <p>  We would also like more effective and robust market intelligence, not only in the area of the demographics of countries but into what our competitors are doing and where opportunities may lie.  The State can certainly assist us with this.  Category promotion, in the form of trade missions, is absolutely vital and a drinks element needs to be built into every trade mission on which a Minister goes.  <\/p> <p>  While free trade is often primarily viewed as a matter of tariffs, the issue of technical barriers to trade is equally important.  One of the key areas in the EU where there has been harmonisation is around labelling but, recently, the Government has sought to introduce a barrier to trade and has, indeed, created regulatory divergence on this island, North and South, with country only labels for Ireland under the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018.  This measure will deter small beer, cider, wine and spirits producers from exporting to Ireland, including the Northern Irish gin producers for whom Ireland is one of their major markets.<\/p><p>The costs will be substantial.  It is important to look at that and implement it in as practical a way as possible.  We have asked the Minister for Health to establish an implementation group and would welcome the committee's support in that regard.  I thank the members for the opportunity to make the submission.  We look forward to answering any questions members have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018120400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Callan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543942200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses very much for their very useful presentations on technical matters and tariffs in the context of what the cost of Brexit is likely to be.

How do companies working cross-Border in two separate currency jurisdictions work so well from an export point of view?

From our perspective, we need to address both.  I take the point that there is a huge level of uncertainty and that things are changing on a daily basis, in particular in Westminster.  What was agreed in Brussels recently was twofold.  There was a withdrawal deal and a political declaration on the future trading relationship.  They are going to get to that and it will hopefully be relatively soon but it is only a political declaration at this stage.  It will become a free-trade agreement of some kind between the EU 27 and the UK.  That is why, when we look at the medium to long-term aspects of this, we consider it to be hugely important to think about, talk about and be focused on these issues.  Over the longer term, the outcome of that process will lock in our trading relationship with what will most likely remain our most important agrifood trading partner.  If we do not get things right around customs and the regulatory relationship, costs will be embedded into our business model in the long term.  As such, it is hugely important to look at those.  There is a degree of certainty in the sense that it is going to happen at some stage or other.  As such, it is important for us to focus on that.<br\/><br\/>From the immediate perspective, there is a great deal of uncertainty and it is very difficult from an investment perspective.  From a business perspective and contingency planning, which is also a matter for the State agencies, there is a certain amount that can be done regarding a &quot;no deal&quot; Brexit.  In some respects, companies have gone past the point of no return and one can probably say the same about State agencies given the additional veterinary and customs inspectors that are needed.  One cannot simply recruit someone and put him or her <i>in situ<\/i>.  Training is required and physical infrastructure has to be put in place.  It is clear that the agencies are working towards December 2020 as the time by which they must be fully up to speed on that but I imagine emergency measures will be needed in the event that there is no deal on 29 March.<br\/><br\/>As Ms Callan said, companies have outlined the various scenarios and done all the plans.  The major issue for most companies is that the level of uncertainty means the sort of investment required to ensure one is done and dusted by 29 March does not make business sense.  They will do what they can where there is little or no cost.  However, if substantial investment is required, most companies are not in a position to make it, in particular in low-margin businesses like food and drink.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018120400002#D01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543942200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>As to whether the Government and its agencies are prepared for a \"no deal\" Brexit, they are absolutely not.  They have been very clear that they are planning for the central case scenario of having that transition.  Even in my last engagement with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I challenged that because it is bad.  Our Revenue Commissioners have no plan for customs on this island.  All the focus has been on east-west customs with the basic presumption being that it will not happen as there is political agreement that it will all be sorted.  We think it would only be responsible to have done some sort of analysis, but the official position is that they have done nothing.  That is what they have told us.  That means we will be at the cliff's edge on 29 March and no one can plan for that.  People have to focus on where to put resources.  Logically, one is listening to all the mood messages and taking the view that it could not possibly happen.  If it does, however, really dramatic decisions will be required.  One cannot have everything in place across all sectors and regulatory areas.  One would have to have some way to keep things going for a while by doing fewer inspections and so on.<\/p> <p>  As to contingency planning by our members, everyone is taking this very seriously.  The larger companies have spent a great deal of money and carried out very detailed case studies around supply chains and the like with a view to ensuring everything is seamless and that there is as little impact as possible on the consumer.<\/p><p>We cannot just think negatively.  UK-based businesses are also reviewing from where they will supply.  There might be some upsides such as, for example, in joint shipments to third countries.  Irish whiskey is packaged in Scotland and sent from there.  It might make more sense to turn it around and do it from here.<\/p><p> In a real practical sense, we brought members by one by one into the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to work through their specific issues.  The questions are about ports.  People want to know if Dublin Port is going to work.  They want to understand what will the tracking systems be, the lanes and who will be given priority.  They are the questions companies are asking.  It is granular stuff.  It has been an interesting process and the companies have found it helpful to obtain that level of detail.<\/p><p> We have also been to Task Force 50 twice in the past five weeks to work through detailed excise stuff and how it will all work.  It must be borne in mind that the UK Government has also come late to this process.  Our very first meeting on excise issues with the UK authorities was about six weeks ago.  There is no level of planning, although we certainly found good engagement and people had a good understanding of our issues.<\/p><p> My concern is that if we keep on going with the unknown, businesses will have to make decisions.  They cannot just adopt the wait and see approach.  People are already stockpiling and warehouses are full across the retail sector, as well as in our industry.  Owing to that advance buying, one will see knock-on implications for both the Irish and UK economies when it all rolls out.  One then has practical issues in terms of physical movements and planning for them.  One might hear people saying they have had enough of this and they will hedge their bets one way or another in either jurisdiction, in the North or the South in our case.  The Government needs to up its communications on the detail.  We hear about how many jobs are being created in Departments and agencies, but we do not hear how it is going to help us as businesses.  We know that is essential, as well as how protection of the food supply chain is critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018120400002#D01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Callan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543942200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Is Food Drink Ireland&rsquo;s level of engagement with the Department weekly or monthly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018120400002#E00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543942200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>The Department has a stakeholder group which does not meet all that often.

Our Northern members are only with our association.  Accordingly, we are bringing that broader perspective.<\/p> <p>  We have seen significant investment in the drinks sector in Ireland purely because people believe in the product and our capacity to have the fastest growing spirits sector in the world.  Building a distillery can cost between &euro;15 million and &euro;25 million.  It was &euro;50 million in the case of one of the more recent announcements.  Another &euro;5 million is needed to mature the stock and as much again for marketing and sales.  There are geographic indications, as well as the belief we have top-notch product which is making traction in global markets.  That is why we are continuing to see money invested in the sector.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, the threat greater than Brexit is something like the Public Health (Alcohol) Act.  There is also the US trade war.  In the space of two and a half weeks we went from having steel tariffs to tariffs on bourbon and whiskey.  There is still a 25% tariff on an imported product here, with the threat that the United States will retaliate against us at any time.  Up to 50% of Irish cream and whiskey goes to the United States.  If it hits us with a 25% tariff, the impact will be much more dramatic for us than Brexit.<\/p> <p>  We are clear on the issues.  We need people to work with us at that granular level.  High politics is all well and good, but we now need to get into the detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018120400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Callan"},{"type":"speech","time":1543942200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Obviously, the drinks industry has ambitious targets.

The word \"Irish\" is protected in the term \"Irish whiskey\".  Irish whiskey is a defined category and the fastest growing spirit category in the world.  We want to protect the Irish identity of the product but that is very much an issue which can be dealt with in the negotiations on the future relationship.  It is just one issue within the withdrawal agreement which is, overall, the best approach to Brexit.  There are many issues here and the backstop may never come into play.  An agreement might be put in place before an extended transition.  The focus now in representing our businesses in Northern Ireland is to express support for the withdrawal agreement.  A \"no deal\" is something we want to avoid.  We hope that early in the new year, we will be in a position to move on from the withdrawal agreement to look at that future relationship.

Specifically, this technical Supplementary Estimate will transfer &euro;15 million of savings in certain areas of the Vote to the World Food Programme, WFP, to support its humanitarian work across the world.  I am also requesting the committee's approval for funding of a further &euro;23 million for the agri-environmental schemes to ensure that there is sufficient funding available to pay a higher advance payment of 85% funding to all farmers who establish their eligibility under these schemes.  Finally, a provision for a further &euro;7 million is requested for provision of payment under the various fodder schemes implemented to assist farmers during the fodder difficulties.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;15 million current funds required for the WFP would be transferred from various subheads where due to changed circumstances, savings have emerged, most notably in the administrative budget pay subhead, control and other support scheme costs, research, quality and certification, development and promotion of agriculture and food, other services and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  There is a total figure of &euro;3.6 million under the payroll underspend.  The saving arises from a lower than estimated pay bill due to recruitment of additional and replacement staff not proceeding as quickly as planned.  Also as a result of a large turnover of staff due mainly to career opportunities for staff across the civil and public services, short-term gaps can arise that in turn give rise to savings in the payroll budget.  <\/p> <p>  There is a saving of &euro;2.3 million under the subheading control and other support scheme costs.  This has been identified as a result of non-requirement to draw down funds that are set aside as a prudent reserve in case of financial sanctions in our clearance of accounts procedures.  There is a saving of &euro;1.4 million under the subheading of other services.  This has arisen due to savings in our legal expenses in 2018.  There is a saving of &euro;1.7 million under the subheading of research, quality and certification.  <\/p> <p>  The 2018 provision was primarily required to meet funding commitments arising from expenditure incurred on previously awarded projects and for new commitments and advances on Call 2017.  Expenditure in 2018 is likely to be some &euro;2 million below the original estimate of &euro;18.6 million.  It is hoped, however, that will be a greater response to future calls for further research projects as existing projects come to fruition and are replaced and in order to maintain the constant level of research activity needed to underpin the sector.  <\/p> <p>  There is a saving of &euro;3.6 million under the subheading of development and promotion of agriculture and food - non-farm.  The savings are arising as there has been a lower than projected spend on lean reviews by food companies as a result of a lower than expected project completion rate in 2018 from what was initially forecast.  It is understood that companies are re-examining projects in light of Brexit.  In addition, the artisan food and small producer schemes have a lower than expected number of approvals that require payment in arrears.  It is expected that these commitments will be drawn down in 2019.  <\/p> <p>  There has been a saving of &euro;2.4 million under the subheading of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM.  BIM has been assisting seafood industry members to get Brexit ready.  Industry demand for Brexit assistance via grant schemes is difficult to apportion as the services provided are available in a number of individual sector schemes.  These are demand-led schemes that have resulted in a lower than expected outturn compared to what was forecast in 2018, which has resulted in a savings of &euro;2.4 million.<\/p> <p>  Overall, these current expenditure savings amount to some &euro;15 million.  With the committee's approval, this will be transferred to fund the WFP.  This additional &euro;15 million provided for WFP in this Supplementary Estimate represents an advance payment of next year's commitment under Ireland's strategic partnership agreement with the WFP.  This earlier disbursement is at the request of the WFP's executive director who has written to inform me that this funding will significantly contribute to enhancing the WFP's capability to plan its interventions and better address the several growing humanitarian crises around the world.<\/p><p> The 2018 budgetary allocations for current expenditure under the agri-environmental schemes is &euro;232.8 million.  The expenditure projections were based on paying schemes at the 75% advance rate set out in the EU regulatory framework.  However, due to the difficult circumstances farmers were finding themselves in, in particular the fodder shortage and the unprecedented weather, I made a request to the European Commission for approval for Ireland to pay higher advance payments of 85% for Pillar II rural development schemes, which is allowed under EU regulations in exceptional circumstances.  The additional &euro;23 million sought in this Supplementary Estimate will facilitate this higher payment to farmers, in particular GLAS and the organic farming scheme, and will bring the total spend under agri-environmental schemes to &euro;256 million in 2018.  I urge all participants in receipt of correspondence from the Department to submit required documentation to enable issuing of their advance payment in 2018.<\/p><p> In early 2018, I introduced the fodder transport scheme and a fodder import measure.  In response to the deteriorating weather conditions and fodder shortages experienced in the sector in recent months, the Department put in place a range of support measures to address the situation.  The fodder incentive production scheme was introduced in autumn 2018 with an allocation &euro;2.75 million.  This measure provided an incentive of &euro;155 per hectare for tillage growers to grow a temporary crop of short rotation grasses for fodder production over the winter months and &euro;100 per hectare for those growing catch crops.  It is expected that somewhere between &euro;1.5 million and &euro;1.8 million will be paid before year end.  The fodder import scheme, which was also introduced in autumn 2018 has an original allocation &euro;4.25 million.  This measure was introduced to contribute to the transport costs of imported forage, including hay, silage, haylage and alfalfa, from outside the island of Ireland.  The closing date of the scheme is 31 December 2018.  Importers are currently submitting their applications to allow payment to issue.  At this stage, as it is a demand-led scheme, it is difficult to estimate the level of expenditure in this scheme for 2018.  It is not expected that the full &euro;4.25 million will be drawn down in 2018.  The additional &euro;7 million sought in this Supplementary Estimate will facilitate these payments.<\/p><p> The original allocation in 2018 to the Brexit response loan scheme of &euro;25 million was current funding, as was the allocation for earlier loan schemes.  However, due to a technical decision by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the allocation now needs to be reclassified and paid as capital expenditure.  No extra expenditure above what was originally provided for in 2018 is involved.<\/p><p> The Department's appropriations-in-aid have been substantially greater in 2018 than provided for in the 2018 Revised Estimates.  We seek to offset our additional requests against these receipts.  These payments are from the European Commission and are the EU funding component for our co-funded rural development programme schemes, including areas of natural constraints scheme, GLAS, TAMS and the beef data and genomics programme.  These are paid in arrears by the Commission, usually on a quarterly basis.  The additional receipts reflect the late arrival of a payment in respect of the third quarter of 2017, which was expected to be received by the Department in December 2017 but was not received until early January 2018.<\/p><p> This is a technical Supplementary Estimate.  The savings I have outlined will be used to fund the World Food Programme and agri-environmental schemes, in particular GLAS and the fodder schemes.  I earnestly recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee for support.  I am happy to respond to any questions that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#B00400","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I ask members to keep their questions to the subheads so we will be able to go through them quickly.

It is imperative that we know the names of the factories, the dates on which they were caught at the offences and how many carcasses were involved.  How regular are the checks in the various factories?  Are there repeat offenders?  What detailed scrutiny do the factories have on trim?

Under the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, we have funding available.  Deputy Pringle mentioned ammonia.  That is one area where we are significantly challenged because our ammonia emissions are virtually at the ceiling.  We are grant-aiding low emissions slurry spreading as a technology in contrast to splash-plate spreading of slurry.  The former reduces ammonia emissions by in the region of 30%.  That is one area where there is a significant gain.<\/p> <p>  There is a host of other initiatives and the agrifood industry generally needs to take these on board.  These include investment in the beef data genomics programme.  We are enhancing that through the additional allocation in the 2019 budget for the beef environmental efficiency scheme to reduce the carbon footprint of the beef sector.  There are those who will say that, relatively speaking, our emissions profile in the beef sector competitive, but we need to do more.<\/p> <p>  Along with New Zealand, we are considered to be one of the most carbon efficient producers of dairy per unit of output.  However, we need to reduce emissions intensity in the dairy sector as well.  Measures such as the beef data genomics programme and the beef environmental efficiency scheme will enable us to accelerate the journey to a more carbon efficient beef sector by having a small suckler cow, a bigger weanling, a more fertile suckler cow and a cow that is easy-calving.  All these collectively contribute to a lower carbon footprint on the slaughtered animal.  That is important, not only because of the climate change responsibility but also increasingly important for the market, which is asking questions about the environmental sustainability of the industry.<\/p> <p>  We have measures such as milk recording on the dairy side.  There has been increased output in the dairy sector since quotas were abolished.  I have seen figures suggesting that 70% of the increased output has come from increased cattle numbers and 30% from increased use of genetics.  We need to turn the tables substantially and get more from improved genetics in the dairy herd.  Up to a point, it is understandable that there may have been a headlong rush to avail of the opportunities post quota.  However, we now need to concentrate on catching up with efficiencies.  We need to ensure data are available from milk recording.  Currently, milk recording is used in only 40% of dairy herds.  Increasing the number of herds where milk recording is used and using the data from milk recording to improve the genetic merit of the dairy herd further would have been considered to have been a leader in terms of the economic breeding index.  We need to do more in that area.  That will allow us to get more production from fewer cow numbers.  That improves the carbon efficiency of the industry.<\/p> <p>  Grassland management is a particularly important area, as is improving soil fertility.  It is a staggering figure, but in the beef sector fewer than 1% of beef farmers are involved in grassland management.  Grassland management involves measuring grass growth using pasture base or other technologies that are available to ensure production is from a sustainable food source.  We can grow grass better than anyone else.  Promoting use of grass measurement is important.  Teagasc runs the Grass10 programme.  Yesterday, we had the announcement of the grassland farms of the year across the dairy, sheep and beef sectors.  We need to mainstream grassland management.  Again, there is higher participation on the dairy side but we need to ensure that these practices are brought into the mainstream across all sectors.<\/p> <p>  We need to improve soil fertility to its optimum level and reduce in some instances the amount of chemical fertiliser that we need to apply.  When applying fertiliser we should use the most environmentally friendly options, for example, protected urea as opposed to using calcium ammonium nitrate as a nitrogen source.  That significantly improves the effect of the release of nitrous oxide, which is another one of the greenhouse gases.  Soil fertility is important.<\/p> <p>  Another side of this is greenhouse gas production.  If we are producing food, we will have greenhouse gas production.  We need to look at how we can sequester the maximum amount of carbon possible.  We spend in excess of &euro;100 million on the Department's afforestation and forestry road programme.  It is important that farmers take up the opportunity this presents.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, recently concluded a review of the forestry programme and has tweaked it significantly, with new options such as low-density agri-forestry to try to address the mix of deciduous and hardwood trees.  We are increasing the payments marginally to improve take-up to sequester carbon production.<\/p> <p>  There is no one initiative that will address this problem on its own.  It will involve a combination of a series of initiatives, some of which I have mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#D00900","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>When will they be implemented?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#D01000","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Some are being implemented.

What kind of contingency has the Department?<\/p> <p>  Is the Minister concerned by payroll and the delays in recruitment?

The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, is piloting that legislation.  It is minor and technical legislation.  As I understand it, primary legislation must underpin the loan initiative because of the involvement of the European Investment Bank.  I imagine that will be concluded in the D&aacute;il before Christmas and, therefore, all the legislative hurdles associated with the launch of the loan scheme in early 2019 will be cleared.  As I said previously, we identified a gap in the market for funding for capital investment in the area of longer-term finance.  There is sufficient competition in the market for shorter-term money.  We identified a gap in the market for finance over eight to ten years.  We propose to fill that gap with this product.  There will be a minium borrowing requirement of &euro;50,000.  Unsecured borrowing at an interest rate of less than 5% will be offered.  Those are the main characteristics of the loan product we will introduce.<\/p> <p>  On weather, this Supplementary Estimate was required for a couple of reasons.  One reason was the fodder initiative we introduced.  I do not make this point to denigrate in any way those still facing significant challenges, but our initial audit showed a fodder deficit of almost 30%.  The most recent audit showed that we were at a 1% deficit.  This shows the value of working collaboratively.  We have reached this point through work led by my own Department and Teagasc, in collaboration with all stakeholders, including farm organisations, financial institutions and the agrifood industry.<\/p><p>There are many who would have had us do much more at a much earlier stage at much more expense.  All of the steps we took, however, were prudent and appropriate.  They have got us to a situation now where the deficit is manageable.  I urge farmers who still face a challenge with their holdings to engage with the advisory service and, in particular, to get involved in fodder budgeting.  The Department will keep the situation under review.  One of the initiatives on tillage side where we have had a response was the planting of 20,000 hectares.  That is important and we should be appreciative of the tillage sector for that response.<\/p><p> There is also the import aspect.  I am aware some approved importers now have a situation where the products they have imported are warehoused rather than distributed.  They are those - including some who may be in this room and if the cap fits, wear it - who would have had us importing in July.  We would be left with stockpiles of fodder now.  The benefit of having worked collaboratively was that the steps taken were appropriate and taken at the appropriate time.  We will, however, keep the situation under review.  If there is a need to intervene in 2019, we will review it then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#E03800","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Corcoran Kennedy happy with that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#F00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#F00300","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Martin Kenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#F00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I will not get into too much detail.

We all have to be realistic.  The weather does what the weather does and we cannot control that.  Having said that, every effort has to be made to mitigate against it, as far as possible.  We have these discussions many times.  The fodder crisis can be solved by most farmers on their own farms and that is the best place to solve it.  Every assistance should be given to farmers to maximise the fodder they produce themselves.  The way farmers manage their own grasslands is the best way of ensuring we can resolve these problems in future.<\/p> <p>  Some of the measures in place in that regard such as the knowledge transfer scheme have helped with that.  It is, ultimately, however, down to the area of the country a farmer is in.  Someone farming in County Wexford this year would talk about a need for irrigation.  Farmers in Donegal, however, still have a problem with wet soil.  It depends on where a person is and what the problems are.  That being said, we have been fortunate that the fodder crisis people expected and feared did not materialise.  Thank God it did not.  We will move on from there as best we can.<\/p> <p>  A number of other issues were mentioned.  Pay was mentioned, as were administration and savings.  Most of that is the result perhaps, as the Minister has said, of people retiring and not being replaced as quickly as anticipated.  I am conscious farmers in many areas are waiting to get payments and there have been delays.  Is the shortage of staff having an impact and is that something that needs to be considered?  There is a broader issue in the context of Brexit.  I notice there was some shortfall in funding, particularly through An Bord Bia and other agencies.  Deputy Pringle mentioned climate change during the discussion earlier and all of that is part of this.  We need to look at alternatives and where we are going in the future.  <\/p> <p>  We all know we are the most energy and carbon efficient producers of milk, which is fine.  The growth in the volume of milk produced has created a problem as well.  That is because of the open market.  There is a similar scenario in beef production but that has been decreasing because the market has led to that situation.  How much effort has been put into, and how much more effort could be put into, opening up alternative sectors that will mitigate against our carbon emissions?  I refer to those not there at present where farmers could do more to help the climate situation while also make a profit for themselves.  I refer to a profit they will have today rather one that will be a retirement fund like forestry.  That type of profit is long term and far into the future.  This is one of the key areas that needs to be looked at.  <\/p> <p>  We are looking at a Vote here today but I am more interested in where we plan to be in ten, 15 or 20 years.  That is what we need to consider for the agricultural sector.  We can all state what is good now and call for us do more of it.  We need, however, to look much further ahead than that because today's bubble might burst.  There is great merit in long-term planning in this area.  Where is the space in this budget for that long-term planning?  I refer to examining the opening up of new sectors and possibilities or taking niche markets and developing them into something that will be progressive and good for new sectors into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#F00900","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>On the fodder issue, the weather comes and we will have to deal with whatever that is.  In that context, building resilience on farms is important.  Returning to the point I made to Deputy Pringle on grassland management, this is an area where we can do much more.  Previous advice on carrying surplus silage from one season into another regarded it as a charge on the balance sheet and not good farming.  We need to move away from that.  We need to build up reserves in a prudent way to take account of events outside of our control.  That message is swinging back into vogue.<\/p> <p>  The difference in grassland management is staggering between those who use the science and technology available and those who do not.  At an awards ceremony yesterday, I made the point that we need to make things as simple as possible in this regard.  We talk about apps and pasture base, etc.  Sometimes that is challenging for farmers who may not be technologically savvy.  It is simple, however.  We are referring to soil fertility that reduces the volume of fertiliser that needs to be spread.  We need to make that knowledge available to all farmers because the difference in the yields of tonnes of grass and dry matter between the best farmers and those at the other extreme is staggering in regard to the additional costs.  We can make much progress there.  <\/p> <p>  I am advised that there are no undue delays with farm payments.  There are always individual cases for one reason or another.  There are, however, no staffing issues in the critical areas processing payments.  Notwithstanding an underspend in the staff area, we have recruited additional staff to address shortfalls across the range of activities in which the Department is involved.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's observation on beef production is incorrect regarding the reason for the decrease.  He may be mistaken because there is a marginal reduction in the number of suckler cows, which is accepted, but the beef kill is at almost record high levels.  In recent weeks, it has been at 40,000 or more.  Suckler cows and the expanding dairy herd have given rise to a larger population of calf to beef in dairy herd enterprises.  Overall, then, there is not a decline in beef production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#F01000","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>There is certainly a decline in the profit farmers are making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#F01100","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I accept that.

The Deputy makes an interesting point about new enterprises.  One of the areas where there are opportunities is organic farming.  There is market demand for certified organic produce and we have reopened the organic scheme, albeit with modest funding.  There are major opportunities in the organic sphere in the dairy and tillage areas, although not exclusively in those areas.  For example, we import organic oats.<\/p><p>We are approaching a stage where a successor to the Food Wise 2025 document will be needed.  That will need to examine the challenges that lie ahead.

When taxpayers' money is being used to market food, very often the people who make the most money from that food are not the primary producers but the people in the middle such as the processors and the supermarkets.  Is there not a responsibility to ensure that the primary producer gets a fair price?  We all know the interests of the consumer must be looked after but the interests of the primary producer must also be looked after.  A significant amount of public money is going into this industry.  It is going directly to farmers but it also goes into the industry through marketing all this food and ensuring that there is an adequate price but that the latter does not go back to the primary producer and certainly not to the farmer from Drumshanbo who sends them the weanling.  Such a farmer does not see it, which is the problem.

There has been an increase in dairy numbers in recent years.  In particular, a significant number of Friesian cows were culled this year and I suggest that this has had a negative effect on the beef market.  Next spring, we will see a lot of Friesian calves coming into the market.  Are we developing extra markets for these because the word is that, come next spring, Friesian calves will be hard to dispose of and the price for them will be very poor?  Are we looking at other markets for these calves?  I was talking to another factory this morning.  Its normal breakdown would be 30% culled cows and 70% beef.  It is telling me that this is now 50:50.  This must be reversed in order to change the difficult differences in price at the moment.  Are extra markets being developed for calves that will be difficult to sell next spring and beyond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#G01000","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>My recollection of the figures is that there have been approximately 215,000 live exports to date in 2018.  That is up by in the region of 30% on the figure for 2017.  Of those, approximately 150,000 were exported calves.  That is subject to correction but that is my recall of the detail so we are growing it significantly.  Can we keep ahead of the growth in the national herd on the dairy side?  That is a challenge but we are looking for as many opportunities as possible.  The most significant issue for the export of cattle is compliance with the regulations.  Anything less is a disservice to the industry, to say the least.  We must be extremely vigilant because it is an area where there is a lot of vigilance around our activities.<\/p> <p>  In the broader context of live exports, obviously, the Turkish market took a hit.  It was one of those issues we could not control.  It was the perfect geopolitical issue - a spat between the US and Turkey - and the collapse in the value of the lira made it uneconomical for us.  They have begun to source other opportunities.  We are extremely active in a host of areas.  The market access unit has renegotiated the veterinary certification for the Libyan market.  This will give rise to increased numbers heading in the direction of live exports.  Spain has become a significant market for live exports.  Ultimately, many of those probably migrate to north Africa.  We are also looking at other opportunities across north Africa, such as in Morocco, Algeria and, to an extent, Egypt.  I am not sure but there may be opportunities in Egypt.  I recently met the ambassador of Kazakhstan to explore opportunities there.  We are vigilant across a range of market opportunities and obviously keep an eye on Turkey and what might happen there in the future.  Live exports are a really important part of the competitive mix, as are new markets for processed meat.  In 2018, market access to China opened up.

In the context of the fodder scheme, I make no apologies for putting forward proposals regarding the fodder crisis.  In mid-July, we were facing a famine in the winter.  Thankfully, the weather intervened and we got an extremely good back end of the year.  However, schemes proposed by us, such as the extension of fertiliser and slurry spreading and the catch crops with the tillage farmers, have played a significant part in redressing the imbalance that was there.<\/p><p>If we get a late spring, whatever surplus of imported fodder we have in store will not take long to disappear.  In the southern half of the country, where fodder was non-existent in mid-August, the situation has improved very dramatically.  Cattle were out grazing up to three or four days ago.  If it is favourable in the springtime, we will have fodder left over, which is a far better situation in which to be.  We raised the matter in the D&aacute;il and, thankfully, the Minister and the Department took initiatives.  Those initiatives with the help of good weather have changed what was a disastrous situation into one where we can come out the far side without the disastrous financial implication of a serious shortage of fodder.  Farmers have incurred enormous expense - it was probably the most expensive year farmers have endured for a long period.  There were eight to ten weeks in the summer during which stock were fed at winter levels.  That has also left a major merchant debt level which will need to be addressed and which will be a serious issue for the future.<br\/><br\/>The Minister is not in touch with what is happening in the beef industry.  I have never seen farmers as despondent about the industry.  I finish a few cattle myself.  Everyone in the chain, from the man producing the calf to the man finishing the animal, is absolutely despondent about the future of the beef industry.  Costs for finishing cattle have risen by approximately 25% to 30% while the price has gone in the other direction.  We can talk all we like about getting increased live exports, getting extra calves away next spring and the hope that various markets will open up.  The reality is that we have had 40,000 killed and we are not able to sell 40,000 cattle efficiently.  That is the bottom line.  Our factories are not able to do it and if they are doing it, they are making a lot of money because they are not paying a viable return to the producer.<br\/><br\/>Cattle prices are disastrous, as are store prices.  The Chairman stated that farmers dread the thought of what they will get for calves next spring.  There is despondency throughout the beef industry.  Farmers have taken enough.  If one asks a suckler farmer, he will say the show is over.  The man who bought animals and took them from calves to beef will say the same thing.  There is complete lack of confidence in the grading system.  We see animals being given O grades but there is no quality assurance.  When that beef appears on a supermarket shelf in Dunnes Stores or in a Lidl in London or wherever, the customer will not see there was an O-grade carcass and yet the factory will pay the farmer 12 cent per kilo less for it.<br\/><br\/>The 30-month restriction was introduced for good reason because of the BSE crisis 20 or 25 years ago.  At this stage, it is archaic and, especially with late-maturing breeds, it adds considerable extra cost for farmers and puts the factories in a position of dominance whereby they know the farmers will have to kill the cattle by a certain date and will adjust their price accordingly.<br\/><br\/>In the Estimate before us, it is proposed to spend an extra &euro;15 million on world aid.  I do not suggest that this money will not be well spent.  However, we have farmers who are going broke.  Certain farmers in areas of natural constraint, especially those who own land on which hen harriers roost, have had their land completely devalued by regulations issued from Brussels.  We did not put a scheme in place to restore the value of that land for them.  A scheme was put in place, but that land which was worth &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 per acre for forestry cannot now be sold.  The capital value of that land has been completely decimated.  Until we put a scheme back in place to restore the capital value of that land, we are not being fair to those people.  The owners of that hen harrier land are being extremely quiet.  With a stroke of a pen the entire capital value of their land was eroded.<br\/><br\/>Our beef industry is in crisis.  The kill is at record levels.  Our targets for 2020 and for Food Wise 2025 are all lovely, but the primary producer of the cattle is getting decimated and they will leave in droves.  They cannot keep taking the losses being incurred.  This winter feed costs will be significantly higher.  A number of people will say they are not feeding cattle anymore.  This summer many of the traditional beef men put aside their land and sold fodder down to the south rather than buying cattle.<br\/><br\/>The beef industry is in crisis.  We can talk about various markets.  Representatives from Bord Bia appeared before the committee two weeks ago.  I do not ridicule Bord Bia's work; it is an extremely efficient organisation and works very hard.  We always said that we could efficiently kill and sell 30,000 cattle.  It might have been possible to get to 32,000 or 33,000.  However, there is no way that we have markets for the current kill level.  Turkey has disappeared as an outlet.  Reality must come into it.  Men just cannot continue with the returns they are currently getting from the beef industry.<br\/><br\/>The word I would use to describe the mood among beef farmers is &quot;despondent&quot;.  Men are making career changes and have said enough is enough and they cannot take anymore.  I will not be unfair on the Minister.  I will not claim he can dictate the price factories are paying for cattle.  However, there must be a realisation that what is happening is not sustainable.  We can talk about targets and everything else, but unless there is an economic return for rearing and finishing cattle, men will not stay there.  At present, that economic return is not there.<br\/><br\/>In the early part of the year, the Chairman took us to an <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>lunch.  At the table, I was ridiculed when talking about Friesian cattle and the returns from finishing feeding cattle.  The men who were ridiculing me should see if the cap fits.  There are farmers in my area who traditionally finished cattle; it will not happen anymore.  They will not do it and it is over as far as they are concerned.  They have been walked on too often and the price being paid at the back end is the straw that has broken the camel's back.  Men just cannot keep going back to it.<br\/><br\/>I presume the decision has been made in respect of this &euro;15 million, but there are definitely farmers on hen harrier land who need support.  People would like to see this spent on trying to secure live export markets.  If live exports are to have a significant effect, cattle would have to move in significant numbers.  A couple of hundred per week will not make any difference.  We need a significant number of live cattle moving from the country if we are put any competition into the trade because it is just not there.<br\/><br\/>I know a man who had a lot of cows to kill last week.  He asked the factory when it would take the cull cow.  The cull cow is now in extremely good condition, extremely well fed.  He was told the factory could not take them until the third or fourth week of January because its stores were full of beef.  We just cannot viably sell the cattle we are killing at the moment.  Men have just had enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#G01300","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I am not sure if there were any questions there for the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#H00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Not really.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2018120400002#H00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1543935600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I will ask the Minister for a brief comment.

Deputy Cahill made reference to 30-month BSE restrictions.  We have to export and find a home for nine out of every ten cattle that we produce and we try to negotiate the best possible deal that we can.  It involves constant engagement with veterinary authorities in other states.  We have, most recently, improved the veterinary certification requirement with Libya and that will enable us to export cattle in greater numbers there.  Some of this is part of the legacy of BSE.  Some of it, in terms of our retail partners, is a consumer preference issue.  We are constantly trying, and work with the sector, to get the best possible market access terms but we must work with the other member states.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill also made reference to a period of 30 months in the context of late-maturing breeds.  In a way, if one takes 30 months to finish a beef animal, one is losing money anyway, with the exception of cow beef, as 30-month beef production is not efficient.  We need to drive efficiency in the sector and part of that pertains to the &euro;250 million we are providing under the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, for example, as well as the additional &euro;20 million that is forthcoming for the weanling scheme.  We are doing a lot in the area.  It is not an easy space.

The unions that comprise our energy and natural resources sector group represent tens of thousands of workers in the energy production and distribution sector, all of whom are directly affected by climate change.  I understand the committee has been tasked with considering the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on this issue and how we can make Ireland a leader in climate action.  The committee's deliberations also take place in the context of the development of the integrated energy and climate action plan for consideration by the European Commission, a process into which the committee's final report will feed.<\/p> <p>  Our delegation wishes to focus in particular on recommendation 7 of the Citizens' Assembly report, namely, that \"the State should end all subsidies for peat extraction and instead spend that money on peat bog restoration and making proper provision for the protection of the rights of the workers impacted\", with the majority of the members of the assembly, 61%, recommending that the State should end all subsidies on a phased basis over five years.  Clearly, workers in this sector and in other carbon heavy sectors will face significant challenges in the coming years.  Congress made a submission to the Citizens' Assembly which acknowledged this fact and also made the case for a just transition to a low-carbon economy.  Unions have been campaigning in this area for a number of years now under the campaign slogan of \"There are no jobs on a dead planet\".<\/p> <p>  The concept of a just transition originates in the international labour movement and, over time, has become the benchmark in terms of how we should respond globally and nationally to this challenge.  In essence, it means that workers and their communities must not shoulder the burden.  The International Labour Organization recommends that transition policies must therefore \"pay special attention to the industries, regions, communities and workers whose livelihoods might experience the hardest impacts of the transition\".  In practical terms, this requires governments to \"formulate accompanying policies through social protection, including unemployment insurance and benefits, skills training and upgrading, workforce redeployment and other appropriate measures\".  Critically, repeated studies of this process and examples of best practice from Spain, Germany and Australia demonstrate the necessity to ensure the process is based on social dialogue, with close co-ordination between the government, state agencies, employers and trade unions.  For example, Spanish unions only last month agreed an historic just transition deal with Government and employers in respect of the country's coal mining industry.  The deal will see &euro;250 million invested in the mining communities and supports for the affected workers.  It has been hailed by the European Trade Union Confederation as a model of just transition.  The ETUC noted: \"We don&rsquo;t need to choose between a job and protecting the environment.  It is possible to have both.\"<\/p> <p>  In the Australian town of Port Augusta, unions worked with local businesses and citizens to develop their own just transition plan in advance of the 2016 closure of the town's coal-fired power station.  Their research found that a solar thermal plant was the best option to enable a smooth skills transfer and ensure a long-term clean energy solution.  The new solar plant will create 1,800 jobs and save 5 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.  It will also help the wider community reap the benefits of a zero-carbon future.  In addition, Australian unions, facing the closure of all coal-fired power stations in the near future, recently published a study that highlighted the example of the Ruhr in Germany, a region long synonymous with fossil-based enterprises and now home to new green industry.  The secret was planning, social dialogue and co-ordination with all those affected.  The study contrasted the success of the Ruhr with the disaster that has befallen the people and communities of Appalachia, where no just transition measures were put in place to deal with the closure of mines in the region.<\/p> <p>  The issue has been brought to the fore here with the recent announcement by Bord na M&oacute;na of a plan that will see the loss of 150 jobs before Easter 2019 and up to 850 redundancies in the peat harvesting business by 2025.  It is a devastating blow for the midlands and illustrates the immediacy of the challenges posed by climate change to the workers, their families and the wider communities.  Congress responded by calling for the establishment of a just transition forum and we have also initiated work with the Nevin Economic Research Institute and unions in the energy and natural resources sector to develop concrete propositions on how we might achieve a just transition for the region and to identify the supports that will be required to do so, along with the many opportunities that this will present.<\/p> <p>  As the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, notes: \"Transitions to low-carbon, environmentally and socially sustainable economies can become a strong driver of job creation, job upgrading, social justice and poverty eradication.\"  This call was echoed by the former President, Mary Robinson, in a recent keynote address to a climate action conference here in Dublin where she stressed the importance of just transition and the need to ensure that the rights of communities in the midlands are protected in this process.  This is why congress has also recently written to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, seeking his support for the Silesia just transition declaration at the COP24 meeting in Poland this week and to return with a commitment to develop and implement such a transition here at home.  It is our hope that the integrated energy and climate action plan will include concrete proposals on establishing a just transition forum for the midlands and the wider economy.  There is no shortage of guidelines and examples of best practice in this area, including those cited here and those agreed by the world's governments, employers and unions at the ILO.  A just transition represents our best chance of tackling climate change in a manner that ensures nobody, including workers and communities in the midlands, is left behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Joyce"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543948200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Before I turn to the members, I have one question about ICTU.

It is welcome to see the trade unions involved because it is the workers we have to convince to make the change.  How difficult was it in the case of Bord na M&oacute;na, which has been an iconic part of our history for so long, to engage workers in terms of telling them that changes have to be made to make progress?  The witnesses might give a brief background on that and how they engaged workers to get to the table and make an agreement on shutting down the first of the plants.  What negotiations are ongoing in terms of retraining or whatever?<\/p> <p>  We talk about rust belts.  This is about the midlands and not bringing about desolation in towns and communities or for the families who live in them.  It is about not depleting them of that population when such a significant industry is on its way out and the idea of getting public support for what will take place instead of what is currently in place.<\/p> <p>  This sector is one of the sectors the witnesses represent.  How many men and women are in the sector?  I imagine there are more men working in it and therefore the package offered will be weighted towards the men in the company.  I refer to the socioeconomic effects of that, as well as the psychological effect, on the smaller communities around them.<\/p> <p>  In terms of an alternative use for the peatlands that will become free and reclaiming the wet agriculture for forestry, Russia has reclaimed extensive areas of peatland.  I accept it may not be a country to compare and contrast with Ireland but it has done that successfully.  I refer to common reed for construction material, paper, solid fuel, fish farming and water buffalo for cheese.  I cannot think we will have that here but Russia came up with imaginative uses for the reclaimed peatland and reinvestment in terms of some of the workers.  On the workers in Bord na M&oacute;na, what is the age profile of those who will be directly affected by this development?<\/p> <p>  In Russia, there have been health benefits from reclaiming the land in that the peat smog has disappeared.  Russia is a very large country but the 20 million people who live in proximity to those lands are no longer exposed to that smog and there has been a decrease in respiratory diseases such as asthma and so.  There has been an increase in respiratory diseases from air pollution exposure.  According to the World Health Organization, 7 million people die from respiratory disease per year as a result of air pollution exposure.  The reclaiming of the land has resulted in a significant health benefit for that area in Russia.  It impacts on cardiovascular problems also.<\/p> <p>  As for the reconfiguration, this is the first time Bord na M&oacute;na has afforded this country an opportunity to implement the just transition framework.  That could be the template for the thousands of workers who work in a carbon-heavy industry.  We need to get this as right as possible to bring in public opinion and support for a move to a more sustainable environment.<\/p> <p>  This affects everything else, and transport is a major aspect.  The number of people using transport to get to work has greatly increased and it is having a major impact.  We talk about electric cars but people still will be reliant on using their own transport to get to work.  Is there a way within the just transition framework to protect the environment and villages, small towns and even villages within cities, whereby we could have local hubs to which people can go to work?  More people will be working from home, which will decrease the level of carbon emissions.  Is that being taken into consideration or will all of us have to travel miles to get to work in the future?<\/p> <p>  What are the other carbon-heavy sectors that the witnesses believe will be impacted upon next?  The Bord na M&oacute;na workers will be affected in this case but what is the next industry that will be impacted?  The witnesses might outline, in chronological order, their size and impact in terms of emissions.  I would be grateful if the witnesses could answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#C01100","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543948200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>The witnesses can take the questions in any order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#C01200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543948200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Some of the questions are for Bord na M&oacute;na.

On the workforce and how its members have taken to what is occurring, the reaction has been fairly pragmatic.  The people in Bord na M&oacute;na knew this was coming.  They knew there was a plan to get out of peat production in the next decade and they had resigned themselves to that fact.  The problem is that has now been fast-tracked.  People thought they would have another decade in peat production but it has been fast-tracked and that has put people under a great deal of pressure.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the age profile, the median age of the people on the bogs is 56, which is fairly high.  However, many jobs have been earmarked to be got rid of, for want of a better term, in Newbridge, and the majority of those are not bog-related.  Many women work in office jobs.  It has been lost on the public that many of the jobs due to end are not just those on the bogs.<\/p> <p>  On reclaiming the sites and using them for forestry, the problem is that trees do not grow on bogs.  Some trees do but the majority of those of any value do not.  That is a red herring.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the way the people in Bord na M&oacute;na have been treated, they have been treated abysmally, and people should know that.  Some politicians have come out in the media and announced they were doing a great service to the members in Bord na M&oacute;na by getting the stakeholder to provide a voluntary severance package.  What they did not say was that the voluntary severance package does not give many of these people one cent more than they would get if they were working in non-unionised employment.<\/p><p>People over 62 are only getting statutory redundancy.  There are people in Bord na M&oacute;na who, under this new voluntary severance package, will be told they are in a location with no job.  The package only offers such people half of what they would otherwise earn and there is no job for them.  They are not getting one extra red cent from this new redundancy package.  In fact they are worse off but the politicians who raced to the media did not tell them that.  This package denies these people their pension entitlements.  Their current pension states, quite clearly, that if they retire before 60 years of age, they can draw their pension if they go voluntarily but there will be an actuarial reduction.  That has been taken away.  I got confirmation from the company no more than an hour ago, before I came in here, that it will be worse than ever before.  That is scandalous.  It is scandalous of people from the Government parties to say they are doing a great service to these Bord na M&oacute;na people.  Deputies from the midlands have said this in their own constituency.  They have not said these employees are going to be worse off, however.  It is abysmal.<\/p><p> That said, jobs in the midlands will be very hard to get.  Bord na M&oacute;na has a landbank of big acreage but it will be confined in what it can do on that.  Trees do not grow on bogs.  There is a lot of opposition to wind farms and people have objected.  There is a lot of not in my backyard, NIMBYism, going on.  The company has come forward with some good ideas on alternative employment but many of those projects will take time to get up and running because they are startup businesses.  The age profile of current staff members at Bord na M&oacute;na means the vast majority of them will not be able to redeploy to new jobs.<\/p><p> We are anxious that whatever would come up for new employment ideas would specifically target the midlands.  It is the people in the towns and villages of the midlands who are going to suffer.  I am from the midlands myself so I know all about it.  They are really going to suffer because of this process.<\/p><p> The next industry to be affected is the ESB in respect of the coal being burned in ESB stations.  I am concerned about it because Mr. Jim Dullaghan and I both have members in the sector.  ESB is possibly next in line to be caught in this decarbonisation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#C01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Willie Noone","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543948200,"counter":207,"content":"<p>The pain involved in the just transition is clearly manifest in communities in the midlands that are affected by these job losses and it is a daunting prospect for people to face Christmas knowing there will be no job there towards the latter end of next year.  There are many thousands of jobs beyond that at risk, not just in the sectors we are specifically talking about this evening but also in other areas such as, for example, those connected to the agrifood sector which, as we know, is making a significant contribution to emissions.<br\/><br\/>There are two points here.  One is to deal with the crisis, and it is a jobs crisis and has an effect on the communities involved.  There must be a plan to deal with that crisis at a local level with innovative and imaginative alternatives in investment and employment and I can develop some of those points later if the committee wishes.  There is a long-term issue where we need to look at the bigger picture.  As a country, we have a very high rate of greenhouse gas emissions.  That is related to a number of things, one of which is the agriculture sector.  It is not just agriculture, <i>per se<\/i>, but the way we do agriculture.<br\/><br\/>The second important element to bear in mind is spatial planning and the way in which we do construction and planning in the cities, towns and countryside.  There is limited value in increasing the cost of diesel or home heating if, at the same time, we do not invest heavily in both retrofitting and an efficient public transport system.  It is not just about getting people in and out of Dublin from the midlands or elsewhere.  It is about connecting places like Mullingar, Athlone, Tullamore and Newbridge in order that people do not necessarily have to use cars to get to work or to get from one place to another.  That is a very important point on transport.  The national development plan is heavily reliant on motorway construction.  The underlying assumption is that private car ownership will continue to expand, albeit with a transition to electric vehicles.  That is not sustainable.  We need to think much more in terms of an efficient and green public transport system fit for the 21st century.<br\/><br\/>This is the bigger picture.  It is a difficult and painful transition.  When we use the term just transition, we also mean painful transition and it has distributional and regional implications where some regions are disproportionately affected in the short term.  This calls for very difficult decisions and choices and people need to be faced with the evidence and difficulties which will inevitably arise as we need to change our consumption behaviour and patterns of production.  Ireland will not solve the global climate crisis but it does need to show moral leadership.  What we are discussing here this evening is an example that we are going to see repeated again and again when jobs are lost and communities are impacted.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948200,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in to help the committee in its deliberations.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. Joyce when was the energy and national resources sector group established.  Does the Irish Congress of Trade Unions see its role as an influencer, given that it represents up to 800,000 workers?  Does it see itself as an influencer in getting the message of climate action out, as well as dealing with the more practical aspects of the transition in terms of job losses and job creation and all of that?  The nub of it is whether ICTU has accepted that the climate is changing.  Has it accepted the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report?<\/p> <p>  I am from the midlands and I reject Senator Devine dubbing the area as a rust belt.  It is disgraceful and inappropriate to use that kind of language.  The entrepreneurs and the hard-working people who live in the midlands deserve better than that kind of language.  <\/p> <p>  The midlands action plan for jobs had a target of 14,000 to be created up until the end of this year and more than 15,500 have been created thus far.  I do not think we need be concerned about it.  There are, in fact, jobs being created.  The key, of course, is to make sure that people are upskilled.  While I appreciate there are people who are in their 50s who may have spent a lifetime doing a particular job, they still are well capable of being upskilled and they deserve that opportunity.  What do the witnesses see as being a role for the just transition forum?  It seems they are saying that it is just on a regional basis.  Have the witnesses examined whether that is sufficient, considering we are a small island?  I noticed that, in Australia, the example was of a town that put this plan in place in advance of the closure of the power station there.  As it is a continent, one would accept they would be obliged to have regional fora there.  As we are a small country, should we have a national transition forum?  Have the witnesses examined whether the national dialogue on climate action would fulfil that role or whether the regional action plan for jobs implementation committees would fulfil that role?  Is there a role for them?<\/p> <p>  Who would lead the proposed just transition forum?  Would it be the unions?  I know in other countries, the unions take the lead.<\/p><p>There is a great opportunity for new work with the retrofitting that we know is required, particularly on public buildings, local authority houses and so on.  There are skills shortages in that field - the Construction Federation of Ireland says it is bringing in workers from abroad - but surely there are highly-skilled people who could be further upskilled who could be part of that and it might be a great opportunity for them.<\/p><p> Have the unions had any further thoughts on the brown to green policy to replace peat with biomass energy?  Are there other opportunities for workers in this regard?  <\/p><p> Did the unions engage in the public consultation on the national mitigation plan produced last year?  It will clearly have a great impact on people across other sectors as well as energy generation and production, with the decarbonisation of everything in addition to electricity, such as the built environment and so on.

SIPTU submitted a document of almost 15 pages to the Citizens' Assembly and was shortlisted for discussion by assembly members.<\/p> <p>  It was the union movement at international level that put the just transition into the Paris Agreement.  The unions pushed hard at the United Nations climate change conference, COP24, this week, and prior to that, to have a just transition statement.  What this week's declaration means for workers is that they have a seat at the negotiation table, which is crucial.  What we do not have now is social dialogue around these issues.  Senator Devine asked about this in regard to the midlands.  For the past two years, we asked for the Department, under the Ministers, Deputies Naughten and subsequently Bruton, to undertake research on the impact on the midlands but this has not happened.  When the Department was before the committee six weeks ago, officials stated clearly that that research would be ready in January but, in response to parliamentary questions in recent months, they answered that terms of reference for that project were yet to be agreed.

At the moment the shareholder has put out a redundancy package, and I believe the Deputy was on the media stating it was great to get this package out there.  What it means in reality is that people in middle management and supervisory staff on a salary of approximately &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000 are able to get up to two years salary plus statutory payments in a redundancy package, whereas the people on the ground, who are on basic pay of &euro;350 to &euro;450 a week, cannot do so.  That is not fair or just.<\/p><p> That is the reality.  It is grand talking about a pan-national just transition, and the Deputy raised the question of whether it should be done on a national or a regional basis.  I am a Roscommon man.  There are people in my area who have worked at Mount Dillon over generations.  However, it does not come under the midlands because Roscommon is not in the midlands, and to have this done on a regional basis and thereby exclude them is not a just transition.  They are people working in these jobs for generations.  Somebody has to look at this and decide what is fair to the people in the midlands.  Is it fair to come up with a plan that will help people in Donegal or Tralee who are not affected by Bord na Mona closing?  There are people losing jobs at this time.  Can we come up with something specifically tailored for the midlands that will come into effect in the next three or four years?  If not, there is no point trying to cod the people in the midlands by saying we are going to do something for the people in Bord na Mona because, in reality, we are not, and we are just having a talking shop about it.<\/p><p> I face hundreds of workers daily who are asking, \"What is it going to mean for me in three to four years?\"  I do not have the answers.  I am looking for people in those constituencies, like the Deputy, to get down and meet those workers, to come up with real plans.  I want them to tell these people, who may be 61 or 62 years of age, that they are going to get the very same as if they were working in a corner shop down the road, and that they are not going to get one cent extra in their redundancy package.  There is nothing specific for this area.  That is not a just transition.  What we are looking for is something that can be tailored and that can be done.<\/p><p> Who will lead it?

I think we should increase carbon taxes but we should do that in a very careful way that does not damage low income households and that takes cognisance of the fact that, in many cases, such as in rural communities, it is not an option to switch to alternatives to diesel or solid fuel heating, for example.  It is something that needs to seen as part of a strategic investment plan.<\/p> <p>  The role of carbon taxes is twofold.  One is to raise money for investment in renewables and in green energy, and the other is to help people to change their behaviour.  However, one cannot help people to change their behaviour if there are not other options in terms of, for example, heating or transport.  It needs to be a joined-up effort.  To that extent, there are good examples in other countries of where carbon taxes can be ring-fenced and part of the benefits of a fund can be paid back to households by way of a dividend, which could be used for better insulation and retrofitting.  There is a connection to what we were just talking about in regard to the midlands because a high proportion of the housing stock, particularly in the midlands, is of a low insulation standard.  There is a challenge to bring a significant proportion of the housing stock up to A or B building energy rating, and that requires a certain mix of skills and it probably involves a new range of enterprise activity.  It also means that households could benefit through a system of dividends paid back from a transition fund which is partly funded from carbon taxes.  However, I emphasise the lessons from other countries, for example, France, of how not to do this and of how to create a strong public reaction that sees this as an attack on people's living standards, with regional implications.  It is important to get that balance right.<\/p> <p>  The key point alongside carbon taxes, and even more important than them, is that the State should lead investment through an entrepreneurial effort.  ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na, in particular, have the opportunity to launch new activities through the development of, for example, solar and wind power.  We do not realise how much access we have to solar power in this country, although this might seem surprising, but the east and south east, in particular, have the possibility of developing new energies.  This can be done across the bogs by installing giant solar panels.  There are also examples in the area of wind power from Denmark, where community co-operatives are linked into the electricity grid.  They have made a transition over three decades and, through wind power, have weaned themselves off much of their dependence on fossil fuels and imported energy.  The key issue in Denmark, I understand, is that communities were given a stake in these community co-operatives.  This is a crucial point.  In places like Offaly, Roscommon and Longford, for example, understandably in come cases, there is a strong reaction against some new forms of activity, including wind turbines.  One way to get people into owning the problem is to give them an ownership stake.  That may also be a possibility for workers who are made redundant.  Perhaps there are possibilities of worker co-operatives developing new services and activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948200,"counter":230,"content":"<p>A remark was addressed to me by Mr. Noone that I want to comment on.

What was always going to be one of weaknesses of the Citizens' Assembly is dealing with the politics of climate change.  It very clearly stated what it stated, and it is up to this committee to deal with the reality on the ground.  The ICTU witnesses are the first witnesses to have come before the committee to outline exactly what that involves and I thank Mr. Noone, in particular, for outlining what the reality is for people, many of whom may have spent a lifetime working for a company with a particular skillset.  Because of the age cohort of some of them, they simply will not work again after this.  As he said, the mean age is 56, so the average remaining working life for that group in the company is 12 years.  I am 54 and I hope the next 12 years are among the most productive in my life.<\/p> <p>  I want to focus on one word in the opening statement - \"impact\".  It is a small word and easy to overlook.<\/p><p>I do not like the approach which states that people can upskill or train.  It is not as easy as that.  The word &quot;impact&quot; captures the necessity of that.  Someone could have been working for a company for 30 years and it is all he or she knows, which is what Senator Devine was talking about.  In the United States, people relied utterly on specific industries and, almost overnight, they disappeared, hence the name &quot;rust belt&quot;.  It is not a criticism and it does not assign a label to a particular part of this country.  It borrows from the experiences of another country where communities were left devastated.  That point has to be made.  It is too easy for us to say that people can upskill and do this or that.  I am focusing on the word &quot;impact&quot; and on the human element of what people are facing .  That involves a range of things.  While it can be a significant opportunity for some, it can be frightening for others.  That is why I welcome our guests' contributions.  The idea that they could easily transition to other jobs gives rise to fear and is intimidating for people.  This was my introduction to this transition forum idea and I thank the witnesses for bringing it to us.  Preparation has to be done.  People have multiple needs aside from income and work.  There is an issue with confidence.  Some people do not have the confidence and have to be mentored to move from a phase of employment life into another, which is especially challenging.  That is not lost on me but I do not want to labour the point.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Healy's contribution was particularly thought-provoking in the context of the opportunities that may lie ahead.  ICTU has to persuade people.  Some members of the committee visited Tipperary last week.  As the clerk to the committee stated , we saw many of the things we had been talking about here in theory.  We were grounded by a number of the things we saw happening with the Tipperary Energy Agency.  We also heard about communities.  What Mr. Noone said about wind energy is interesting, namely, that there has been a loss of appetite for it and that it is controversial.  One group we met indicated that a contributory reason for this is that communities were promised a direct benefit from wind energy.  They were promised there would be local community fora and buy-in, and that there would be a community dividend when wind energy came to their town.  That has not transpired.  Corporate bodies have received the dividends.  We need to go back and look at wind energy.  If it is true that solar panels could be laid across the bog, with all the economic and employment benefits that would derive from doing so, that simply cannot happen without the community having ownership of it.  The latter could be ownership in having some energy dividend personally or being involved in the construction.  That involves training, etc.  We cannot have a situation where a multinational or big corporate company comes in, takes ownership of the bog and does what it wants.  Solar or other energy alternatives must come from the community.  If there is one lesson we learned from last week, it is that communities lost interest in wind energy because promises about things from which they would have benefited directly were never followed through on.  I ask our guests to provide feedback on that.<br\/><br\/>Reference was made to the ESB and coal.  Last week, someone mentioned the book <i>Who Moved My Cheese?<\/i>during our visit to Tipperary.  The only criticism I have of Mr. Noone is that the timeline has been brought from 2030 to 2025.  I am not a Minister.  I am talking as a layman and citizen.  That could be brought back to 2020.  Mr. Noone must have seen this coming.  Other industries must have seen it coming.  They must act as persuaders and informers, even sitting down with companies and saying it is coming even if companies say it is not, and not to be surprised when it happens.  One can see from David Attenborough's contribution in Poland during the week that it is becoming more urgent.  We have been appallingly poor at addressing this climate change and timelines will probably have to be pulled back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#F00700","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543948200,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Deputy Brian Stanley took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Our guests need time to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#G00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Mr. Healy mentioned that there may be more employment opportunities.

We were not surprised.  The workers at Bord na M&oacute;na were not surprised that they were going to stop working with peat or that the timeframe for this was brought forward.  They could feel what was happening in the recent years on the wind.  They are surprised that there has been a lot of talk by politicians and the trade unions, and by all commentators, whether ex-Presidents or the Citizens' Assembly, that the people involved should be treated fairly.  This is the third time I will say this: it has surprised them that people are now being told that their jobs are gone and they are not getting one red cent extra.  There are people in their 60s who have been told that their jobs are gone and that the package that has been offered to them is inferior to what has been offered to other semi-State workers in the recent past who are not going through a decarbonisation policy.  They feel they should come under the umbrella of a just transition.  They are surprised that there are people who should be putting their shoulder to the wheel to ensure they are treated fairly who are not doing so.  They are not looking for anything beyond what they think their entitlements are.  It is very unfair that there are people who are very capable of getting jobs and who have good skill sets, specifically in senior and middle management, who will get a golden handshake and probably walk into jobs fairly shortly afterwards.  As the Deputy stated, there are people in the age group who cannot do that and they are being treated unfairly.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lahart mentioned a dividend for the wind farms.  I agree that if wind farms are coming in, there has to be a direct connection to the community so they can get a dividend from that.  The Deputy mentioned solar panels.  I do not know if a suggestion of mine will get traction.  It is currently Government policy to give a 40% grant for people who put solar panels on their houses.  I suggest that the grant be increased and targeted at the midlands.  They can be put on local authority houses, including in such places as Banagher, Birr, Tullamore and Mullingar.  That will attract work to the midlands and benefit the people in the midlands.  It should be easily possible if the political will is present.  There is a mountain of ideas if one talks to people in the midlands about what could come about.  It is all energy-related and targeted directly at the midlands.  The Deputy mentioned solar panels.

I alluded to some examples earlier because those examples are not specific to an industry.  They look at how we move our entire country and all our workers into a low carbon economy, starting with the workers in the high-carbon industries and moving onwards.  For example, some forums are examining how we counterbalance this by investing in low carbon industries such as care work, where many women are working, the arts or education and how we invest our money there.  Those sectors are growing, which is important as well.  It is an all-encompassing approach.<\/p> <p>  Our energy sector committees and other committees deal with the workers who will be impacted upon first.  In any union there are shop stewards and committees and we are engaging with them constantly, but what is missing is that social dialogue decision making forum in which we move from the concept and having the just transition on paper to the practicalities of how we do that, discuss it around the table and make a decision on how we move forward.  At present, we do not have that.  There has to be some leadership from the Government in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Yvonne O'Callaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Ms O'Callaghan said there is a just transition centre.

One was the establishment of a tri-party body comprising the trade unions, employers and the Government to ensure the transition.  That was one type of body for action at central level.  There was also the question of establishing the just transition fund, which is happening at European level as well, and what that means at national level.  Importantly, there is the study of the impact that meeting our goals in the Paris Agreement will have on communities and industry, and legislation backing that up in terms of the principles of the just transition.  The committee has been liaising with the Department in terms of research and trying to do research studies but it has not advanced.  That is part of the problem.  We all recognise that it is a big problem and it has a huge impact.  The things we will have to roll out are not going to happen in a piecemeal way.  A programmed approach is required for this.

We have been highlighting the transition.  There is an opportunity in changing from what could be termed the brown revolution to a sustainable revolution and in terms of new industries.  Many of the workers are concerned that there will not be the same number of jobs.  Mr. Noone is best placed to give a view on this as he is on the ground.  What is the best way to find an alternative that can provide substantial employment?  The board is looking at a number of options around energy, horticulture and aquaculture.  All of us who have been Bord na M&oacute;na employees know that neither horticulture nor fuel will create the same level of work as there was in peat extraction.  That is a great concern.  Has the ICTU looked at other industries?  The board has outlined its big three areas.  All of us desperately want to see employment.  It is very important that it is maintained.  We are talking about communities where there was very little until the 1950s.  Older people who remember how it was before then will tell us how difficult it was in those areas.

Bord na M&oacute;na has come forward with plans.  Our view is that it has made some bad decisions in the recent past.  However, we have been told that it has had these plans robustly audited and checked for risk regarding the industries it has proposed.  We can only accept its bona fides.  Bord na M&oacute;na believes the quantum of jobs will be equal to the number of jobs that are being lost.  The problem we have is with the age profile in the company.  These jobs may not come on-stream quick enough to aid the people who are currently losing their jobs.  That is also tied in with the redundancy package, which I keep bringing up.  The quantum of the redundancy package is not the issue, in case anyone might think it is.  The issue is the fairness of how it is being distributed.  The company is telling us it will select people for redundancy on financial criteria.  That means it will make whatever selection is most financially advantageous to the company.  It will intend to let people with 25 years' service go and keep people who may be in their 60s.  As far the company is concerned, it is more financially advantageous to get rid of those who may be in their 30s or 40s.  Our view is that it should exit those who are in their 60s and who at this stage are not going to be re-employed in a job that may come on-stream in five or six years because they will be too old.  The company needs to let those older people out and re-skill and retrain those who are in their 30s and 40s and who will be able to benefit.

The challenge is that the State needs to step up to play a role of co-ordination and leadership even though many other actors are involved.  We need to realise as well that a blueprint is not possible but a broad plan is.  We do not know what way technology is going to evolve.  Even in the past five years, the technology for solar power has been transformed.  The costs have come down.  It is a different situation now from when we went into recession.  This is where we need imaginative and creative thinking.  It could come, perhaps, from some of those workers in Newbridge who are in an administrative or support role.  I do not know the details; Mr. Noone may know more.  Why are we laying off workers?  Why are we not considering creating new lines of activity and new possibilities?  In the main, new enterprises, particularly in the midlands, will probably come from new areas, some of which we are not even thinking about.  We need to be ahead of the curve.  We have a lot to learn from Denmark about how it made that transition I mentioned earlier in respect of wind generation.<\/p> <p>  In the 1940s we had a national emergency.  Fuel was running out.  Imports of coal and oil were very low and people were put to shovel-ready work.  That was the spirit behind Bord na M&oacute;na.  Subsequently, the flourishing of many semi-State enterprises really filled a gap.  That is what we need to think about again.  It is a different context but the challenge is still there.  Just waiting for other people to do it for us, whether they are multinationals or science experts, is not enough.  There is a need now to develop some of these new lines of activity.  I strongly suspect the urgency is not there is public policy.  This is a real crisis internationally as well as nationally.  We need to redouble efforts and investment.

One of the presentations referred to the deal struck by Spanish unions in October 2018 as being a just transition deal with the Government in respect of the coal miners, and that there would be a fund of &euro;250 million invested in those communities.  Perhaps we could hear where that money has come from and what the process was for getting there.<\/p> <p>  We had Bord na M&oacute;na here a few weeks ago making a presentation.  I am a bit confused listening to Mr. Noone because Bord na M&oacute;na indicated to us that the redundancies were being made on a voluntary basis and therefore it was for workers who wished to seek to be made redundant, at least at this juncture.  Will Mr. Noone clarify whether that is the case?  I would agree with Mr. Healy, as would everybody, I suppose.  We have to be innovative in respect of new jobs.  When Bord na M&oacute;na was here, it cited, for example, a tyre recycling plant that was being established with 50 new jobs in the area.  This was an example of the sustainable type of industry that is required.<\/p><p>I wonder whether an application has been sought.  Has Bord na M&oacute;na made an application under the climate action fund?  Has it been suggested to it that it should do so?  Are ideas forthcoming in relation to what alternatives there might be?  We constantly hear that we are not hitting targets and that we are behind.  In my view, we are often short on detail on what the alternatives might be.  We have all established that there is a problem here that needs to be addressed.  We need lots of ideas now, especially because we are drawing up a report.  Solar farms and wind farms on bogs have been mentioned as alternatives.  I assume that when those farms are operational, there will be an operational fund that will be paid for community benefit or gain.  Is that what is envisaged when such alternatives are mentioned?  Would the funding pool be used for entrepreneurship and for the development of alternative sustainable energies in this area?<\/p><p> I would like to make a point on a more macro level.  The workers we are talking about are those in the energy and natural resources sector.  When we talk about transition, we must focus on the people who have the most potential.  I know the main focus has been on Bord na M&oacute;na workers.  We do not need a crystal ball as we try to look at how this will affect them.  The closure of Bellacorick power station in my home county of Mayo caused devastation from which the community is still recovering.  The tower came down in 2010.  The jobs were lost before that.  We already have evidence of what happens in rural communities.  I am just getting to my point.  It seems possible that the just transition will hit people in rural areas hardest.  The national organisations represent workers right across the board.  I imagine that those who will have the fewest options are people in rural areas.  We are feeding into policies like Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan.  We will have regional plans to implement those policies.  To what extent is worker migration being considered?  We are all about sustainability.  The ideal is that we take workers, the imbalance is addressed and we see more sustainable growth in these rural areas.  Do the witnesses feed into national policy in this area?  Do they have their own policies on it?  Would they agree with my assertion that workers in rural Ireland are going to fare worse than their counterparts who are represented by the unions that are here today?  A worker in the fossil fuel industry in Dublin will have way more options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#J00800","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543948200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I ask the witnesses to keep their answers brief because the Senator's five minutes are nearly up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#K00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543948200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I will answer the questions that relate specifically to Bord Na M&oacute;na.

I know that reinvestment is happening in those regions now.  As Mr. Noone and others have pointed out, these industries have generations of workers.  We want to make sure new generations of workers with new skills for new types of clean energy are coming into these industries.  It is important to emphasise that the just transition involves keeping everybody in those areas.  It is important for us to keep the worker migration point in mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#K03000","nonspeaker":"Ms Yvonne O'Callaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948200,"counter":292,"content":"<p>We are moving on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#K03100","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948200,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I also asked about applications under the climate action fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#K03200","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948200,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I ask the witnesses to be brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#K03300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543948200,"counter":295,"content":"<p>We are not aware of any such applications.

I have two questions, the first of which is for ICTU.  I thank Mr. Joyce for the interesting presentation.  I want to tease out some of the detail of what he has said about the just transition in so far as it relates to the Bord na M&oacute;na workers.  Three examples of countries where transition deals for workers were done - Australia, Spain and Germany - have been cited as a kind of template, but no detail has been given.  Does Mr. Joyce have detail of the deal?  He gave a small bit of detail of the &euro;250 million deal that has been agreed by Government employers in respect of the coal-mining industry in Spain.  Given that the Spanish coal-mining industry is massive, &euro;250 million does not sound like a massive figure.  Could such examples be applied to the sort of thing about which Mr. Noone was talking?  What sort of redundancy payments will be made?  Will the workers who have been transitioning over to other types of work retain their pay, conditions and pensions etc.?  That sort of detail is being demanded by workers in Roscommon, Dublin and Clare who want to know whether they will have security in their pay, terms, hours and pensions.  If they are to be made redundant, they need to know they will be looked after properly.  If we do not get this right, we are in for a pile of trouble.  If we do not bring people with us and treat them fairly, we are in for a pile of trouble because we do not have a lot of time.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the carbon tax itself.  Several references have been made to it.<\/p><p>What has happened in France with the yellow vests, the <i>gilets jaunes<\/i>, has really changed the narrative on this.  For example, the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said in the D&aacute;il today that we have to be careful about how we introduce the measure.  This is the first time this was said.  The yellow-vest protests and the climb-back of Macron's Government have had a real impact.  There is probably a lesson in this for the Bord na M&oacute;na workers in that if they want just transition, they will probably have to fight for it rather than expect it to be delivered.<br\/><br\/>On the carbon tax, is it not now time to say the carbon tax has to be delivered as a tax on profit and wealth rather than a tax on ordinary people, who are not benefitting from just transition and did not create the climate change problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#K06100","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543948200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>With reference to the Spanish example, we are seeking detail from the unions on the specific terms.

They successfully turned it around.  I refer to the plan announced last month.  The number involved in coal-mining in Spain has diminished significantly in recent years.  There is not a great number involved and the industry is confined to three regions in the north of Spain, including Asturias and Castilla y Le&oacute;n.

That will be important to the committee in its deliberations.<\/p> <p>  There was a notice on the ICTU website about a conference in May on just transition.  It outlined four points, including the establishment of a tripartite body comprising unions, employers and the Government, the establishment of a just transition fund, and a study of the impact of meeting our goals under the Paris Agreement on fossil fuel-dependent communities in Ireland.

Something needs to happen in this regard.  We need to operate beyond the Government.

It was to be the example to which we could all refer as the big glorious project in which the workers transitioned and were treated fairly.  We are getting a very strong sense today, however, that the workers are not getting packages that are commensurate with their years of service.  This committee has to take that very seriously.  When the Bord na M&oacute;na representatives were before us, they spoke about the 11 town hall meetings they had.  I hope no gloss or spin was put on that.

Mr. Noone has expressed some views on that.  They spoke about recycling and tourism.  My question is simple.  There was mention of town hall engagement with workers but do workers who are not seeking to subscribe to the voluntary redundancy scheme have a legitimate expectation within Bord na M&oacute;na currently to transition to other areas in the company?

The 11 town hall meetings mentioned by the Deputy were generated by the company and they took place following the announcement of the redundancy package.  It was a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.

I hope that will happen.  If a sufficient number take the package, it will be easier to exit people etc.  The fairness of the package is causing much disgruntlement with people.  We believe the scheme will be oversubscribed and the company will then select the people who will leave, and that will be done unfairly.  I know there are people in the company with 42 or 43 years of service and although they expect to retire, they will be told they are not allowed to go and will have to stay until they are 65.  There are people in their late 50s who will look to get their pension and although they can leave, they will not get any pension.  It is a change from what was in place three months ago.  If those people had gone three months ago, before the package was developed, they could have received their pension but they are now being told they cannot get it.  It is crazy stuff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Willie Noone"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948200,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Are the goalposts being shifted on a constant basis by the management?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2018120400002#M00300","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1543948200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>That is correct.

Do they agree that the main structure we seek is a mediation service?  I mean an independently fully resourced and skilled team who can be brought in and used when areas are designated to be in need of a specific just transition plan.  I do not have a long tradition in the negotiating process.  However, I know that the mediation process is not binding.  I know that it is fully State resourced and has all of the expertise that we can marshal to provide a mediation service between workers, employers and communities in the just transition process.  Do the witnesses think that structure is the right approach in terms of establishing a just transition commission to assist in this process?<\/p> <p>  I will ask all my three questions and the witnesses can answer them together.  I agree very much with Mr. Dullaghan when he said that the State will have to lead a lot of this work.  We are going to back to our future in terms of State leadership unlike the electrification of our country.  I was very disappointed that Bord na M&oacute;na, in its new strategy, did not see the opportunity I see that the company must have in the &euro;50 billion project to retrofit buildings, which we need to do in the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  I see Bord na M&oacute;na having a role in that.  Rather than laying off people in Newbridge, Bord na M&oacute;na will have to employ hundreds of additional people in Newbridge to set up apprenticeships for 1,000 carpenters, 1,000 heating engineers, 1,000 plumbers and 1,000 glaziers to manage its biggest and most important project.  If we can go back to Bord na M&oacute;na and say, \"rather than excluding that from your option of menus and just going with the options that you have set out, go big in terms of the State showing that we can be brilliant at creating an apprenticeship system that gives the youth of the midlands a future.\"  Do the witnesses agree with such a strategy option?  <\/p> <p>  Engagement on this should be a continuation of the record that we also have in partnership.  To me, the partnership process has served this country well.  The governance structure of this initiative will see it centred around the Taoiseach's office.  In other words, Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General, Department of the Taoiseach and the Secretary General for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment would set the sights of the Action Plan for Jobs at the core of the State.  The unions have a good connection with the Department of the Taoiseach through the partnership process.  Does such a governance structure make sense to the witnesses?

I thank the select committee for giving me the opportunity to attend to assist in its consideration of the Supplementary Estimate which has been requested for my Department.  The requirement is for an additional amount of nearly &euro;182 million which comprises two major elements.  On the expenditure side, there is provision for &euro;147 million in additional expenditure to meet superannuation costs.  There is also a contingency provision in the order of &euro;35 million for European Social Fund receipts.  I will oultine briefly the reasons for both elements of the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware that my Department has sought Supplementary Estimates to meet superannuation costs a number of times in recent years.  They resulted from the gap between the allocation made to meet pension costs and actual expenditure to meet ongoing pension costs and pension gratuity payments.  This issue has also affected other parts of the public sector.  There has been an upward trend in the overall number of pensioners in the education sector.  In 2014 pensioner numbers in the sector were estimated as being in the order of 42,500.  Next year, we expect the figure to be closer to 49,000.  As the committee is aware, it can be difficult to predict with absolute certainty the number of retirements in any particular year.  This is primarily because teachers account for the vast majority of retirements in the education sector, but only a very small percentage of teachers retire on compulsory age grounds.  The specific number of teachers who will retire in any given year will vary, but the trend has been broadly constant for a number a years.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the position in 2018.  The amount we were allocated in budget 2018 would have provided for pension gratuities and pension costs for some 773 retirees in schools and 76 retirees in the institute of technology sector.  The Supplementary Estimate will provide for the cost of an additional 1,319 retirements in the school sector, bringing the overall number to 2,092, and 143 in the institute of technology sector, bringing the overall number to 219.  The Supplementary Estimate will provide for ongoing pension costs, where there is also an under-provision.  I am pleased to say that, following significant engagement between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;147 million in additional funding is to be provided in 2019 to meet superannuation costs in the education sector.  This figure has been calculated with reference to actuarial forecasts and will mitigate the need for a Supplementary Estimate to meet pension costs in 2019.<\/p> <p>  The second major element of the Supplementary Estimate is a contingency provision for European Social Fund receipts.  My Department's original Estimate for 2018 included a conservative forecast that some &euro;34.7 million would be received in receipts related to a European Social Fund claim due to be paid in 2018.  The Department made this claim to the relevant European authorities in November and our expectation is that it will result in receipts of &euro;109 million which will be brought to account by the Department of Education and Skills by the end of the year.  When dealing with amounts of this scale, it is obviously necessary to take a highly prudent approach.  Given that at the time the Supplementary Estimate was being considered by the Government, we had not yet received this funding in the Department's accounts, it was considered appropriate to provide for a contingency in the unlikely event that the money was not received until next year.  I want to make it clear that it is purely a technical exercise related to the timing of claims and recoupments and necessary to avoid any risk of an excess Vote.  My Department is confident that we will receive the &euro;109 million in this year of account and that it will be remitted to the Exchequer.  In the highly unlikely event that we do not receive the funds until next year, it is important to stress that it is merely a timing issue and that there will be no loss of funds to the State.<\/p> <p>  I again thank the committee for its consideration of the Supplementary Estimate.

Unfortunately, they are not all related to the subject matter of the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  The pension issue arises year in, year out.  It is no joke - it is a significant amount of money.  We receive assurances every year that it will be sorted by the following year, but that has not come to pass.  The Department does not seem to be able to deal with the issue which has to do with forecasting.<\/p><p>The forecasting of teacher supply is constantly underestimated.  I wonder sometimes if it is an accounting trick.  A grant to a school or a programme can always be cancelled but the pensions must be paid.  Is this simply an accounting trick played every year to ensure the Department can get an extra &euro;100 million and then go back for the Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year because the Oireachtas cannot refuse funding for pensions?  What has happened in the Department to change this?<\/p><p> The issue about the European Social Fund is very strange.  Why was the application only made in November if the Department is expecting funding to be in place this year?  Is there a reason for that?  It seems to be the case of \"the money was only resting in the account\" from the Department's perspective, because it is claiming a Supplementary Estimate that it hopes will not be needed.  In that eventuality, it will be passed back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  If it does not it will go into the account.  I am not sure this is a good way to deal with hundreds of millions of euro, and it causes me some concern in the context of the fact that the share of voted expenditure allocated to education has been decreasing over the last number of years.  Education is not getting its fair share.  It had been allocated 16.6% of overall voted expenditure but in 2018, it has decreased to 16.3%.  I do not know how this couple of hundred million euro, thrown in at the end and for which we will see no educational benefit, will affect those percentages.  It is disappointing, and it shows a significant lack of prioritisation by the Government.  It is highly unfair.  These figures have been provided by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  They have not been noted by anyone; very few of us have spoken out about this.  It is really worrying.  The fact that it has been getting a smaller share of the pie each year for the last number of years speaks loudly to the Government's commitment to education.  I would not like to see the figures massaged by money that will rest temporarily in the account or a temporary extraordinary figure for pensions where students would not actually see a benefit.  The Minister should comment on that and tell us what he will do to ensure that education will become more of a priority for the Government when it comes to budgets.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2018120400002#B02100","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543937400,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan raised the issue of teacher supply.  She will be aware that there is a working group on teacher supply, which is chaired by the Secretary General at the Department.  We are working on a number of measures, including some we can take straight away such as, for example, changing the rules on teachers returning from career breaks.  We are also looking at outreach opportunities focusing on teachers young and not so young working in the south east of England and in the United Arab Emirates.  We are launching a promotional and marketing drive over Christmas, and intend to roll out several such campaigns.  Teacher supply is a big issue.  On the specific issue of retirees, the combined figure for retired teachers working in primary schools and secondary schools in the year 2017-18 was 1,342.  That figure highlights the nature and the scale of the demand and the pressures on the system.  There are constraints and challenges in the capital city and different constraints and challenges in rural areas but overall, there is a big demand for teachers, as the Deputy pointed out, and we want to keep the focus on this issue.  I certainly want to keep the focus on it.  I am also engaged with the Teaching Council.  Deputies, Senators and different school groups can sense a frustration when we are trying to register teachers.  While there are reasons for that as well, it is an area on which I am working very closely with my officials to ensure there are ways in which we can speed up the response to that major issue.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has knowledge of the superannuation issue from her previous role.  We had Supplementary Estimates, and they are contained in the information pack provided.  Totals of &euro;40 million, &euro;30 million, &euro;37 million and &euro;71 million were provided on the teacher side in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.  Those figures do not include the institute of technology sector.  To dovetail into Deputy Thomas Byrne's questions around this type of practice, I am reliably informed that it is not an accounting trick.  Having researched this matter myself and having asked the question as to why we end up in this situation - which does not only affect this Department - I have found there are legacy issues, given where we were and the constraints on resources in recent years.  I have been assured that this figure will mitigate against having to provide a Supplementary Estimate.  I am on public record on that now.  Although nobody knows where we will be this time next year, I am convinced that the work being done by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will ensure that this issue does not arise every year.  In fairness to the Department, there was no miscalculation of numbers.  Those figures are too wide, given where we were a couple of months ago and where we are now.  I accept the fact that we are coming from a position where there were great challenges on our resources and choices had to be made in 2011, 2012 and 2013.  It also highlights the enormous challenge we face in terms of pensions, not just in the Department of Education and Skills but throughout the public service and Civil Service.  We will have to find extra resources, and decisions will have to be made in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  As for the issue of the Department's spending and whether there has been an increase or decrease, if one looks back over the figures it is clear that they fluctuate over the years.  My personal commitment, the commitment of the Government and the commitment of the Oireachtas to education is front and centre stage at all times.  It is the third biggest departmental spend and &euro;10.8 billion will be spent in 2019.  There is always an issue with extra resources, but as an economy grows and improves and as demographics in counties such as Dublin, Wicklow, Louth, Meath and Kildare change, the pressures change.  I have asked for figures on the growth in those places where populations are growing.  We have to respond to that.  We are not, however, just looking at what is happening next year or in 2020.  This must fit into the ten-year capital plan and how we gauge population growth in those areas.  The officials in the Department and I are committed to ensuring that we continue to fight for our fair share of the distribution of funding at budget time.  That will continue to be the focus.  Cross-collaboration between Departments must also be pointed out.  Each Department must look after its own funding but much work is taking place on a cross-collaborative basis as well.  Education does not work in a silo and never has.  It has always worked with industry.  Even in the projects I have visited in my capacity as Minister in recent months, including the IBM project at Larkin community college or the work being done with Microsoft at Dublin City University, there is much cross-cutting work going on in the education sector.  It is a creative space.  I certainly will be focusing on keeping up with technological advancement as well, but that is a discussion for another day.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2018120400002#C00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1543937400,"counter":401,"content":"<p>The Minister and his officials are welcome.

The fact the number of retirees was 63% more than what was estimated is incredible.  The figure was underestimated by over two thirds.  The bigger issue, which touches on what Deputy Jan O'Sullivan said, is whether we have a significant number of teachers retiring early.  If it is the case, we need to try to understand why they are doing so.  Is the job so onerous that people feel they have to retire early?  I completely understand it in the case of teaching principals.  I attended their conference last Saturday week.  Quite a significant number - I think one third - of teaching principals are retiring early.  If there is a problem, we need to be able to try to get to the root of it.  There has been an additional Supplementary Estimate every year since 2014.  It seems it is being continually underfunded which does not make sense.

He asked about the numbers of projected pensioners and additional retirees.

There will be resource challenges in the future and decisions will have to be made in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to the Chairman's question about why teachers retire and why some retire young, some do not.  Some do a specific number of years and then decide to stay on for one reason or another.  There is a question around - let us call a spade a spade - the pressures of the job and the stresses that go with it.  The committee has done a lot of work in terms of well-being and anxiety focused on pupils and students but it has also focused on the teachers.  It is an all-school well-being model.  There are extra pressures and demands.  On the creative side, there is more flexibility, even within the junior certificate curriculum, to allow more bottom-up, locally-led projects empowering teachers and students to have more control over the curriculum.  It is an addition.  It is a changed world.  It has changed since when I taught in 1993, 1994 and 1995.  The classroom is not just a room of instruction any more.  There are many aspects to it in terms of looking after and caring for students, motivation and dealing with wider issues, including family issues.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman also asked what we have done about pensions and she compared it with the Army.  The Department has carried out a similar exercise as that carried out with the Army pensions.  Conversations have gone on within the Department and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There have also been conversations at a cross-departmental level.  The Chairman asked how confident we are that we will not be in the same position again next year looking for another Supplementary Estimate.  I see the former Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, smiling.  Perhaps she has been in the same position as me.

When 3,000 workers in my own county lost their jobs as a result of the closure of Fruit of the Loom, and when Unifi in Letterkenny closed a few years after that, we faced the massive challenge of getting the local workforce reskilled and reinvented.  Adult literacy was a big part of our approach to personal development.  Our adult education sector took a hand-in-glove approach to that.

This section amends 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Section 851A provides the basis for confidentiality of taxpayer information.  It also provides the basis for the circumstances in which such information can be disclosed by the Revenue Commissioners, including the limited circumstances in which such information can be disclosed to the Department of Finance.  The proposed amendment will address a conflict between the legislative provisions of section 851A and those of the Freedom of Information Act, which currently prevents the Department of Finance from providing records to the Office of the Information Commissioner even when it is statutorily required to do so in the context of the operation of the freedom of information legislation.<\/p> <p>  This change in law is necessitated by a specific issue which has arisen.  This issue arose during the course of a review of the freedom of information decision by the Information Commissioner which, in part, involved records which are taxpayer confidential.  Under the current provisions of section 851A, officials in the Department of Finance are precluded from providing these records to the Information Commissioner as to do so would constitute a criminal offence.  However, on the other hand, under the Freedom of Information Act, there is a statutory requirement to furnish this information to the Information Commissioner and failure to comply may constitute a criminal offence.  This results in a highly unsatisfactory legal position with conflicting legislative provisions and this prevents the Department from providing the records to the Information Commissioner as it wishes to do so.<\/p><p>The proposed amendment to section 851A should address this legislative conflict and remove the anomaly.  It will ensure that the requisite records can be provided to the Information Commissioner so that the commissioner can conduct a review and fulfil his statutory function without further delay.<\/p><p> Department of Finance officials had initially explored the possibility of including this amendment in this year's Finance Bill.  However, the Department was advised that the proposed amendment was inappropriate for inclusion in a money Bill given that it did not have money Bill status.  Therefore, it is necessary to use an alternative, such as this Bill, to bring forward the amendment.  Under the measure, the Department of Finance can receive confidential taxpayer information from the Revenue Commissioners solely for specific limited purposes, namely, in the context of policy formulation and in connection with state aid matters.  It is important to note that any Revenue officer or any person, including Department of Finance officials, to whom taxpayer information is disclosed and who knowingly provides to any person any taxpayer information or uses any taxpayer information otherwise than in the course of administering or enforcing the tax Acts shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to criminal sanction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120400002#B02400","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543932000,"counter":470,"content":"<p>Do I take it that the information is provided by an official in the Department of Finance as opposed to the Revenue Commissioners?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120400002#C00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1543932000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance officials may have information relating to the tax status of a company.

This is to cover costs incurred by the OPW for the papal visit and an estimated additional spend of &euro;4 million on new works, alterations and additions for a number of projects including emergency work, ancillary works on energy retrofit projects, lift replacement programme, work on Leinster House and the Department of Justice and Equality rationalisation programme.<\/p> <p>  The main part of this Supplementary Estimate, at &euro;18 million, relates to costs of the work undertaken by the OPW on the visit of Pope Francis to Ireland.  On request from the Taoiseach's office earlier this year, the OPW fully committed to providing its resources to plan and assist in organising this event.  However, it should be noted that there were no funds allocated to the OPW within its 2018 Estimate for an event of this magnitude.  There was an understanding that additional funds would be provided on completion of the work by the OPW and I am here to request that the committee approves this Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  A number of queries arose at the last meeting regarding the procurement of goods and services for this event.  The first aspect that needs to be acknowledged is the extremely short timeframe from the date the Department of the Taoiseach requested the OPW to plan for this event to the actual date of the papal visit.  Hence, the OPW used a combination of tendering competitions where possible and existing multi-year frameworks for a number of contracts that had been put in place, together with the Office of Government Procurement for the decade of centenaries.  All suppliers on the existing framework had successfully been through the rigours of a public request for tender process and have to date fulfilled all obligations as laid out in their respective contracts.<\/p> <p>  At the last committee meeting, Deputies were very considerate and complimentary of the excellent work carried out by the OPW on this event.\u00a0 I would like to reiterate my thanks for the hard work the OPW put into ensuring that this event was carried out in a highly professional and effective manner.  To put into perspective the magnitude of the event, it was viewed by 1.1 million viewers from 159 countries, with 1,200 journalists from 31 countries accredited for the event.\u00a0 We, as Deputies, and our colleagues in government can be proud of how Ireland was portrayed nationally and internationally by this event.  Hence, it is my opinion that we should support <\/p> <p>  Before I conclude, I remind members that the OPW is consistently available to Government to respond to these large-scale infrastructural projects and will do everything in its power to obtain value for money in carrying out its function, which is a very wide remit spanning from flood risk to estate and heritage management.  I am happy to recommend this Supplementary Estimate for approval by the committee and to answer any questions that may arise.  We circulated answers to the questions put to us last week.  I have also circulated the figures required by the committee.  I am happy to take questions relating to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120400002#G00400","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1543932000,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State but, unfortunately, the information came in very late.

The public would not do that for a similar private event by a political organisation, social movement or the organisers of a concert or football match.  In the cases of all those major events, the costs would be covered by the private organisation in question.  This raises a fundamental question about the relationship of church and State.  The public is made up of Catholics and non-Catholics, and everybody has their absolute right to practise their religion.  However, the public is being asked <i>en masse<\/i>to pay for a private religious event of one private religion, in this case the Catholic Church.

Some of this is quite complicated because there is so much detail involved, as the members can see from figures such as 2,916 stewards.  There are many queries, checks and cross-checks until we are satisfied that the invoices can be paid.  In some cases we are dealing with multiple small suppliers and the main contractor cannot invoice the Office of Public Works until it in turn is invoiced by multiple smaller suppliers, some of which are voluntary organisations.

First, we had to go out to tender for the gates.  This does not come about by just sending out a tender; there were different people involved in heritage issues from other Departments to look at how we would go about this.  The gates are a protected structure and are part of the Phoenix Park.  In order to get the gates properly in place for the event and afterwards, and for money to be spent on them, it is not just a case of repainting the gates and putting them back up.  I shall outline what goes along with that.  In taking the gates down originally, some stonework and pillars had to be removed.  They had to be rebuilt and put in place.  Steelwork had to be in place.  We also had to incur costs on tarmacadam and archaeologists because to put these gates back into place we were interfering with the road works.  Included in those costs are the collective costs in putting the gates back where they belong.  As members are aware, the park has won awards and gold medals recently and is vital to the people of Ireland.  It is hugely important to the people and we had an opportunity, when doing those gates and bringing them back, to put them into use again that will do for centuries to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018120400002#K01700","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1543932000,"counter":641,"content":"<p>The two figures are &euro;244,025 to take down the gates and to put up temporary gates.

Our intention is to ensure there is an obligation on the judicial system to sanction in some way persons who do not co-operate with the system.

As I said, there should be some sanction for people who do no contribute in a co-operative way to the system when they assess damages or make their case.  We made the point in the D&aacute;il earlier during parliamentary questions that there seems to be no sanction for people who engage in a process to scam people, fraudulently secure money by false means, present false evidence to courts, lie under oath or view the system as an opportunity for scams.  In my role as spokesperson in this area, I will seek to ensure measures are put forward that oblige the Judiciary, the prosecution services and the investigative services to be as hard as possible on persons who are non-co-operative or who use the system in an abusive way to secure funds through fraudulent means or the pretence of being injured.

The effect of the amendment is to remove the discretion of the court as to what order it may make on what costs, if any, it will allow a claimant or respondent, taking into account the failure by the claimant or respondent to comply or submit in the manner specified in subsection (1).  It raises constitutional concerns because it would cut across the constitutional principle of the separation of powers and the discretion of the courts to make an order for costs.<\/p> <p>  Section 8(1) lists the circumstances under which the court can consider an adverse costs order: where the assessors have requested the claimant under section 23(1) to furnish additional information or documents relating to his or her claim for special damages and the claimant has not complied with the request; where the assessors have requested the respondent or respondents under section 23(2) to furnish additional information or documents and the respondent or respondents have not complied with the request; where the assessors have requested the claimant or respondent or respondents under section 23(4) to assist or co-operate with retained experts, and the claimant or respondent or respondents have not complied with that request; or where the assessor has requested the claimant to submit himself or herself to a medical examination arranged by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and the claimant has not submitted himself or herself to the medical examination.<\/p> <p>  The section provides that the court may order certain matters, taking into account the failure to comply or submit in the manner specified in subsection (1).   The word \"may\" in the section refers to the order a court may make on what costs, if any, it will allow a claimant or a respondent.  The making of an order is, and must remain, a discretionary matter for the judge.  The court must take the matters referred to in subsection (1) into account when deciding on whether to make an order.<\/p> <p>  When the general scheme of the Bill was published in June 2017, it was proposed under head 7 that a court shall have regard to the failure to respond to a request for further information, documents or medical reports in determining the admissibility of evidence in subsequent proceedings and that a court shall have regard to a failure to attend an independent medical examination in determining what medical evidence is admissible in the court case.  <\/p> <p>  The Bill was drafted in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, which was involved directly in the wording of the section.  It was decided that a proposal to limit a court's discretion as to the admissibility of evidence would raise constitutional issues because it would cut across the constitutional principle of the separation of powers.  It is the function of the court and the constitutional duty of a judge to hear all the available evidence, arrive at a decision on foot of that evidence and determine issues of liability and quantum.  Furthermore, the plaintiff has a right to tender evidence before the courts.  The court must retain discretion in any given case to ensure constitutional rights are vindicated and fair procedures are followed.  By providing for potential financial consequences to be applied for non-compliance with requests by PIAB assessors, the section, as drafted, should have the desired effect to change behaviour and encourage parties to adhere to the requirements set out in the Act.<\/p> <p>  For the reasons I outlined, I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment because I cannot support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018120400002#B00300","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948800,"counter":808,"content":"<p>I asked a question in the D&aacute;il earlier about the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy's, proposals to bring forward next year a constitutional referendum to allow for a cap on awards.

We were told at the time that the awards made in Ireland could not be compared with those made in other countries.  I would like an explanation as to why we cannot benchmark the awards made in Ireland across the norms.  We benchmark the cost of medicines in Ireland with the cost of the same medicines in OECD countries.  In the context of personal injuries, we would want to draw a comparison of awards in Ireland with those in common law jurisdictions.<\/p><p>I make this point because the awards made in our nearest neighbouring country, which has a similar legal system, are much lower.  For example, the award for whiplash in the UK is about &pound;4,000 compared with a figure of &euro;20,000.  I know that we have a problem when it comes to awards <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other countries.  I wonder at the reason for the great difference in the level of awards.  I would like to see an explanation in the review of the book of quantum as to how a particular figure is arrived at.  It is fine to publish the details as to what awards should be for various injuries, but there must be some broader assessment as to why a specific figure is arrived at as opposed to the arbitrary announcement that an amount should be paid out when a person suffers a personal injury.  The people as well as the Judiciary have a difficulty with the large disparity between awards across jurisdictions.<\/p><p>The book of quantum will be a discretionary tool for the Judiciary.  There needs to be research and analysis and a broad assessment of the figures that are awarded for specific injuries.  This is an important point and goes beyond the scope of this Bill.  The Judicial Council Bill 2017 is under consideration, which will in effect take its potential instructions from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, in terms of assessing awards.  I am led to believe that PIAB will assist the Judicial Council in assessing what should be the broad benchmark.  I would appreciate clarity on section 9 in respect of a benchmark which is not self-explanatory in terms of advising and helping the proposed Judicial Council<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018120400002#C00800","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948800,"counter":819,"content":"<p>PIAB has offered to help the Judicial Council, but it will be up to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to deal with this during the passage of the Judicial Council Bill 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018120400002#C00900","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948800,"counter":820,"content":"<p>Would it not be up to Parliament?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018120400002#C01000","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1543948800,"counter":821,"content":"<p>Yes, it will be up to the Parliament to decide.

This report was subsequently published on 18 September 2018 and a key recommendation of the report was that the Judicial Council, when established, should be requested by the Minister for Justice and Equality to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  When the judicial guidelines are in place, it is intended that they will supersede the book of quantum.

The proposed change contained in section 11 would remove the power of ICTU to nominate two people to the board and replace it with one nomination from Insurance Ireland and one nomination from the Central Bank.  The balance of the two nominations from ICTU and one from IBEC reflects injured parties and premium paying policyholders who should be the principal stakeholders in PIAB.

Seeking expressions of interest for board appointments through the PAS process allows for appointments to be made from a greater number of potential candidates with the desired skill sets, which can vary over time, depending on the skills available to the board.  Board members are appointed as individuals by the Minister where, in the opinion of the Minister, they have the expertise in a field relevant to the board's functions.<\/p> <p>  The code of practice for the governance of State bodies published in 2016 provides that board members should have the appropriate skills and knowledge appropriate to the activities of the State body to enable them to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively.  The code of practice also requires that, in determining the criteria for board vacancies, the Minister consult the chairperson of the board to identify the appropriate and collective mix of experience, knowledge and skills required to oversee the board's performance of its functions successfully.  All applicants who meet the criteria may apply to PAS and be assessed.  Corporate governance standards require that the board members act in good faith and in the best interests of the State body.  The duty of the board member is owed to the agency and not to any specific stakeholder.<\/p> <p>  Under the Bill, it was proposed that five board positions would be filled through PAS, through open advertisement operated by PAS, which since 2014 has been responsible for putting in place an open, accessible, rigorous and transparent system to support Ministers in making appointments to State boards.<\/p> <p>  I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the current board consists of a Chairperson, the chief executive of PIAB, and nine ordinary members, of whom six are nominated by external bodies designated under legislation.

Trade union members are not the only people who slip and fall coming out of a shop.

The inclusion of ICTU and IBEC may no longer be appropriate but I am open to persuasion.  I remain unconvinced that we should continue with something just because we always did it like that.  Perhaps the board needs a different composition but I suggest that we do not make it too big or too prescriptive.

This money was collected for the purpose of assessing injury claims, as provided for under legislation, and for no other purpose.  Perhaps the reserve should go back to the policyholders who paid it in either directly or through their insurance premiums, which has already happened to an extent.  For example, the fixed fee for an assessment has reduced from &euro;1,500 in 2004 to &euro;600 currently for respondents and their insurers.  In addition, the Exchequer has been repaid a loan of &euro;5 million for set-up costs.

T&aacute; s&eacute; seo le feice&aacute;il sa Bhunreacht agus mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il san Acht Oideachais nuair a deirtear gur g&aacute; don Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna cuidi&uacute; le baint amach cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; agus polasa&iacute; n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta i leith an d&aacute;theangachais.<\/p> <p>  T&aacute; taca&iacute;ocht trasph&aacute;irt&iacute; faighte ag polasa&iacute; Rialtas na h&Eacute;ireann i R&aacute;iteas an St&aacute;it i Leith na Gaeilge in 2006.  Is iad na haidhmeanna at&aacute; leagtha amach ansin go bhfuil an St&aacute;t ag iarraidh &uacute;s&aacute;id agus eolas ar an nGaeilge a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; mar theanga phobail, an oiread saor&aacute;nach agus is f&eacute;idir a bheith d&aacute;theangach, agus l&iacute;on na dteaghlach a bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar theanga laeth&uacute;il chumars&aacute;ide acu a mh&eacute;ad&uacute;.  Cuid de na cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; a bh&iacute; sa r&aacute;iteas sin n&aacute; spreagadh agus taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don phobal an Ghaeilge a thabhairt don ch&eacute;ad ghl&uacute;in eile mar theanga theaghlaigh, oideachas l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge a chur ar f&aacute;il do dhalta&iacute; scoile arb &eacute; mian a dtuismitheoir&iacute; n&oacute; a gcaomhn&oacute;ir&iacute; &iacute;, agus taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt do Ghaelscoileanna.  I Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030, t&aacute; s&eacute; leagtha amach &ldquo;an l&iacute;on daoine a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge gach l&aacute; ... a ard&uacute; &oacute; 83,000 go 250,000&rdquo;.<\/p> <p>  Is &eacute; an pointe at&aacute; m&eacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh leis an gc&uacute;lra sin a thabhairt n&aacute; go bhfuil st&aacute;das ag an nGaeilge.  T&aacute; polasaithe ag an St&aacute;t at&aacute; glactha mar pholasa&iacute; ag na p&aacute;irtithe go huile is go hioml&aacute;n.  Ba ch&oacute;ir, mar sin, go mbeadh Ranna an St&aacute;it, mar at&aacute; leagtha amach san Acht Oideachais, ag tac&uacute; leis an bpolasa&iacute; seo agus leis an st&aacute;das a chur chun cinn.  Fi&uacute; amh&aacute;in chun an sprioc sin de 250,000 cainteoir Gaeilge laeth&uacute;il a fh&aacute;il, t&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go dteasta&iacute;onn n&iacute;os m&oacute; Gaelscoileanna.<\/p> <p>  &Oacute; thaobh an &eacute;ilimh ar oideachas l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge a l&eacute;iri&uacute;, is ceist &iacute; seo a th&eacute;ann go smior nuair at&aacute;imid ag pl&eacute; leis an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna.  I dtaighde de chuid ESRI i 2015, fuarthas gur mheas 72% den phobal gur cheart go mbeadh oideachas l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge ar f&aacute;il do ph&aacute;ist&iacute; d&aacute; mbeadh tuismitheoir&iacute; &aacute; lorg.

An fhadhb at&aacute; leis sin, &aacute;fach, agus feictear &eacute; sin in aguis&iacute;n 1 at&aacute; curtha agam leis an gcur i l&aacute;thair seo, n&aacute; nach bhfuil an rogha sin ag tuismitheoir&iacute; a bp&aacute;ist&iacute; a sheoladh ag Gaelscoileanna mar nach bhfuil ach 4.7% de bhunscoileanna na t&iacute;re ina Ghaelscoileanna.

T&aacute; an t-&eacute;ileamh seo aimsithe ag an bhForas P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta agus muid ag glacadh p&aacute;irte sna pr&oacute;isis ph&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta le seacht mbliana anuas.

Feictear sna tuairisc&iacute; sin - is d&oacute;igh gurb &eacute; seo an pr&iacute;omhphointe ar&iacute;s maidir le h&eacute;ileamh - go bhfuil 26% ar an me&aacute;n de na tuismitheoir&iacute; sa phobal a ndeachaigh muidne chucu ag lorg oideachas l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge d&aacute; bp&aacute;ist&iacute;.  Tagann s&eacute; seo le taighde an ESRI.<\/p> <p>  An pointe at&aacute;imid &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh n&aacute; go bhfuil st&aacute;das ag an nGaeilge, go bhfuil polasa&iacute; ag an St&aacute;t &oacute; thaobh an d&aacute;theangachais, go bhfuil taca&iacute;ocht i measc an phobail go mbeadh s&eacute; ann, agus go bhfuil &eacute;ileamh ag 26% de thuismitheoir&iacute; &aacute; lorg.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an Roinn ag feidhmi&uacute; air seo.  Mar shampla, luafaidh m&eacute; anois cuid de na ceantair, i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath 2, 4 agus 6, a ndeachamar chucu agus lenar ghlacamar p&aacute;irt sa phr&oacute;iseas p&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta in 2018.<\/p><p>Thacaigh 25% den phobal len&aacute;r n-iarratas ach n&iacute; bhfuaireamar Gaelscoil.

N&iacute;l ach Gaelscoil amh&aacute;in ansin agus t&aacute; 13 scoil Bh&eacute;arla sa cheantar.  N&iacute; bhfuaireamar Gaelscoil.  I mBaile Pheil&eacute;id in 2017, fuaireamar taca&iacute;ocht &oacute; 25% den phobail, n&iacute; bhfuaireamar Gaelscoil.  N&iacute;l ann ach Gaelscoil amh&aacute;in agus 14 scoil Bh&eacute;arla sa cheantar.<\/p><p> I Marino-Droim Conrach in 2016, fuaireamar taca&iacute;ocht &oacute; 32% den phobal.

In imscr&uacute;d&uacute; an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga in 2017, chinn s&eacute; nach raibh for&aacute;lacha teanga an Achta Oideachais comhl&iacute;onta ag an bpr&oacute;iseas p&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta at&aacute; ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna.  Chinn s&eacute; nach raibh an cur chuige a bh&iacute; ag an Roinn maidir leis an bpr&oacute;iseas p&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta ag teacht le r&eacute;ad&uacute; bheartais an St&aacute;it i leith leathadh an d&aacute;theangachais.  Fuair s&eacute; locht ar an bpr&oacute;iseas mar n&aacute;r &eacute;irigh leis freastal ar an &eacute;ileamh ar oideachas l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge, agus mhol s&eacute; f&eacute;achaint in athuair ar an &eacute;ileamh a bh&iacute; l&eacute;irithe i Marino-Droim Conrach.  Lorg s&eacute; tuairisc taobh istigh de s&eacute; mh&iacute; ar conas go raibh an Roinn chun an t-&eacute;ileamh a sh&aacute;samh.  Go f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach, d&rsquo;iarr an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga go gclo&iacute;f&iacute; an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna feasta leis na dualgais reacht&uacute;la teanga at&aacute; uirthi sa phr&oacute;iseas p&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta.<\/p><p> N&iacute;l s&eacute; seo &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh sa phr&oacute;iseas p&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta nua at&aacute; f&oacute;gartha.

T&aacute; 12 bhunscoil le hoscailt i Me&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair 2019 agus n&iacute;l aon chur chuige i bhfeidhm chun freastal ar an &eacute;ileamh ar oideachas l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge. <\/p><p> Braitheann an Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta go bhfuil an cur chuige at&aacute; ag an Roinn Oideachas chun scoileanna nua a bhun&uacute; claonta go c&oacute;rasach i gcoinne scoileanna l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; s&eacute; seo &aacute; r&aacute; againn leis an Roinn &oacute; cuireadh an pr&oacute;iseas nua seo i bhfeidhm roinnt mhaith blianta &oacute; shin faoin am seo.  Is &iacute; an chaoi ina bhfuil s&eacute; claonta n&aacute; gurb &eacute; an pr&iacute;omhchrit&eacute;ar a &uacute;s&aacute;ideann an Roinn chun iarratais ar ph&aacute;tr&uacute;nacht a mheas n&aacute; l&iacute;on na tuismitheoir&iacute; a thaca&iacute;onn leis.  An pointe at&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;anamh leis &oacute; th&uacute;s ama n&aacute; go labhra&iacute;onn tromlach na ndaoine in &Eacute;irinn B&eacute;arla.  Is &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad teanga at&aacute; acu.  Glacaimid ar fad leis sin.  N&iacute; nach ionadh m&aacute; th&eacute;ann duine go dt&iacute; pobal, agus m&aacute; iarrtar duine air an bhfuil an pobal sin ag iarraidh scoil nua, go dtaca&iacute;onn an tromlach sin le scoil tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n an Bh&eacute;arla.  Bronntar p&aacute;tr&uacute;nacht den chuid is m&oacute; ar scoileanna B&eacute;arla sna com&oacute;rtais.  N&iacute;l aon chur chuige ann chun freastal ar an 25% den phobal at&aacute; ag lorg oideachas l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge.  Is &eacute;acht mar sin &eacute; nuair a thagann an Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta chun cinn in aon chom&oacute;rtas p&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; chomh m&oacute;r is at&aacute; an t-&eacute;ileamh sin sna pobail.  T&aacute;imid tar &eacute;is 52% n&oacute; 48% den l&iacute;on taca&iacute;ochta a fh&aacute;il chun go bhfuaireamar aon Ghaelscoil sna pr&oacute;isis seo.  N&iacute;l cothrom na f&eacute;inne &aacute; fh&aacute;il ag na tuismitheoir&iacute; at&aacute; ag lorg oideachas l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge.  N&iacute; thugtar aitheantas mar sin do st&aacute;das na Gaeilge sa Bhunreacht sa phr&oacute;iseas p&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta agus n&iacute;l an pr&oacute;iseas seo ag clo&iacute; le polasa&iacute; an St&aacute;it i leith na Gaeilge mar a fuair an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.<\/p><p> T&aacute; roinnt molta&iacute; againn a bhf&eacute;adfadh an Roinn a chur i bhfeidhm chun an cheist seo a chur ina cheart.  Go bun&uacute;sach, t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh ar an Roinn aitheantas a thabhairt don st&aacute;das ar leith at&aacute; ag an nGaeilge.  T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go gcuirfeadh an Roinn polasa&iacute; an St&aacute;it i leith na Gaeilge i bhfeidhm.  T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go dtabharfadh an Roinn aird ar mheon an phobail agus ar mhianta tuismitheoir&iacute; at&aacute; ag lorg oideachas l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge.  Is f&eacute;idir leis an Roinn an pr&oacute;iseas p&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta do scoileanna nua a leas&uacute;.  Mar shampla, mura bhfuil scoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge i gceantar, ba cheart cinneadh a bheith t&oacute;gtha roimh an bpr&oacute;iseas p&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta gur scoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge a bheidh ann.  Anuas air sin, m&aacute; t&aacute; scoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge sa cheantar cheana f&eacute;in ach mura bhfuil s&iacute; &aacute;balta freastal ar an &eacute;ileamh de 25% de thuismitheoir&iacute; at&aacute; cruthaithe ar&iacute;s is ar&iacute;s eile, ba cheart cinneadh a dh&eacute;anamh gur scoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge ilchreidmheach a bheidh ann.<\/p><p> Is &eacute; an tr&iacute;&uacute; moladh n&aacute; go bhfuil &uacute;s&aacute;id &aacute; bhaint as an bpr&oacute;iseas athchumraithe faoi l&aacute;thair chun rogha a shol&aacute;thar do thuismitheoir&iacute; ar scoileanna ilchreidmheacha timpeall na t&iacute;re. T&aacute; an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna agus na boird eile ag d&eacute;anamh suirbh&eacute;anna ar cheantair timpeall na t&iacute;re chun rogha ilchreidmheach a chruth&uacute;.  D&rsquo;fh&oacute;gair an iar-Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna, an Teachta Bruton, go raibh s&eacute; i gceist 400 scoil ilchreidmheach a bheith sa t&iacute;r faoi 2030.  C&eacute;ard faoi na scoileanna l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge?  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil plean ann chun 400 scoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge a bheith sa t&iacute;r faoi 2030?  T&aacute; an pr&oacute;iseas ilchreidmheach seo ann chun rogha ilchreidmheach a chruth&uacute; do thuismitheoir&iacute; in aice baile.  Ba cheart an pr&oacute;iseas a &uacute;s&aacute;id chun rogha l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge a chruth&uacute; in aice baile freisin.  Nuair at&aacute; athchumr&uacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar scoil Chaitliceach, ba cheart f&eacute;achaint chuige ar dt&uacute;s an bhfuil d&oacute;thain sol&aacute;thair de scoileanna l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge i gceantar, agus mura bhfuil, ba cheart an scoil a athchumr&uacute; ina scoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge.

I am seeking a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;139 million for 2018.  Primarily, the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to fund the Christmas bonus for Vote 37 social assistance recipients.  The Christmas bonus will be paid this week.  For the first time in many years, it is being paid at 100%, which we all very much welcome.  It is being paid over the course of this week to approximately 1.2 million customers.  The bonus is a welcome contribution for people in receipt of long-term social welfare payments in the run-up to Christmas - because it finds its way into communities, local businesses and economies - and for families and individuals to allow them to prepare for the festive season, which is its overall aim.<\/p> <p>  The Christmas bonus is estimated to cost approximately &euro;266 million.  This cost is broken down into just over &euro;120 million for Vote 37 recipients and nearly &euro;146 million for Social Insurance Fund recipients.  The Social Insurance Fund is providing for the cost of the bonus being paid to people on contributory payments such as the State pension contributory, invalidity pension, and so on.  Accordingly, this element of the bonus does not impact in any way on this Supplementary Estimate application.  The Social Insurance Fund is in surplus this year.  In contrast, the bonus paid to people in receipt of payments from Voted schemes is met entirely by the Exchequer.  The bonus is not included in the original Estimates for the Department and, unless savings are made that will meet the entire cost, a Supplementary Estimate is required in order to ensure that the bonus will be paid.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman suggested at a previous meeting that it is difficult to compare like with like when comparing the original Estimate with the Supplementary Estimate because of the inclusion of the bonus in the outturn position for the relevant schemes.  For this reason, I have included an additional table, beginning at page 3 of the committee's brief, which shows the variance before the bonus is paid and the effect of the bonus on the outturn position.  I hope the committee finds this approach helpful.<\/p> <p>  The income from pay-related social insurance, PRSI, receipts during 2018 will result in a Social Insurance Fund income of an estimated &euro;10.6 billion.  This will be &euro;252 million or 2.4% ahead of profile for this year and will be &euro;793 million or 8.1% ahead of the position in 2017.  This position is a reflection of the continuing improvement in employment levels in the economy and continues the welcome trend that I presented to the committee here last year.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on Social Insurance Fund schemes and administration, including payment of the Christmas bonus, is expected to cost approximately &euro;9.5 billion.<\/p><p>This is &euro;187.6 million, or 2% above profile, and &euro;145.5 million of this is due to the payment of that Christmas bonus.  Even with the payment of the Christmas bonus to social insurance schemes, the surplus of the fund is still expected to be around &euro;1.1 billion at the end of 2018.  The accumulated surplus in the fund at the end of the year is estimated at &euro;2.32 billion.  While all of this is good news, and it is welcome to see the social insurance fund in such a healthy state, it is worth noting that the fund was also running a significant surplus of &euro;3.6 billion at the end of 2007, but that surplus was exhausted by 2010 when Exchequer subvention was again required because of the economic climate of the time.<\/p><p> The overall expenditure of the Department's schemes, services and administration in 2018 is expected to be &euro;20.33 billion and this will be &euro;320 million, or 1.6%, more than provided for in the original 2018 Revised Estimates.  As I mentioned earlier, &euro;266 million of this is due to payment of the Christmas bonus.  The total expenditure for the Department, which includes expenditure from the Vote and the social insurance fund, comprises overspends on some schemes and underspends on others.  For example, on the social insurance side there has been higher than anticipated expenditure on treatment benefits, which is very welcome, but lower than expected expenditure on invalidity pension.  On that Vote, there has been higher expenditure on administration and on illness and disability payments but lower expenditure on the working age employment supports.  When taken together, and excluding the Christmas bonus, the Department's expenditure on such schemes and services is expected to be &euro;54 million ahead of the profile, less than 0.3%.<\/p><p> The live register is expected to average at around 221,300 in 2018, a reduction of over 39,000 on the average for 2017.  Most of the estimated costs of paying the Christmas bonus of &euro;25 million to jobseekers is being offset by an underspend of over &euro;22 million in the jobseeker's allowance allocation.  The ongoing strong performance of the live register is evidence that growth is continuing and that more people are continuing to make the move into employment.  The live register is now well under 200,000, the first time it has been at that level in ten years and the CSO figures that came out this morning are welcome indeed.  We will continue to work with jobseekers to ensure they are adequately prepared to enter the workforce and can benefit from the recovering economy.<\/p><p> In 2018, the Supplementary Estimate referred to the committee and the briefings provided to committee members list the schemes for which additional sums are being sought, as well as some of our underspends.  We can go through the positions of individual schemes as required by members.  The amount of the Supplementary Estimate is derived by estimating the outturn across all voted schemes, which includes underspends on some schemes and overspends on others and adds in the cost of the Christmas bonus.  Nearly all the Department's expenditure is demand led and, as people apply for income supports when they meet particular circumstances such as ill health or unemployment or when they reach pension age, demographic trends, economic and societal changes and developments in the labour market all play a role in expenditure incurred by our Department.<\/p><p> Any estimate of expenditure for any scheme for the following year is published in December as part of our annualised Revised Estimates volume.  The individual Estimates are constructed on a scheme by scheme basis using data on trends in recipient numbers, average payment values and other relevant information that is available at the time the Estimate is calculated.  It is appropriate to note that the outturn position of the Department in the absence of the payments of the Christmas bonus would be &euro;20.7 billion, or just 0.3% above our original Estimates.  In this regard, I am satisfied that the Estimates process is working well.  It takes account of all key trends and expenditure patterns and provides an accurate picture of the following year's expenditure.  Trends can and do, however, change over the course of a year, resulting in expenditure being higher or lower than originally provided for.  The actual expenditure on most of our schemes can probably never be precisely predicted and the extent of an overspend or underspend only becomes fully apparent at the end of a year when the outturn of the year has been confirmed.<\/p><p> I hope my opening statement, along with the briefing material which I sent over yesterday, provides the necessary information to the committee and supports the reasons given for the Supplementary Estimate.  I am happy to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#B00200","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her opening statement.

It is also worth acknowledging the work of the staff in the Department who are tasked with preparing the Estimates.  As the Minister rightly said, the variance in terms of the output in comparison to the Estimates across most subheads is very small which means that somebody is doing a good job of work.  That being said, I am sure that colleagues will have issues and questions.  In general terms, in the global figures presented there is close correlation between the Estimates and the outturns.  Those working on the figure and the projections have been doing a good job.  <\/p><p> Deputy O'Dea is first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#C00200","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>I reiterate what the Chairman has just said.  I also welcome the 100% return of the Christmas bonus, which is made possible by the lower payouts under the jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit schemes thanks to the increase in the number of people working.  However, that is offset to some extent by increases in payments of illness benefit and so on.  There seems to have been a marked increase in payments under the different disability and illness headings and while I know that all of these things are demand led, I would like the Minister to comment on that.<\/p><p>On page six of the briefing note there is a payment of &euro;21.3 million for agency services.  I ask the Minister to outline what exactly is involved there.  I note that under the exceptional and urgent needs payments category, the number of such payments is 16,000 over profile, which is a significant number.  While that has been provided for, it indicates that the Department seriously underestimated the demands on that particular fund.  On the other hand, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is around<b><\/b>5,000 below profile.  I appreciate and accept that there have been some changes to that scheme around rates and so on but does the Minister have any plans to change or relax the rules?  I have been contacted by a significant number of people who are just on the margin and who do not qualify for the allowance.  There are 3,000 fewer people availing of the school meals scheme and I ask the Minister to explain that.  Spending on community employment is slightly below profile.  I made the point to the Minister in the D&aacute;il last week during Question Time that the rules relating to community employment, CE, schemes should be relaxed.  I do not say that because I want people to spend 12 years on a CE scheme but because some people in their mid to late 50s find it hard to get work and it would be better for them to be doing something.  Furthermore, sometimes it is easier to get a job when one is actually doing something.  On T&uacute;s, I note that the decline in numbers has been reversed and the reason for that is that in most of those community type schemes, increasingly T&uacute;s members are replacing CE participants.  <\/p><p>Spending on rent supplement is down by &euro;9.5 million.  Does the Minister have any figures for the corresponding increase in spending on the housing assistance payment, HAP?  I know that the latter payment comes from a different Department but it would be useful to have that data to get the total picture in this area.  The back to education allowance payments are 579 over profile.  A report was prepared in recent years on the back to education allowance scheme which indicated that it was not working particularly well and that the results were not very impressive.  On carers, I note that the Minister can make more than &euro;13 million in savings due to the fact that there are 1,300 fewer people qualifying for the carer's allowance.  The figure for the carer's support grant is approximately &euro;2,500, which is surprisingly high.  All of the statistics show that the number of carers in Ireland is gradually increasing.  What I detect from these figures is that because of the rules, a bigger percentage of people who are actually caring are not entitled to the carer's allowance or carer's benefit.  Certain changes have been recommended by the various organisations representing carers that would make quite a significant impact and introduce much needed flexibility into those schemes.  <\/p><p>The back to work family dividend payments are 541 below profile.  The working family payment, previously known as family income supplement, FIS, is just short of 3,000 below profile.  There were suggestions that a lot of people were not aware of their entitlement to FIS.<\/p><p>Has any action been taken by the Department to increase awareness of this scheme?<\/p><p> On illness benefit, I refer to the figures for disability allowance in particular.  Disability allowance is nearly &euro;2.4 million above what was anticipated.  Is there a proposal to employ additional medical assessors in the Department?  If so, how many and at what level and salary scale will they be employed?<\/p><p> I take it that the increase in treatment benefits is due to the extension of the benefit to those who are self employed.<\/p><p> On pensions, I noticed that the figure for non-contributory pensions is only up 3%, even taking the actual increase into account and it is something similar for contributory pensions.  Does the Minister have any actual figures on the extra number of pensioners we had to pay over and above last year and over and above the previous year?<\/p><p> Has the Minister studied the recent Supreme Court decision on pension entitlements for somebody who is incarcerated and what are the implications of that decision for the system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#D00200","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>I welcome the Christmas bonus payout of &euro;266 million to 1.2 million needy people.  It has to be warmly welcomed.  It also has to be welcomed from the point of view of the injection of money it brings to local economies because I said it at a previous committee meeting - probably last year's Estimates - how important the Christmas bonus is for individuals and for the local economy because very few, if any of those people will be heading abroad to spend that money.  Every penny of that money will go directly into the local economy.  It is an invaluable injection into businesses and retailers at this time of year.<\/p> <p>  On the figures and community employment, CE, under heading A12, there is a massive underspend of &euro;7.2 million in 2018.  I went online today and I saw that there are 1,678 vacancies for CE places across the State.  I have said before that this is a serious problem and I will say it again.  I ask the Minister what her views are on why there are so many vacancies on CE schemes across the board.<\/p> <p>  On heading A31, which is the working family payment, again there is a really large fall in the spending for this.  Could the Minister give additional information on why exactly that is the case?  Has there been a fall in applications or has there been a serious change in people's circumstances which means that they are no longer entitled to the working family payment?  It would be useful if we could get that information.  I appreciate that the Minister might not have all of the information to hand today but it would be useful.<\/p> <p>  I refer to heading A32, which is on the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  Again, there is a fall in the number of recipients and the money being paid out for this allowance.  Given the increasing cost of sending a child back to school which is only going up, does the Minister have the actual number of applications that were refused to hand?  I know we have the numbers that were granted and I know that many people do apply and there are many criteria that have to be met.  Does the Minister have the exact figures for how many people have been refused?<\/p> <p>  I raised it with the Minister that there were a lot of delays in people getting payouts and I know she said that it was because people applied late but that is not the full reason there were late payments.<\/p><p>People were getting payouts in September and October when kids were long back at school.  There are problems there.  <\/p><p> The underspend on school meals is a little strange.  The Minister said it is due to a lower uptake from schools.  Is there an explanation for that?  Has she considered that?  Is there a reason schools are not drawing this money down?  It is badly needed and if there is a reason, that needs to be examined.  Will the Minister elaborate on that a bit? <\/p><p> Under subhead A2, administration non-pay, there is a sum of &euro;4.2 million for \"Office Equipment and External IT Services\".  Over the past few months, there have been major difficulties with the payout of illness benefit for many thousands of people and it transpired that there were problems with the IT system being rolled out by consultants.  Was some of that money for the roll-out of that system supposed to be for illness benefit or where are those figures to be found?  There are issues in this regard and the Minister said they related to the IT system.  Has that money been paid to consultants for the roll-out of that system, which caused massive difficulties for many people? <\/p><p> There is a reduction in the amount for rent supplement, which is understandable because people are being moved onto HAP.  That falls under a different Department but the intention is to ultimately move everyone off rent supplement onto HAP.  Is there a timeframe for that?  How many people have transferred from rent supplement to HAP?  There are difficulties with some landlords who refuse to sign the HAP lease.  That is putting people in serious difficulty because their rent supplement payment is being cut.  Claimants are being told their landlord has no choice, he has to sign HAP or the rent supplement will be cut.  Could the Minister give an overview of that?  There are concerns that there are higher standards for HAP, which is brilliant because a minority of landlords have been getting away with blue murder in respect of the conditions they have been providing through rent supplement.  Much of that goes back to local authorities that failed to carry out inspections.  Landlords do not want to go to the additional cost of having to carry out refurbishment and upgrade works to meet the HAP criteria.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could outline the figures in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#E00200","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>The Christmas bonus is welcome.

However, there are two figures in subhead A2, administration non-pay, which I would like the Minister to explain.  One is payments for agency services at an additional &euro;21.3 million.  That is a lot of money.  What was the original Estimate and what additionality did the Department get for the &euro;21.3 million?  Under the same subhead, there are allocations for training and development and incidental expenses.  There were savings of &euro;6 million under training and development   What had the Department intended to do and what training programmes were forgone to make that saving?  It is also a substantial figure.<\/p> <p>  Members referred to savings in the carer's allowance.  More and more people are presenting at our clinics seeking supports for caring for somebody, though I do not suggest everybody is eligible for the allowance.  However, while many of the target Estimates have been good, there has been a saving in this area and the figure is lower than the profile figure.<\/p><p>Could any of that be attributed to the time it takes to process those applications rather than the number of applicants?  Carer's allowance can take quite a period to be processed.  Rather than saying there are fewer people on it, are the savings more attributable to other factors?  The Minister knows what I am getting at and I ask her to comment on that.<\/p><p> As an example, the working family payment was lower than expected with 2,800 fewer people on it.  There was also a smaller number in receipt of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  This is a bugbear of mine.  Does the Minister future-proof existing schemes when she is doing her Estimates and budgets?  Are people falling out of some of the schemes from an eligibility point of view based on increases they might have received from the Minister or tax increases or whatever else?  Does the Department use future-proofing?  In our clinics we do not notice a significant reduction in people who are looking to join such schemes.  When the Minister increases social welfare payments, are people falling through the cracks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#G00300","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>It is called the step-up effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#H00200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>Yes.  I have one further question.  This is a small point but it is interesting.  I refer to subhead A40, the grant to the Citizens Information Board, CIB, which made a small saving.  Despite the rationalisation, the budget year-on-year for 2018 versus 2017 is still up a couple of million euro.  Are there any efficiencies to be generated given that the Minister is no longer servicing 90 or so boards?  However, the savings are in areas where we might have expected to see pressure for increased spending.  There was an underspend of &euro;400,000 on the mortgage arrears services being provided by the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  Another &euro;100,000 was saved on Abhaile staff.  The figures are not significant, but at a time people are having difficulties in this area, I am concerned whether those organisations have evolved quickly enough to meet the existing demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#H00300","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>Would the Chairman if I go backwards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#H00400","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1023,"content":"<p>The Minister may do it any way she wishes.

The first point relates to the step-up effect.  There is a bit of work to be done with regard to some other Departments in terms of changes that are made in the budget and the impacts of those changes.  In the main, there were increases.  If payments under any scheme increase by &euro;5 or &euro;3.20 or whatever it happens to be, then the qualifying conditions have to be cognisant of that.  One cannot suddenly no longer get access to a back to school allowance just because an increase has been provided.  That is called the step-up effect and that is reflected in the legislation.  Everything gets stepped up in line with the increases provided by the Department.  However, that is not true of some other Departments.  The Chairman and I have had conversations about medical cards and Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, and a body of work needs to be done in that regard, in particular in terms of positive changes that can be made to welfare payments.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons the CIB's budget has increased is it has been asked to provide additional services.  One of the Chairman's party colleagues was responsible for increasing the services provided to the deaf community.  I put in a few million euro more to ensure the CIB could through its funding streams give money to the organisations that provide additional signing services and additional access to information, and to increase the availability of the service on a daily basis to people in the deaf community.  That is very welcome.  I accept that there are some reductions in the anticipated spend on the CIB and it is because there is genuinely not the same requirement for them that we anticipated.  One can reflect on that and conclude that, thankfully, the number of people in long-term arrears on their mortgages are reducing.  That means we must now change and reflect the services to suit the needs of the people.  One of the changes that has been made in the past year is that to provide mentors to attend court sittings with people.  That is  positive and has been well received and we might further roll out that service.  Some of the Abhaile services and the work with PIPs in the community have not entirely fulfilled some people's expectations of getting a deal and providing them with a long-term route to deal with their longer-term debt.<\/p><p>It might be time to consider putting in place some internal performance improvement plans, PIPs, in that service to ensure they do not have to use vouchers, but the Chairman is right.  Some of the underspend is due to the fact that the number of people accessing the services is reducing.  It is time to examine those services and make small changes and tweaks so that we can help the people equally as well as we have done in recent years.<\/p><p> I will come back to the training shortly.  <\/p><p> On the administration, the original Estimate for 2018 was &euro;119,820,000.  The actual Estimate is &euro;141,141,000, so it is an increase of &euro;21,321,000.  That is to pay our agents who carry out the work on behalf of the Department.  To give some examples of that, An Post is paid for making scheme payments to customers and, thankfully, that is up this year.  I believe we are the largest customer and user of An Post, and long may that last, and its services with us have increased this year, which is very welcome.  Doctors are paid for certifying illness in respect of illness benefits and that figure is up this year, notwithstanding the difficulties we experienced.  They did not come from the certificates but there is an actual increase in the number of people making applications for illness benefit this year and therefore the doctors have to be paid.  I have the figures now if they are any good to the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#H00600","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>Yes, please, for An Post.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#J00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1027,"content":"<p>I have told the Chairman a dirty lie; the figure for An Post is actually down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#J00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>Now, Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#J00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

It is difficult to extend those subheads with 100% or even 99% accuracy.<\/p> <p>  Training savings of &euro;665,000 were incurred in this particular area.  That was primarily as a result of lower costs than were initially anticipated.  We got our training courses last year for less than what we thought we would have to pay.<\/p> <p>  With regard to additional information on learning and development, savings were incurred.  The Department has provided extensive training for all our staff in 2018.  To date, there have been 13,416 staff attendances at instructor-led classroom training, and 2,678 staff received this training in 2018.  There have been 2,447 e-learning modules and front-line serving training areas were completed in 2018.  Other internally delivered staff training outside the scope of these programmes was provided to 2,796 staff and another 1,799 staff received an externally delivered training programme.  The Department arranges approximately 100 one day learning courses across a range of subjects, and those are available to all our staff.  Those are the training and administration figures.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Joan Collins raised the issue of school meals, as did the other two Deputies.  Most, if not all, of our schemes are demand led.  We can put out an offer, as we did in this year's budget, to extend a hot school meals pilot scheme, which we hope to take on board at the beginning of next year, but we cannot make schools take up that offer.<\/p><p>A significant amount of additional money was provided, at a sitting of this committee at which I was present in October or November 2017, for the year 2018 but there was not the level of uptake that we expected for which there is a variety of reasons.  I would not have viewed the matter in the same way as the Deputy concerned who sounded  frustrated and wondered why schools would not avail of such a good scheme.  <\/p><p> We had an issue with one particular area.  I refer to instances where school meals were distributed by staff or volunteers who were over and above the staff in the school.  In the past year something happened to the provision of those staff members so schools could no longer deliver the school meals programme.  Thankfully, we have resolved the issue but it would have meant the non-delivery of school meals for a number of months in a small cluster of schools.  There are other schools where the staff are not available in the schools to take in meals and distribute them on a daily basis over and above the normal day-to-day running of the schools.  Again, we are trying to work with individual schools to break down whatever barriers exist that prevent schools from availing of the programme.  When we added the extra money last year, it was probably before we addressed the matter and we added people to the list thinking nobody would say \"No\".  Some schools have different issues.  We have to break down those barriers school by school because the barriers are not the same in each school.  Again, we are working with people.<\/p><p> Let me give the example of a school that has difficulties with the items listed on the school meals programme as suggested by Healthy Ireland in its health eating guidelines.  The school is a special needs school.  Some of the children will not eat what is listed on the school meals programme and, therefore, pulled out of the school.  We worked with the school and decided that we needed to be more flexible about recommendations.  We brought in a nutritionist and considered what should be provided to the children to ensure that we can continue to deliver.  Reasons vary in schools.  We have an incredible division located in Sligo that looks after the scheme and they are very proactive.  If there are issues, we visit the schools and work with them to make sure that we break down the issues, where we can, and bridge any gaps.  We are intent on ensuring that the school meals programme is fully up to spend.  We will also add the hot school meals pilot programme next year.  Please God it will go well and we can add another string to our bow in terms of school meals.  <\/p><p> In terms of the carers' allowance, there has not been a decrease in the number of people applying for the allowance.  I know it probably looks like there was a decrease.  Last year, we anticipated that more people would apply than applied because there had been an increase year-on-year.  For example, at the end of last October as many as 17,406 applications had been received and we received 20,852 last year.<\/p><p> There is a new carers' form planned.  Deputy Joan Collins suggested that it is a very difficult scheme to apply for and the Chairman suggested that one of the reasons for a reduction in the number of applicants is due to the process taking so long to complete.  My answer is no as the process took equally as long the year before and the year before that, unfortunately.  As a result we have worked very closely with the Carers' Association of Ireland in the past year and come up with a new application form.  As Deputy O'Dea will be aware, particularly with our work with the domiciliary care allowance and DCA Warriors in the past number of years, we have similar issues because it is a very similar scheme.  Obviously, one scheme is for adults while the other scheme is for children.  It was a difficult application to navigate and we did great work with the DCA Warriors.  The organisation and the parents helped us enormously to make the application a much simpler process.  We have done exactly the same work with the Carers' Association of Ireland and we will release a new form at the beginning of next year.  I hope that the new form will mean that far more people will be successful with their first application.  <\/p><p> To answer the question posed by Deputy O'Dea, we have a new recruitment campaign for medical assessors planned for January.  It is not just to extend the service.  A  number of medical assessors left over the course of the year and we got new replacements this year.  The new recruitment campaign will help us to continue and extend that employment recruitment drive.  We want to make sure that the application is as easy as possible and people give us all of the information.  The reason it takes a while to process applications is not that the qualifying, from a condition perspective, is onerous.  One must meet the conditions outlined in the means test, which are relatively simple.  Out of all of the schemes, they would have the highest conditions to reach.  One's income threshold and all of that kind of stuff on the carers' allowance would be much higher than some of our other schemes.  Due to the fact that people need to be medically assessed and the bar for a full and half carer's allowance - the threshold of the care that has been given has to be fully detailed and examined by medical assessors, which takes a little bit of time.<\/p><p>We all accept that it has taken too long, but I hope the new application form and the employment of additional medical assessors next year will bring a drastic reduction in the numbers.  I believe, and management share my view, that there is a need for more staff in that area, and we are awaiting staff arising from efficiencies in other areas to move into this area.  It will then benefit from a double whammy of getting the attention and new initiatives it deserves.  The annualised figures for the number of carers at the end of October 2018 were 78,681 an increase from 74,881 in the same period the year before.  The rate of increase has slowed down.<\/p><p> Deputy Carey raised the issue of treatment benefits.  We increased the allocation for treatment benefits this year and allowed both the self-employed and employees to claim under this scheme.  We expected the uptake to increase, but never to the level received.  This is good, as it means that people perceive this scheme as a genuine benefit.  When people think about their social insurance contribution, all they think about is the pension that comes when they reach 66 years, which in their case is donkey's years away.  We wish to instill the value of the social insurance contribution and treatment benefits are one clear way that resonates with the people and there has been a significant increase in the number of applications this year.<\/p><p> Deputies Brady and O'Dea raised the issue of the CE scheme.  There are 1,600 and odd vacancies on this programme.  The scheme is entirely different from T&uacute;s, the community work placement initiative.  Under T&uacute;s, the employment official in consultation with the unemployed person and with his or her co-operation send him or her on a T&uacute;s scheme whereas under the CE scheme, one has to apply for a place on the scheme.  People on the live register visit the Intreo office on a weekly basis and they choose to apply for the CE opportunities.<\/p><p> The number of people applying for places on a CE scheme is reducing for two reasons.  First, there are fewer people on the live register than there used to be so fewer people are available to apply for the scheme in the first instance.  Based on the contributions of the members who were of the view that JobPath was hampering people in applying for CE places, we allowed anybody who was on JobPath this summer to do both.  That has not resulted in a significant increase in the number of people applying for the CE programme from this summer.  The only factor I can put my finger on is that because there are jobs in the community, people are looking for full-time employment as opposed to work experience.  We work with all of our CE sponsor schemes which do tremendous work on a monthly basis and we try to improve their access to people and help them to advertise their positions<\/p><p>.  As unemployment numbers reduce, the number of positions on CE schemes should reduce by a percentage in line with the reduction in the live register because the CE programme is purely an activation model.  I do not subscribe to the fact that it is an activation model because a raft of people on community programmes are not there just to be trained to move on to the next job as they see what they do as a fulfilling and worthwhile activity.  Members share my view that this work is of significant value to our communities.  We need to reflect on that and change how it is viewed.  Sometimes it is more than just a work experience or training opportunity for people but the reasons the numbers are falling is that the unemployment figures are reducing and it is reflected in that.  The falling numbers is not due to anything we are doing differently in the Department, as the scheme is entirely demand-led.  The places are available because of the reflected numbers that we expected to be on the live register this year.  That number will reduce next year as the number on the live register comes down again.  Nobody is preventing anybody from applying for a place on a CE scheme anymore.  Anybody who is on the live register can apply to be on a scheme.  They are choosing not to and we will reflect on that.<\/p><p> The working family and the back to school allowance payments are demand-led schemes.  People are benefitting from the fact that the economy is recovering.<\/p><p>This relates to the back to school allowance as well.  Nothing has changed.  I view the changes in the back to school allowance and the working family payment as positive for those who receive these payments.  We introduced a disregard into the working family payment.  People who rely entirely on the working family payment to top up their incomes now have a weekly disregard for their rent payments.  Back to school payments for next year were increased significantly in the budget.  I know we have not finalised that yet.  Deputy O'Dea is right when he says that this increase reflects the fact that the cost of going to school is increasing.<br\/><br\/>The number of people who are accessing both of these schemes is a reflection of the fact that the economy is recovering.  Many people are moving into full-time employment at a level where they do not reach the means test, do not need the working family payment or do not qualify for the back to school allowance anymore.  The number of new applications for the working family payment received so far this year - the figure was 23,803 at the end of October - is relatively similar to last year's number.  I have mentioned the introduction of the disregard.  It is a good thing that the numbers are slowly decreasing.  It is not something to be worried about.  As I have said, this will always be a demand-led scheme.  I want to be able to allow people who are currently on the scheme to earn more and to take home more of the money they are actually earning.  I hope this will incentivise and encourage them to earn more and keep more of their own money.  The scheme will always be led by demand.  If there is an increase in the need for the scheme next year, we will respond to that.<br\/><br\/>I have spoken about school meals.  I will come back to illness benefit in a second.  Deputy Brady mentioned the overspend of &euro;4.2 million under the heading of Office Equipment and External IT Services.  Our list of ongoing schemes is continuing to grow.  Every time I introduce a new scheme, I have to get into the queue to get an entirely new platform developed.  Thankfully, we are introducing new schemes.  We introduced the paid parental leave and the self-employed jobseeker's schemes this year.  These brand new schemes need brand new IT platforms.  We are investing in our online digital services.  We are about to go live with <i>mywelfare.ie<\/i>, which is a new and hugely positive method of interacting with the Department.  It is so user-friendly that even I am totally impressed by it.  This new system is incredibly easy to use.  We have 6,000 staff and 70 schemes.  This means that our IT platforms are constantly being upgraded and new systems are constantly coming on board.  The only difficulty we have as a society, a country or an economy at the moment is that there are so few software developers on the Government procurement list.  They are all busy.  They are already doing stuff for all the other Departments.  This will probably slow down our ability to deliver on some of the new schemes we would like to deliver on.  It is possibly something that needs to be looked at.  That accounts for the &euro;4.2 million overspend.<br\/><br\/>I think Deputy Brady is under the impression that there is a programme to move people off rent supplement and onto HAP.  I say that because I am making an assumption.  I hope I am wrong.  No one in the Department is working off a list with a target of getting 100 people off rent supplement.  Rent supplement is a short-term measure to bridge a gap in the housing need of a family or couple.  The State has to make sure it provides long-term sustainable solutions for people.  Ideally, we would like to see people not being on rent supplement for any more than about a year.  That has not been the reality in recent years because we have given people rent supplement for more than 12 months.  It was always intended to be a short-term stop for people as they come in and out of need.  Over recent years, HAP has been introduced, there has been a move away from RAS and a long-term requirement for HAP leases to be five or ten years has been introduced.  As a result, people have moved gradually from rent supplement to HAP.  There is no agenda of getting officials to hurry through a list of 10,000 people.  It will happen as people come.  Therefore, I am disappointed to hear from the Deputy that people are being told they will lose their RAS if they do not take up HAP.  It is definitely not coming from the Department.  People will get RAS for as long as they need it.  Rent supplement is provided because there is a need for it.  When somebody moves onto HAP or into a social house, or wins the lotto and buys his or her own house, he or she will come off rent supplement because it is no longer required.  Nobody is actively pushing people off rent supplement.  All of our schemes are led by demand.  If someone has a need and the conditions apply to him or her, he or she will get what comes from the Department.  There is nobody telling that person that he or she should or should not be here.<\/p><p>I have just been given the figures.  At the end of October, we had 25,654 people on rent supplement, 19,196 people on RAS through the local authorities and 41,693 people on HAP.  I might be wrong, but I think the Deputy is asking how many people came off rent supplement and went onto HAP.  Is that what he is asking?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#J01300","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1042,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#N00200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>I do not have that figure with me, but I will come back to the Deputy with it.

I am going off script slightly at the moment, not that I have a script.  I am going off on a tangent.  Every time we announce something, we get a barrage of responses from people asking why we have a &quot;customer&quot; charter.  We decided to draw up the charter a number of years ago because we wanted to provide the most excellent level of customer service.  That irks people because they are not really customers.  Then we called them &quot;clients&quot;, but they are not really clients.  We cannot call them &quot;citizens&quot; because we look after many people who are not citizens.  I am not sure what the correct language is.  Someone told me one day that I should just call them &quot;people&quot;, but sometimes that does not quite fit into what I am talking about.  I would love some advice on this.  The last thing we want to do is to upset somebody by saying &quot;citizens&quot; when we look after people who are not citizens or by saying &quot;customers&quot; when they are not really customers.  If I could get some advice on this issue, that would be deadly.  Similarly, it was noted this week that some people do not like the idea of us calling the Christmas bonus a &quot;Christmas&quot; bonus.  It was suggested that we should think about calling it something else.  We are all gone very politically correct lately.<\/p><p>We are making people aware of the new <i>mygovid.ie<\/i>and <i>mywelfare.ie<\/i>platforms, which are very interactive.  All of our people in the Intreo offices and all of our front-line staff are well aware of the conditions around FIS.  The idea behind FIS when it was introduced a number of years ago was to try to encourage people who depend entirely on welfare to go out, take a chance and try to do work.  We were trying to give them comfort that they would not lose the supports they previously enjoyed.  We are trying to make sure the transition period is well supported by the Departments of Health and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  That is what is there.  We are consistently trying to help people to get into employment.  We are certainly not shy about telling people that FIS is there.  The new &euro;95 disregard for rent payments will certainly be well advertised in all of our offices next year.  It is not something that we are keeping secret.  I genuinely believe that it is because people's fortunes are improving that these schemes are not required anymore.<\/p><p>I have covered the issues of community employment, school meals, back to school payments and agencies.<\/p><p>I have not yet responded to Deputy O'Dea's question about the court ruling during the week which deemed that our withholding of contributory pension payments to a particular gentleman under section 249 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 was unconstitutional.  The report from the court is very lengthy.  We are probably still assimilating it without jumping to any conclusions.  I know what my gut is telling me to do, but obviously I have to get some advice before I can do that.  The Attorney General has the report.  I expect to have a meeting before the end of this week, or early next week, at which a final decision can be made.  The Deputy is well aware that this is not something that can be put on the long finger.  We need to decide soon whether we are going to appeal or make alternative arrangements.  I will be looking for the co-operation of all parties in the House when the time comes to rectify the position we currently find ourselves in.  Even if it is not of our making - I hope it is not - it is not very satisfactory.<\/p><p>The final point I would like to make in response to Deputy O'Dea relates to pensions.  He was looking for the actual numbers for the year-on-year increases.  This year, an additional 17,300 people are receiving the contributory State pension, an additional 500 people are receiving the contributory widow's pension and an additional 130 people are receiving the non-contributory State pension.<\/p><p>The total pensions additional this year are 17,930.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#N00300","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>Which brings the total to what?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#O00200","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>I do not have that figure.

What it does show clearly is that,  for the hundreds of thousands of people who have had the experience of going through it, a very large percentage - an enormously successful percentage - with the exception of JobBridge,  which people in Deputy Brady's party did not appreciate for a number of years, it has been the most successful activation programme we have ever run in the State.  I know the Deputy does not like it and that is fine but it affects tens of thousands of people who have got jobs because of the interaction, assistance and help from the great staff in Turas Nua and Seetec, who are all Irish people by the way in case there is an ideological difficulty there.  They are Irish people helping Irish people to get work and they are succeeding, which is great.  It is wonderful to see the extra money that is being paid to those companies because it means they are actually being effective, which is what we want to see.  If the Deputy does not want to take my word for it, the live register and CSO figures were issued this morning and they are going down.  The reason they are going down is because our activation methods are working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#Q00700","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1098,"content":"<p>The Minister is in denial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#Q00800","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and her officials for attending today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#Q00900","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1543928400,"counter":1100,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#Q01000"},{"type":"speech","time":1543928400,"counter":1101,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 90, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p><blockquote>The Select Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimate for public services for the year ended 31 December 2018: Vote 37 - Employment Affairs and Social Protection .  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2018120400002#Q01100","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1543928400,"counter":1102,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 2.18 p.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
