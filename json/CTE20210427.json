We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department: Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill, principal officer, and Mr. Donal Crowley, head of human resources.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from RT&Eacute;: Ms Dee Forbes, director general; Ms Eimear Cusack, director of human resources; and Ms Fiona O'Shea, group financial controller.  We are also joined by Ms Anne Louise O'Donovan, senior manager, BAI.  I warmly welcome all the witnesses to the meeting.  I thank them and their staff for the briefing material they prepared for the committee.  <\/p> <p>  I note that this is the first time the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and the Media - a big Department - has appeared before this committee.  I wish Mr. Healy and his staff every success with their diverse and important brief.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up background noise or feedback and, as usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, several of today&rsquo;s witnesses are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  To assist our broadcasting service and the staff of the Debates Office, I ask Members to direct their questions to specific witnesses.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, whether that is RT&Eacute; or the Department, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time they contribute.<\/p> <p>  I am informed that there is a technical issue with the Comptroller and Auditor General's connection so I invite Ms Forbes to make her opening statement.  She has five minutes and I will give her a reminder after four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021042700002#A00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619523000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and all the members for inviting us here today.  The invitation comes at a very important time.  We sent the committee some notes last night which I hope the members will find useful to engage today.<\/p> <p>  The questions the members have regarding employment in RT&Eacute; are important.  Over the past few years, we in RT&Eacute; have reviewed, and changed as appropriate, the basis of engagement for a number of people whose working relationship with RT&Eacute; had evolved over time.  The Eversheds Sutherland review has been thorough and I and my colleagues are happy to answer questions on that across the next couple of hours.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, however, I thought it would be useful to give the committee some context of what is going on in our sector and within RT&Eacute; at present.  While terms and conditions of employment in RT&Eacute; and the sector are certainly important, the broader challenges facing the sector have caused many to lose their jobs and are threatening the future of many more.<\/p> <p>  Decisions soon to be made by the Government on the future of media in Ireland will have far-reaching consequences not just for RT&Eacute; and all who work here but the broader sector and, crucially, Irish audiences into the future.  Much is at stake.<\/p> <p>  Public service media now exists in a very different world from when RT&Eacute; was established.  Audiences in Ireland now live in a transformed media and communications landscape.  With unlimited choice and every interest and taste catered for, audiences enjoy a digital world - always on, accessible across multiple devices and, increasingly, delivered or mediated by global companies.  Audiences today exercise much more control over when and how they consume information, journalism and programming.<\/p> <p>  RT&Eacute; has evolved with these developments and still occupies a unique place at the heart of Irish public life.  Over the past 15 years RT&Eacute; has embraced the opportunities of digital technology.  Today, while continuing to deliver the country&rsquo;s leading broadcast channels, RT&Eacute; has extended its public value with market-leading online and mobile media services, offering all of its journalism and programming on the smartphone, tablet and desktop.  <\/p> <p>  These investments have ensured that RT&Eacute; remains at the centre of Irish public life, accessed in any given week by 94% of the people living in Ireland, and many more around the world.  This has never been more important than in the past year when RT&Eacute; underpinned a shared national narrative and was a consistent and trusted source of information, analysis and news that people could rely on every day to keep themselves, their families and their communities safer.  As independently tracked by Am&aacute;rach every week, 90% of the Irish people are choosing RT&Eacute; as their main source of information, news and analysis on Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  Over the next decade, as broadband speeds increase and coverage extends fully into rural areas and as digital devices become smarter and global competition becomes even greater, the effects of digital disruption on media are likely to become even more fast-moving and profound, particularly for a small country such as Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The members will see from our annual report in 2019 that RT&Eacute; carried a deficit for the year of &euro;7.2 million, a deficit that underscores a structural funding problem at RT&Eacute; that has emerged in the past decade.<\/p> <p>  The financial crash of 2008-09 devastated the economy and many sectors, including media.  In 2008, RT&Eacute; had total revenues of &euro;444 million; in 2019, RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s total revenues were &euro;342 million.<\/p><p>The result has been a significant contraction in investment in Irish broadcast journalism and programming over the past decade.  Investment by RT&Eacute; in the independent production sector has reduced from over &euro;75 million per annum in 2008 to &euro;40 million now.  RT&Eacute;'s investment in drama and children's programming has more than halved and its investment in factual programming has reduced by a third.  This is not good for RT&Eacute;, audiences in Ireland or the Irish creative media sectors.  <\/p><p> Reform and cost-cutting has been a necessary theme in RT&Eacute; throughout this period.  RT&Eacute; has reduced its annual operating costs by over 20%, approximately &euro;100 million, in line with a total fall in income of the same level.  Staff numbers have reduced by 22% from 2,351 in 2008 to 1,831 by the end of 2019.  That is a reduction of 520 people.  RT&Eacute; has also reduced its remuneration of top talent by over 30% on the 2008 levels.  <\/p><p> Due to ongoing financial constraints over the past decade, RT&Eacute; has only been able to invest half of what we should in capital.  In 2017, underutilised land in Donnybrook was sold to raise funds for essential capital investment in digital technology, studio infrastructure and to reduce debt and fund restructuring.  In late 2019, RT&Eacute; committed to further reducing its operating costs by &euro;60 million between 2020 and 2022.  RT&Eacute; is on track to deliver these reductions, which include a further reduction of 15% of our top talent fees and a 10% cut to the pay of the executive board, as well as a waiving of fees by the RT&Eacute; board.  However, cuts and asset disposals cannot sustain RT&Eacute;, let alone allow RT&Eacute; to invest to meet the needs of future generations.  Just when RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s income has sharply contracted, changing audience needs and increasing global competition demands that RT&Eacute; increase its investment in its journalism, programming and key technology so that we can retain distinctiveness and connection with our audiences.  Quite simply, RT&Eacute; does not have adequate revenues to deliver against our remit or fulfil our prescribed role.  Numerous independent reviews, including the review of the funding of public service broadcasting conducted by the joint Oireachtas committee in 2017, have identified the need for increased public funding for RT&Eacute; and structural reform to the TV licence system.  <\/p><p> As noted above, 94% of Irish people access one or more of RT&Eacute;'s services each week using multiple devices, yet the law still only stipulates ownership of a television as the basis for paying the TV licence.  In 2019, 11% of households therefore were ineligible to pay the TV licence.  The cost of collection is higher in Ireland than the European average, more than double that in the UK, and evasion levels in 2019 were also among the highest in Europe, at 12.6% of eligible households.  Both the levels of evasion and the numbers of ineligible homes have significantly increased since 2019.  By our estimates the evasion level rose to over 15% of homes in 2020, with the level of ineligible homes rising to 13%.  As a consequence, every year the current TV licence system is now losing over &euro;50 million.  To put that in context, that is the equivalent to the annual cost of all programming on RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s radio stations and orchestra.  It is more than RT&Eacute; spends annually on news and current affairs programming on RT&Eacute; 1 and RT&Eacute; Radio 1.  It is more than double what RT&Eacute; currently spends on TV drama.  It is more than three times the current Broadcasting Association of Ireland, BAI, sound and vision scheme, which supports independent producers.  That is the amount being lost every year.  The system is also unfair on those who pay.  It should be a universal fee to which all households contribute and benefit, but over a quarter of households now do not pay at all.  The TV licence fee system is now by some distance the most unreformed part of the public media in Ireland.  Fixing this is the responsibility of Government.  Persistent failures to do so have already cost jobs, both within RT&Eacute; and the broader audiovisual sector, and hundreds of hours of journalism, creative and cultural programming.  <\/p><p> Key decisions are now essential to secure the future of public service media in Ireland and those who work in it.  Inaction will mean a decline in RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s relevance, financial sustainability and the level of services it can provide.  Those who gain from this decline will not be Irish-owned media organisations but, in the main, large international media providers who invest little or nothing in Irish-focused programming or journalism or create or sustain jobs here.  <\/p><p> Much is at risk beyond RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s own future, from Irish investigative broadcast journalism, comprehensive election and political coverage, international broadcast news coverage, to in-depth coverage of Northern Ireland and national regional coverage, a vibrant Irish TV drama sector, a viable independent production sector, distinctively Irish children&rsquo;s programming, cultural and arts programming, significant investment in Irish sport and Irish-language news, current affairs and radio services.  None of these services or activities is sustainable on any scale in this country without a strong and viable RT&Eacute;.  I thank the Chair.  We look forward to the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021042700002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619523000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Forbes for her opening statement.

The largest element of the expenditure was annual grant funding provided to RT&Eacute;, totalling &euro;196.5 million.  Grant funding to Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge amounted to &euro;36.2 million.  The broadcasting fund, which is used mainly to grant assist the development and production of programmes for radio and television, received a contribution from the Vote of &euro;14.8 million in 2019.  The fund is managed by the BAI.   <\/p> <p>  A substantial part of the Vote expenditure on broadcasting is funded by appropriations-in-aid in the form of broadcasting licence fee income.

Payments to An Post to cover the costs of collection of the licence fees totalled &euro;11.4 million in 2019.

The provision of funds to public service broadcasters by cable and satellite providers is a subject that is being discussed in many countries at the moment, but that is not the case in most countries.

Having said that, to give the Deputy an indication I can say that last year was an incredible year on many levels, whether it was simply keeping everything going and keeping the country going or the huge shifts we saw in how we work as an organisation.  On the one hand, our expenditure was less than expected.  Why was that?  Some of the big sporting events did not happen.  The Olympics and the UEFA European Championship were cancelled and the GAA season, along with a huge amount of other sporting activity, was curtailed.  However, some of those events were deferred and were not cancelled completely and we are hoping some of them will happen this year.  Likewise, a lot of production could not happen.  We had to stand down &quot;Fair City&quot; for many months while we physically could not produce it.  The sector, particularly in the first lockdown, was not able to produce.  We did not fulfil our commitment to the independent sector last year because it was not possible as it was not able to produce.  Our expenditure was lower than expected but our revenue was also lower than expected, even though as the country opened up we got a bounce and revenue improved.  All in all, when our accounts come to pass - and it was reported recently in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>- we will report a surplus in 2020.  That was an unreal year, however, and we have to look at Covid over a two-year cycle because a lot of the reason we were able to do better than was anticipated was the deferral of a lot of cost but that cost will come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021042700002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1619523000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>How does that impact RT&Eacute;'s revised strategy for 2020 to 2024 and the actions within that strategy in response to the financial crisis RT&Eacute; is facing?

The independent sector is hugely important to us.  We are a partner in the production and provision of Irish content to our audiences.  That is the first thing.  Last year was a particularly tough year for the sector because practically no production was possible during the first lockdown.  We were producing here as an essential service but everybody was still getting to grips with protocols and how to produce in a safe environment, so the first lockdown was very difficult.  As I said, we underspent our commitment so we have commissioned excess programming this year to try to make up for that shortfall.  We have regular contact and dialogue with the sector and have commissioned significant content this year.  We talk with Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, on a regular basis and constantly update it on where we are at.  This year will be a challenge - it already is - and we are seeing some issues come our way even with mandatory hotel quarantine, for example.  We have a production crew coming in from Belgium on an important Irish drama in June and it is proving a huge issue in terms of both cost and availability.  We are not out of the woods yet but the important thing is our commitment to absolutely honour what we should be spending.  It is also important to state that under the Broadcasting Act 2009 it is a requirement of RT&Eacute; to spend that money and we have two years after the year in which we did not spend it to do so.

Yes, in theory production can happen anywhere but having said that, there has to be infrastructure around it.  The Deputy rightly pointed out that we produce a lot of content in Donnybrook.

As the Deputy said, the land we sold went for a very lucrative price.  I think it was the highest price per acre ever in this market.  The value has now reduced but that does not mean it may not rise again.  The thing we have to think about, and we have done a lot of work on this over the years, is that it is quite a complex matter simply to lift and shift RT&Eacute; because of the infrastructure needed for broadcast.  While the Deputy is correct to say that, if we were starting again, we would probably not need all the studio infrastructure we have right now, we have to look at the feasibility of that because the last time we looked at this, which was a couple of years ago, the amount of money we would get from a land sale and then to be able to build would not add up.  We simply would not have enough money.  If we take, for example, what the BBC has done and what the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is doing, they are availing of significant other cash to move from where they are to where they are going to be.  Typically, they are part of renewed areas or media city developments, so they are becoming anchor tenants in a creative space.  They are getting preferential rates and everything else to be part of this.<\/p> <p>  This is something we have to keep on the agenda and keep looking at, but the maths, the last time we did them, did not add up in terms of being able to afford to move and build what is needed.

Having said that, plans are afoot and it is great to hear that studios are coming in and setting up sound stages in the years ahead in and around Dublin, Wicklow, Wexford and so on.  That is something we keep a close eye on but, as I said, the maths just do not add up at this point.  The interesting thing about the land we sold is that it was greenfield; there was nothing on it.  It was a ready-made field that did not have any complex infrastructure.

To return to the issue of the licence fee, commitments were made in 2019 by the then Minister with responsibility for communications to examine the device-based model, which I am under the impression RT&Eacute; would support.  Has there been any significant communication or development between RT&Eacute; and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on that issue, and will the witnesses give an update on it?  We are not the only country that is struggling with public funding through a device-based model.  In the UK, there has been a great deal of unhappiness since March at the fact the BBC did not manage to adopt a more progressive funding model.<\/p><p>One of the things that was pointed out during that back and forth was that the Government had a concern that due to a failure to roll out broadband, a device-based model of funding for the licence fee would disenfranchise a certain section of the population.  A device-based licence fee would be based on access to broadband, with regard to the public broadcasting aspect of it.  I am interested in Ms Forbes's thoughts on that.  Is a device-based model for the licence fee directly linked to or dependent on our roll-out of broadband?<\/p><p> My second question is around RT&Eacute; Player.  It is probably not news to RT&Eacute; to say that sometimes there is criticism of RT&Eacute; Player and its efficacy.  I would like to understand a little bit more about how RT&Eacute; is going to update that and keep it as live and relevant to users as it can possibly be.

As the Deputy has pointed out, there have been some technical issues.  It is worth saying, at the outset, that the nature of the RT&Eacute; Player is complex because it is a combination of live and streamed content, unlike Netflix and unlike Amazon, but Amazon does have some live sport.  When one thinks about it, one is getting a stream from Netflix but if a person is watching RT&Eacute; Player live it is a very different entity.  Having said that, we have spent a lot of time and money in the last couple of years trying to upgrade it to the best product we can do.  In the last eight to 12 months it has improved and, for example, we are seeing that time spent on RT&Eacute; Player at the moment up by about 43%.  The amount of content has increased and the quality of the player has improved.  We have to develop and enhance it constantly.  As the technology improves, so too will our process.  I am not aware of the ISL issue but I will come back to the Deputy on it and get her an answer.<\/p> <p>  On the licence fee and the model to be decided on, there are a couple of things.  First of all, in Ireland right now if a person is watching RT&Eacute; on RT&Eacute; Player he or she does not need a licence fee.  That is the loophole in the current legislation.  We had been talking a lot with the Department about closing that loophole.  The UK closed it a number of years ago.  If a person is watching the BBC iPlayer in the UK it automatically asks if the viewer has paid the licence fee.  If not, it directs the person to the licence fee payment method.  The licence fee in Ireland is now the subject of a media commission investigation.  Part of that remit is to come up with a model that is best for this country, whether it is device-based or one of the other models.  A number of countries around Europe are grappling with this, but there are also many successes such as in Germany, Italy and the Nordic countries.  Other countries have managed to solve this.  At this stage it is being discussed by the media commission and we hope it will recommend a model in the months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021042700002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1619523000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I apologise for joining the meeting so late.

Over the years, when there was only terrestrial television, advertising revenue increased.  Since the advent of digital players, such as Google, Facebook and others, the number of platforms available to the advertisers has grown.  In the main, the money involved in advertising has reduced and the number of players having to fight for that has also increased.  There is less money with more players.  Having said that, we are working at the moment on really trying to maximise our linear advertising, which has seen declines in line with the overall market, and on trying to maximise our digital offering.  This is where we are seeing a progression of viewing going to digital.  As I said earlier, &euro;1 on linear television does not equate to the same on digital.  We must work with the industry and our advertisers on maximising the digital offering.  There is no doubt that digital advertising is taking money away from linear, but we have strong Irish content and strong programming, and Irish advertisers want to be seen in that light.  We need to do more of what we are doing.  We need to diversify more into digital areas, and we also need to come up with new revenue streams, which we had certainly planned for last year.  Of course, Covid stopped a lot of our plans.  We had a lot of plans to create events, to do more with the RT&Eacute; Concert Orchestra and to take some of our programmes on the road to have immersive experiences for the audiences, such as by taking \"The Sunday Game\" on the road.  We had plans to do a lot of that last year as another way of diversifying our revenue as an organisation.  A combination of all of those things will help us to get revenue to a more stable place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021042700002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Dee Forbes"},{"type":"speech","time":1619523000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>In doing long-term planning and planning for the next five years, does Ms Forbes see RT&Eacute; getting in a greater amount of income from that area or will it just stay static, which would result in the restriction of further development for RT&Eacute;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021042700002#K00500","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619523000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>We would hope to increase the overall pot, but the make-up of it will change.

In terms of these roles and if somebody new is to be considered, again this is done on a very confidential basis because it is a small market and we tend to know who is in the market for these sorts of roles.

The draft regulations are before the committee by virtue of the procedural requirements of section 28 of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996.  This provides that a draft of every regulation proposed to be made under the Act shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that the proposed regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.<\/p> <p>  The draft regulations amend the Protection of Young Persons in Employment Act 1996, providing for additional protections for young people engaged in the fishing sector.  The Act must be amended by these regulations to complement the full transposition of EU Directive 2017\/159 on the implementation of the social partners' agreement on the Work in Fishing Convention.  This directive is primarily a matter for the Department of Transport but certain requirements of the directive require sectoral amendments to the Protection of Young Persons in Employment Act 1996, which falls under my Department.  These will ensure that the directive is fully implemented in Irish law.  It is important to emphasise that the protections offered by the directive are already applicable to all young persons in employment under EU law but that Ireland is required to fully transpose the directive to ensure its protections are carried over into our national law.<\/p> <p>  These short draft regulations are solely concerned with enhancing protections for young persons who are employed in the fishing sector, including by restricting night-time work, working hours and holiday work.  They are not connected to general working conditions on fishing vessels and do not have an impact beyond young persons aged between 16 and 17.<\/p> <p>  The draft regulations will need to be read in conjunction with SI 179 of 2020, entitled European Union (International Labour Organisation Work in Fishing Convention) (Minimum Age) Regulations 2020.  This statutory instruction, which was introduced by the Minister for Transport, sets out the enhanced protections introduced by the EU directive that apply to young persons aged between 16 and 17 who are employed in the fishing industry.  These are now included in the draft regulations for consideration by the committee today.<\/p> <p>  These regulations provide that a young person may be in engaged in night-time work in the fishing industry only if it is required for essential training purposes and provides for appropriate rest periods.  The regulations also mean that a person aged 15 may only do light work on board a fishing vessel during school holidays provided that the hours of work do not exceed seven in any day or 35 in any week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042700002#B00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":248,"content":"<p>The first member who has indicated a wish to speak is Deputy Louise O'Reilly, who has 14 minutes if she wishes to use them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042700002#B00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I doubt if I will need 14 minutes.

This would be specific to young persons.  I have significant concerns about enforcement in this area.

This means that fishermen have to land their catches at Howth or Castletownbere.  This is an issue on which I and a number of Deputies are pressing the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

The Minister of State pointed out that the protection is in place largely to give support to family members.

We need a balance there.<\/p> <p>  How is this scheme regulated?  The Minister of State and other Deputies mentioned the Workplace Relations Commission a number of times.  In essence, is it that a complaint has to be filed by an adolescent to the effect that he or she has been mistreated in the context of the scheme?  I ask the Minister of State to respond to that question.  As already stated, we do not want to be criminalising fishing operations, particularly the smaller ones.  It may be that some of the worker rights issues that have been spoken about occur on much larger vessels that are fishing very far offshore and are away from port for a number of days, but I do not think that is the case in the context of small fishing vessels.

I acknowledge and commend its recent work in helping to produce and strengthen a climate Bill which puts Ireland on a path to net-zero emissions and mandates a 51% reduction in emissions over the next decade.<\/p> <p>  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Justin Moran, who is our head of public affairs, and Paul Blount, who is the portfolio director at Coillte and who is here in his capacity as chairperson of our 70by30 policy committee.<\/p> <p>  Wind Energy Ireland is Ireland&rsquo;s largest representative body for renewable energy, with more than 150 members.  Wind energy has transformed Ireland&rsquo;s electricity system over the past ten years, cutting millions of tonnes of CO2 emissions every year &ndash; 4 million tonnes in 2019 alone &ndash; and steadily reducing our dependency on imported fossil fuels.  We are proud of the contribution our members have made but it was only possible by the work of EirGrid, ESB Networks and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, in developing the grid and integrating renewable energy.<\/p> <p>  It is to the credit of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Rya&rsquo;s, that the policies he put in place when last in government enabled us to develop the onshore wind sector, which last year produced 38% of our electricity.  This makes us number one in the world for the share of electricity demand met by onshore wind and it ensured we exceeded our 2020 renewable electricity target.  We are also a major contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  The recent Economic Impact of Onshore Wind in Ireland report from KPMG showed that onshore wind energy is supporting more than 5,000 jobs and is worth more than  &euro;400 million annually to our economy.  Both of these figures will rise.<\/p> <p>  As we develop onshore wind, it will be alongside an entirely new industry.  Offshore wind energy has the potential to transform our energy system and our economy.  It is a multibillion euro opportunity for coastal communities and will deliver unprecedented savings in carbon emissions.  This achievement puts us in a strong position to meet our 2030 ambitions.  The 2019 climate action plan and the programme for Government set out ambitious goals of developing 5 GW of offshore wind and doubling our onshore wind capacity to 8.2 GW by 2030.  I wish to take the opportunity this morning to commend Deputy Bruton on his work in developing and delivering the 2019 climate action plan.<\/p> <p>  We know we have the pipeline of projects to achieve these targets but the most significant challenge we face is whether the grid will be strong enough to integrate this renewable energy.  Last year, Wind Energy Ireland published a series of four reports known as the 70by30 implementation plan, which set out what needs to happen across planning, grid and market policy to decarbonise our electricity supply.  Implementing those four reports gives us our best chance of reaching our 2030 targets.  I want to focus today on the Saving Power report, which sets out how to integrate more renewable energy onto the grid.<\/p> <p>  Last year, more than 10% of renewable generation was lost because the grid could not accommodate it.  In the first six months of last year alone, enough renewable energy was lost to power all of Galway city for a year.  We need a complete redesign and reinforcement of the transmission system, with a focus on parts of the country where large volumes of renewable energy will be developed.  Our fossil fuel back-up generation must be replaced with zero-carbon solutions such as demand response and energy storage.<\/p> <p>  An electricity grid and market designed for fossil fuel generators are not suitable for a future where most of our electricity comes from wind and solar.  We must reform the market to ensure the new system we are building is efficient and cost-effective.<\/p> <p>  Implementing these reports and developing the electricity grid will not be easy.  We must work with and listen to communities who will be hosting new wind farms or new grid infrastructure.  We must ensure they are empowered to be part of our energy transition and we must find ways to adapt, where we can, to meet their concerns.  The reality, however, is that we will not decarbonise our electricity system without new overhead lines, underground cables, substations, battery projects, wind farms and solar farms.  The public and political support must be there to enable EirGrid and ESB Networks to deliver the infrastructure we need to decarbonise Ireland.  Without it, we will fail.<\/p> <p>  We look forward to playing our part in EirGrid&rsquo;s Shaping Our Electricity Future consultation and the Government&rsquo;s consultation on the 2021 climate action plan.  To inform our contributions, we engaged energy consultants, Baringa Partners, to analyse how the electricity sector could deliver even more CO2 savings.  Initial results show it is possible to reduce power sector emissions to at least below two million tonnes of CO2 by 2030, which is less than half that envisaged by the climate action plan.  This will require EirGrid and ESB Networks to deliver essential grid reinforcements and to continue their world-leading success in integrating renewables onto the power system, thus enabling us to go beyond 70% renewable electricity by 2030.<\/p><p>We look forward to engaging with EirGrid, the committee and the Department when the analysis is complete.  Finally, I note that we recently published our Our Climate Neutral Future: Zero by 50 report, developed for us by UCC MaREI.  This is a call to action for every level of Irish society.  The report sets out our pathway to becoming energy independent and delivering warmer homes, cleaner air and tens of thousands of new jobs.  We can decarbonise our energy system while building a foundation for the Irish economy and our society based on zero carbon energy.  Delivering this future will require unprecedented leadership and it will not happen unless we can bring people with us by showing them the benefits of a truly just transition.  Our members can and will rise to the challenge.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cunniffe.

On future development for communities around the country, how many additional onshore wind farms might we expect to see across the Twenty-six Counties before 2030?  I would just like some sense of that situation.  Turning to public acceptance, I would like to hear the perspective of the witnesses regarding that aspect.  We had the planning regulator in with us some weeks ago and he talked about the possibility of designated areas for renewable energy.  He also referred to there almost being an effective ban in policy in some counties.<\/p> <p>  From my experience, I know the great public resistance there can be concerning what is seen as opportunistic development that is not well thought through and not well connected with communities.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that point about public acceptance.  The wind energy guidelines are still outstanding as well and I ask if the witnesses have opinions on that aspect from their experience.<\/p> <p>  Representatives from EirGrid will be appearing before the committee in the next hour.  There is some sense that EirGrid's ambition is not what it should be.  I note the wide range of proposals that Wind Energy Ireland has in respect of policy development which would have to change to meet our 2030 targets.  Will the witnesses comment on the ongoing EirGrid public consultation and the type of submission Wind Energy Ireland will be making to that consultation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#B00300","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I will take a few of those questions and then I will pass the question on public acceptance to my colleague, Justin Moran, who leads much of our public engagement work.  Starting with the number of onshore wind farms that can be expected across the country, it is safe to say that onshore wind farms are getting more efficient.  Turbine technology is always progressing well.  This means that to deliver the equivalent amount of onshore wind energy to that we already have in the system will require far fewer wind farms and turbines.  That is because they are more effective and efficient and can deliver more energy for the same number of turbines.  I do not have an exact figure for how many wind farms can be expected.  They range, quite dramatically, in size from perhaps 5 MW up to more than 100 MW, and the exact number will depend on how successful various wind farms are at auctions.  It is safe to say, however, that meeting the capacity needed will require fewer wind farms and turbines than we have today.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the planning aspect which was mentioned by the Deputy regarding the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, I think that is definitely an issue.  Much planning of renewable developments today is done on a county-by-county level and often one county might designate a certain portion of its area as suitable for wind energy development, whereas a neighbouring county might have ruled out the area right on the other side of the border for renewable development.  What we are looking for, therefore, is a more regional approach to planning, which is led by the three regional assemblies where there is an overarching renewable policy framework for developing renewable energy across the country, rather than on a county-by-county level.  <\/p> <p>  Moving to the wind energy guidelines, those are still outstanding.  We are very keen to see them, and I imagine we want to see them more than anyone else.  For us, there are several issues in the draft wind energy guidelines, especially related to the noise element.  We want the final guidelines to be based on scientifically robust and implementable solutions.  Whatever is published in the wind energy guidelines from a noise perspective, therefore, needs to be deliverable and implementable.  <\/p> <p>  I refer also to several other areas of the wind energy guidelines, such as set-back distance being increased to four times the tip height of turbines.  That is a change from the current set-back distance of about 500 m.  It is likely to go out to 750 m or 800 m, which will reduce the land area available for onshore wind energy generation by about 40% compared to today.  However, we recognise this is necessary and it is something we are absolutely willing to work with.  There is also a point in the wind energy guidelines on reducing shadow flicker, which is an issue.  We again absolutely accept that is something that needs to happen.  For us, therefore, we want to see those guidelines published quickly and they must be based on scientific evidence, especially concerning the aspect of noise, and they also need to be implementable. <\/p> <p>  The last point I will mention concerns EirGrid's consultation, and then I will pass over to Mr. Moran to comment on the public acceptance issue.  This is the biggest consultation I have ever seen EirGrid do.  Its level of engagement has been exceptional and it is reaching out to all parts of society.  The consultation proposals regarding the future of the electricity grid, the markets and how the system is operated are well considered.  There are four options for grid and network development.  We will be asking for a blend of those four options.  We do not believe that any one option will be the solution and I think EirGrid acknowledges this point as well.  Our focus is on trying to deliver the capacity targets set out in the Climate Action Plan and the programme for Government, and we would like to see an electricity grid developed which can help to meet those capacity targets.  I will pass over to Mr. Moran now to respond to the aspect of public acceptance.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I will pick up on one point Mr. Cunniffe mentioned about the number of turbines and give a practical example.  We have a wind farm at Barnesmore in County Donegal that one of our members is repowering.  This example will give the committee members an idea of how the change in technology is occurring.  That wind farm has 25 turbines and a generating capacity of 15 MW.  We are going to take down those 25 turbines and 13 will be put up instead, halving the total number.  However, the generating capacity will go from 15 MW to approximately 60 MW to 70 MW.  That gives an idea of how rapidly the technology is changing, to the point where we now need fewer turbines to get the same amount of power.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of public acceptance, opinion polling consistently shows substantial levels of support, 70% to 80%, for wind energy in Ireland.  Even when people are asked a question about a wind farm near them, we still see majority support even in rural Ireland.  On our end, we need to engage with those people who have questions and concerns about projects.  Frankly, we must be improving that aspect continually and always doing a better job.  One of the ways we do that is by listening and then changing projects as they are ongoing.  It would be very rare today for an onshore wind farm project to finish as it started.  The project will change as the concerns of people are listened to and adjustments are made accordingly.  <\/p> <p>  For example, one project in the midlands started out with either 27 or 29 turbines and it is now going to be built with 23 turbines.  The substation has also been moved to a different location.  Those changes have all been based on the feedback that came from people in the community.  I think the Deputy is right, therefore, and this issue touches on the point made by Mr. Cunniffe at the end of his contribution.  The only way we are going to develop wind farms and grid infrastructure is through enhanced public engagement as early as possible.  We must not just listen to people, which is obviously valuable, but also take their views into account and adjust accordingly wherever that is possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Moran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Mr. Paul Blount might have something to add on these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I reiterate and emphasise the point that Mr. Cunniffe was making about the importance of a blend to enable the installed capacity targets to be met.<\/p><p>In many respects, the grid is a key enabler of competition.  If we are to deliver this transition at the least cost to consumers, the grid is what will enable competition.  By going for a blend of the options that EirGrid has put forward, we enable the competition that will allow transition to be delivered at least cost and with the ability to flex to the higher levels of ambition that I expect will inevitably come.  I really want to emphasise that point.  EirGrid has done the work and analysis on this and it is a case now of making the right decisions.<\/p><p> There can be a tendency to focus on the cost of providing the grid infrastructure.  We need to start thinking of it as an investment that will enable cheaper forms of renewable energy to come onto the system.  We must approach it with the kind of mindset that if there is underinvestment, the transition may become more expensive.  We need to invest the right amount in order to create capacity and enable competition.  The analogy I like to use is that failing to do this would be like investing huge sums of money in trains but investing nothing in the railway lines.  That is where we are at on this issue.

There is some concern at this time regarding the development of wind energy, which is happening apace.  That development is needed because we have our targets to meet.  However, there are concerns as to whether the environmental considerations are being taken fully into account when we are planning where the farms will go.  The provisions relating to the marine planning framework are going through the D&aacute;il this week.  My understanding is that there will be a very limited consultation on those proposals, with only a 50-minute debate scheduled in the D&aacute;il.  Even that discussion had to be campaigned for quite strongly.  Mr. Moran spoke about bringing communities on board, having full discussions and consultation and making sure everyone knows what is happening.  That is really important and I am very glad to hear it is a priority for Wind Energy Ireland.  Does Mr. Moran have any concerns that rushing through the proposals for the marine planning framework without having a full debate in the D&aacute;il could undermine that community engagement and set a scene whereby communities will already feel disadvantaged coming into the process?<\/p> <p>  My other question follows on from the point raised by Deputy O'Rourke.  In my constituency of Wicklow, there are three major wind farms planned for the coastline.  I cannot find a map showing those three farms and indicating the capacity or target relating to each.  That is the kind of information communities need.  Will providing that information be something Wind Energy Ireland can either facilitate or seek to get done, perhaps through the Department?  It is important that people understand and can see exactly what the impact of these farms will be.  What is the witnesses' opinion on that issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#C00200","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Any of the projects we are developing will need to go through an environmental impact assessment process to identify whether they will have impacts on the local environment and, if so, the efforts that can be made to minimise or mitigate those impacts.  We are really conscious of the responsibility we have to do that effectively and in such a way that we can be held to account by the planning authorities.<\/p> <p>  One of the areas in which it would be great to see some additional support or investment is in terms of ensuring that other actors in the environmental space are able to participate in the process.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, for example, is drastically underfunded.  It really needs to have the resources available to look not just at onshore wind farm development but also at offshore development in the years to come.  The same can be said of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We are going to see the development of offshore wind farms, including those the Deputy mentioned, and we will need to ensure they are adequately resourced.  We must ensure not only that the planning process is carried out in a responsible, transparent and accountable way but that it is seen by the communities involved to be carried out in that way and that they are able to participate in the process.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the national marine planning framework, I am not sure what the D&aacute;il schedule is for discussing it this week.  I see it as a document that is critical to the development of renewable energy and putting in place an effective planning framework.  There has been quite a long consultation on the national planning framework.  I understand the Government extended the consultation period to give people an opportunity to have an input into the proposals.  We need to ensure the document is properly scrutinised.  Whether that is done by allocating time for debate in the Oireachtas is a decision for members of the committee and the people who are responsible for scheduling.  It is really important to ensure that what we put in place is robust, will last five, ten or 15 years, and will provide a system that enables us to develop the offshore renewable energy production which, as the Deputy mentioned, is absolutely critical.  It must do so in a way that enables communities to participate in that process, both through the framework system and through submissions, which many communities have made, and also in respect of decisions on individual projects.<\/p> <p>  Mapping offshore wind farms can be quite a challenge.  At this point, many of those involved in the projects are simply carrying out surveys of specific locations on the seabed.  They might be carrying out a survey on a much wider space than they plan to use for the development of the wind farm infrastructure.  We need to find ways of getting that information collated better and making it more available and transparent.  If there is something we can do to work with the relevant authorities to achieve that, we would be very happy to take it on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#C00400","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cunniffe for his presentation.  We all recognise the importance of renewable energy as a significant part of meeting our electricity generation needs and the increased demand in that regard over the coming years.  Where it gets a little more difficult is in the perception, or perhaps the reality in many cases, of the saturation point having been reached for onshore wind in many of the most attractive areas from a wind capture point of view, and the significant impact that is having on communities.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on how they intend to engage more effectively in this regard and to the broader benefit of communities.<\/p> <p>  Heretofore, wind energy developers tended to do deals with community enterprises, namely, the local GAA club, a community council or similar, and provide some funding in that way.  This model, in my view, does not work and does not address the impact on some of the communities involved.  A decision can be made to go for the setback distance and put the farm out to 1 km, but there still will be people who feel impacted by the intrusion of a wind farm.  Let us be honest about this.  Some people are concerned about noise and some are concerned about flicker.  If one drills down into their real concerns, some people will talk about health issues, which are certainly not proven and probably not real.  They are also concerned about the visually intrusive nature of wind farms.  Are the witnesses considering a greater level of involvement for communities in discussions on matters of this nature?  I am not referring to situations where people are participating with their own equity.  Is Wind Energy Ireland going to share the profit or gain with a wider cohort of the community than just the community groups, local GAA clubs or landholders?  That is critical in getting some of the areas to a point where they can be developed.  There are certain areas in which I expect the witnesses will never get the support of people for development.  That will have to be taken into account.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that there has been a lack of engagement through the Covid period.

Then I will pass over to Mr. Moran to talk about the community benefit and some of our work there.  Then I will pass over to Mr. Blount to talk about the engagement during Covid.<\/p><p> On the saturation issue mentioned, there was a very interesting presentation last week by the planning consultants MKO at the Wind Energy Ireland conference.  That showed that delivering the 4 GW of additional onshore wind energy we need between now and 2030 would require 0.3% of the land area in Ireland.  The amount of land area that is required to develop 4 GW is getting smaller all the time because the turbines are getting more efficient and fewer are needed, effectively.  When that 0.3% is dispersed across multiple counties, it should not lead to an oversaturation in particular parts of the country.<\/p><p> In terms of how we see development with communities over time, Wind Energy Ireland carries out a pipeline survey of its members every nine months to understand how the onshore and offshore wind pipeline is progressing in the country.  If you look back over the pipeline surveys over the past two years, it has been very interesting to see projects at very early stages of development go from one survey to another and, very often, get smaller over time.  That is because they have engaged with communities in the early stages of development.  They have optimised the placement of turbines and removed them in certain instances, like Mr. Moran mentioned earlier.  We really are trying to bring communities with us and have those discussions at the earliest possible opportunities we can.  I might let Mr. Moran and Mr. Blount talk a little bit more about that separately.<\/p><p> The potential for offshore wind energy in Ireland is enormous.  We have a challenge of getting to 5 GW by 2030.  That challenge is not set by a lack of projects being developed or the developers that are there to deliver it.  The challenge is ensuring we get a planning system up and running as quickly as possible, we have a grid system up and running so that projects can be connected to the grid, and we have a route to market so that we have auctions available to deliver 5 GW.<\/p><p> It was a fantastic announcement by the ESB a couple of weeks ago and it is real evidence of the just transition happening from coal to the future of offshore wind energy.  The vast majority of offshore projects developed this decade will likely be fixed bottom offshore facilities, predominantly located off the east coast, but certainly some will be required off the south and west coast, most likely, to hit the 5 GW target.  We can see floating offshore wind projects playing a role towards the latter half of this decade and certainly into the future.<\/p><p> The programme for Government set a target of 30 GW of floating offshore wind potential.  What we saw in our recent UCC report, which looked at getting to a zero carbon economy by 2050, was that we need about 25 GW of renewable energy between now and 2050 purely for our own domestic demand.  That is not even taking into account the export potential that was referenced in the programme for Government.  I have no doubt we need to continue developing onshore and progressing our offshore development, especially floating technology, as we go out into the 2030s and 2040s, and we need to develop solar energy because we need diversity across the renewables portfolio.<\/p><p> I will pass over to Mr. Moran on the community benefit and he will be followed by Mr. Blount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>There is a real opportunity for Senator Dooley and other members to get involved in shaping how those community benefit programmes will run.  As members may be familiar, under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, that was launched last year, every wind farm participating in that scheme will need to put in a payment to the community benefit fund of &euro;2 a megawatt hour.  That works out at roughly between &euro;4,000 and &euro;5,000 for a megawatt of installed capacity.  For a 20 MW farm, it will cost somewhere between &euro;80,000 and &euro;100,000 a year for 15 years going into a local community.  The really impressive part about the renewable electricity support scheme is that it has put community control and influence over where the money goes at the heart of how it is being developed.<\/p> <p>  The reason I said there is an opportunity here for members is because the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is running a consultation asking people to provide input on how community committees should be structured, set up, the powers they should have, and the supports and resources that should be available.  We are very keen to see communities empowered and enabled as much as possible to ensure the SEAI provides them with the resources that enable them to take best advantage of this.  A wind farm, for example, could be a transformative opportunity for a small rural community or a coastal community when offshore wind farms come together.  Let us think about how we can use this money over ten or 15 years to leave a real lasting legacy in that community.  It is not just investment in small pockets.

The committee has been very strong in wanting to double the ambition we set out in the climate action plan, which is welcome.  I see the witnesses are talking about moving to in excess of 85% capacity for wind on the grid.  There is a dilemma for both politicians and the witnesses.  We all want more but, as we have seen with housing, it is often politicians themselves who, having declared a housing emergency, want to block each individual case and want every piece of a case heard.  We need to find a better way of doing this, and that is not to criticise politicians who feel frustrated, because I know that happens.  If we find that every case is going to be pursued by a group of politicians or judicial reviews, we will never get this done and we are wasting our time declaring an ambition of 51%.

We need public and political support to deliver what we are trying to do here.  It is not just wind energy, but also grid infrastructure.  If we really want to deliver a net zero-carbon economy, we need renewable energy because the electricity grid will be the backbone of not just our electricity supply but of our heating and transport sectors and all our services.  We need to start looking at things through the lens of an investment rather than as a cost.<br\/><br\/>Regarding international best practice, many European countries are trying to double their wind energy resource.  This is a challenge faced throughout Europe and across the world based on some of the announcements in other jurisdictions.  We work with partners in Wind Europe, our trade association body at European level, to try to identify best practices of engaging with communities.  The Deputy is right that we need to do more by going into communities and explaining the benefits not just of wind energy but of infrastructure in general, be that transmission grid, distribution grid, broadband, transport networks, etc.  It is a challenge for all of us.  <br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked about the backup capacity.  Security of supply is paramount, and we need to ensure that the supply of electricity can remain secure and reliable as we transition to a zero-carbon portfolio.  The diversity of renewable energy will certainly help with that.  Onshore wind, offshore wind and solar generation have diverse availability patterns.  At times when solar might not be available, wind might be available and <i>vice versa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>We need to look further at interconnection and how it works.  We need to see the Greenlink interconnector delivered in 2023.  We need to see the Celtic interconnector delivered by 2026.  This will diversify our security of supply to other jurisdictions and will allow the efficient trade in power so that when we have excess power we can export it and when we do not have power, we can bring it in from other jurisdictions.<br\/><br\/>In the short to medium term we need to look at long-duration storage.  Several technologies today provide multi-hour battery storage, for example.  Very often our issues when it comes to security of supply are of a multi-hour timeframe, for four to five hours over the evening peak, as we saw during the wintertime just gone.  Multi-hour storage devices charged with renewable energy ideally during other times can be used to provide cover at those evening peaks.  They represent one zero-carbon solution that does not depend on fossil fuels.  <br\/><br\/>In the longer term we need market incentives in order to drive a transition towards a carbon-free molecule to combust, be it hydrogen or something else.  We really need to think about how we evolve the thermal portfolio of our system away from one that is focused on coal and gas more towards clean carbon source.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked if there were any obstacles to delivering this.  The biggest obstacle for both onshore and offshore wind energy is grid infrastructure.  We need the grid to be capable of exporting the available power to where it is needed.  There are several examples of wind farm projects on the onshore side which have planning permission but are not progressing because the grid infrastructure to deliver the power to where it needs to be is not there.  <br\/><br\/>Similarly, the EirGrid consultation has shown that significant investment is required on the east coast in order to deliver our ambitions there for the 5 GW capacity.  We will also need to look at the south coast and west coast in that regard.  <br\/><br\/>Mr. Moran may wish to make comments about the investment in the recent KPMG report that we used.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":317,"content":"<p>An investment of approximately &euro;2.6 billion or &euro;2.7 billion will be required for developing the electricity system and developing onshore wind farms and solar farms over the next few years.

When the community does not accept a bad proposal and it does not go ahead, it sets back the other good projects in an area.  I can think of a poor project in Galway now and contrast it with the Galway Wind Park which got great support.  Do we need to look at best practice from the outset and not to make a proposal that is likely not to get support because it does not always change over time and then negativity has set in at a very early point?<\/p> <p>  I do not believe the witnesses talked about opportunities for Ireland on the manufacturing and maintenance side.  We are talking about energy generation and exporting excess energy, but perhaps there is an opportunity for Ireland to get involved even though we are coming to it later than other countries, such as Germany.

Last year we published a report, entitled Harnessing Our Potential, which looked at the investment opportunities for offshore renewable energy.  It found that there is a commercial opportunity for port infrastructure off the west coast and east coast which can help become a supply base and create an indigenous supply chain to support the offshore wind energy industry in Ireland.  It is certainly something that is worth looking into.  We believe we could have a commercial opportunity for a staging port which would be worth about &euro;70 million.  There would be a commercial opportunity for an operations and maintenance port worth about &euro;350 million.<\/p> <p>  This report was based on the climate action plan target of 3.5 GW rather than the increased target of 5 GW.  Between now and 2030 we will need an investment in offshore wind energy of approximately &euro;18 billion.  Looking forward to post-2030 potential, we believe an additional &euro;42 billion is on the table.  It is all about how much of that opportunity Irish companies can tap into and harness.  We are very much minded of that and we have a very active supply chain working group looking at those opportunities.<\/p><p> One of the final comments was on the west and north west.  To return to the grid infrastructure, one of EirGrid's current options, as part of its consultation, concerns the savings that can be made in grid infrastructural requirements if some large energy users can be moved from the Dublin region to other parts of the country, and it is examining the west and north west as options in that regard.  Delivering that will require public policy support to achieve the transition and infrastructural development in things such as fibre broadband that are very important to the large information-driven industries developing around the Dublin region at the moment because of their broadband infrastructures.  That will be vital for bringing not just investment in renewable energy but also the demand out of Dublin and towards the other regions.<\/p><p> Mr. Moran or Mr. Blount might wish to comment on the NPWS or the other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>To take the operations and maintenance opportunity, for example, it is worth mentioning that a number of people are already working in operations and maintenance in Ireland.  One company, off the top of my head, is Enercon, a turbine manufacture from Germany whose Irish national headquarters is located in Tralee.  It employs about 150 people across the country, most of whom are turbine technicians who travel throughout the country.  These are jobs in rural Ireland for engineers and technicians who, in many cases, have come back from other countries.  When we move to offshore, a typical 500 MW or 600 MW offshore wind farm would have between 80 and 100 operations and maintenance jobs once it is up and running in whatever port or harbour is identified as its support.<\/p> <p>  On the point about public engagement, we need to get out there as early as possible and constantly try to find ways to improve.  It is fair to say that as an industry, the approach and the investment of time, money and resources we put into community and public engagement today is very different from what it would have been, say, ten years ago, and we are getting better and stronger in that regard.  I accept the point that it can be confusing if a project changes or is amended.  There is a communications task in being able to explain to people that a project has changed because they asked us to change it.  It is about giving them a sense of empowerment and control over the decisions being made in their area.  We need to explain that we have moved a particular substation because we were asked to, or that we are constructing it differently because we were asked to.  That is work we need to do.<\/p> <p>  On the NPWS, when we are developing onshore wind farms and, in the future, offshore wind farms, we need to do so in such a way that allows us to protect Ireland's biodiversity and to ensure that what we are developing will mitigate environmental impacts where possible.  The earlier we can engage with the NPWS about projects, the better and stronger not just we will be but also the projects themselves.  There are steps we can take as an industry.  I take this opportunity to plug that we have just launched our all-Ireland pollinator plan with the National Biodiversity Data Centre.  Wind farms increasingly take up a specific geographic location or space.  We need to examine what we can do to build, operate, maintain and manage them in a way that enhances Ireland's biodiversity.

While Deputy Bruton stated that politicians and communities are objecting, in general judicial reviews arise because we do not screen out the bad applications in the first instance.  The way in which we could do that is by having the marine protected areas zoned before dealing with the marine planning, or by having the two go hand in hand.

Deputy Devlin asked about the measures we need in order to reduce the number of dispatch-down instructions, given that that is a grid challenge with EirGrid coming in.  There are two elements to dispatch-down, namely, constraints, which are a local area problem, and curtailment, which is a system-wide problem that deals with the inability of the system to manage securely the level of wind energy on the grid.  To take the system-wide issue first, the main step we need to take over the next ten years is to substitute fossil fuel generators with clean, zero-carbon sources of providing services to the grid.<\/p><p>These services relate not only to energy but to stability as well.  Examples include things like demand side response, battery storage and some of the newer technologies involved.  The ESB announcement some weeks ago is relevant too.  These factors will be really important.  We see this as the primary way to make space on the grid for renewable energy.<\/p><p> We carried out some work with Baringa last year.  It showed that if we can transition to these zero-carbon services, then we can remove 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the power sector.  That is approximately one fifth of our emissions today.  That does not require any new large-scale grid infrastructure.  It can be done.<\/p><p> Another point is that we absolutely need investment in our grid infrastructure.  We need to use the existing grid better.  There are ways to do this and new technologies that can better utilise existing lines.  One area in particular is hybrid connections.  This was referenced in the 2019 climate action plan but it is not in the 2021 climate action plan goals for this year.  We would like to see this improved.

I am joined by Ms Suzanne Collins, our head of public relations, and Mr. Liam Ryan, our chief innovation and planning officer.<\/p> <p>  The climate action plan, underpinned by the recently published Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, will set out a pathway to reduce carbon emissions across society and the economy by 50% between now and 2030.<\/p> <p>  EirGrid operates the power system on a 24-7 basis across two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland, thus ensuring people have electricity at all times.  EirGrid is also responsible for planning the power system of the future.  Our planning horizon runs for decades.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is a world leader in renewable energy integration, namely, onshore wind.  Last week, we reported the fact that Ireland achieved 43% of all electricity from renewable sources in 2020.  This was an extraordinary achievement and ahead of the 40% target set back in 2008.<\/p> <p>  As recently as March of this year we signed off on our capability to operate the power system at 70% renewables on the system on an instantaneous basis.  We are the only island country in the world operating at this level.  We expect to be able to operate at 75% by the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has exceptional untapped wind resources, particularly offshore.  They equate to approximately ten times what is currently installed on the island of Ireland, namely, 5,000 MW.  As we look to 2030 targets and ultimately to net zero emissions in 2050, offshore wind has a key role to play.<\/p> <p>  The forthcoming climate action plan seeks to transition the electricity system from the aforementioned 43% from renewable sources last year to at least 70% by 2030.  We are among an elite group in the world with such ambition.<\/p> <p>  I will set out some context.  The task of meeting the target of 70% of electricity from renewable sources in 2030 represents a whole-of-system challenge, one that has to be dealt with across three dimensions.  I will elaborate on these three dimensions.  First, the total system demand for electricity is going to increase by as much as 50% in the coming ten years due primarily to data centres, electric vehicles for transportation and heat pumps for homes.  Second, the generation portfolio is changing dramatically as fossil fuel plant exit the system and the fleet of renewable generators increases by between 100% and 200% through continuing investment in onshore wind - something Ireland is excellent at - new solar generation and a major new industry centred around offshore wind generation.  Third, EirGrid occupies the space in the middle, completing the jigsaw and delivering the balancing act across the three dimensions, including operations, the market and the network, more commonly referred to as the grid.<\/p> <p>  While operations and markets are fundamental to achieving the renewable energy target of 70% by 2030 I will focus on the role of the grid in this discussion because it tends to attract the most attention and is the most controversial.  Let us consider demand and generation of electricity.<\/p><p>To understand the grid, one must understand generation and demand.  Today, we have a mixture of fossil fuel generation, including coal, peat and oil, as well as onshore wind spread across the country.  In fact, we have onshore wind in 80% of counties in the Republic of Ireland.  As we transition to 2030, more onshore wind will be required in most counties, solar generation will be developed in the southern half of the country and offshore wind will be developed in the Irish sea on the east coast.  The following questions have to be answered: where is demand going to be located?  What is the optimum balance of renewables technologies?  Where should generation of renewables be located when looked at through the lens of the necessary supporting grid infrastructure?  The grid is what holds the system together.  Our Shaping our Electricity Future programme, which we are discussing, is designed to answer these questions and thus provide a clear picture of our power system in 2030, including setting out the optimum pathway to delivering this future of a power system with 70% of electricity coming from renewable sources.<\/p><p> To find the optimum grid solution we have distilled a major body of work, which we have been engaged in over the past year and a half, into four fundamental approaches, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.  Before I speak to the four approaches, I stress a number of points.  First, the approaches are not mutually exclusive; it is not about picking one option at the expense of all others.  The issue is more complex than that.  Second, all approaches require significant grid infrastructure &ndash; there are no easy options.  Third, almost every county in Ireland will see some level of impact.  Fourth, the objective of the process we have designed is to find the best solution in consultation with a vast array of stakeholders.  What I mean by the best solution is that it delivers the objective of 70% by 2030, and it does so at an acceptable cost.<\/p><p> I will briefly go through the four options.  The first option is called \"generation-led\" and the concept is that Government policy would inform where electricity generation will be located, particularly with reference to where demand for electricity is high and where the grid network is strong.  The second option is called \"developer-led\", which is the current approach.  I must emphasise that the current approach has served us well in getting us to in excess of 40% renewables on the power system last year.  The third option is called \"technology-led\".  It is somewhat more radical, using technology that is deployed on offshore wind farms to move large volumes of electricity across the country to high demand regions.  The fourth option is called \"demand-led\" and involves Government policy informing where large demand users might be located, particularly with reference to strong grid infrastructure and adjoining renewables generation, thus moving away from a Dublin-centric emphasis, which is the way things have developed in the past.<\/p><p> I refer to engagement.  We cannot achieve this ambition on our own.  We need support across a vast range of stakeholders, but particularly in the community and political domains.  We launched Shaping our Electricity Future on 8 March last and so far the response has been positive and very measured.  It has been genuinely inquiring as people seek to understand what the future will look like and what voice they can have in that future.  This all-island engagement programme will do four things.  It is reaching deep and wide, both at national and regional levels, involving more than 20 set piece events.  It is highly transparent.  The high-level document in plain English runs to 20 pages and the detailed technical document runs to approximately 200 pages.  It is backed up by a major communications programme, national, regional, local, radio, newspapers and social media.  It is be underpinned by a real commitment on the part of EirGrid to listen to all views.<\/p><p> I will summarise my message.  Enhanced electricity generation using renewables is at the centre of EirGrid's approach.  This transformation will have a significant impact across the country and will impact every county.  Our engagement process will reach into all levels of society and business across the country, North and South.  We have options, but all options include unpopular choices.  Shaping our Electricity Future will provide the roadmap to deliver the policy objective of 70% renewables by 2030.<\/p><p> I and my colleagues will be delighted to take questions from the members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Foley.  While we are figuring out the order of the members raising their hands, I will ask about the North-South interconnector, which is a critical piece in EirGrid's plans.

My understanding is that unless we push through with this we cannot achieve the level of renewables penetration we would like on the grid either in the North or South.  Perhaps you will discuss that, the method of delivery and how you see the project progressing.<\/p> <p>  Second, I refer to the consultation EirGrid is running until the middle of June, which Mr. Foley mentioned in his statement.

I will ask Ms Collins to speak to that shortly but, first, I will deal comprehensively with the North-South interconnector project.  It has attracted a great deal of controversy and I have been involved in engagements on it as recently as last week.<\/p> <p>  First, all four approaches in Shaping our Electricity Future assume that the North-South interconnector will be built.  I will frame my answer about this project in three questions.  First, why is this project needed?  Ours is an all-island integrated system, not two systems.  Long before me, people worked very hard to create the exemplar of North-South co-operation, the integrated single electricity market.  We look at the system as an integrated, all-island system.  Second, the current link between Northern Ireland and Ireland is very basic and might best be described in lay language as a modest, single-lane carriageway, to use the analogy of a road network.  It is a line that runs up through County Louth and into County Down.  This very constrained link threatens security of supply, makes the overall system much more expensive and inhibits greater integration of renewables across the island.  Frankly, we are currently moving inexorably towards a two-tier electricity system on the island if we do not address the constraints that are currently in play.  To use the roads analogy, in essence, we need a motorway to link Ireland and Northern Ireland.  This motorway would function like the spine of a body, transmitting very large volumes of electricity traffic between the North and the South and, essentially, enable the island to be truly one and fully integrated as a power system.<\/p> <p>  The second question is: why is it proposed to be overground?  Alternating current, AC, using overhead lines has been around since electricity was invented 100 years ago.  It is safe and reliable.  It is the universal network approach in every developed country across the world.  Unfortunately, AC lines are very restricted in terms of the extent to which they can be deployed safely and reliably underground.  That limit is currently at approximately 50 km and only when there is real strength in the system at both ends.  This is an undisputed technical fact.  It is a function of physics.  The 50 km is at the absolute upper boundary of what can be achieved.  The North-South interconnector cannot be delivered using an underground AC cable today.  It is close to 140 km long and the enabling infrastructure at both ends is very weak.  It is unlikely that such a length of underground AC cable will be possible for decades to come, if ever.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to the third question: what about using high voltage direct current, HVDC, underground?  This question is continuously asked of me and my colleagues in respect of a possible alternative to the North-South interconnector.  HVDC involves converting the AC form of electricity into high voltage direct current, transferring it as direct current and converting it back again at the other end.<\/p><p>This technology is available in many parts of the world.  In fact, it is used by EirGrid on our east-west interconnector with the UK, it is used extensively on offshore wind farms, and it will be used in EirGrid's proposed Celtic interconnector with France, which is to be commissioned around 2026.  This is established technology.  The big \"but\" is that it is not used anywhere in the world in what I would call the central nervous system of a synchronous power system.  It is always used on the periphery, where the consequences of failure can be managed.  It does fail because of its complexity.  It will fail and, therefore, it cannot be relied on in the mission critical environment of our all-island power system.  To be clear - when I speak about failure and the consequences of same, such a failure is inevitable.  We would see a system collapse in both jurisdictions worse than what happened in Texas recently.<\/p><p> Speaking as someone with no history with this project - I only took up my office with EirGrid in June 2018 - but who has personally investigated the options, the project is only viable as an overhead AC cable.  There is no viable alternative.  The consequence of not delivering it is that we will effectively end up with two systems across the island with a limited link on the current line.  That will drive cost increases in both jurisdictions, send us backwards in terms of the vision that those who came before us had of an all-island integrated system, and make the job of achieving 70% renewables more difficult because we will almost be doing it as two separate projects in two separate jurisdictions.  These are the honest facts about the North-South interconnector.  There is a great deal of noise about the project and many people are suggesting that A, B and C are possible, but these are the facts.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for indulging me.  It was a long answer, but it had to be that full.  I will pass over to Ms Collins to address the second part of the question on how Shaping our Electricity Future is going, what have we done and what is to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":338,"content":"<p>As Mr. Foley outlined, we are midway through a consultation that is unprecedented for EirGrid and probably the public sector in terms of its scale and scope.

As such, it is critical that we have meaningful engagement.  It is an ambitious all-island engagement programme and we want to make it as inclusive as possible.  It is amplified by media - traditional print and broadcast with a focus on regional media, and social and digital media to increase our reach.<br\/><br\/>We have been holding a series of workshops and meetings across the country.  They have been online due to Covid restrictions.  We have leveraged our stakeholder partners in the delivery of this consultation.  It has had a positive and powerful impact.  For example, Irish Rural Link is hosting workshops for us with communities across the country.  Chambers Ireland is doing the same with its business membership.  We present at these workshops and answer questions.  The National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, held a series of workshops, culminating in a youth assembly last Wednesday evening that Mr. Foley and Mr. Robbie Aherne from the project team attended.  It was fantastic and well moderated by the NYCI.  The challenge and questions coming back from the group of young people who were assembled were interesting and gave us much to think about.  We had an industry forum the same week.  It was for generation companies, developers and large energy users.  There were approximately 250 attendees.  Over the coming weeks, we will hold a civic society forum that brings together NGOs, academia and agricultural, community and environmental bodies.  We will also hold a public forum that is modelled on the Citizens' Assembly to consider issues of recruitment, demographics, geographical balance and so on.  There has been a great deal of political engagement in the form of meeting local authorities, sometimes before whole councils, sometimes before smaller groups depending on what they request.<br\/><br\/>We have had more than 80 dedicated stakeholder events at the midpoint of the campaign, covering business, civil society, statutory bodies, farming organisations and various other groups, and there have been more than 100 consultation submissions so far.  We have tried to meet people where they are and give them the kind of information and level of engagement that they want and need.  As Mr. Foley outlined, a great deal of work was done to make the information as accessible as possible.  We worked with our partners in the National Adult Literacy Agency on the language to ensure that it was accessible.  We also have a dedicated consultation portal, <i>consult.eirgrid.ie<\/i>.  People can go to it and answer a series of questions.  It tries to break down the technical information and make it as accessible as possible.<br\/><br\/>We are halfway through the campaign and open to whatever suggestions committee members might have about different forms of engagement or other groups that we need to meet.

We have heard that projects of common interest in the EU would have preferential access to the grid.  Is that the witnesses' understanding?  What measures will ensure that renewable energy will have preferential access?<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the context of the four options.  I read the detail of the consultation.  The witnesses have told us that the options are not set against one another, but they seem to be in the way the consultation is framed.  We are told that one option will lead a certain way but that it will not be available if another option is chosen.  There might be a sense of playing different elements against one another.  Will the witnesses give us a reassurance in this regard?  I am particularly concerned that policy is one of the four options.  While this relates to demand and policy driving where projects are situated, it would be good to provide a stronger understanding of the fact that policy is the context within which whatever we do will operate, for example, our environmental protections and so forth.  Marine protected areas are due to be designated.  Do the witnesses anticipate that the part of their map that maps out where they expect energy will be produced in 2030 will change as a consequence of that designation?  Will their planning respond positively to that or could the two be at odds?  It is positive that there is consultation, but the policy elements that will exist regardless of what drives the locations are important, as are our planning infrastructure and the importance of access to justice.<\/p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on the issue of storage?  Are we hitting the right balance currently between investing in storage versus focusing on potential carbon capture technologies?  How can we scale that up?  Do the witnesses anticipate Ireland having a national renewable energy reserve at some future point, perhaps by 2030, to replace our national oil reserve?  Could that happen?<\/p> <p>  I wish to comment on the question of large energy users.<\/p><p>Specifically, we are talking about data centres and that is clear from the graphics.  Is there a concern that, if we have heavy demand from data centres, that could affect us reaching the target of 70% by 2030?  What are EirGrid's plans if the requirement moves up?

As Mr. Foley and the Chair have indicated, it is a piece of infrastructure of critical importance.  I have followed this since 2006, read every publication by EirGrid and engaged in numerous meetings with them.  The assertion in Mr. Foley's opening statement that the engagement approach is underpinned by a real commitment to listening to all views is not the experience of people living alongside the North-South interconnector.  I would go so far as to say that EirGrid's approach to the communities in that region has been driven by arrogance and a refusal to acknowledge that there are any valid concerns or alternatives to their own, despite the fact that the rationale outlined by Mr. Foley as to why this project cannot be undergrounded has changed on a number of occasions since the mid-2000s.<\/p> <p>  EirGrid has learned some of the lessons on the consultation and engagement process, and we see that in the outcome of the Kildare-Meath line and the consultation process there.  The problem is that it has not learned it in the region of the North-South interconnector.  Why is there a different approach to consultation and engagement for the North-South interconnector line than for other lines?<\/p> <p>  Second, is Mr. Foley aware of the 2007 independent expert group appointed by the then Minister?  Is he aware that report described the undergrounding using DC technology as \"a credible option\"?  Does Mr. Foley accept that statement or does he think the expert group was wrong?  Its strongest argument against using underground technology was that it had not been used before to this extent.  If we were to apply that logic, we would never implement or try new technologies.<\/p> <p>  The third question I have is in respect of the review announced by the Taoiseach into the North-South interconnector.

Mr. Foley said much of the increase in demand comes from electric vehicles, heat pumps and data centres.  It is true to say that the bulk of it is coming from data centres.  In managing our grid infrastructure, would EirGrid favour a change in the planing regulations?  Dr. Ryan said that he works with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Should our planning regulations not now be taking account of the cumulative impact of data centres on our emissions targets and on our infrastructural capacity?  Would EirGrid favour such a mechanism?  Reference was made to favouring the move of data centres away from Dublin and that EirGrid would certainly support that.<\/p> <p>  A report by the Irish Academy of Engineering in 2019 said an estimated &euro;6 billion investment in the infrastructure would be required to support the influx of data centres.  How can we ensure it is not the public purse that picks up the cost of that infrastructural investment and that the data centres that require such critical infrastructure carry the burden of this cost?  What are the options to prevent more gas-powered generators coming on line, in line with the data centres?<\/p> <p>  I have a final question for Mr. Foley on the importance of the single electricity market and that a fully independent market in the North would likely increase the cost of electricity for customers in the North.  Does Mr. Foley have a view on where EirGrid stands on the options put forward in the Northern Ireland Utilities Regulator call for evidence report?  I believe there were four options.

First, I will go back to the North-South interconnector questions from Deputy O'Rourke.  On access to lands, there is ongoing engagement with local landowners.  That will continue in respect of access to lands in terms of ourselves working with the ESB.<\/p> <p>  We have procured the designers of the towers.  This has happened and contracts have been awarded to carry out design work.  Procurement notices for the full construction contracts will issue shortly, certainly within the next week or so, in anticipation of a positive outcome from the court hearings.<\/p> <p>  We acknowledge there is a difference of opinion.  I have been with Cavan County Council and Monaghan County Council in the last two weeks, and I have offered to meet with the North East Pylon Pressure Campaign protest group.  That invitation is out as we speak.  I am very hopeful there can be a discussion between my team and the protest group and that we can try to have a sensible discussion about what the facts are around underground versus overground.  I am looking forward to that engagement because the dialogue will help.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Rourke asked about EirGrid's role in the review.  EirGrid is another stakeholder.  We were not part of the terms of reference.  We have been advised that the process has been kicked off.  We expect a question and answer session to take place, or a submission to be made to the Department, on the basis of some documentation that will be forwarded to us.  We will participate in an open and transparent manner, along with other stakeholders, in that review.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the timeline for the North-South interconnector and that the dates have slipped due to the court hearing.  We are fortunate in the sense that the growth in electricity demand in Northern Ireland has been very flat over the past years post-recession and continues to be so.  To some extent, this has helped us by not making the situation so acute that the lights would go out in Northern Ireland.  We are happy that the current programme, which sees completion around 2024, will be adequate in supporting the security of supply needs in Northern Ireland.  I believe I have answered the questions there.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boylan asked a very important question about data centres and I would appreciate if she would indulge me in trying to get my arms around all of the dimensions she raised.  Should I have said the Member of the European Parliament?<\/p> <p>  The data centres are a big part of the Irish economy today.  That is a fact.  The most recent report from IDA Ireland, as I understand it, on the economic benefits of data centres suggest the overall economic benefit is approximately &euro;7 billion to the Irish economy.  This is not inconsiderable and is something we should be conscious of.<\/p> <p>  Let us acknowledge the fact that we are living and experiencing the most spectacular social experiment in human history where millions of us are working from home.  Thanks to the information and communications technology sector, I currently have 600 staff working seamlessly from home today.  I have been working from home for nearly 15 months.  Data is the currency of the 21st century so it is absolutely critical to business.  The reality is that data permeates every aspect of our lives, including the social and the non-working element of our lives.  It is ubiquitous and part of everything that happens from the time we get up in the morning to the time we go to bed.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland we must ask ourselves a number of key questions.  I will pose those questions and maybe give the committee some of the thinking that EirGrid is sponsoring at the moment.  What road do we see for data centres in the Irish economy over the next decade and beyond?  It appears that they will continue to play a central role because they are so important to the economy and to society.  What level of growth can be reasonably accommodated?  We have to ask this question.  Where can this growth be accommodated?<\/p> <p>  One will see from the four options we have presented that EirGrid brought up the possibility of high-demand centres being located not in the Dublin area but in the regions, to be less impacting.  How should it be accommodated and what should the rule-set be?  Should there be a pecking order for firm capacity, for example?  Should we reward those who deliver on their promises?  Should those who have a track record get preference?  What price or risk should be borne by the developers?  Is it time to start asking developers of data centres to bring some part of the solution such as on-site low-carbon generation?  We pose those questions with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and with the Department with a view to a new framework that would inform the growth and development of data centres into the future.<\/p><p>I hope that has answered the question from MEP, Ms Lynn Boylan. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":361,"content":"<p>It is Senator Boylan these days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#M00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I beg your pardon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Foley"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Foley.

It is not a no risk or no impact solution.  I thought our first port of call would have been to minimise those costs.  I am surprised that there is no mention of demand management in the document.  The document referred to four questions.  Surely the first question should be how we can manage the demand for electricity, including renewable electricity, because of the costs of generation and transitioning.<\/p> <p>  Data centres will be a huge cost to us.  I accept the point that they are part of how we live at the moment and have a function within our economy.  However, if we expect data centres to move to provide their own generation capacity on site, are we not better off putting a cap on the growth we will allow in the sector?  Such a cap could force changes.  The expectation that we will be able to transition to a low carbon economy while at the same time allowing an incredible increase in demand from a particular industry is a contradiction.  <\/p> <p>  I hope that the first port of call is to ask what level of demand we will accept because there will be a cost to all this, financially and environmentally.  Surely we should impose a cap on large users.  What is Mr. Foley's opinion on that?  Where does demand management come into play in the proposal?

I raised this issue with the Wind Energy Ireland representatives earlier.  The Minister, Darragh O'Brien, launched a new initiative with Cl&uacute;id Housing, in partnership with EnergyCloud, which allows for excess energy to be used to heat hot water and homes and alleviate the risk of fuel poverty - about 460,000 households are at risk of fuel poverty across the country.  About 50 houses in the Cl&uacute;id scheme are using EnergyCloud.  What are the thought of EirGrid on utilising that excess energy across the grid?  Does it view it as a realistic option that could be rolled out with local authorities?<\/p> <p>  I refer to point one of the summary.  In terms of electricity security for the island, how does Mr. Foley envisage the threat to that?  Are there any blackspots across the grid currently?

There is also a recognition that some gas generating compressors are working off grid in order to provide it with the appropriate level of electricity.

Therefore, we need to think about how that can be brought out more.  We are trying to plan for the system knowing the demand we are forecasting, which, as Mr. Foley said earlier, is up to 50%.  If it is less than that, it will make the target more achievable within a shorter timeframe.<\/p><p> We would like to work with the Government and the Department on the cap Deputy Whitmore mentioned and on how caps may be brought onto the system.  The solution we have proposed is potentially to move some of the demand outside of the greater Dublin region to facilitate the connection as much as we possibly can, knowing, as Mr. Foley said earlier, that it is a key part of the ecosystem and the other benefits back to society, and noting the concerns Deputy Whitmore mentioned earlier.<\/p><p> Moving on to Deputy Devlin's questions, EirGrid is working very closely with Cl&uacute;id Housing and EnergyCloud on that endeavour.  We see that as a potential opportunity to utilise the energy that is curtailed and constrained off the system.  The curtailment is coming because we are world-leading and at times we cannot operate the system.  We have too much generation on the system, more than we can run on it and, therefore, we are now moving that up, moving to 75% instantaneous and going above it.  We see unlocking that demand potential as a real solution to that.<\/p><p> I am trying to answer the questions very quickly.  Deputy Dooley's related to outages on the grid.  As we are operating the grid and minimising building new infrastructure, we have to take part of the existing grid out to operate it, make it stronger and modernise it more in order that the future generators and demand customers can connect onto it.  That is part of evolving the transmission system of how we do it.  Also, we see that some energy users are growing more quickly than the infrastructure can be built.  It takes a number of years to build infrastructure and, therefore, during that period some of the large energy users are putting solutions in place which allow them to grow it at the rates they want to grow it while we are developing the system.<\/p><p> The final point that was raised related to wind farms in various jurisdictions.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to be here today to discuss the draft stability programme update, SPU.  The SPU sets out the Government&rsquo;s macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for Ireland for the next five years.  It will be submitted to the European Commission later this month.  At the outset, I stress that this is a purely technical document, with the projections based on existing Government forecasts and decisions.  In accordance with the requirements under EU legislation, the macroeconomic forecasts set out in the SPU have been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.<\/p> <p>  The speed and scale of response to the supply and demand shocks created by the pandemic have been the theme of the Government&rsquo;s economic response.  Since March last year, we have moved rapidly, using the strength of our public sector balance sheet, to replace lost private sector demand in order to ensure that firms, workers and incomes were supported and protected through wage subsidies, deferrals of tax liabilities, and income supports.  Our overarching objective has been to support households and firms, as well as to limit the permanent effects of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  As we look towards a cautious reopening of the economy over the weeks and months ahead, it is clear from the stability programme update that the relationship between economic activity and public health restrictions has weakened over each wave of the pandemic.  Certain sectors of our economy have been better able to adapt to living with Covid.  The adaptability and innovation shown by businesses is borne out by the high frequency, real-time economic information published by my Department, which shows that the impact of the current set of restrictions is around half that of last spring.  Much of this is due to the flexibility of our domestic enterprises.  Firms and consumers have innovated and adapted.  Last month&rsquo;s VAT data, up 8.5 % on the first quarter last year, shows that people have altered their behaviour.  They are buying local and buying online.<\/p> <p>  As we all know, however, the pandemic has not impacted everyone equally.  Those in contact-intensive employment have suffered the most, while many others, especially those with the ability to work from home, have had very little or indeed no reduction in income and are as well off as before.  Equally, those who have continued to work have continued to pay income tax and many businesses that have been able to operate through the public health restrictions continue to pay corporation tax.<\/p> <p>  The strength of these revenues, as well as the extraordinary easing of monetary policy by the ECB, have enabled the Government to support jobs, incomes and businesses throughout the crisis.  This is only right, as the huge impact of the pandemic has demanded a forceful response from the Government.  This is what we have done.<\/p> <p>  The overall budgetary strategy remains one of providing strong, counter-cyclical budgetary support to the economy.  With a value of almost &euro;38 billion, or nearly one fifth of national income, the budgetary support provided by Government has been extraordinary.  We are in a position to do this because of the supports of the ECB and the support for our public finances over recent years.  The total value of payments paid to date under the Government&rsquo;s three main support schemes, the pandemic unemployment payment, the employment wage subsidy scheme and the Covid restrictions support scheme, is now &euro;13.5 billion.  We have spent more than &euro;7 billion on pandemic unemployment payments and around &euro;5.5 billion on wage subsidies.  While the response has been appropriate and necessary, the cost continues to be significant.  Last year, a general government deficit of &euro;18.5 billion, or 5% of GDP, was recorded.<\/p> <p>  In the medium term, the speed at which the economy can recover will depend on our vaccination efforts.<\/p><p>This was a constant theme, for example, in the recent IMF and World Bank meetings.  They are the cornerstone of our domestic recovery.  The programme is now being accelerated over the coming months.  Of course, there will be week-to-week fluctuations and day-to-day challenges but the bigger picture is clear; we are on track to vaccinate a large majority of the adult population of our country by the end of this quarter.  This in turn will allow for a more significant easing of containment measures over the summer, and with that a sustainable recovery can begin.<\/p><p> A conditioning assumption underpinning the projections in the SPU is that low levels of public health restrictions will be in place in the second half of the year, with minimal restrictions next year, which should allow economic activity to normalise.  However, it is likely that this normalisation will be somewhat different from the pre-pandemic norm.<\/p><p> Based on this scenario, modified domestic demand, MDD, which is the best indicator of economic trends, is projected to increase by 2.5% this year.  This will accelerate to 7.5% next year.  The release of pent-up consumer and business demand will be the key driver of the economy in the near term.  The recovery in consumer spending is also assumed to be supported by an unwinding of part of the excess household savings built up during the pandemic.<\/p><p> The cost of this pandemic is, of course, felt most particularly by those who have lost their jobs.  When the number of people in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment is added to the standard unemployment rate, the unemployment rate is projected to average around 16.25% this year, before declining to 8.25% next year.  This level of employment is projected to increase by around 80,000 this year and 225,000 next year, although the level of employment will still remain below its pre-crisis peak until 2023.<\/p><p> Over the medium term, an important but still open question relates to the extent of any permanent destruction of the economy&rsquo;s productive capacity from the pandemic, the so-called scarring effects.  At this base point, evidence is extremely limited.  The scale of such harm will become clear over time as more data becomes available.  Of course, a key area of focus of our existing policies is to try to minimise that scarring.  A preliminary estimate is that my Department is projecting domestic demand to grow at around 3.5% over the medium term.  This means that, notwithstanding a reversion to trend growth over the medium term, domestic activity would still be lower by the end of the projection period than the level suggested by the pre-pandemic trend, with employment still lagging.  I reiterate that the outlook remains very uncertain - for example, if more stringent health measures are needed for a longer period, the Irish economy could be 4.5% smaller by the end of next year than it would under the main scenario.<\/p><p> On the fiscal front and on a technical basis, a deficit of &euro;18 billion is estimated for the year.  This is based on existing Government policies.  I repeat, as I said previously, there will be no cliff-edge to our most important supports but any extension to these supports will, of course, worsen our deficit.  This year&rsquo;s deficit will bring our overall debt levels to just under &euro;240 billion, or 112% of national income, measured in a way that strips out some of the bigger influences of larger companies on our national income.  To put this another way, our public debt is approaching &euro;250 billion.  Once the worst of the pandemic has passed, it will be necessary to address this by eliminating our deficit over time in a way that balances supporting the economy with continued sustainable national finances.<\/p><p> A deficit of just under 3% is projected for next year.  This assumes that beyond 2022 all Covid-specific supports are assumed to be unwound.  With a recovering economy, withdrawal of these supports should be sufficient to better align what we take in and what we spend.  In other words, economic growth via increased tax revenues will be enough to close the gap between what that State earns and what it spends.  There are, however, clear downside risks for our public finances.  In particular, international corporate tax reform could weigh more heavily on this revenue stream than is currently assumed.  Having said that, our public finances are in a better position to absorb the expected shock to revenue than, for example, a decade and a half ago.  Our tax base is much wider than prior to the global financial crisis and, importantly, there is time to build up the resilience of the public finances before international reforms move to the implementation phase.<\/p><p> Overall, the pandemic has taken a severe toll on our health, our economic health and lives and livelihoods.  However, the continuing progress of the vaccination programme and the collective effort of our country provides reason for optimism.  We entered into this crisis from a position of strength and our economic model has proven its resilience.  Together, we will overcome the pandemic, rebuild our economy and return our people to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#A00400","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I will now open the floor to members.

There was relief last week when he talked about no cliff-edge for Covid-related income supports but in recent days that relief quite quickly gave way, certainly on my part and I suspect on the part of many people out there, to deep concern at suggestions that the PUP payment might be cut in the near future for sectors where there are still large numbers of people unemployed through no fault of their own because of the impact of Covid measures.  I want to get an assurance from him that people who have lost employment and income, as a result of the pandemic, are not going to be further punished because they happen to be in the sectors that are worst hit.  I think it is important to put it that way.  Some sectors have been hit much worse than others and they are going to be the longest impacted, or scarred, by Covid.  The idea that there would be a withdrawal of PUP payments from, for example, taxi drivers, whose industry is on its knees, musicians, arts people, cultural workers, areas linked to aviation, certain parts of retail, and hospitality, and that they would be punished by cuts in the PUP in the short term, when we are still a long way from the recovery of those sectors, would be unacceptable.  I want to get an assurance from the Minister that that is not the case.<\/p> <p>  I would like the Minister to comment on the reports that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is talking about troika-style monitoring of public service budgets, which is a very alarming echo of the austerity policies that failed us so badly in the aftermath of 2008.  Surely one of the things we have learned from Covid is that in areas like health, ICU capacity, hospital capacity and public health infrastructure, we do not need retrenchment; we need more investment, more spending and more capacity building.  The same can be said about education, higher education and, obviously, public housing and affordable housing.  We do not need retrenchment in these areas.  We need significant increased investment because big deficits in these areas have been further revealed because of Covid.  Again, I want an assurance that that is not the case.  Indeed, I could add climate-resilience infrastructure to that list as it needs significant increases in spending and investment.  Any talk of troika-style retrenchment would be extremely worrying when we need to move in the exact opposite direction.  Perhaps the Minister could respond to those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#B00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  Far from the Government looking to punish any parts of society or any citizens, the approach of the Government has been to sustain society while we have all been grappling with an economic crisis that has its origins in health and public health.  That is why the Government has had the PUP in place for so long.  We have sustained a higher level of income replacement for citizens because we recognise the need to support them at a time of significant challenge and that is what we have done.<\/p> <p>  What happened last year is the Government looked to begin to change and reduce those payments at the right time, as work became available and the economy began to reopen.  The Government has not yet made any decisions regarding what the nature of the PUP will be later in the year.  However, we will have to make decisions relating to that payment at the right time and look at how we can change it as the economy reopens.  We can sustain emergency levels of expenditure and very high levels of support when we need to and many people do not have the option to work.  However, as the economy begins to, and does, reopen, we will have to begin the work of moving some of the supports that are in place into line with the rest of the social welfare system.  It may be the case that we will be able to sustain some of those payments for longer than we would otherwise be able to do.  This what the Government began the work of doing in the second half of last year but we were not able to complete those changes because, obviously, we were then confronted with further developments within the disease and we reverted to a tiered level of payment on the PUP, with the highest level of payment being &euro;350.  The Government has not yet made any decisions with regard to the PUP but, as the economy begins to reopen and we move out of a health emergency, the very high current levels of spend will have to be considered and we will have to decide what their future will be.  <\/p> <p>  As regards the arrangements put forward by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, this is not about the changes in expenditure that are associated with a decade ago.  The SPU indicates clearly that, as the economy returns to a degree of normality, the return of growth will do much of the heavy lifting that is required to close the gap between taxation and expenditure.  What the Minister is recognising, and on which I agree with him, is that when we get to a point at which the health emergency is behind us, many of the very high levels of spending we have in place in particular Departments will need to be reviewed and adjusted.  As the Deputy will be aware, our current working assumption is that the emergency levels of expenditure will come to an end at the end of next year.  That is what the processes put in place by the Minister are seeking to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#C00100","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I will slightly press the Minister on that issue.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, will bring a memorandum to Cabinet today.  I am not sure what is in the memorandum, but it certainly raised alarm bells.  It would be very helpful for the Minister for Finance to give reassurances to people, particularly those in sectors where there is likely to be quite a long-term impact from Covid.  I previously referred to taxi drivers.  They will be protesting on Thursday.  Their sector will not recover until the music, entertainment, aviation and tourism sectors recover.  It would be completely wrong to cut their PUP, as it would be to cut the PUP of workers in sectors such as music or entertainment where it is clear they have lost income and employment opportunities as a result of Covid and are likely to be the longest impacted by those factors.  Assurances in that regard would be helpful.<\/p> <p>  It is not just about the fact that there are emergency Covid payments and public services.  My point was that Covid has revealed significant deficiencies in spending and investment in several areas.  It is important that we do not go backwards, to where we were previously, but, rather, recognise the lessons of Covid.  We need to increase capacity in ICUs, hospital bed numbers and public health teams around the country to name just a few examples.  Similarly, we need investment in schools such as in better ventilation, better quality buildings and smaller class sizes.  Surely these are the lessons of Covid.  Learning those lessons means increased investment and capacity building.  I have given just two examples.  Housing is another I could add.  Any talk of just returning to the situation pre Covid would not be learning the lessons of the pandemic in terms of going to the new and better normal that has been much spoken about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#C00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>A key feature of where we have been economically is that the country has been able to fund what we have done in the past year for two reasons.  First, it is due to the support of the European Central Bank, ECB, and, second, when we came into this crisis, what we were collecting in taxation was approximately equal to what we were spending.  Our national finances were in a position of broad balance.  There had been a primary budget surplus since 2014 and we were due to run quite a significant surplus for this year.  All of this was a massive help in the context of funding the significant measures we have had in place during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  In the SPU, we are planning to increase current expenditure each year by 3% to 3.5%.  We still plan to increase current spending when we have beaten the pandemic and as we reduce the emergency expenditure that is in place.

The savings of many people have increased during the pandemic.  The concern is that, as we reopen the economy, there may be a spending splurge, which may lead to inflation.  We may see money leaving the country.  People and families may be inclined to go overseas on foreign holidays when they can and the purchase of new vehicles may increase significantly if we do not seek to curb it, if that is the right thing to do.

It is a challenge that we will face, as will every other economy that has been closed for a period and is beginning the process of reopening.<\/p> <p>  In terms of where we are now, if he looks at where we were in 2020, we estimate that our household savings ratio, that is, the portion of income that is not being consumed, reached almost 24% across that year.  That is approximately double where we have been in previous years.  If we look at the comparison between February 2020 and February 2021, there was an increase in deposits of approximately &euro;11 billion during that period so there has been a very considerable increase in savings.<\/p> <p>  Regarding how much of that will be spent, at what rate and where, the stability programme update has relatively conservative assumptions regarding this.

Our assumption is that the willingness of families to spend those savings will be dependent on the degree of optimism or certainty they face regarding their own future, particularly in terms of where we are with employment.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of what we can do to respond to that challenge, the first thing is to see how we can get our economy open in a sustainable way.  There is a way in which these household savings are not facing significant bottlenecks in terms of how that investment can be released into our economy.  Second, we have to consider what we can do to try to encourage that money to be spent in ways that are more conducive to public goods within our economy and the sustainable development of our economy.<\/p> <p>  To use the issue the Deputy raised of cars, he will be aware of all the changes we made in the latest budget where we fundamentally changed our motor taxation system and also our taxes in respect of the purchase of a car to make it more aligned to public goods and reduction of climate change.

This has been an unprecedented 12 to 15 months we have lived through. To say we have given out &euro;13 billion in PUP and wage supports is a statement in itself.  The only good thing about that is that money is going to people rather than to corporations or whatever.  It is, and will be, in the economy because people will have money and they are paying their bills to keep going.<\/p> <p>  Looking at where we are and where we are going, there are a few questions.  We talk about investment and about housing and technology being two places where investment is very much needed.  I had a discussion this morning locally in a Zoom meeting about housing, the dysfunctional nature of it and what solutions we can put in place to make housing one of the triggers to economic recovery, as well as providing much-needed homes.  There is a lot of talk about affordable housing, social housing and whatever else.  The important thing is that the private housing market is not working at the moment.  I believe the cost of building a house has gone up substantially in the past number of years due to the fact we want to build a better standard of house.  We are looking at having a house that is more passive and uses less energy.  Long term, we will get the benefit from that, but the initial capital cost for developers or anybody building a house is added to considerably.<\/p> <p>  As well as that, a large volume of housing is not occupied in towns and villages and for which we are not taking any regard, in terms of the help to buy scheme or the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  For instance, with the help to buy scheme, if it is a second-hand house, the buyer will not qualify for support.  For first-time house buyers, it is imperative we get young families back into towns and villages and give them the same chance as if they were buying a new house.  A large number of houses lie vacant in our towns and villages and it would not cost the same as building a new house.  We seem to be dead against the idea of supporting that in a real, tangible way.<\/p> <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme will only support the purchase of a house.  It will not support the refurbishment the buyer will have to carry out on a house.  For example, someone could buy a house in a village for &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 and put in another &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 to have a modern living space in a town or village for a family, as opposed to spending &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000 on a new house, including buying a site, building a house, etc.  There seems to be a lack of commitment to that. <\/p> <p>  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland lately, in a presentation on the cost of building apartments in Dublin, stated that more than 70% of the space in Dublin over ground floor retail is vacant.<\/p><p>That is a great deal of space that could be used for people to live in, and one might ask why we are not taking it up rather than being driven mainly to support only people who are buying or building new houses.  If we are to get the economy to grow and grow, while at the same time increasing the potential for people to work in a blended way in the regions, towns or villages, that is important.  In the previous Government, it was a battle at times but we got the national broadband plan in place, which has proven to have been a very solid decision at the time.  If there is any way in which we can accelerate the programme, we should do it.  It is only in the past year that people have realised how much they are missing out on broadband.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#E01400","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":427,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's second point, the Government will do what we can to speed up the delivery of the national broadband plan.  The Deputy and I were involved in that decision in the previous Government and time has proven it to have been the correct decision.  I understand that the difficulty in speeding it up is related not to funding or even to the contract but rather to the impact of the public health restrictions and the fact that they have not allowed the work needed for this project to go ahead.  I hope our exiting public health restrictions will allow that work to accelerate.<\/p> <p>  On the question regarding the help to buy scheme and whether it should be made available to existing properties, there are inflationary challenges and risks with such schemes.  The way in which we have prevented those risks developing is by making the scheme contingent purely on the building and completion of a new home.  We have tried to make that policy focus as much as possible on the delivery of additional supply.  My concern is that if we were to focus such schemes on existing housing stock, although I think the Deputy is suggesting buildings that might require work in order for them to be liveable, it would not have as great an impact on the release and creation of new homes.  It would mean doing work on structures that exist or even on existing homes, and I do not believe that is the route this scheme should go down.<\/p> <p>  On the other hand, the Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and Darragh O'Brien, through the rural regeneration and development fund, have been making grants available to towns and villages throughout the country to put in place plans that allow homes to be delivered in towns and villages.  I think that is the way we should do it and I understand it is the way we are doing it, namely, by servicing land and sites in the centre of towns to allow homes to be either completed or delivered there.  That is the best way of delivering the priority the Deputy outlined, which I share.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#F00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":428,"content":"<p>The properties I am talking about are not houses at the moment.  They are derelict structures in towns and villages, and young people are willing to get involved in them and take on the challenge of doing them up and living in those towns and villages.  There is no incentive for them to do that, however, and in some cases, services such as sewerage may not be there.  This would not add to inflation.  The Minister stated he wants to increase the supply of housing, and this is one of way of doing so and at the same time rejuvenating towns and villages.  The schemes currently in place through the Departments of the Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and Darragh O'Brien, are there to provide public areas and public realms and buildings, but there are private properties too and people just need a bit of an incentive.  I think it would be a game changer.<\/p> <p>  The next issue I want to raise, in the context of future budgets and the NDP, relates to construction cost inflation.  It has been reported that because we closed the construction industry, we have lost up to 40,000 people who have gone to the UK to work.  We need to get them back.  They are people with skills such as engineers, project managers, quantity surveyors and so on as well as skilled labourers.  When we come to implementing the NDP and try to regenerate the economy through capital expenditure, the level of inflation in construction may be different from that of overall consumer price inflation.  There may be a spike in inflation in construction because material prices are increasing as a result of many factors, including the lack of supply of native timber and other resources and the increase in the price of steel, which is a scarce commodity at the moment.  In the context of the NDP and the funding in that regard, we may not get as much buck for our pound as we think we will.  What kind of contingency planning will be done to account for that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#F00300","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I absolutely understand we are facing an inflationary risk in the pricing of raw materials, an issue that has been raised with me by businesses.  On the other hand, the great challenge we faced in construction over recent years concerned the degree to which construction was competing with other priorities apart from housing within the economy, such as the delivery of commercial property, the building of hotels and other priorities that obtained at that point.  My expectation, for the short term if not longer, is that in respect of some of the other priorities the construction sector was seeking to deliver ahead of housing, a rebalancing may occur that allows a greater priority to be given to the delivery of housing within the economy.  While I accept there are issues with the pricing of raw materials and there will be issues with how we rebuild the number of workers we will need to get our construction sector up and running again, it is possible that the demand for some of the other things the construction sector has wanted to deliver in recent years may change.<\/p> <p>  From a capital point of view, we are going to continue to invest heavily in the delivery of homes.  The total level of voted capital expenditure, before the Government adds to it in the coming period, stands at between &euro;10 billion and &euro;11 billion per year.  When the previous Government, of which the Deputy was a member, started in 2016, that figure was between &euro;3 billion and &euro;4 billion.  It has increased significantly and, unlike during the previous crisis, we are not planning to cut back on it.  That will play a very positive role in delivering our priorities in housing and elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#F00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister most sincerely for taking time out of his busy schedule.  I really appreciate it.  It is very good of him to come before the committee to assist us in our work.  I will try to be helpful in telling him about some of what I have been hearing on the ground.<\/p><p>I have had discussions with people involved in the tourism sector in recent days.  As the Minister will know, the county I represent, County Kerry, is the premier tourism capital of Ireland and of the world.  The hoteliers and all the business people have told me they are finding it difficult to get employees to fill positions in their businesses.  For varying reasons, they lost their employees during the pandemic.  They redeployed to other sectors that were able to stay operating.  I have first-hand experience of dealing with some projects that were allowed to continue during the pandemic.  For instance, it is ironic that those managing some of the larger public contracts taking place throughout the country are also finding it difficult to get people with the varying skill sets required to work on the ground.  I am telling the Minister this because as Minister for Finance I genuinely want him to hear it.  I am only saying it to be helpful.  I presume he knows it already.  Deputy Canney rightly highlighted in his excellent contribution what is currently happening in the housing market as a result of the cost of materials having greatly increased.  I would make a special plea to the Minister on behalf of the Rural Independent Group which, as he will know, has flagged the issue of VAT imposed on insulation material.  We are encouraging the owners of private houses and businesses to insulate their homes and the places where we work to conserve energy and thereby reduce fuel bills.  It is a big disincentive for the State to charge VAT on those goods.  I would be worried about that.  The Minister might closely examine that area when future budgets are being adopted.  <\/p><p> In recent days, I have outlined my concerns about the timing of the introduction of carbon taxes and what they will mean for every man, women and child.  I hope the Minister heard those concerns.  All of us are interested in protecting the environment.  I appreciate we are all only custodians of the environment but we cannot cripple people with taxes.  I believe in and adore democracy.  I appreciate and fully respect the right of people to vote for whoever they want to elect to different positions.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for a person who gets to the position of being a Minister, and in particular a Minister for Finance and all that entails.  However, I am worried about the future in that we are giving control of carbon budgets to a group of people who are not elected and were not put into their positions by anybody in the public domain.  I have grave concerns about that.  If we as legislators are entitled to vote at budget time that is fine, and we live in a democracy.  If other Deputies vote through a measure that I do not like, my attitude is that is fine because that is democracy.  However, I am concerned when I see a group of disciples being brought together.  We are being told that this group will tell the Irish people in future how much tax they will pay in terms of carbon tax and what areas will be affected.  I have no problem with the Minister for Finance introducing a budget and our voting on it but my God if we are going down the road of unelected people having a say in the future finances of our people, I would have grave concerns about that.  I must put that on public record.  It would be wrong of me to say it in other forums and not to say it in front of the Minister.  <\/p><p> I sincerely thank the Minister for his work.  I acknowledge he is in his ministerial role at an extremely difficult time.  I respect work and people I see working and doing their jobs.  I know the Minister is doing that.  I might not agree with everything he does or with what his Government does but I appreciate the reasons he does it.  I also appreciate the reason those in government think every decision they make is perfect and right, but I would not agree with all of those all the time.  A number of sectors of society have been closed for a long time.  I would not have agreed with that decision but what is done is done.  As a representative of those people, be they people involved in different areas of hospitality, hairdressers or beauticians, I know they are not happy.  The fact that people were not allowed to go mass and up until today only ten people were allowed to attend a funeral has greatly upset many people.  While those in government might have thought they were acting in the best interest of the health of the people, they alienated themselves from many people because people did not agree with what they were doing.  I thank the Chairperson for the opportunity to make that contribution and I will stay quiet now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#F00500","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I thank the Deputy for his contribution.  The first thing I would say is that I never pretend for a moment that any decision I made is perfect.  All I can do, which I do my best to do, is weigh up the pros and cons of every decision.  I make a decision motivated by the public good and then justify that decision to the Oireachtas and to our country.  It is in that spirit I will quickly deal with the different points the Deputy made.<\/p> <p>  First, on his point on carbon taxing and his concerns, I assume, regarding the new carbon emissions reduction legislation that has been brought forward by the Government, he would be the first person to make the case for the beauty of the countryside in Kerry, its environment and its biodiversity.  That legislation has been brought forward by the Government with the aim of being able to protect that or minimise the harm to it for the all the generations to come and even for this generation.  That is what has motivated the legislation that has been brought forward.  Decisions on carbon taxation will always be decisions that are made with respect to the finance Bill by the Oireachtas and the Minister for Finance.  If the next D&aacute;il is unhappy with the decision-making process that has been brought forward in the Bill from the Government, the democratically elected members of that D&aacute;il can change the structure of that decision making if they so wish.  The structure that has been brought forward by the Government to deal with the issue of carbon budgets is the subject of legislation, which in turn depends on the consent of the democratically elected members of our Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's point regarding VAT on insulation materials, I cannot give any commitment about that but I will certainly have a look at it and consider it in terms of decisions that will be made later in the year.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's final point on the hospitality sector and the difficulty employers face in potentially getting their staff back to reopen our hotels, restaurants and so on, I am aware of that challenge.  It has been being raised with me directly in the context of employees who have moved from one part of our economy to another.  In some cases, employees have left our country and now face the challenge of getting back into the country.  We will have to consider those issues in terms of how we can reopen our economy in a sustainable and safe way.  At the heart of the employment challenges those in the hospitality sector face is they being able to indicate credibly to those returning to work in hotels and restaurants that they will be working in hotels and restaurants that have every prospect of being able to stay open and not be closed again.  That is what the Government is trying to do.  We want to ensure that what we reopen we can keep open and that we can have public health policy in place that will allow businesses to stay sustainably open as opposed to having to close and our having to shut them as we have done during the last year.  I am aware of the concerns the Deputy has raised.  That is why we are hoping to safely and sustainably open new parts of our economy to create more certainty regarding continuity of employment within them.  That in itself is difficult, which is why the decisions we are making at the moment are very finely balanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#G00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and call Deputy Patricia Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#H00100","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Could I just-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#H00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Sorry, Deputy Healy-Rae, your time is up.

One of the matters that has been raised at our committee is an issue around scenario analysis and planning.  We are projecting a certain amount of growth but, obviously, we are not entirely sure whether that growth will be as we project it.  We are not entirely sure, even with pronouncements from President Biden on tax changes, what companies will do in terms of corporation tax.  We do not understand growth in the medium term or what either higher or lower revenues will do to our decision-making processes.

The scenario analysis we have done here is more advanced than we have had to do in recent years.  We cover off the different risk assessments and risk matrices in tables Nos. 17 and 18 in the stability programme update.  My view is that limitations in our modelling are not preventing these scenarios being more detailed.  It is, rather, limitations in our ability to forecast and the uncertainty of future developments.  If our scenarios are in any way insufficient for the committee, it is not due to the challenges that we have with modelling and the models available to the Department of Finance, but it is a reflection of the fact that so many things could happen in the future.  We have to make reasonable assumptions regarding the most likely things and, on the basis of that, make our forecasts.  For those who believe our forecasts should be more accurate and sophisticated, as some do, I ask for their help as to how we can form a better view of what the future may hold.  We have seen how unpredictable it is over the past year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#H02000","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":454,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty and I have asked questions about the PUP.  I am still getting slightly conflicting signals from the Minister and would like to get a bit of clarity on the PUP.  Some sectors will, of course, recover,  As public health restrictions are lifted, people will be able to go back to work and they will not be on the PUP, so the Minister will not need to maintain it for them.  In respect of continued public health restrictions or the scarring effect on particular areas, a few of which I have mentioned, such as aviation, music, entertainment, certain areas of hospitality and tourism, since people's loss of employment and income results from Government public health policy, can the Minister give an assurance that he will maintain supports for those groups because otherwise he is, in effect, punishing those worst hit by the pandemic?  This would be pretty ironic considering, as the Minister pointed out, some people have not been impacted economically at all and some sectors of our economy and some of the wealthiest people and most profitable businesses have done extremely well during the pandemic.  It would be grossly unfair to pull supports from the worst affected while others have done extremely well in the pandemic.  The Minister should give assurances that he will not do that at any point when the loss of income and employment is not the fault of these people but is a consequence of the pandemic and measures the Government took to address it.  If the Minister does not give this assurance, people will be very angry.<\/p> <p>  Another question I put to the Minister last week to which I have not received an answer is in the same ball park.  Why has the Government consistently refused to extend schemes like the CRSS and the CBAS, the grant support schemes for people who have ongoing fixed costs that they cannot cover because of loss of revenue, to people who do not have rateable premises?  Those groups have been as badly hit - in some cases, even worse - as those with premises but the Minister has refused to extend the grant support schemes to them.  Again, I refer to musicians, taxi drivers, people in events and so on.  Why is the Government not giving them support when they are some of the worst hit when it comes to covering their fixed costs and when the debts they are accumulating are going to make it very hard for them to recover?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#J00100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":455,"content":"<p>In the spirit of an exchange, there is something I would like to get the Deputy's views on.  I heard him continually make the case for zero Covid, particularly when we were dealing with the consequences of the third wave in our country.  Given that we have not met the criteria of zero Covid, as he described, I would really be interested in hearing whether he is supportive of us reopening the economy in the way we are doing at the moment.  I am interested in hearing his views on this but I will answer the questions he put to me because he has put serious questions to me.  I am interested in hearing whether he, as a leading proponent of zero Covid, still stands by that view when we have levels of community transmission that are higher than he would have indicated as being safe in respect of our economy reopening.<\/p> <p>  To deal with the questions the Deputy put to me, because I accept I am before this committee to answer its questions, although I believe in debate and argument on matters, the Government has not made a decision on the future of the PUP but it is a general payment.  It is a payment that we make available to everybody and is at a level that is significantly higher than other rates of job support payments we make available to people, for example, through the jobseeker's payments.  It is significantly higher than that.  As we get to a place where our economy is reopening, we are going to have to make decisions at the right point about what the level of that pandemic unemployment payment is.  What the country will not be able to afford is a situation where our economy has reopened and is approaching a degree of normality and programmes like the PUP, the employment wage subsidy scheme and CRSS are unchanged and still exist in their current format.  That is where the Deputy and I differ.  Over time, as employment grows, I believe our deficit will need to fall to keep our country safe from other challenges we could face.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question on the CRSS, for months in the D&aacute;il, many Deputies called on me to bring in a scheme to support businesses that were required to close due to public health guidance.  That is what the CRSS is.  It is an immensely powerful and successful policy tool and has been acknowledged as such by all those on it.  It will pay out probably over &euro;500 million to businesses that need it most.  I was asked to put in place a scheme for businesses that were required to close.  That is what I did through the Revenue Commissioners and both the Revenue Commissioners and I stepped up to doing that.  We then acknowledged that there were businesses that were not supported by that scheme.  That is why a variety of other schemes were brought forward that look to address the needs referred to by the Deputy.  Schemes like the tourism interruption scheme introduced by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Covid-19 business aid scheme introduced by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment involve tens of millions of euro and try to meet the different needs that are there.  I acknowledge that there are still some businesses and citizens who feel they are not getting the support they need or deserve but we have now spent &euro;12 billion on these different schemes to meet those needs, so I can assure the Deputy it is not for lack of effort or intent on our behalf and we are looking to address the issues to which he referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#J00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I assume the Chairman is not going to allow me to respond but if the Chairman gives me time to answer the Minister's question, I am happy to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#J00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I am prepared to give the Deputy a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#J00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I do not think the Minister quite explained why some people are excluded.

The truth is that there is tremendous fatigue and there will be no stomach for trying to reimpose even harsher restrictions.

If I heard the Minister correctly, his concern is that we would end up effectively renovating homes that are already lived in and not actually reactivating vacant homes.  I encourage him to take this very seriously and to think about it because we have some very good Government policy at the moment between the rural strategy, the town centres dispersed policy being developed and the remote working strategy.  I think there are 200,000 vacant homes spread across the State.  It will not be possible to reactivate all of them but a substantial portion of them could be reactivated as homes, particularly for young families, to bring life back to our towns and villages.<\/p><p>Perhaps there is a way around the Minister's concerns and we can be creative in introducing some kind of modification of the help to buy scheme so that young people, in particular, are supported in purchasing what are essentially vacant private structures.

My view is that it is a priority.  As he stated, we have good policies in this area in terms of how we develop our town centres, but the way this needs to be implemented will vary in different towns and from local authority to local authority.  For example, if we have homes that are in an exceptional state of disrepair, the family that he is referring to may need more support than they would for a home that had not been lived in for a while and might need less work.  That is the kind of issue that is better dealt with by grants from our local authorities than through varying the help to buy scheme.  If this is the priority that many local authorities assert it is, there are clear opportunities in the rural regeneration fund and the ample funds that are being made available for town centres for some of that money to be reprioritised or diverted local authority by local authority to deal with it.  For example, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, has made more money available to deliver hubs in various towns and villages across the country to take advantage of the roll-out of broadband.  Perhaps local government should accompany that by using a small amount of its money to assist in the rejuvenation of homes near those hubs in a way that is well designed for each local authority area.  That is how it should be done.  It would avoid any inflationary or price pressure risk that could come were we to change the help to buy scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#K00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#K00300","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I apologise, as I was at another committee and I hope that I do not revisit questions that have been asked.

Those changes are not only happening in Ireland, but in many other parts of Europe as well.  A number of the issues that the credit unions raise with the Deputy and me are the consequence of the regulations that the Central Bank has in place to keep those unions safe and protect them and their members.

First, the level of State involvement in our banking sector at the moment is already advanced.  We are a minority shareholder in one bank and the majority shareholder in two others.  Our starting position is a high level of State involvement from an ownership point of view.  Second, the Deputy touched on non-bank entities such as our credit unions - there is also An Post, which she did not mention but I am sure she would - that are capable of responding to consumer needs that they believe are not being met.  Third, we vowed a decade ago that we would never again build a direct link between the balance sheet of our country and our banking sector.  A public bank is a way of tightening that link and creating new kinds of risk for us in future.  I do not see the case for it.  It would take a long time to do.  Instead, we need to take stock of where our banking sector stands at the moment and determine what our more appropriate policy priorities are in the context of the exit of KBC and Ulster Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021042700002#K00900","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>The Minister held an interesting tax seminar last week.

They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by me to discontinue their remarks.

SOLAS has responsibility for funding, planning and co-ordinating further education and training in Ireland and is the statutory authority for apprenticeships.  This means we have statutory responsibility for approving new areas of industrial activity for apprenticeship, approving employers, maintaining a register of apprentices, and making statutory rules for the conduct of apprentices.<\/p> <p>  SOLAS also has a role as the co-ordinating provider for craft apprenticeships.<\/p><p>While training is provided by a network of education and training boards, ETBs, institutes of technology, ITs, and technological universities, TUs, SOLAS remains responsible for developing and setting curricula, scheduling off-the-job training across the provider network, setting assessments and overall quality assurance of provision.<\/p><p> The apprenticeship system is underpinned by a strong partnership approach, with SOLAS playing a central role in its development and management alongside the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, education and training providers, employers and social partners.  It is crucial in delivering the right and latest skills for employers and delivers a significant and positive impact on society and the economy.<\/p><p> At the start of this year, the apprenticeship population reached 20,000 for the first time.  The female apprentice population has also grown substantially in recent years and now stands at 1,100, building on major efforts to increase participation and offer more diverse opportunities to enter an apprenticeship, although much more needs to be done to address barriers to entry.  This was thanks to the opening up of apprenticeship following the publication of the most recent apprenticeship action plan.  There are now 60 apprenticeship programmes to choose from, ranging from level 5 to level 10 on the national framework, serving industries as diverse as biopharma, ICT, recruitment, financial services, retail, hospitality, engineering and construction.<\/p><p> We have seen apprenticeship develop significantly as a viable career option for a much wider base of people.  The Generation Apprenticeship campaign targets employers, parents, teachers, guidance counsellors and potential apprentices of all ages and backgrounds.  We are also exploring how further education and training and apprenticeship options could be set out alongside higher education choices as part of the CAO decision-making process, which could be a real game changer in raising awareness of these great pathways that are available to everyone.<\/p><p> Over the past three years, important steps have been taken to ensure that apprenticeship is promoting and supporting green skills, with content developed and integrated into a number of core apprenticeship programmes.  Centres of excellence in nearly-zero energy building, NZEB, are now established in the south east and midlands, with three further regional centres of excellence in development.  New apprenticeships in the areas of arboriculture, geo-drilling, scaffolding, roofing and cladding have green skills technology and knowledge as components of the curriculum and approach.  The Generation Apprenticeship schools competition has also had sustainability as its core theme over the last three years.<\/p><p> We believe the work of SOLAS and our partners has helped to support a world-class and rapidly expanding apprenticeship system, with the quality of our apprentices acknowledged on the global stage in Worldskills competitions.  It provides an excellent foundation from which to further grow and diversify that system.<\/p><p> The new apprenticeship action plan, published last week, sets out an exciting new agenda for the development of the system over the next five years.  It targets an increase in registrations to 10,000 per annum and aims to create a single integrated apprenticeship model.  This includes further development and enhancement of the consortium-led approach, increased support for employers, including SMEs, support for targeted recruitment of under-represented groups and targets for the public sector to take on apprentices.<\/p><p> The plan also includes a commitment to establish a national apprenticeship office, to be jointly managed by SOLAS and the HEA.  SOLAS will retain its statutory responsibilities with regard to apprenticeship but it is hoped that this joint office will provide apprenticeship with a distinct focus and identity, and reflect the fact that apprenticeships are now provided across both further and higher education.  SOLAS looks forward to playing a lead role in this office and in the continuing management, development and oversight of apprenticeship in Ireland.<\/p><p> SOLAS will retain responsibility as co-ordinating provider for craft apprenticeships, although there is a commitment to move this provision to a devolved model of delivery over the lifetime of the plan.  This will involve education and training providers taking on more of a lead role in this regard, building on their expertise in developing curricula, setting assessments and quality assuring provision.  A migration plan will be developed in close partnership with all our key stakeholders involved in this process including industry, unions and the providers themselves.<\/p><p> While there is an exciting future for apprenticeship, of course, we must acknowledge the significant damage that Covid-19 has caused to provision over the last year.  Our training centres and institutions, which provide off-the-job training, have been closed or operating at severely reduced capacity for nine of the past 12 months.  The practical focus of apprenticeship means that most of this training has to take place on site and the restrictions have caused significant waiting lists to develop.  The problems have also acted as a spur for innovation, however.  We have seen apprenticeship training move online for the first time ever with theory elements of programmes delivered remotely.  We have worked with providers and unions to phase back essential on-site provision via safe, socially distanced approaches.<\/p><p> Addressing the backlog will be a significant challenge but the recent announcements of &euro;20 million in capital funding to expand capacity, the use of online and competency assessments to speed up the apprentice journey through training and working with providers and unions to agree flexible and overtime arrangements to facilitate provision outside of traditional training periods will all help to start to make inroads in the next few months.<\/p><p> I hope this provides a brief overview of the reform of the apprenticeship model and the current and evolving role that SOLAS plays in managing and developing the system.  I thank the committee for its time and I look forward to further discussion on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Healy to give his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#B00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":503,"content":"<p>Chairman, committee members and colleagues, we are mindful that we speak to everyone today in the context of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, which, as we know, is having a profound global impact on societies, economies, workers and the ways in which businesses operate.  Certain sectors of our economy, particularly those providing customer-facing services, remain under immense strain and will not offer their pre-Covid-19 employment levels for some time to come, giving rise to job displacement, skills mismatches and exceptionally high unemployment levels, particularly among our younger people.<br\/><br\/>As members will be aware, significant challenges remain for businesses as they adapt their models to provide a safe environment for employees and customers.  Workers, too, are learning how to complete tasks remotely, enabled by digital communication tools, yet many activities and functions do not lend themselves to distance working.  In the context of the dramatic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our labour market, the work of agencies such as Skillnet Ireland and SOLAS in upskilling those in employment has never been more important and will be a driving force as we enter a period of significant disruption that will require all of us to adapt and learn new skills.<br\/><br\/>Skillnet Ireland was set up by Government in 1999 to help meet these challenges.  We were given a specific mandate to work directly with employers to develop the skills of those already in employment, and in doing so, contribute to the overall competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise sector.  I will note to the committee at this point that our mandate is distinct from that of apprenticeship and we do not have a formal role in the delivery of apprenticeship schemes. <br\/><br\/>Returning to in-employment upskilling, which is, yet again, the focus of our work, Skillnet Ireland uses a highly specialised approach, working directly alongside Ireland&rsquo;s main industry groups, sectoral associations, industry clusters and chambers of commerce.  Each of these groups operates and promotes its own distinctive Skillnet network.  There are 73 Skillnet networks it total, covering every sector and every region in Ireland.  Working with our partners, we identified the major trends shaping their sectors or region, for example, new digital skills, management skills, the impact of climate action, Brexit and Covid-19, but also how we can help jobseekers.  This approach gives us direct access to thousands of companies and workers every year.  In 2021, Skillnet Ireland will support 19,000 businesses nationwide, which I will stress are primarily small firms and microbusinesses, upskilling 70,000 workers and facilitating over 6,000 training programmes.<br\/><br\/>Our approach is very agile and responsive to the needs of employers.  We also contribute, however, to substantial actions in many of the labour market and enterprise priorities set out in Government in policies and strategies.  We played a key role in preparing Irish businesses for new realities posed by Brexit, for example, including rapidly upskilling more than 3,000 workers on new customs procedures through our clear customs<i><\/i>scheme.<br\/><br\/>We have also been highly proactive in helping the business sector operate safely during this pandemic through our rebound scheme, which has supported more than 3,500 SMEs to date, limiting the spread of infection in industries spanning childcare, healthcare, manufacturing, hair and beauty, the creative sector, retail and hospitality.<br\/><br\/>Central Statistics Office, CSO, data from March tells us that in excess of 440,000 people are currently in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  We must not allow a long-term unemployment legacy to arise from this pandemic.  With the support of our department, Skillnet Ireland has been on the ground since July of last year helping those who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic to find new employment opportunities.<br\/><br\/>Our Skills Connect scheme operates on the basis of cross-sector employability.  By that I mean we help people move from sectors worst affected by the crisis to new jobs in growth sectors such as technology, healthcare, food production and in the green economy.  Some 1,200 companies are supporting these Skills Connect schemes by hosting work placements for jobseekers, which we then combine with upskilling courses and other career supports.  We have seen very strong employment outcomes to date through Skills Connect, with some programmes achieving an 80% conversion rate to employment.<\/p><p>Demand is strong, and we expect to support more than 8,000 jobseekers through Skills Connect this year.<\/p><p> I will now turn to climate change, the most pressing issue of our time, and the implications for businesses and workers as Ireland transitions to a low carbon and environmentally sustainable economy.  This month, we launched our climate ready initiative, which will equip business with the skills to manage climate action but also to thrive in the green economy.  In 2021, the initiative will see us support more than 1,100 companies and 3,000 workers in areas including sustainable business practices, skills for the renewables sector, clean water and sustainable finance.  At a minimum, we will invest &euro;10 million in green skills through the climate ready initiative over the coming four years.<\/p><p> Skillnet Ireland is funded through the national training fund.  Our 2021 allocation is &euro;41 million, representing approximately 5% of the fund in a given year.  However, it is important to stress to the committee that Skillnet Ireland operates on a cost sharing basis with employers, where our grants are combined with investment from businesses.  In 2019, employers made a total additional contribution of &euro;22 million to Skillnet Ireland training programmes.  This represents a highly efficient use of public moneys and an effective vehicle for State investment in the skills of our workers.  To meet an ever-increasing demand for our services, with the assistance of our Department we are now pursuing a number of participation opportunities on EU programmes.<\/p><p> I would like to make a number of recommendations.  In light of the challenges outlined, the Government should maintain a rigorous focus on developing the skills of those already in employment.  It should implement in full the recommendations arising from the independent evaluation of the national training fund undertaken by Indecon, including greater priority being placed on supporting in employment training.  It should also continue to expand demonstrably effective government and enterprise upskilling mechanisms, such as Skillnet Ireland, allowing us meet the serious demand we have, particularly from small firms that employ between 60% to 70% of our workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Healy and I call Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.

My first series of questions will be those Deputy Conway-Walsh wanted to raise.  I thank the witnesses for their statements.  This is a crucial issue.  My first questions are for SOLAS and Mr. Brownlee.  As I understand it, in February 2021 almost 7,000 apprentices from five craft programmes were on waiting lists for off-the-job training.  At that stage, 1,800 of them had been waiting for more than a year.  This goes well above and beyond the Covid situation.  What is the situation at present, two months later?  Given that 1,800 people had been waiting for more than a year what are the non-Covid related causes of delay?  Why were there delays prior to Covid in the first place?  How will we clear the backlog and when can we expect it to be cleared?<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to the overall approach.  We welcome talk of a unified approach but there are some misgivings about the consortia-led model.  Some of the trade unions, including Connect, have been raising concerns that it is a move away from what has been a fairly successful model for craft apprenticeships under SOLAS.<\/p> <p>  The level of take-up under the consortia-led model has not been anything like what it was under the former model.  This led to some of the targets being missed.  Is it accurate to say that overall the approach is to move craft apprenticeships to this consortia-led model?  Will SOLAS no longer be the co-ordinating provider for craft apprenticeships once the migration is complete?  There are concerns.  We have a world-class apprenticeship model for training tradespeople and there are concerns that risks are being taken in this regard.<\/p> <p>  It has been said that the apprenticeship population is reaching 20,000.  My understanding of figures released by the Department is that there was an apprenticeship population of 28,500 in 2007 before many of these new apprenticeships were ever envisaged.  The 10,000 additional annual registrations would give us a population of 31,000 to 33,000 apprentices.  Proportionately, this leaves us a long way short of some of the more successful countries.  Given the importance and emphasis being placed on this and on expanding areas linked to the green economy and construction, is it ambitious enough?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#C00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will try to take the points in turn.  The Deputy is absolutely right that waiting lists are a significant worry and concern for SOLAS.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, training centres and institutions provide the off-the-job training and they have been effectively closed for nine of the past 12 months.  My understanding is that at the end of March we had more than 4,000 people waiting to get onto phase 2 training, which is the start of the pipeline.  They are waiting to go into training provided by education and training boards.  At the end of March, the number for phase 4 was just under 2,000 and for phase 6 it was 1,500.  It is a significant problem.  We know how urgent an issue it is.  We know how important it is for apprentices and employers.  We are absolutely committed to getting apprentices back into the training they need and deserve as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right that this was an emerging problem before Covid.  At that point, we had approximately 1,000 people waiting to get into phase 2 training, which is the first step in the pipeline.  The reason for this was pretty simple.  The number of craft apprentices had been expanding rapidly in recent years and there was a capacity issue regarding ability to keep up.  The issue now is that the waiting lists are four times that level.  It is very much a Covid-driven problem but I accept there was an emerging problem before Covid happened.  There is definitely a clear action plan in place to address it.  We are going to expand capacity with the help of the Department.  A capital investment of &euro;20 million will be made in further education and training and higher education.  This will target in particular the areas of greatest strain, which are plumbing and electrical.  The good news is that we have apprentices back on site thanks to great work with the TUI, SIPTU, education and training boards, institutes of technology and technological universities.  We have had to do this in a safe and socially distanced way so there are capacity constraints.  They are finally back on site and this will help us address the throughput.<\/p> <p>  We continue to deliver online the components that we can as part of the training package because this can speed up the apprenticeship journey.  We are also looking at using competency assessments to see whether we can progress the apprentices.  We are working with the unions to see what flexibility and overtime arrangements can be put in place to deliver apprenticeships outside of the traditional training periods because this will be essential to move things forward.  This is the position on waiting lists.<\/p> <p>  The unified model of craft apprenticeships is very much part of the new action plan.  The Deputy is right that a plan is set out whereby SOLAS would effectively migrate out of the co-ordinating provider role for craft apprenticeships over the five-year lifetime of the plan.  The thinking behind this plan is that there has always been a bit of uneasiness between the roles in terms of management and oversight of the system and being a provider of education and training within the system.  There is a bit of a conflict about which we have always been concerned.  Another issue we need to take account of is that we have education and training providers, including education and training boards, institutes of technology and technological universities, with their own very well established quality assurance arrangements.  In a way, they should be very well placed to help reform-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Brownlee to provide to the clerk any further information on Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#C00500","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":509,"content":"<p>My apologies to our witnesses, but I am on my phone.

This is a really exciting area on which the committee has the privilege of working with the organisations represented.  The area on which I would like to focus is twofold and has been touched upon by the witnesses in their opening statements.  The first relates to the opportunities in terms of climate action and reskilling and the second concerns one of the unfortunate consequences of Covid-19, namely, high unemployment in the younger age groups in particular, which has been mentioned by both witnesses.  My focus will be primarily on the potential both organisations will bring to leaving certificate reform and how rebranding apprenticeships and on-the-job training can become a pathway to career progression for those who might not ordinarily focus on academic performance or the CAO system.<\/p> <p>  There are some identifiable constraints within the existing arrangement.  What work have the organisations represented, particularly SOLAS, put into evaluating how the process could be streamlined to ensure the apprenticeship programme that is being rolled out by the Minister, Deputy Harris, is a success?<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns what I would regard as a relatively small programme.  The plan to increase numbers by 10,000 over four years is, of course, welcome, but is there a constraint to making it a much larger programme or is it simply demand that is responsible for this?  Please forgive my ignorance if that sounds like a simplistic question.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of on-the-job training, I am encouraged to hear some of the numbers provided by the witnesses.  It is unusual for a group to come before the committee and set out conclusions and recommendations.  It is most welcome and I thank the witnesses for that.  My question relates to the identification of areas where Skillnet Ireland can step in and provide support to companies that are looking to diversify and provide more sustainable work for their employees and what steps Skillnet Ireland can take in that regard.  Perhaps Mr. Brownlee can respond initially.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#D00100","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":510,"content":"<p>On those points around making apprenticeship a more viable career option and looking at the importance and the role of the leaving certificate in that regard, there are a few things to say.  First, we have been focusing a lot on the Generation Apprenticeship campaign to raise awareness in schools of potential apprenticeship pathways.  We have been working with guidance counsellors, the National Parents Council Post Primary and the TUI to get the information out there.  However, clearly that is only part of the issue.  We have a system here where the focus of all school leavers' decisions on where to go next is around the CAO.  That lends itself to a situation where two thirds of school leavers go directly into higher education.  Indeed, there are even schools where 100% of school leavers go directly into higher education.  I believe there must be people in that cohort who are better suited to an apprenticeship or to a further education and training, FET, course, even it is part of a pathway to then go into higher education.<\/p> <p>  We are doing a few things in this area.  We are working with the CAO, the education and training boards, ETBs, and Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, to look at how we can find a way to put FET and apprenticeship options on the table at the same time as the higher education choices at that decision point when young people are talking to their families, teachers and career guidance counsellors about what to do next.  That is one part of it.  The other part, to which the Deputy has alluded, is around the leaving certificate.  A review of the senior cycle is currently being undertaken.  It is most important that that review looks at how we can embed vocational options and pathways within the senior cycle so that people can get a taster for careers in engineering, STEM, nursing and a whole range of different vocations, and can be encouraged to move into further education and training and apprenticeship.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the constraints on the scale and ambition of the programme.  I do not think there are such constraints, but I think you need to take apprenticeship as being part of an overall system.  There is massive potential for much more of role for further education and training and for higher education to work alongside those two offerings to give us a fit-for-purpose system which can meet the needs of the future world of work and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":511,"content":"<p>In respect of the Deputy's question about helping business to diversify and become sustainable, it speaks to a broader question around our ability as a country to compete on the basis of talent, which is something we have been very successful at doing.  Having a high-skilled and agile workforce is a core part of our proposition in this country and how we win investment.  However, that is, of course, under immense strain all the time from factors such as technology in particular and how it is reshaping the workforce and skills.<\/p> <p>  In many ways, there is a twofold challenge that Skillnet Ireland is working on.  The first is how to maintain a highly skilled workforce in the context of the changes occurring with the introduction of new technologies and so on.  Our job really starts when people come out of the public education system, further and higher education and into work.  That is when they are in our hands.  We can boost their skills while they are in employment.<\/p> <p>  The second challenge that we are committed to is working with small firms, in particular.  We will support somewhere in the order of 16,000 to 17,000 SMEs this year.  It is important we help them because there are productivity challenges within our small firms of which the Deputy will be aware.  For workers within small firms, it is important their skills are not left behind due to productivity or innovation issues within the firm in which they are working.  It is a core part of the work we do in supporting hundreds of thousands of workers in small firms to remain competitive and have opportunities within their careers.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, the dual challenge we see is delivering a system that continues to produce high skills in respect of those in employment but which can also meet the skill challenges of those working in smaller firms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh &aacute;r n-a&iacute;onna.  I wish to spend the few minutes I have asking the witnesses about three issues, namely, the shortage of skills we have to deal and contend with, the question of how we build the prestige around apprenticeship, and the issue of gender.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the shortage of skills, I am getting a picture that it is about trying to get people who are preparing for working life to think in terms of apprenticeship but also the vital work of providing ongoing training to people within the workforce to allow them to move or develop, as the case may be.  Will the witnesses give us some numbers to demonstrate how acute the shortage of skills in our economy is and to give examples of areas?<\/p> <p>  The second issue is that it is clear that there is a need to build the prestige around the notion of apprenticeship and to get people thinking and to make it part of higher education so that people have pathways and so on.  I am always very struck by the tradition of the journeymen apprentices that you would come across in other countries.  At the start of their careers they have elaborate costumes and there is a great pride in their professions.  Is this something that could be part of the necessary building up of the identity around apprenticeship for particular trades?  Is it something from which we could learn?<\/p> <p>  The third question concerns gender.  One of the aims of the reform of the apprenticeship model is to encourage more female apprentices.  Certainly, there is a huge disparity in areas like construction.  I believe that, currently, 5% of our apprentice cohort are female.  Does that mean there are particular barriers that need to be addressed, or is the desire to encourage more females into apprenticeship in pursuit of something else?  Is there another reason?  Is it about filling gaps in the market, drawing people from one sector of the economy to work in the other, or is there another reason?  The \"why\" is as important as the \"what\" in all of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#D00500","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I will deal with the first of those points and then I will pass over to my colleague, Dr. Trant, who has been leading on a lot of work on how we build the prestige of apprenticeships and widen participation in them.<\/p><p> On the Senator's point regarding skills gaps and needs, we benefit from having the skills and labour market research unit based in SOLAS.  I am happy to send on more detailed statistics.  Principally, the highest level needs we are seeing at the moment are around tech and skills related to the construction sector.  The Senator hit on the fundamental point.  Our main concern with regard to skills is not the skills we need for today, but the skills we need for the future world of work.  It is fair to say that the days of doing a block of education and training between the ages of 17 and 21, and that serving people for the rest of their careers and their lives, are gone.  We need a system that allows people to upskill and reskill continually throughout their careers and their lifetimes.  We put a lot of focus into the workforce upskilling agenda through a programme called Skills to Advance.  The principal and initial target of that programme are the 900,000 people in the workforce, many of them older workers, who do not have the equivalent of junior or leaving certificate qualifications.  It is a really hard group to reach.  There is a role for further education and training, FET, at local level, working with employers to upskill these people so that their jobs remain sustainable and they can adapt to new technology.  <\/p><p> I am sure Mr. Healy will elaborate further on his role and workforce upskilling as well.  At this point, I will hand over to Dr. Trant to deal with the Senator's second and third points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the questions.  On building the prestige of apprenticeship, as mentioned by my colleague, Mr. Brownlee, there has been a lot of work going on over the last five years on the Generation Apprenticeship approach.  Thankfully, we have 60 programmes available now, up from 27 five years ago, which span all 21st century industries in Ireland.  The feedback is that employers have a huge role in promoting the benefits of apprenticeship as a pipeline in terms of what they offer people coming into their companies and the pathways they make available.  We have 25 ambassadors around the country who have been excellent in peer-to-peer engagement, but also in working with schools and engaging with teachers and students in schools about apprenticeship as a fantastic route to a career.<\/p> <p>  There are many countries in Europe where apprenticeship is well embedded and valued.  Obviously, our systems will never be the same.  We need a change in attitude to apprenticeship as a route of learning right up to PhD level.  Apprenticeships are really valuable and they have a huge amount to offer.  We need to get that on the table, and at the critical point when people are making decisions about what they want to do, how they propose to get started in their careers and how they propose to upskill.  The initiative, The Right Course, a website that presents everything together, introduced this year by the Minister, Deputy Harris, has been very helpful.  It presents, for the first time, all of the options to people and encourages conversations about what people want to do, be that an academic course or a course that is work based.  We have work to do.  The new action plan sets out a number of steps to be taken in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  On gender, the Senator is correct that there is a lot of work still to be done and also a need for a better understanding of the barriers, which vary.  The Senator mentioned construction.  The number of women in construction is relatively low.  There are employers who are doing a lot of really good work in this area and they have shown results.  Employers who have focused on this and encouraged women to come into their industry have that benefit and they are building on it.  There are many small companies that do not have the time and effort to do this.  This is where some of the supports nationally will come into play.  That will form part of the plan.<\/p> <p>  Approximately one year ago, Skillnet Ireland gave a talk to a girls school during which the question, \"Why can't we access apprenticeships?\", was asked.  That group of girls thought that apprenticeship was not for them.  This shows there is still a level of understanding needed in the system about apprenticeships and who can avail of them, including that they are open to people of all ages and backgrounds.  The next five years will be really important in building on the work that has happened.

I thank the witnesses for coming to meet us again to discuss this important issue that has been forgotten for a long time, although I know significant work has been done in the area over the last few years.<\/p> <p>  A couple of issues come to mind.  I know that a lot of engagement is happening in secondary schools, but to what extent is our secondary school system designed in such a way that the natural route is to go into an academic third level course?  In terms of the subjects taught in secondary school in respect of the leaving certificate, our vision of what education means needs to change for us to see apprenticeships as the natural progression rather than pointing to them as another little thing that students can do, which is, perhaps, what it sounds like to young people.  They do not have the confidence in the practical experience that is required in an apprenticeship.  I believe apprenticeships and other routes need to be wrapped together.  We need a reform of second and third level so that further and higher education can come together, rather than us trying to advertise something that is not easily understood.  I would welcome the witnesses' thoughts on that.<\/p> <p>  On gender, which was raised by Senator Mullen as well, it is fantastic to see that real increase, but it is coming from a really low base.  As I understand it from the figures provided, it is 1,000 women out of a population of 20,000.  Females in politics know it is very difficult to put themselves into an area where everyone already in it is male.  Not everyone, but almost everyone, does not see themselves doing that.  Are there female mentors available who could be encouraged to take that lead and do something similar to Women for Election?  In regard to politics, it is often said that women have to be asked four times to go into politics whereas men put themselves forward.  This is because women do not see themselves in that area.  A lot more work is probably needed by all of us in that regard.  The witnesses might also offer their thoughts on that issue.<\/p> <p>  I would like to raise one final issue.  This is about what employers need as well as what people need to feel fulfilled.  That requires a response from Government, including in terms of the programme for Government.  I have a particular concern in regard to the 500,000 target provided for in the programme for Government in terms of retrofitting.  This is but one example of commitments in regard to the green economy.  Do the witnesses believe they are well placed to be able to respond to that need in terms of the apprenticeships currently in place and the people taking them up?  What more needs to be done to ensure that we hit our targets of 51% reduction in emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050?  The work done by Skillnet Ireland and SOLAS is critical to us hitting those targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#E00400","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  The first two points in regard to the school system and how to develop female ambassadors and mentors can be separated.  We can be the agents for change in this area.  My first point is that we have an excellent education system, one that is respected worldwide.  Whatever we do, it is about building on that system.  It is not about ripping it up and starting again.<\/p><p>I totally agree with the Senator.  I remember a meeting of a previous incarnation of this committee at which a brilliant young female apprentice said that she was interested in vocational and technical subjects subject at age 12 or 13 when she went to secondary school.  However, she went to an all-girl school and because there was no one there to teach those subjects, they were not available as options.  There is a legacy problem in that many schools are designed to generate the academic CAO pipeline.  One aspect of our strategy, which we are exploring with the NCCA, is whether we can use further education colleges to offer taster modules for programmes as part of senior cycle or transition year so that we can bring the capability into schools.  A lot more people, particularly women, could be advised as to what options are available.  That is important.<\/p><p> In terms of green skills, there is a great deal to do and there is much that we are already focusing on.  We are developing and expanding a network of retrofitting and upskilling centres.  There are two NZEB centres in place and three more are planned.  We are updating apprenticeship curricula.  Perhaps Dr. Trant can talk about that in more detail.  We can provide more information after the meeting if the committee requires it.<\/p><p> The new FET strategy is trying to create a sense of a college of the future which deals with all of the points we have talked about, including a larger scale, a bigger identity within the community and region and bringing together what was traditionally further education and training activity.  Being a green campus is a prerequisite for all of that development.  Within the strategy, we have made a commitment that all FET provision will be used to develop knowledge of climate change and environmental issues.  There was a follow up in the programme for Government we talked about, a green further education and skills development plan.  There is real opportunity to embed that learning in every FET course so that we are effectively creating the agents of change and the new generation that will understand what needs to be done and help to drive us towards those targets.  We are working with the ETBs on that at the moment.  It is an exciting opportunity where no matter what further education course one does, there will be a sustainability component within it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brownlee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#F00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I welcome everybody.

In many ways, there is an opportunity in this crisis to help to tackle a problem that was a legacy issue before Covid ever arose.<\/p> <p>  I invite my colleague, Ms Donnery, to comment on some of the work we are doing to support jobseekers in particular, with a focus on moving people from the sectors most affected by the crisis, such as the services sector and so on, to growth sectors like technology, the green economy, private healthcare and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":523,"content":"<p>We launched a new programme, Skills Connect, last year.  We are developing programmes with businesses whereby they identify areas of job growth, especially in the technology sector, the green economy, food and agriculture.  Thirty four of our Skillnet networks are running programmes that provide people with job placements and career development in order that they can develop the confidence to return to employment or change career.  The programmes also provide technical skills and qualifications.<\/p> <p>  A new programme, Future in Tech, comprising eight different pathways, including cybersecurity and many other areas in the technology space, enables people to develop pathways.  They do not need to have prior experience in technology.  People can develop their skills at entry level and then reach a point at which they can choose one of eight different pathways.  We have found, for example, that people are moving from logistics and have an interest in technology.  There is a lot of support and mentoring from businesses.  We have 1,200 companies providing supports for individuals.<\/p> <p>  In the green space, the NZEB programme has been successful.  Young people in particular have become involved.  We have found that, like our main programme, Skillnet, the gender balance is 50-50.  One of the reasons for this is because we showcase best practice and examples.  It shows participants people who are like them doing the work.  It is one way in which we try to support and attract as many women as men to these programmes.<\/p> <p>  We have found that the gender balance of 50-50 has followed through across the different programmes.  A lot of that is down to showing people best practice examples, including videos and other things that will appeal to individuals so that they can see themselves in particular roles.  As part of this, we have a great programme, Women ReBOOT.  It supports women who are returning to the technology sector.  For years it has had a skills gap, which continues to be a problem.  It also has difficulty in retaining women and supporting and developing them further.  The programme supports women who may have worked in the technology sector and left it for a number of years, often due to caring responsibilities.  It aims to bring them back and support them in the sector.  Critical to this is the support provided to help the person to have the confidence to return to work, as well as specialist training and qualifications in the latest technology and the support of other peers.  I have spoken to a number of women involved who have told me that what attracted them the most was hearing from someone who has done it because they did not believe it was possible.<\/p> <p>  This involves the support of companies, from multinationals right down to small businesses, that are willing to mentor trainees, provide them with training placements and, ultimately, employ them.  Over 80% of those in the Women ReBOOT or TechSTART programmes have been employed.  The medtech sector is also engaging with women returners.  One of the supports we provide is helping people to return to these sectors.<\/p> <p>  There is a wide range of different programmes.  I have outlined a taste of some of them.  The key issue is how we promote this system, make it appeal to people and provide a mix of peer support and technical skills.  Often these programmes are between four and six months in length, with qualifications being recognised by the national framework of qualifications, as well as industry accreditation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Tracey Donnery"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Donnery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#F00600","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":525,"content":"<p>That is absolutely fantastic.

The Minister, Deputy Harris, launched this morning the regional workshops that will be targeting companies and telling them about additional incentives to take on apprentices.  It is so hard for SMEs and micro-enterprises.  How are they going to proceed?  Where are they going to have the bandwidth?  How can the apprenticeship office help them?<\/p><p> How is Dr. Trant engaging with career guidance teachers?  How will they support parents?<\/p><p> I have a question for Ms Donnery on Skillnet.  I thank her.  It is great to hear about the supports she has in place for women, including through having ambassadors and role models.  These are crucial, particularly when trying to get people involved in STEM.  Reports were produced by Science Foundation Ireland several years ago and it was discovered that the most important aspect is to have a female role model, be it someone you know, such as a family member, or a friend of your parents, so you can see your path is feasible.<\/p><p> Could Ms Donnery state three things Skillnet Ireland will be doing to support different types of enterprises, listing one each for micro-enterprises, retail and hospitality?

For employers interested in getting registered, there is an online process.  They can submit an expression of interest on <i>www.apprenticeship.ie<\/i>and this gets passed on.  Contact is made with the relevant ETB in the region and there is follow-up and a visit.  There is a bit of support regarding what the apprenticeship is and making sure the employer is prepared.  The employer becomes registered in that way and approved to employ apprentices.  It can be a quite quick process, especially if an employer is already familiar with the apprenticeship system.  Generally, it just takes a short number of weeks.  We now have over 7,000 employers using apprenticeship.

We ensure that the best practice of the larger companies, which can sometimes be more advanced, can be shared with the smaller companies.<\/p> <p>  The three things we will be doing with businesses include broadening the base of businesses we support.  We already support all the larger companies and most mid-size companies but there are still plenty of smaller companies that we could support.  We would be giving them opportunities to determine, using their own voice, what skills they need, particularly in the focus area of SME productivity.  In this regard, there can be a very wide range of programmes, depending on the sector, be it aviation, nursing homes or manufacturing.

Last year, there were difficulties certifying those who were leaving school after their junior certificate to ensure they could enter an apprenticeship.  Ultimately, the Minister provided an interim letter of confirmation after some pressure from ourselves and others.  I want to know whether this is being boxed off for this year.  Can we ensure that there will be no repeat of the delays faced by those leaving school after the junior certificate and that they will be able to access apprenticeships swiftly and without any complications?<\/p><p>On the future of apprenticeships, a lot of work has gone into <i>www.apprenticeship.ie<\/i>but I hear complaints about it not being user-friendly.<\/p><p>The feedback is that <i>apprenticeship.ie <\/i>is not user-friendly and that there are some difficulties with it.

I can think of instances where people I have known with smaller businesses would have provided an apprentice to somebody they knew who may have been struggling and not had a job for while and who probably might not have otherwise provided an apprenticeship to this person.  This would have allowed that person to serve their time with them but they allowed that because of the circumstances that young person was in.  There is obviously a logic to a unified approach and everyone having a fair crack of the whip but will there be a flexibility on the ground for circumstances such as that?<br\/><br\/>Similarly, are we taking enough cognisance of the fact that many people who would offer apprenticeships would run businesses that are quite small?  Are we taking cognisance also of their ability to negotiate this new consortia-led model?<br\/><br\/>Finally, I raise the lack of painting apprenticeships in Cork, which Mr. Brownlee would be familiar with.

As the Deputy said, in 2020 there was an agreement that a State certificate or letter would be supplied along with a skill report which would get a person over the previous criteria of having to have 5 Ds in one&rsquo;s junior certificate to access an apprenticeship.  It worked.  I got statistics from the apprenticeship team this morning that 25% of our apprentices in 2020 came through that junior certificate route.  It worked even if it took longer than we would have wanted to get the system in place.  The same conditions apply this year, so I hope the Deputy will not see any of those same issues this year because there will be clarity that that is the approach from the start.<br\/><br\/>I will ask Dr. Trant speak to the Deputy about the <i>apprenticeship.ie<\/i>website because we launched that in the last few weeks.

The action plan identified the need for additional SME supports to be provided to try to persuade those businesses about which the Deputy talked to take a chance without too much of a financial hit and to take on that local person they may feel deserves a chance.  That is definitely something that we need to focus on.  It is a focus in the action plan.<br\/><br\/>On the question regarding painting and decorating, we  followed up with Cork Education and Training Board which I believe was in contact with the Deputy.  There is a workshop available and it is just a question of demand at present.  The Deputy referred to some evidence of there being demand and of taking people from the UK at a system level but we do not see that demand.  My understanding is that there is only one workshop offering a painting and decorating apprenticeship at the moment and that is in Ballyfermot.

Obviously, dealing with youth unemployment and providing young people with opportunities at top skills has been part of the DNA of further education and training for a long time.  As we mentioned, we have the apprenticeship incentivisation scheme for employers, which is trying to persuade employers to take that chance and take on young people.  There is also a whole range of programmes in further education and training, FET, that are specifically designed to help young people to upskill and to take them directly into jobs and employment.  In Youthreach, we have specific skills training and a significant amount of post-leaving certificate, PLC, provision which has incredible success at taking people into really interesting jobs and careers, together with community training centre provision.  The key for us is to mobilise that provision and ensure the capacity is there to deal with this immense demand that we have at present, which both Deputies have identified as being a real issue and concern.  We are trying to ensure that the places are available.<\/p> <p>  There is also a cultural issue where there is a large number of young people who cannot walk into jobs, no matter how insecure they previously would have been, and have no access to any income-earning potential.  They probably do not think of further education and training or even an apprenticeship as a viable option because there has been that predominance of higher education choices almost as part of the psyche.  We need to focus on trying to persuade them that there are opportunities out there, even online opportunities through e-college.  We could perhaps also look at the system of support that we give them.  For example, SUSI support is available for all higher education and PLC provision but if one wants to do a traineeship at the same level, level 5 or level 6 as PLC, one does not have access to SUSI, instead one is asked to sign on for welfare support to take one through the course.  That type of system creates a kind of divide and a perception that that type of upskilling and help is not for certain people but this is a key focus and an issue.  We have put in place an initiative called Skills to Compete which is all about addressing those structural issues in the labour market as a result of Covid-19.  This is a three-pronged initiative.  One is about giving the person the employability skills that will help him or her to get a job.<\/p><p>Second, it is about giving people access to the digital skills they will need for any job in the future world of work.  Third, it is about targeting skills in specific occupations.  That might be technology, green skills, energy and opportunities like those.

The second heading relates to how the work we do is very close to employment.  We are working hand-in-hand with employers so we are seeing, almost in real time, the skills gaps, the jobs they are trying to fill and so on.  We are helping to match those with suitable jobseekers we are upskilling.  The last heading relates to work placement.  It is not just an isolated training programme which might be taken online, this is fully integrated with work.  The places we offer to jobseekers and to the very concerning numbers of youth unemployed come with a mandatory work placement, where they are being hosted among 1,200 businesses which are voluntarily supporting us.  In respect of many of these schemes, particularly in technology, we are seeing a conversion rate to employment of 80% or more.

Of course there is also investment in capacity and in capital infrastructure and in the staffing and resources that will allow us to expand capacity to the extent we need to in order to deal with the waiting list problem, but also to the extent that we need to meet our ambition in the national apprenticeship plan and our own FET strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brownlee and Mr. O'Callaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#J00700","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":553,"content":"<p>We will hear from Senator Flynn and then I will take a couple of additional people at the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#J00800","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I am not in Leinster House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#J00900","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator, I will take the slot myself.

I wish to concentrate on the hospitality sector, with which I have had a lot of meetings and interactions over the last while.  Representatives have spoken about how a lot of their own staff will not be coming back and reskilling and retraining and everything like that and I am aware that both the Minister and Minister of State have mentioned this.

The hospitality sector is of concern in a number of ways.  There are a couple of really good apprenticeship programmes up and running for that sector.  I might ask Dr. Trant to come in on those in a minute.  We are doing a lot.  We launched a workforce upskilling initiative for the hospitality sector, so while it is in this period of inactivity in which its businesses are constrained, we are rolling out, through Skills to Advance, a range of upskilling initiatives to develop its leadership and management capability.  A major initiative to develop the sector's understanding of green skills and sustainability was launched in the last few weeks.<\/p> <p>  We are obviously providing them with access to e-college and a whole range of upskilling and reskilling opportunities.  One of the sector's real concerns was on the affordability of having to subsidise the off-the-job training of its apprentices.  That is something the new apprenticeship action plan is trying to address.  It is saying it is going to address the lack of parity between employers who take on craft apprentices and those who take on apprentices under the newer programmes and give a grant in order that there is more support for employers and they are not taking as much of a financial hit.  That could have a big impact on the hospitality sector.  Dr. Trant may wish to come in on the apprenticeships in that space at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#J01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":558,"content":"<p>As Mr. Brownlee mentioned, there are three apprenticeships in the area, namely, commis chef, chef de partie and sous chef.  There were over 203 apprentices in training when the pandemic hit last year.  Due to the fact that a lot of the employer's premises were not able to remain open and training centres and institutes of technology were shutting down as well, it was really challenging.  The training providers have done a lot of work to move online and to keep the apprentices on board.  By and large that has worked and helped.  The real focus is to help those apprentices to complete and then, hopefully once the vaccine gets rolled out and the country opens back up again, there is going to be a huge amount of demand and new opportunities in the industry for those apprentices once again.  There is no doubt it has been an industry really badly hit.  There is an awareness in the industry of the long-term need for a pipeline, through apprenticeship, for example, and the importance of sticking with it.  Recruitment is on hold for the moment in 2021 but that is unsurprising.  However, we are hopeful that, in supporting the current crop of apprentices to get through, there will be new opportunities as things start to open up and the pipeline will get going again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary-Liz Trant"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":559,"content":"<p>At Skillnet Ireland we have a lot of networks already operating in this space.  For example we have a restaurant skillnet and this year we have launched a new hospitality skillnet with the Irish Hotels Federation because despite there being issues, a lot of companies are using this time to upskill their employees.  As Dr. Trant said there, this relates both to developing the management skills but also to the skills of the staff.  We also have a skillnet in the fitness and leisure sector, which is part of this wider sector.  The key supports which we have found to be very beneficial to the sector this year include our mentors work programme.  It is dedicated to supporting leaders, owners and SMEs in re-examining their business models, looking to shift business online, looking at either of the pillars of financing their business, their people, operational efficiencies or digitalisation.  There has been a high take-up among businesses within that sector.  We have also seen great collaboration from some in the sector, such as the Restaurant Association of Ireland and others, which are working together to develop programmes which will help the businesses be ready for reopening.  Our ReBound programme was also very valuable and had great take-up, particularly with helping businesses be ready to ensure their staff would be safe when they had an opportunity to reopen last year.<\/p><p> We have a lot going on in that regard.<\/p><p> We also find that across all our regional networks, which are mixed sectoral networks, they are putting in place many supports to help the staff from the hospitality sector to develop their skills to allow them move to another sector while there are opportunities.  Also, there are many women in this area, some of whom are part-time workers.  They have been able to upskill and equip themselves to be ready to take on a job in a new area, for example, medical technology or technology.  Luckily, all of those networks are still going strong and still finding great demand from the businesses to upskill their staff.

Later this year the committee will examine the issue of reform of the leaving certificate.  Do Mr. Healy and Mr. Brownlee have any thoughts on how more vocational options, including apprenticeships, for school leavers could be promoted and encouraged?  It is an opportune time to examine reform of the leaving certificate because of Covid-19.  The current leaving certificate system is outdated; I have been saying that on the public record in recent years.  Whether we introduce continuous assessment or whatever we have to give every student every opportunity.  Some people want to go to third level to do different courses but we have to look at the apprenticeships also, what those skills have to offer and how we could incorporate the leaving certificate into that.  Mr. Healy might begin by making a brief comment followed by Mr. Brownlee because I do not want to be taking time from everybody else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#K00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I will comment briefly but it is probably largely in Mr. Brownlee's domain.  In the reform of the leaving certificate there may be an opportunity to integrate more subjects with the reality of work, for example, to help people in that transition into employment directly after their leaving certificate.  What aspects of the leaving certificate could be moved from rote learning and expressing one's memory onto a page?  What can be done within the curriculum?  How can the curriculum be modified to make it a more pragmatic intervention in the life of a student, not just in terms of the academic process but in preparing them for a long life of work and moving into employment either directly after the leaving certificate or directly after further or higher education?  I will hand over to Mr. Brownlee for the broader answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Healy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Healy.  I touched on some of this earlier but there are probably three fundamental aspects that I would like the committee to examine.  The first is the embedding of vocational options as part of the senior cycle.  As Mr. Healy mentioned, there is an opportunity now to do that.  There is a system in Scotland where further education colleges deliver modules effectively as part of the leaving certificate or highers, as they are called in Scotland.  There is real potential to look at a similar system to get those kind of vocational options and experiences on the table, particularly in schools that do not have the technical teaching capability to look at delivering them.<\/p> <p>  The second is around CAO reform.  We need to find a way to put further education and apprenticeship options on the table at exactly the same time as higher education choices for our school leavers.  That needs to be done either via the CAO system directly or a parallel system that sits alongside that.  It is very important that we can reinforce that aim.<\/p> <p>  The third aspect is around the role of the transition year, TY.  If we can embed taster modules and experiences as part of TY that give students a flavour for the many great apprenticeship and further education opportunities we will sow the seeds and then build on that through the other two interventions after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042700002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Brownlee"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brownlee for that and Mr. Healy.

It might have been a turn of phrase.  I would have thought that bringing it in before that would have been appropriate on entry into the senior cycle.  Does Mr. Brownlee have a comment to make on that?<\/p> <p>  Other witnesses might wish to contribute on the point that the future of the leaving certificate, as raised by the Chairman, which is a matter for discussion at this committee, will involve new pathways to careers, as we mentioned earlier.

As part of those conversations we should be telling students that there are many apprenticeships and FETAC courses they can pursue as part of that to that.  It is to get people to start thinking at a much earlier stage that that might be for them.  I totally agree with the Deputy.  I was talking about the fact that when young people make their actual choice about what is next they do not even see those apprenticeship or further education opportunities when they are talking to their teachers, parents or guidance counsellors.  If they do not have the options on the table, how can they persuade a bigger proportion to go for it?  The Deputy is right.

As part of her work, she visited the parliament in Myanmar on a number of different occasions.  I am very pleased that she has shared the research she had led on the parliamentary system and survey of the members of the members of parliament in Myanmar.  She is now going to share her experience and expertise with us, and to inform us of matters.  Indeed, we are all shocked to see on a daily basis the images of the sanctions, cruelty and suffering inflicted on civil society in Myanmar by a military regime, in a country that has succeeded in establishing, through difficult challenges, a parliamentary democracy, albeit a fragile democracy but one that has been progressing in a strict way over recent years.  We look forward to hearing from Dr. Murphy.  We also look forward to discussing the options for our committee to assist in highlighting the issues and exhorting the international community to respond to the instability in Myanmar.<\/p> <p>  The committee is being broadcast from the D&aacute;il Chamber.

I am very pleased to engage with the committee.  I welcome its interest in learning more about the situation and considering what role Ireland might play in responding to the crisis.<\/p> <p>  Before I begin, I apologise for the earlier technical issue and the fault was on my end.  I also apologise that members cannot see me as I have had to enter the meeting using a web browser as opposed to the Teams App.<\/p> <p>  As the members will be aware, the military coup in Myanmar has been ongoing since 1 February 2021.  There are few signs of a peaceful return to civilian rule in the short term.  The seriousness of the crisis should not be underestimated.  Further violence is almost assured.  It will likely be accompanied by economic collapse and a serious humanitarian crisis.  The repercussions of such developments are grave and include geopolitical instability in the region.  The tragedy of the situation is all the more poignant given that Myanmar and its people had experienced newfound freedoms as the democratisation process proceeded since about 2011.<\/p> <p>  Myanmar, as members will be aware, is a diverse and complex country.  Myanmar gained independence in 1948 but it was subject to an oppressive military junta from 1962 until 2011 when a gradual return to civilian rule began to proceed.  Throughout that period, Myanmar had to deal with the longest running civil war in the world.  Ongoing since 1948 and based on a very complex mix of conflicts between the State and ethnic groups, including non-State actors and a military that has, over decades, infiltrated both the State and the economy in very deep ways.<\/p><p>The 2008 constitution and free elections in 2015 signalled the beginnings of a democratisation process.  However, on 1 February this year, the day the newly elected Myanmar parliament was scheduled to meet for the first time following the November 2020 election, the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, seized control and declared a year-long state of emergency with a stated intention to hold new elections at the end of that period.<\/p><p> The coup followed the intensification of tensions between the military and the civilian government which crystallised further after the November elections.  The National League for Democracy, NLD, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won by a landslide.  The military and the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, USDP, disputed the election result, claiming widespread fraud and calling for a rerun of the election.  In the aftermath of that coup, leaders of the NLD, including Aung San Suu Kyi, have been detained and imprisoned and are facing various charges.<\/p><p> I highlight in particular that there has been widespread public opposition to the coup which catalysed into an extraordinary civil disobedience movement spearheaded by Myanmar professionals, including doctors, bankers, teachers, factory workers, civil servants, transport staff, and many other workers across the country.  Hundreds of thousands of workers from these sectors are striking and have been doing so for months.  They aim to stifle the economy, thereby cutting off the military&rsquo;s sources of revenue and forcing an end to the coup.<\/p><p> We have seen the mass mobilisation of young people in Myanmar.  This cohort is playing a critical role in opposing the coup.  I emphasise the extent to which young people, in particular, are resolute in their resistance to military rule in Myanmar and have shown themselves willing to make extraordinary sacrifices to ensure the return of freedom and democracy.<\/p><p> The political response has included the formation of the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, CRPH, by a number of elected NLD MPs in exile.  The committee comprises 17 members.  Importantly, it includes two elected MPs from ethnic parties.  It seeks to conduct parliamentary affairs as per its electoral mandate in November.  The junta has charged 17 members of the CRPH with incitement and has threatened anyone who contacts them with seven years' imprisonment.<\/p><p> On 31 March this year, the CRPH declared the abolishment of the 2008 constitution and announced a new interim constitution, the Federal Democracy Charter.  Two weeks later, the CRPH formed a national unity government that brought Aung San Suu Kyi back into her previous role as State Counsellor.  The national unity government includes cabinet members drawn from both the NLD and, critically, the ethnic parties, all of whom are currently in hiding or outside the country.  They are seeking international recognition as the legitimate government of Myanmar.  The junta has declared the national unity government unlawful.<\/p><p> The military has responded forcefully to repress all political and civil opposition in Myanmar.  It has imposed martial law in parts of the country, introduced curfews and altered laws to prevent mass mobilisation and undermine the civil disobedience movement.  According to UN sources, more than 700 civilians, including children, have been killed by the military since the coup began.  Many more have been seriously injured.  There are more than 3,000 in detention, and tens of thousands in the ethnic states, in particular, have been displaced as villages have been targeted and bombed by the military.  In the larger cities, we have seen increased movement out to rural areas to escape the crackdowns.<\/p><p> I must stress the military&rsquo;s tactics in this regard are increasingly indiscriminate, systematically attacking neighbourhoods, randomly discharging weapons into homes, and bombing and shelling villages in ethnic areas.  The UN has reported the use of heavy artillery against civilians.  There are also reports of the military targeting medical professionals with arrest and preventing those who need medical treatment from receiving it.<\/p><p> In addition to this deteriorating human rights crisis, a humanitarian crisis is looming in Myanmar.  Many citizens have lost their jobs amid the turmoil and can no longer afford to support basic needs.  The World Food Programme has warned of food insecurity in the short term.  Communication systems have been severely disrupted.  Myanmar&rsquo;s economic situation is also deteriorating.  There will be an expected 10% contraction, at least, in 2021.  A serious refugee crisis cannot be discounted.<\/p><p> The EU and the US have imposed some sanctions on Myanmar, including financial sanctions and travel bans on key military personnel.  The US has also applied a series of sanctions, including financial sanctions, in respect of the military&rsquo;s two major conglomerates.<\/p><p> At an Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, summit meeting on 24 April 2021, a five-point consensus on the situation in Myanmar was agreed, calling for the immediate cessation of violence, constructive dialogue among parties, a mediation role for the special ASEAN envoy to be appointed, provision of humanitarian assistance and access to Myanmar for the ASEAN envoy.  Although this five-point consensus is welcome, there are issues which remain unaddressed.  ASEAN did not call for the release of political prisoners.  There are no explicit plans for dialogue with the national unity government and no clear timeframe for actions.<\/p><p> The seriousness of the crisis in Myanmar should not be underestimated.  If the situation continues to escalate, and the signs are that it is escalating, the country risks becoming a failed state in the heart of Asia.  The consequences of this are severe and include unconscionable human suffering, economic and social devastation, a likely refugee and humanitarian crisis, and geopolitical instability in the region.<\/p><p> In terms of how the Oireachtas and the Irish Government can play a role in opposing the military coup and supporting democratic forces in Myanmar, there are a series of actions that might be considered.  First is encouraging and supporting a robust leadership role for ASEAN, which has a critically important role to play in addressing the crisis in Myanmar.  There is also capacity for Ireland to use its position on the UN Security Council and in the General Assembly and its network of embassies across Asia to encourage ASEAN and individual countries in the region to leverage their efforts and influence to prevent the situation from deteriorating.  It would be important for countries to support and endorse the work of both the UN special envoy to Myanmar and the ASEAN special envoy to Myanmar.  Sanctions must be maintained and there should be a push for additional targeted sanctions against military-run businesses and industries.<\/p><p> There is a role for the Oireachtas to play in publicly acknowledging the CRPH and the national unity government.  There is capacity to push for the European Union to strengthen its response to the situation in Myanmar.  Ongoing support for an international arms embargo is similarly important.  The Oireachtas may consider applying pressure to leading gas and oil companies operating in Myanmar to temporarily stop giving taxes and other pipeline-related payments to the military regime and the conglomerates it dominates.  There is capacity to engage with tech companies to protect, improve and facilitate ongoing access to communication facilities in Myanmar and to encourage the fashion industry, which supports a large garment industry in Myanmar, to speak out much more forcefully against the military coup.<\/p><p> The Oireachtas and the committee may wish to consider calling additional witnesses to share evidence, including, for example, members of the CRPH in Myanmar, former ambassadors, business interests in Myanmar, and UN personnel.  The Oireachtas can play a role in defending the human rights of elected MPs in Myanmar by raising the crisis there with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, IPU, which has its 142nd assembly upcoming in May this year.  Finally, the fact of this session sends a signal to Myanmar and helps support public morale among Myanmar protestors and citizens by helping to maintain an international focus on what is happening in Myanmar and by maintaining sustained, strong and vocal opposition to the military coup.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042700002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary C.

I have been following the situation in Myanmar closely over the last few months.  Indeed, over the last few years any time that Myanmar has been in the news it has been, unfortunately, in connection with matters related to genocide and acts against citizens by the military junta.  I am really concerned about the situation there.  Dr. Murphy has spoken quite graphically to all of our concerns and I thank her for opening statement.  Recently I have been speaking to a number of people who worked previously with NGOs on the ground in Myanmar.  They are very concerned about the situation there and about some of their colleagues who are still on the ground in Myanmar and who are afraid to speak out because of the potential repercussions.  Unfortunately, what we are seeing and hearing on the television news is probably only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what is actually happening on the ground.  I thank Dr. Murphy for highlighting the situation there.<\/p><p>Myanmar has been in difficulty since it gained independence from the British in 1948 and what we are seeing now is part of the legacy of the colonisation of south east Asia and other parts of the world by various countries.  I have referred to acts of genocide that have happened in Myanmar, the most recent being those perpetrated against the Rohingya Muslim population in 2017.  This led the councillors of Dublin City Council to withdraw the Freedom of the City which was conferred on Aung San Suu Kyi.  Concerns have existed for some time about the actions of the Myanmar Government in dealing with some ethnic minorities and what is being done now by the military junta must be condemned. <\/p><p>Dr. Murphy mentioned the ASEAN talks and the agreement that has been reached but yesterday the Karen National Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Karen National Union, KNU, launched an attack in the southern part of Myanmar.  Concern has been expressed that this attack will give the junta an excuse to back out of the tentative agreement that is in place at present.  The junta has said that it will focus on quelling any military revolt.  The KNU has a long history of fighting for self-determination.  The make-up of Myanmar is complex, with so many different ethnic groups within the country.  Does Dr. Murphy share the concern of others about the implications of the actions of the Karen National Liberation Army?  <\/p><p>My brother lives in Thailand and has told me that huge numbers of refugees have fled Myanmar and crossed into Thailand.  This is creating real difficulties in the context of Covid and the mass movement of people.  There have been significant spikes in case numbers.  Does Dr. Murphy have any information regarding Covid in Myanmar?  We have all seen what is happening in India but I am interested to learn about the situation in Myanmar <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>Covid-19.  As I said, there has been a spike in the number of cases as a result of people fleeing persecution and crossing the Thai border.  This has obviously created a humanitarian crisis and a crisis in terms of the spread of Covid.  <\/p><p>Again I thank Dr. Murphy and hope she will be able to answer some of my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042700002#D00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":583,"content":"<p>We will take two more contributions before going back to Dr. Murphy.

I glanced through her research project on the parliament, which is so sad.  At the time of her research, it looked as if things would be so different.  She met what seemed to be a very enthusiastic set of parliamentarians who wanted to do their job better.  As has been said by the Chairman and Deputy Brady, the images on television of the unfolding humanitarian crisis are so distressing.  We know that at least 720 people have been killed and more than 3,000 imprisoned.  We also know a little of the barbarity that exists in the prisons and the overall picture is very distressing.  It is good that we are addressing these issues here today.<\/p> <p>  Am I correct in assuming, in terms of geopolitics, that the military junta is being supported by China and to a lesser degree by Russia?  Is that why the ASEAN response did not include releasing prisoners and was somewhat muted?  Is there a connection there?  Would it be fair to say that we in the West, including the USA, are supporting the return of the National Unity Government, NUG, and that China is supporting the military junta?  Is that a valid assessment and if so, what are the implications of that?  If it is not valid, I would be interested in hearing more from Dr. Murphy.  It is very interesting to see that the ASEAN agreement fell short of a full settlement or was that done on a tactical basis to try to achieve some moderate solution initially?  I presume Dr. Murphy is happy with what we are doing within the UN Security Council.  The briefing documentation would suggest that we are very active at the Security Council on this question, as we should be.  I presume Dr. Murphy is happy in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  I understand from the briefing material that in excess of &euro;1 million was given directly in aid to Myanmar.  What is Dr. Murphy's view of the entire humanitarian effort?  I presume it is never good enough but is she satisfied that the aid is getting to its intended target or is the junta making efforts to thwart that?  Dr. Murphy's recommendations to us with regard to the embassies are eminently sensible and, as the Chairman said, we will discuss them further as a committee.

We know that historically the military has been extraordinarily powerful there.  There are almost 500,000 members of the military.  Dr. Murphy referred to the need for an international arms embargo.  Following on from Senator Joe O'Reilly's question in which he suggested that the military in Myanmar was getting support from other countries, could Dr. Murphy say who has supported it in the past with the arms it has?  I noted on some television programmes recently that it has quite a powerful set of hardware.  For it to work, an arms embargo would have to be universal and include all countries.  Given that it has such an arsenal, I wonder what its impact would be.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked about Covid.  With the mass gathering happening at the moment, and with no testing or treatment, it is obviously a huge concern also.  It could spread among the general population.  I noted that many of the doctors in the hospitals are refusing to co-operate with the military junta at the moment and the healthcare system has more or less collapsed.  Perhaps Dr. Murphy would comment on that.<\/p> <p>  The situation of refugees going to other countries such as to India, China, Laos and Thailand and the Rohingya refugees going to Bangladesh is of huge concern.  Dr. Murphy mentioned more than once her concerns regarding this complex spreading to other jurisdictions and destabilising the general area.  Will she say a little bit more about this?  What are her concerns about this and how might it happen?  We would all agree with the responses Dr. Murphy suggested we make in our role on the UN Security Council and in the European Union, and that maybe we should support the Government and the Minister in what he is doing in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the fashion industry, which Dr. Murphy said is quite important to that region.  What other industries are there underpinning Myanmar's economy?  I am aware it has oil, gas, and a lot of renewable energy.  Will Dr. Murphy comment on that?<\/p> <p>  The situation is a huge concern.  There are very few places in the world where this kind of thing is happening at the moment, and to this extent.  I know there are wars elsewhere.  Syria was similar to this and we saw what happened there.  This is very worrying.

I thank all the members for their questions and, in particular, for their interest and concern.  Let me start with Deputy Brady's questions.  I would 100% reiterate and underline the way in which the Deputy depicted the sinister nature of the atmosphere in Myanmar right now.  The actions of the military have been appalling in the extreme.  I mentioned just some of them.  There are all sorts of allegations against the military in how it has been treating its own citizens during this period.  It is the indiscriminate nature of the violence that is really adding to the sinister nature of society in Myanmar right now.<\/p> <p>  On the question of information, the Deputy makes an important point.  I do not think all the information is getting out.  Communications systems have been limited.  The Internet is not available during the night.  Access to the Internet is patchy and completely non-existent in some parts of the Myanmar.  In this situation, information is absolutely critical to the opposition, in particular.  It is critical to allow it to organise and to protest, and to facilitate the coming together of protesters.  It is also critical to allow the protesters and the opposition movements to communicate with the rest of the world and to give a true sense of what precisely is happening on the ground in Myanmar.  The international community is not quite getting a full picture at the moment because of the ways in which the military has been limiting communications systems.<\/p> <p>  I refer back to one of the points I made in my recommendations for ways in which the committee and the Oireachtas could engage with the tech community and tech companies.  I am aware there are moves among many in Myanmar and among those who are following the situation to connect with Elon Musk's Starlink project.  This is important because the Starlink project tests low-orbit satellite Internet provision in different parts of the world.  What is critical about this facility is that it offers access to an open web and allows the user to bypass a state's Internet controls.  There is enormous optimism about the way in which these technological developments have the potential to disrupt authoritarian regimes such as the military coup we are seeing in Myanmar right now.  It means that one can effectively cut off the extent to which a regime can control and dominate information, because a state simply cannot regulate this particular service.  It also means that Internet access can be offered in the most remote areas of the planet, and parts of Myanmar fit that category.  China and Russia are opposed to this form of technology, but many countries across the West are enthusiastic about the way it can help to assist with democratisation processes, and the provision of information freely and fairly around the world.<\/p> <p>  The Rohingya crisis has been a particularly appalling aspect of what has been happening in Myanmar in recent years.  The Rohingya community is concentrated mainly in Rakhine state in Myanmar.  Since the beginning of the military coup there appears to be some latent empathy emerging for the Rohingya community more broadly across society in Myanmar, across the ethnic groups and across the main Burmese ethnic population, which accounts for some two thirds of the population.  It has been interesting to watch this.  Given all they have experienced since 1 February, the ordinary citizen in Myanmar seems to be developing a degree of empathy for the way in which the Rohingya were treated by the Myanmar since 2017.<\/p> <p>  On the other ethnic groups, reference was made to the Karen National Liberation Army, KNLA, which has a very long history of fighting for self-determination against the military.  Many of the ethnic groups, not just the KNLA, are seeing an opportunity during this period of instability for them to proceed with their attacks against the military and to push even further for some of their political and constitutional goals.  We are also seeing some young people, especially in and around urban areas, now choosing to align somewhat with some of these ethnic groups, and choosing to contribute to the military effort to defeat the military coup itself.<\/p> <p>  Again, it has been quite interesting in the period since the coup began on 1 February 2021, to see some degree of unity among disparate groups in Myanmar that had previously been opposed to each other.  They are now, effectively, all united against a single force, which is the military coup.  There is some capacity for the international community and for national institutions such as the Houses of the Oireachtas, to assist the ethnic groups, to assist the civil disobedience movement, to offer them some degree of capacity building and to help them to stabilise the partnerships that are emerging between these groups in their attempts to defeat the military coup.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing the beginnings of a refugee crisis, which Deputy Brady also mentioned.  With regard to those countries that border Myanmar that are seeing an influx of refugees at the moment, the Oireachtas and governments around the world might encourage those states to consider granting asylum to people who are fleeing persecution in Myanmar.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 is a very serious issue in Myanmar right now.  The Covid-19 crisis had caused enormous disruption up to this point but now there is the near collapse of the health system and the complete absence of testing since 1 February.<\/p><p>That protests groups have been gathering in such large numbers makes it likely that the Covid-19 crisis will deteriorate even further.  The fear is that as the refugees move across borders, we will see an intensification of that problem and a degree of hostility between refugees and populations in those countries.  There is an enormous amount to be aware of here and it is very hard to know precisely the extent to which Covid-19 is problematic simply because of a lack of information and any process of testing right now.<\/p><p> I thank Senator Joe O'Reilly for his comments and his kind words about the two reports with which I was involved.  I feel particularly saddened reading those reports again and reflecting on those brief periods I spent in Myanmar.  It was clear the democratisation was proceeding and there were certainly challenges and difficulties.  On the whole there was an atmosphere of enthusiasm and optimism.  There was a clear preference for a future based on democratic principles.  That was absolutely self-evident, despite the challenges and difficulties.  It is an enormous tragedy to see the way in which there has been a rolling back of all that progress over a period of ten years or so.<\/p><p> With regard to the geopolitical position, there was mention of China.  This is a complex matter in itself.  As the committee is aware, China blocked the UN Security Council condemnation of the coup but has, nevertheless, backed calls for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and a return to democratic norms in Myanmar.  China has a policy of non-intervention in cases like this.  It is fair to suggest China has not lent decisive support to the military in Myanmar.  China's key and overriding interest is to maintain stability in Myanmar.  To a certain extent, maintaining stability, whether in the context of military or civilian rule, is the priority.<\/p><p> Relations between the National League for Democracy and China were relatively harmonious in the period before the coup and there has traditionally been some wariness of China in the national capital, Nay Pyi Taw, about the role China may have in Myanmar as it proceeds through the democratisation process.  China is very important to Myanmar in that it is its biggest trading partner and it is also one of the largest sources of inward investment.  Approximately 1 million tourists from China visit Myanmar every year.  China, therefore, has an important role to play.  Myanmar is also important to China in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative.  There are more than 30 bilateral agreements between China and Myanmar, including everything from the development of railway systems to deep sea port projects.  This is important to Beijing because it provides an alternative route for energy imports.  Aside from this there continues to be a degree of wariness in Myanmar about Chinese intentions.  They fear this may be costly for Myanmar and they also fear that some of these facilities may be put to military use in future.<\/p><p> China's interest in stability is sort of based on its economic interests in Myanmar, or it is at least linked to them.  I tentatively suggest that China would see a civilian government in Myanmar as offering a greater prospect for stability than a military-led Myanmar.  It is not simply a case of China supporting Myanmar without there being any restrictions or nuance in that respect.  It is a complex relationship and China's approach to this has not been decisively supportive of the military.  It is important to note that.<\/p><p> With regard to the perspective of the United States and the West more generally, the condemnation of the coup has been wholesale and quite vociferous.  I mention the UK in this context as well as it has been quite outspoken.  There are some difficulties for the US, the West and Britain.  Recognising the legitimacy of the National Unity Government is challenging because that government is completely disparate now; some of the members are in exile but most are hiding and they are not necessarily in contact with each other.  They do not have any access to the resources of the state.  There are difficulties.<\/p><p> The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, has been playing a very delicate role in trying to navigate this terrain.  It invited the leader of the military, Min Aung Hlaing, to the ASEAN summit last Saturday but it did not invite representatives from the National Unity Government.  There is some dismay in Myanmar that ASEAN appears to be prioritising the military coup in that context.  However, it is more nuanced, challenging and sensitive than that.  ASEAN is trying to create a scenario and conditions whereby it can draw the military into longer-term negotiations aimed at addressing the situation and moving back to the democratisation process as it has been experienced.  There are enormous challenges and major sensitivities and none is simplistic.  All of them pose problems or difficulties for those trying to navigate the area.<\/p><p> Ireland has by all means been speaking out on this very well.  Its position on the UN Security Council means it has some capacity to engage other members on a bilateral basis, particularly other countries in the region, including Vietnam, for example.  Norway is also on the UN Security Council now and it has been quite outspoken.  It has an embassy in Myanmar.  There is capacity for all that to be developed and I have no doubt Ireland's contribution to the UN Security Council is ongoing.<\/p><p> Humanitarian aid to Myanmar is something promised by the ASEAN summit.  We must be very careful about who would distribute this aid and how it would filter into Myanmar.  It is fair to say that if the military was given access to that aid and asked to distribute it, the civil disobedience movement would refuse to accept that humanitarian aid.  That speaks to the resilience and resoluteness of the civil disobedience movement, so care must be taken on how aid is distributed in Myanmar and who is given responsibility for that.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy Stanton for his questions.  He mentioned the international arms embargo and the access to weaponry or defence resources that the military in Myanmar has.  It has very substantial reserves of power in that context.  In particular, it has very strong defence links with Russia, with defence contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  The committee is aware that Russia is another member of the UN Security Council that did not support a statement condemning the coup earlier this year.  Russia supplies arms and equipment to Myanmar.  It sees the coup as a domestic matter and it also has a policy of non-intervention in these cases.  Russia is an important player in facilitating what is happening in Myanmar.<\/p><p> The only different point I could make is that an international arms embargo also has an impact on the ethnic groups and the emergence of what has been called an embryonic federal army that aims to take on the military in Myanmar.  An arms embargo would also affect those groups and there must be an awareness of that.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanton also asked about Covid-19 and I repeat the points I have made.  The healthcare system in Myanmar is close to collapse.  There is no testing capacity and there has been mass mobilisation of people but we do not have adequate information or data on the extent of Covid-19's spread.  We can only assume it is spreading.<\/p><p>That causes all sorts of problems within Myanmar, where there is no functioning healthcare system to deal with the fallout and, in addition, the movement of refugees across borders creates its own difficulties in the wider region.<\/p><p> In terms of destabilisation in the area and the broader geopolitical concerns, the committee will be aware that Myanmar borders not just China but also India, Thailand, Laos and other countries in the region.  There are concerns about conflicts on the borders, particularly if the ethnic groups, many of which are confined to border areas, step up their aggression against the military.  There are fears that conflict would spill over into other countries.  There are also concerns about the way in which a substantial humanitarian and refugee crisis may put pressures on neighbouring states.  There are already hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees located in Bangladesh and adding to those numbers in any way, shape or form has the potential to destabilise the area.<\/p><p> There are important points to be made about the economic situation in Myanmar, as Deputy Stanton mentioned.  Oil and gas are two important resources in Myanmar and this speaks to one of the recommendations I made in the discussion paper I submitted to the committee.  There are companies such as the US company Chevron with substantial sway and considerable interests in Myanmar.  For decades, Chevron has been working there through a subsidiary called Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise.  This is a State-owned company that is now controlled by the military junta and probably represents the largest source of funding for the military at the moment.  That company runs a massive gas pipeline that has also been linked, in the past, to alleged human rights abuses.  Myanmar's army has been accused of permitting those abuses, including rape and murder, while providing security for the pipeline.  <\/p><p> Chevron and the French company, Total, transport natural gas from the Andaman Sea to Yangon, Myanmar's most populated city, and to Thailand.  These two companies have substantial stakes in these particular projects.  They have paid hundreds of millions of US dollars in recent years to this State-owned company, the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, which is now, effectively, run by the military.  There have been international calls for these companies not to pay the many taxes and production rights they owe to this particular State-owned company and to instead put those taxes and production rights into escrow accounts to safeguard those resources until such time as there is a return to democratic rule in Myanmar.  There is a strong sense among many in Myanmar that stopping the oil and gas money is a vital way of assisting the democratic struggle there.<\/p><p> I will say a few words about the fashion industry.  There has been rapid growth in the garment sector in Myanmar, concentrated particularly around Yangon.  Major brands and retailers use the facilities around the city and source materials from Myanmar, including Adidas, H&amp;M, Zara, Primark, which has some interest, Samsonite and Benetton.  We have seen a big increase in exports to the European Union since approximately 2011, when the economy began to liberalise and the democratic system began to take shape.  Many of those companies have severed their links with Myanmar in the aftermath of the coup.  There are, obviously, fears about disruption but there are also fears about reputational damage.  The issue is that this has left many in Myanmar without jobs and income.  It also critically threatens to undermine the advances in worker conditions which had come on the back of these companies taking an interest in Myanmar.  The industry has, of course, also been severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p> On the ground in Myanmar, the civil disobedience movement has been very critical of the fashion industry, which employs hundreds of thousands of people, for the way in which companies have been so tepid in their condemnation of the coup.  The military has also targeted the garment district because many of the workers there live in hostels and dormitories that are relatively easily targeted.  Workers want the fashion industry to make it clear that the suspension of their business in Myanmar is until such time as a democratic government is restored.  They want the fashion companies to speak up and to defend their interests because many of these workers have been fired for attending protests.  Many have been locked into their factories to prevent them attending protests.  Limiting the ability of the military in this context and speaking out against the military would be a considerable moral boost for the protestors in Myanmar.  The garment sector predominantly employs women in Myanmar.  They are a cohort of society that has traditionally encountered a higher degree of discrimination relative to their male colleagues and counterparts.<\/p><p> I hope I have addressed the bulk of the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary C.

Before I revert to Dr. Murphy, there are a number of points or questions that I would also like to put to her.  I acknowledge her frank engagement with us as a committee.  We can follow up as early as Thursday on this.  As she will be aware, Ireland fully supports the sanctions against the perpetrators of the coup and the economic entities that currently sustain the regime.  We are, of course, conscious of the fact that EU sanctions and measures that predate the current coup were in place and were supported by Ireland.<\/p><p>It is important that we continue to strongly support the measures and perhaps a further expansion.<\/p><p> In this regard I was very struck by what Dr. Murphy said about the possible engagement with international tech companies, many of which are operating in Ireland.  Obviously, communications from areas such as Myanmar and other areas which from time to time experience unlawful coups are vital.  It is not a new adage that the truth is the first casualty of war.  We need to ensure an adequate flow of information.  The committee will investigate that further to see what can be done from an Irish perspective in respect of our engagement with the tech companies.<\/p><p> Dr. Murphy said that the response from ASEAN to the political situation fell short of calling for the release of political prisoners.  I ask her to expand on the reasoning for that.  In the past few weeks, I would have thought there was a possibility of suspending Myanmar from ASEAN.  However, Dr. Murphy did not include that in her recommendations, nor did the European Union, which has referred to further engagement of ASEAN.  What are the likely next steps in the engagement with ASEAN, given that she does not support suspension of Myanmar's membership?<\/p><p> Dr. Murphy responded to Deputy Stanton on the arms embargo, which is crucial notwithstanding the resources that are currently available to the directors of the coup.  She specifically mentioned Russia.  I would add India and China and ask her to respond to that.<\/p><p> Dr. Murphy recommended the engagement of Irish and international parliamentarians with politicians in Myanmar.  However, the ambassador with a remit for Ireland would be the Myanmar ambassador to the UK, who, of course, was recalled some weeks ago.  I note the Irish Government did not receive any notice of the recall and was not in any way informed.  Therefore, we do not have any direct engagement through ambassadorial channels.<\/p><p> Dr. Murphy has experience of engaging directly with politicians there.  Would it be fair to say that she has direct knowledge of the work practices and political philosophy of some of the current CRPH members?  Would she recommend international democratic regimes contacting them?  In that regard I ask her to comment on the national mandate of these CRPH members?  What is their remit nationally across Myanmar?  Is it a broadly based political organisation?  As a consequence of that, what international recognition has there been of the CRPH?<\/p><p> When Dr. Murphy says that there might be further direct engagement, perhaps even towards the civil society, what is her view of there being civil society leadership?  There have been calls internationally for the generals to speak directly to civil society.  Does she believe that would be a meaningful engagement?  What is the strength of the civil society leadership?  This is something that will provide us with further engagement.  I ask her to respond to Deputy Clarke and me on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042700002#G00400","speaker":"1589","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":594,"content":"<p>The Chairman and Deputy Clarke made a good point about humanitarian aid.  Most of the NGOs and international development organisations have effectively left Myanmar and very few remain on the ground there.  While there are some, they are very constrained in what they can do, how they can work and how visible they can be.  They are under threat of being detained by the military.  They need to be exceptionally cautious in their work which makes it even more challenging in assisting Myanmar in-country now.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy rightly made the point that doctors and healthcare system workers have effectively been on strike since the beginning of February.  That has had very real and impactful consequences for the healthcare system in Myanmar.  Doctors and medical personnel are trying to provide some form of care to those who need it urgently and in emergency situations, but they are doing that under the threat of extreme violence and the possibility of detention by the military and beyond that torture, imprisonment and perhaps even worse.  The only medical facilities that are readily available are private hospitals.  These have become exceptionally expensive in recent weeks and are beyond the means of the vast majority of Myanmar citizens.  <\/p> <p>  There is some voluntary provision of care, but, as I said, that is becoming exceptionally difficult.  Doctors, because of the role they have been playing in the civil disobedience movement, are being targeted by the military.  They have had to act very cautiously in assisting people who may need medical assistance.  This speaks to the way in which a humanitarian crisis is looming in Myanmar in the absence of that kind of medical care for all aspects of society, including children.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the National League for Democracy.  I cannot give a precise figure for the people who are detained, in exile or in hiding, but many of them would be operating under the threat of being picked up by the military and detained.  Much of the work and activity of the national league is being filtered through the CRPH, which is being led by 17 MPs, two of whom represent ethnic parties with 15 representing the NLD.  They would be senior figures within the NLD movement.  That is the focus for engaging with the political system or at least with the alternative political system in Myanmar now.<\/p> <p>  On the capability of neighbouring countries to accommodate refugees, I made the point that Bangladesh is already hosting hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees.  Thailand is also seeing some influx of refugees right now.  Any influx of refugees in the large numbers that may materialise in the weeks and months to come will be exceptionally challenging for many of these countries, particularly countries like India which, as we know, is experiencing a severe Covid-19 crisis now.  Underdeveloped countries in the region will also struggle to accommodate that kind of influx of refugees and all that goes with that in terms of the economic demands on society and the potential for instability in those border regions.<\/p><p>I agree there is an onus on the western world and the European Union to look at the way in which NGOs can be mobilised on the borders in Myanmar to deal with the likelihood of large numbers of refugees moving across the borders into other states in the neighbourhood.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for his comments, particularly in regard to the tech industry and other international companies which are operating in Myanmar, and ways in which the committee and its members may be able to engage with those companies in terms of encouraging them to be outspoken in their objections to the Myanmar military coup right now.<\/p><p> On the question of ASEAN, as we know, it met on Saturday and I made the point that it produced a five-point consensus plan, which must be welcomed, although it fell short in key respects.  I need to put that in a degree of context.  ASEAN is a ten-member body of states in the region.  It is an intergovernmental body and the primary reason for its existence is to maintain peace and stability in the region.  It represents 650 million citizens across the region.  It is guided primarily by the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.  That is a very important principle for ASEAN and, of course, it comes with challenges in that it means ASEAN has historically been accused of not always having a strategic vision in terms of dealing with crises like these.<\/p><p> There are also diverging priorities among the member states which make up ASEAN and, even on the issue of the Myanmar coup, there are very different perspectives.  Countries like Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia have been more outspoken and have condemned the violence, and they have also expressly called for the release of political prisoners.  That is not something we have seen in regard to other countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, which have been much quieter in terms of responding to the coup.  In fact, countries like Vietnam and even Thailand may be seen as being more sympathetic to the military in Myanmar than to the civilian government.<\/p><p> There are some strategic difficulties for ASEAN in terms of how it can deal with a crisis like this.  It is not a body which can be compared with the European Union, which is far more developed and advanced in its capacities.  That record of weakness in implementing decisions needs to be watched very carefully in the weeks ahead.  ASEAN is to be applauded for having reached the five-point consensus plan and, in fact, for some observers the extent to which it was able to reach agreement, and we understand agreement was reached with the leader of the military coup on these five points, is to be applauded.  However, the biggest challenge going forward is to ensure the five-point consensus plan is implemented and, even on the first point on the cessation of violence, there is no sign there has been a serious cessation of violence in Myanmar since Saturday, although that was something that was agreed to at the meeting.<\/p><p> There is a need for the international community to speak up and to pressurise ASEAN and to ensure accountability in terms of pursuing the five-point consensus plan.  I did not mention expelling Myanmar from ASEAN, although some have mooted that as a possibility.  I would see it differently.  I think it is better for Myanmar to be talking to ASEAN than to be excluded from ASEAN at this time.  ASEAN did invite the military to its summit but it did not invite the national unity government.  As I mentioned, there is some concern on the ground in regard to why that happened.<\/p><p> Some individual countries in ASEAN are, I think, more open to being pressurised than others.  Therefore, there is potential for the Oireachtas and the Irish Government to apply pressure in that particular respect.<\/p><p> On the issue of Irish parliamentarians and how they might engage in a real and meaningful way with what is happening in Myanmar, the CRPH has spoken to elected representatives in other jurisdictions and it had a meeting with four Members of the European Parliament.  The European Union has not legitimately recognised the CRPH but, nevertheless, there appears to be a degree of empathy for what the CRPH is trying to do.  It has a strong mandate in that all its members were all elected in November 2020 and they are collectively representing more than 400 elected MPs, including members of the National League for Democracy, NLD, and some ethnic groups.  However, on a wider scale, there has been very little in the way of formal recognition for the CRPH and that is primarily a consequence of the fact the CRPH is an organisation in exile.  Accessing the organisation is certainly possible but the capacity for those in the organisation to talk to each other or to have any control over the resources of the state is completely constrained at the moment because of the military coup.  There are difficulties but I would certainly encourage the committee and the Oireachtas to engage with the CRPH, if that is something the committee is open to, and there are ways and means of facilitating that.  It would be a very important message to send to the CRPH and would be very well received by the CRPH.  It would symbolise an enormous commitment on the part of Ireland to what is happening in Myanmar right now and would give a very significant boost to public morale among the civil disobedience movement in particular.<\/p><p> The Chairman mentioned civil society leadership.  This is a little more disparate and there are not necessarily any key leadership figures we can point to.  Trade union leaders have played an important role in terms of mobilising the civil disobedience movement, but one of the key problems is that many of those in leader positions within civil society have now been detained.  They have been picked up by the military and imprisoned, and some will have lost their lives during the course of these protests.  Therefore, it is very challenging to isolate leadership within the community at the moment, and it is made even more difficult by the absence of information emanating from Myanmar right now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary C.

I cannot stress to the committee how resolute they are about meeting the challenges of the current situation, defeating the military coup and returning to the democratisation process.  There is an onus on all of us and on the international community to support, recognise and assist that effort because it is the efforts of those people on the ground who wish to see a return to democracy in Myanmar that will ensure the situation stabilises.<\/p><p> Having said all of that, it is very important for the international community to recognise the seriousness of the crisis in Myanmar and the potential for it to become a failed state in one of the most important geopolitical and economic regions in the world.

The committee has been supplied with a detailed briefing document for each of these Votes in advance of the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the work of my Department in light of the proposed 2021 Estimates, and touch on the proposed 2021 Estimate allocations for the President&rsquo;s Establishment, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  While I have certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas for administrative matters in some of these offices, they operate independently of my Department.<\/p> <p>  On Vote 1, the Estimate for the President's Establishment is &euro;4.51 million.  This includes &euro;3 million for pay and administration, with the balance to fund the centenarians' bounty.  On Vote 3, the Estimate for the Office of the Attorney General is &euro;17.46 million.  Of this &euro;12.26 million relates to staff costs and &euro;2.46 million is allocated to the Law Reform Commission.  On Vote 5, the Estimate for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is &euro;44.7 million.  This provides &euro;16.5 million for fees to counsel engaged by the director to prosecute cases, &euro;7.3 million to fund the local State solicitor service and costs awarded against the State arising out of legal proceedings.  On Vote 6, the Estimate for the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office is just under &euro;37.69 million, the bulk of which relates to salaries and administration.  A provision of just over &euro;16.4 million is allocated for the payment of legal fees incurred.<\/p> <p>  The Estimate for my Department, Vote 2, is just over &euro;50 million.  Almost 47% of that relates to staff and administration.  The remaining &euro;26 million provides funding for Covid-19 public communications, the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, the National Economic and Social Council and several independent inquiries.<\/p><p> My Department will continue its central role in providing, co-ordinating and overseeing a whole-of-government focus on the response to Covid-19.  It is vital that we ensure that our overall approach to the management of the pandemic continues to be one that is prudent and sustainable over the immediate-, medium- and longer-term.  It is essential that disease prevalence is brought to lower levels, hospital and critical care occupancy are reduced to low levels and that the most vulnerable are protected through vaccination before further easing of restrictions is considered.  Any easing of measures should be gradual, with sufficient time between phases to assess the impact and to respond if the situation deteriorates.  Subject to the prevailing public health situation, the areas under consideration for after 4 May are a full return of construction, the reopening of cultural institutions, a phased return of non-essential retail and the recommencement of personal and religious services on a staggered basis.  <\/p><p> Ireland is working as part of the EU in securing a stable supply of Covid-19 vaccinations.  Vaccines continue to be administered very quickly after their arrival here and Ireland is ahead of the EU average for doses administered.  As of yesterday afternoon, a total of all 1,407,184 vaccines had been administered, including 1,007,003 first doses and 400,151 second doses.  One in five of the population who can get the vaccine have received the first dose.  A total of 12,000 vaccinators have also been trained in anticipation of the ramping up of vaccination corresponding with increased supply.<\/p><p> From the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was recognised that providing clear and timely public information would play a vital role in the State's response to this public health emergency.  There is provision for &euro;50 million for Covid-19 public communications in this Estimate.  The communications programme needed was of an unprecedented scale, comprising the majority of Departments and a large number of State agencies.  Platforms used include national and local print and radio, television and a variety of digital channels depending on the specific audience being targeted.  There have been 45 campaigns completed to date, covering multiple strands, including public health, business reports, well-being supports, societal supports and communications on the various roadmaps to lift the various restrictions.<\/p><p> The impact of the pandemic on the domestic economy and public finances has been severe.  However, the enormous scale of Government intervention has prevented even larger declines in economic activity, even higher rates of unemployment and an even more rapid rate of firm exit.  We hope it has laid the foundations for a swifter recovery by ensuring businesses can stay viable and survive and that jobs can be retained.  As the virus is effectively brought under control, there will be a need to move away from these extensive and wide-ranging emergency supports, with a move first to more targeted interventions for sectors which remain subject to restrictions, as well as towards investments which support recovery and opportunities for future growth. <\/p><p> We know that the pandemic has not impacted everyone equally.  It has had a disproportionate impact on people who work in contact intensive sectors, many of whom are younger and on lower pay.  We must ensure that the recovery is inclusive and balanced and recognises the unequal burdens and risk of increasing inequality stemming from the pandemic.  We must also ensure sustainability is to the fore as we rebuild.  There will be challenges, but there will also be opportunities as we transition to more sustainable economic development.<\/p><p> Work is progressing on the development of the national economic recovery plan to support and reboot the economy to meet all of these challenges.  It will set out a roadmap for a resilient, innovative and productive economy aligned with the Government's green and digital ambitions.  Like all sectors, housing and construction have been impacted by the pandemic.  However, we are committed to working with the sector to deliver an increased supply of affordable, quality and accessible housing.  <\/p><p> Tackling climate change and transitioning to a climate-neutral economy remains a key focus of this Government.  My Department plays an important role in driving the implementation of our ambitious climate agenda.  This year the key architecture that will frame our approach to climate action for years to come is being put in place.  This includes the climate Bill, Ireland's first carbon budget and an updated climate action plan, all of which will reflect a step up in ambition committed to in the programme for Government.<\/p><p> My Department played a key role in ensuring a successful outcome in the finalisation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which came into force on 1 January 2021.  This work, together with the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, secured Ireland's key objectives in the Brexit process.  These were protection of the Good Friday Agreement and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, ensuring the best possible outcome for the economy, trade with the UK and the protection of Ireland's place in the Single Market, maintenance of the common travel area and our continued commitment to our place at the heart of Europe.<\/p><p> My Department has been strongly engaged in the national Brexit readiness work, in close collaboration with the Department of Foreign Affairs and across government.  This has included the development of primary legislation, the provision of financial upskilling and advisory supports for business, extensive stakeholder outreach and a multi-year public communications campaign to promote readiness<\/p><p> Whole-of-government readiness work must continue as we support businesses or individuals encountering difficulties with customs checks or clearance and as we prepare for the introduction of new UK import controls.  Right across government, we will work to mitigate the impact of Brexit on our economy and citizens.  Covid-19 has also thrown into sharp relief how interconnected and interdependent our world is.  As we work this year to overcome the pandemic and rebuild our economy, we will do so with the added strength and resilience of EU membership and through continued engagement with the wider international community.<\/p><p> At the beginning of January, Ireland took its seat at the United Nations Security Council.  Our two years on the Security Council is an opportunity for Ireland to make a meaningful contribution to international peace and security.  Three principles underpin our approach: building peace; strengthening prevention; and ensuring accountability.  I plan to participate in a number of high-level debates in at council during our term in office and attend a regular UNGA high level week in September, a month during which Ireland will hold the presidency of the council. <\/p><p> We marked the 23rd anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement on 10 April.  The Agreement represented a new beginning for political and community relationships on the island, with a new ethos of tolerance, equality and mutual respect.  We must continue to protect and nurture the potential of the Agreement.  I have established a shared island unit in my Department, which is funded from the Department's Vote as a whole-of-government priority to invest in and look to our shared future on the island in an open, inclusive and constructive way, engaging with all communities and political traditions. <\/p><p> In budget 2021, we established a shared island fund with a major commitment to &euro;500 million in capital funding over the next five years, ring-fenced for North-South investment, to deliver projects that will enhance connectivity, sustainability and opportunity across the island.  To inform how we deepen our co-operation and connections on the island, the unit is progressing the comprehensive research programme, working with the ESRI and other partners to enhance understanding across a range of policy areas.  <\/p><p> Three shared island dialogue events have been held to date.  There has been engagement with young people on climate and biodiversity issues and on the pivotal role of civil society in our peace process.  There have been really refreshing, practical and thoughtful contributions in the dialogues from a range of community and sectoral perspectives.  <\/p><p> Through the work of the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality, my Department will continue to support whole-of-government efforts to combat poverty and disadvantage, improve the position of vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, promote diversity and inclusion, tackle inequality in all its forms and provide ongoing support to children and families.  <\/p><p> Work of the implementation group on policing reform is supported by an implementation office in my Department.  I am encouraged to see the responsiveness and flexibility shown by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with the demands of Covid-19.  Its contribution at an organisational and individual level has been immense and we are extremely grateful to it.<\/p><p> My Department, together with the Department for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, provides the secretariat to the future of media commission, an independent expert body established by the Government to establish how public service aims can be delivered and sustainably funded through broadcasting, print and online media in Ireland over the next decade.  Since it commenced its work last October, the commission has held a public consultation process that received more than 800 submissions from the public and has run six online dialogues with experts, stakeholders and the public.  The commission is working to a very tight timeline and I expect it will bring forth a set of recommendations to Government by July of this year.<\/p><p>My Department continues to promote the deliberative democracy process by supporting the current Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality.  The assembly published the results of its voting on 45 key recommendations last Saturday and I thanked the citizens involved for their commitment and hard work.  Their full report, which will set those recommendations in context, is expected to be submitted to the Houses for consideration in June.  The assembly&rsquo;s experience of operating on an online basis will inform the approach to be taken with regard to the other citizens&rsquo; assemblies outlined in the programme for Government. <\/p><p> Provision is also made in the Estimate in 2021 for a number of independent inquiries, including the Moriarty tribunal, the Cregan commission and the Cooke commission.  The Estimate includes an allocation of just over &euro;2 million for the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, for its work in providing forward looking, strategic advice on economic, social and sustainable development issues.  The current NESC work programme includes a programme of research to support the Shared Island initiative and to contribute to policy response and analysis on Covid-19.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Revised Estimates with Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021042700002#A00800","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.

As far as I can see, we have responded to the correspondence we received from the Chairman on behalf of the committee.<\/p> <p>  On the recovery and resilience fund, the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are preparing a Government submission to Europe and have been in touch with the European Commission.  It has to be broadly aligned to the EU's recovery and resilience programme and the thematic approach the commission has adopted.  Significant parts of that will involve investment in the green economy and digital transformation.  The allocation to Ireland in grants is expected to be approximately &euro;915 million over a four-year period.  The Government is identifying priorities in the context of that plan and will submit it to Brussels in the first week of May, I think.  That is the essence of it.  I have talked to both Ministers.  The Government is still working on prioritising, and has been doing a lot of work on this over the past while and has been engaged with the Commission.  It also involves country-specific reforms that the Commission may indicate it would like to see consistency in fulfilling reforms it wants in the broader economy.  It will represent a distinct piece of work involving how to strategically use the grants that will come from that fund.  The idea is to concentrate it on some key strategic priorities in digital transformation and the green economy to create jobs.  A broader national economic recovery plan will be published subsequent to that.  There is also the national development plan that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is preparing, which will be a ten-year plan on the structural projects.  There is also the Brexit adjustment reserve fund.  Those are four big pieces of work in the Government's investment agenda, which we will announce during 2021 with a view to developing the economy after.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021042700002#C00500","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":617,"content":"<p>The point made by Senator Higgins and Deputy Farrell is that they are looking for information that was sought on an ongoing basis by the clerk to the committee.

It concerns the Stardust inquiry.  Budget 2021 allocated funding for an inquest into the Stardust fire after years and years of campaigning by the families.  I commend those families who have never let this issue go.  A commitment was made that no family would be prevented from accessing justice, but that is not the case with many of them now being denied legal aid.  My colleague, Senator Lynn Boylan, spoke about this matter in the Seanad as recently as yesterday.  She said that these families have waited 40 years for justice and are now being asked to supply PPS numbers, bank statements and payslips.  They are even being asked what kind of car they drive.  This is 40 years in the waiting and families still have to fight and to protest for the justice that is their right.  Section 29(2) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 allows for a discretion to waive the financial eligibility test.  This requires a statutory instrument from the Government.  Given the commitment that the Government has given, is it willing to provide that statutory instrument to waive the financial eligibility test for these families who have campaigned and waited for so long?  What communication, if any, has the Taoiseach had with the Office of the Attorney General or with the Department of Justice to bring forward a statutory instrument?

I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that the stability programme update contains a 3.5% increase in expenditure year-on-year over the next number of years.  Is he aware that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has said that the fiscal projections rely on technical assumptions that do not reflect the Government's priorities and that projected spending increases are very close to what is needed just to cover rising prices, wages and demographics?

There has also been a variety of very significant expenditures in education, health and across all of the various Departments to underpin activities that are under way within those Departments.  The stability programme update is not the budget but it gives a broad technical framework as to where we are in fulfilling our commitments in that regard.<\/p><p>They do not exclude further increases, for example, in subsequent budgets or prioritisation that Governments may take beyond that.  There are two key dimensions here as far as I see it: one is the degree to which we emerge from Covid and evolve from the level of supports that we currently have in place.  I think we can get to a reasonable position in terms of reducing deficits over time, as specific Covid expenditure falls away and the economy reboots and restarts.  Substantial elements of the current expenditure profile are made up of Covid expenditure, both current and, in some respects, capital.  There will be challenges but, on the other hand, the macroeconomic advice from the Commission, the ECB, the IMF and others is to maintain the stimulus position until we emerge stronger out of Covid-19 and reboot the economy.

Therefore, there might be a need to tailor supports, but the idea that we would keep the same supports going well into 2022 or forever is not tenable either.  If we get out of the grip of Covid-19 and the influence it has on it, we will have to look at new areas for the allocation of expenditure, in particular in sectors that have suffered more than most in the past 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021042700002#E00900","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021042700002#E01000","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":658,"content":"<p>Could I clarify how much time I have in my slot?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021042700002#E01100","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":659,"content":"<p>The Deputy has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021042700002#E01200","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":660,"content":"<p>That is brilliant.  Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis an Taoiseach for his appearance and, most importantly, for the weighty documentation his Department presented in advance, which allows us the ability to dig in.  I will ask two sets of questions on two very specific areas.  They are pretty different from what Deputy Doherty asked but very similar to ones I regularly put to the Taoiseach on the floor of the D&aacute;il during Question Time.<\/p> <p>  The first relates to Vote 2, part F, the shared island unit in the Department.  It is something that I have said many times is an extremely welcome initiative driven by the Taoiseach's personal commitment.  It has significant potential for everyone on this island regardless of our political beliefs.  The unit has been allocated a ring-fenced budget of &euro;500 million, which is extremely welcome.  A review is in progress and three quasi-virtual dialogues have been held.  Where is the advance in concrete proposals?  I think, for example, of the Narrow Water bridge that has full planning permission and buy-in from both local authorities.  It is supported by both the Executive and the Government here and it is something that, for want of a better word, is an easy win and can be achieved.  Any possible strengths that will come out of the shared island unit will only be displayed when there are tangible and physical results, not just conversations but actual physical work.  What is the status of that particular project, but also other ones the Taoiseach has mentioned many times in various speeches and within the programme for Government that are so important to show how important this unit is to communities North and South?  I will come back in when the Taoiseach has replied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021042700002#E01300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":661,"content":"<p>It is a very important piece of work.  The &euro;500 million will be allocated through the relevant Departments for those expenditure items.  A key project to which we have already allocated funding of approximately &euro;6 million is the Ulster Canal.  We intend to do more there to bring that project ultimately to conclusion.  It will make a significant difference in bringing people together from both sides of the Border to enjoy a wonderful amenity and also develop a first-class facility for people to enjoy.<\/p> <p>  We have an interesting project coming forward on research.  We are trying to develop a programme for research in third-level institutions, PRTLI, type project to be funded through the shared island unit in terms of collaboration between third level bodies North and South on topics of mutual interest.  Both of those are coming close to realisation.  We are working with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  We have already allocated some basic grants for research projects of &euro;20,000 per project on the shared island itself.<\/p> <p>  The Narrow Water bridge project is one I am interested in pursuing.  Both county councils are committed to it.  I have been in touch with the Minister for Infrastructure, Nichola Mallon, on the Northern side.<\/p><p>We are hoping to progress that.  Close to June, I would like to be in a position to outline some further projects on which we can get agreement and to which we can give the go ahead.  The Deputy will be conscious we have supported a feasibility study with regard to North-South high-speed rail.  We have also supported a complementary industrial project in Derry and Letterkenny, in conjunction with the City Deal initiative.  We will create industrial parks on both the Derry and Donegal sides to try to develop both indigenous industry and foreign direct investment.  This will be an investment in the North West Regional Development Group, whose members have worked consistently over many years irrespective of politics.  We would like to be in a position to support that initiative, which will complement the work the group is doing.  We will also be funding a feasibility study with regard to the Sligo-Enniskillen greenway.  We announced quite a number of projects at the North-South Ministerial Council plenary session at Christmas.  We hope to be in a position to announce spending on a number of further concrete projects in June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021042700002#E01400","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":663,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach very much for that.  The real proof of this shared island initiative will be the sight of actual shovels in the ground and material advancements so that people can see these projects.  The buy-in of the Northern Executive will be very important.  I hope that certain political noises and stand-offs between certain elements of the Executive can be avoided to progress projects.  That just makes sense for everyone on this island.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues the Taoiseach touched on was that of high-speed rail between Dublin and Belfast.  This will be very important to the new Dublin-Belfast economic corridor.  It also feeds into a second area, which relates to Vote 2.  I refer to the Government's post-Brexit trade and investment plans.  One of the great skills of one of the Taoiseach's predecessors, an iarThaoiseach, Enda Kenny, was his ability to take to the world and sell Ireland, to get companies of all sizes to invest in the country and to push through really imaginative projects that allowed the economy to recover and which restored so many people's jobs.  Deputy Doherty has already spoken about those who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic.  That will be a very significant challenge.<\/p> <p>  With regard to that section of Vote 2, the Department of the Taoiseach not only works alongside but co-ordinates with State agencies like Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland which come under the T&aacute;naiste's Department.  There is also the matter of how the Taoiseach envisages maximising Ireland's role on the UN Security Council.  There are only 18 months left in that appointment.  A great deal has been curtailed by the pandemic but the Taoiseach has said, both in his address and in the supporting documentation, that his Department has big plans for that role.  As we are facing into a very acute economic squeeze post pandemic, with the spectre of the lingering fallout of Brexit, will the Taoiseach flesh out how his Department will lead the economic charge in that regard, bearing in mind the great work done by his predecessors, such as Enda Kenny?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021042700002#F00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":664,"content":"<p>In terms of the broader question, during the week of St. Patrick's Day we co-ordinated significant virtual outreach not only to the Irish diaspora but to the economic interests Ireland has.  We had many meetings, under the auspices of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, with companies and economic interests in the United States in respect of our interests in terms of both companies that want to expand into the United States and American companies that invest and are present in Ireland.  Over recent months, I have held regular meetings with significant senior personnel in many multinational companies.  These were held virtually as we could not travel.  Thousands of jobs have been announced.  Since January alone, I estimate that up to 6,000 jobs have been announced in a number of companies.  There have been very significant announcements from the likes of Intel and from quite a range of digital companies that have announced plans for expansion and investment.  As we get out of the Covid pandemic, we will be able to do this better by getting out there and visiting these companies.  I anticipate the Government doing that with vigour once we can do so as a result of greater vaccination rates across Europe and the world.  That will enable us to get back out there again with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to advance Ireland's cause and to create jobs.<\/p> <p>  Some work has recently been done by the T&aacute;naiste's Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the value of economic trade agreements.  This will be published.  The research refers to four trade agreements, those with Korea, Japan, Canada and Mexico.  These trade agreements have resulted in dramatic and very significant increases in Ireland's exports.  We are a global nation and depend on global connectivity.  I am very conscious of that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to our role on the UN Security Council, Ireland has been working extremely hard and doing a lot of work.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been leading this contribution admirably.  I intend to be there in September, as I have said.  We have had engagement in respect of that, especially with regard to Syria and getting the agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue back on track.  We have also had engagement on the climate front.  We put the whole climate security issue on the agenda.  So far, our representatives have been very effective and we hope to build on that.  Our values and our approach to the conduct of international relations include encouraging a rules-based approach to international organisation and taking a peaceful approach to conflict.  We want to apply the values that have informed Irish foreign policy over the years in the context of our membership of the UN Security Council.  We do not necessarily wish to use our membership to raise our economic profile but rather to have a good and beneficial impact on the world, as best we can, through the Security Council.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the situation post Brexit, we need to do further analysis of the impact of Brexit on the British economy, as we export a great deal to Britain.  The early figures as to the reductions in trade flows are significant.  It remains to be seen whether these reductions will be sustained.  That is something on which we have to keep an eye.  In our engagement with the British Government, we are developing post-Brexit structures between Britain and Ireland.  This will replace the kind of engagement we had as common members of the European Union.  The work is ongoing with regard to the approach to the British-Irish dimension post Brexit but also with regard to putting the EU-UK relationship on a stronger basis.  I hope that is happening because it would have a beneficial impact on the Irish trading experience for our exporters and importers and on the issue of Northern Ireland and the protocol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021042700002#F00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I will begin by adding my voice to the comments of the Chairperson and Deputy Doherty as to what I consider to be the non-reply received with regard to the correspondence sent on the issue of the pay increase for the Secretary General of the Department of Health.

Before I do so, however, I want to tease out an issue.

All of that said, the percentage of the population that has received one dose is 20% whereas the EU's percentage is 21.26%.  In terms of what is probably the best indicator of where a nation stands, that being, doses per hundred, Ireland's figure was 28.6 whereas the figure for the EU was 29.18.

It landed in Ireland again when a Minister of State - I believe it was Deputy Joe O'Brien of the Green Party - voiced his support for such a tax and wrote to the Minister for Finance in that regard.  The basic argument put forward was that there were people who had gained enormously financially since the start of the pandemic and others who had been significant losers on the financial front.  Some of the former include large pharmaceutical corporations, corporations that provide Zoom meetings and other social media meetings of that kind, etc.  Obviously, people who have lost their jobs and, in particular, the poor and the young have lost out financially.  It struck me that the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach were very quick to rule out that tax and argumentation was not given to support the logic of their position.  Many commentators wonder whether the ruling out of this suggestion was overly hasty and perhaps put Ireland behind the curve.  The IMF is not in any way a radical organisation.  It is proposing to clip the wings of the super wealthy in order to defend the system of the super wealthy, but it is proposing this as a serious suggestion.  It has been ruled out very hastily, though.

I think the context there is that, as I said earlier, 18.4% of the national income is the level of support that the Irish Government has put in play.  It is an unprecedented level of State expenditure.  The State has never been more involved in the economy than now because of the pandemic.  I would ordinarily have thought that such a position was something that Deputy Barry would have embraced.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the reviews, we want to get people back to work and we want to get sectors reopened in the economy.  If we can, that will be a natural reduction in some of those expenditures, be it the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, or the pandemic unemployment payment.  We do not want to hit the economy with measures that could restrict the growth of the economy in 2021 and 2022.<\/p><p>That is why there is a view that the idea of a Covid-19 solidarity tax is not something that the Government is minded to do.  Government is not minded to do that right now.  Government wants to assist and facilitate recovery rather than choke it off unnecessarily, although I am not saying one issue on its own will choke it off.  That philosophy will govern how we emerge from Covid-19.  We want to try to reposition the economy so that we can create jobs and get sectors that have been hit hardest back up and running.<\/p><p> We have to look attentively at the sectors that have been hit hardest.  I have identified some of them and they include hospitality, tourism, travel, aviation, entertainment, music and the arts.  All these sectors have suffered greatly as a result of Covid-19.  We have borrowed a vast amount of money to sustain this period.  We are in a position to be able to do that given the role of the European Central Bank in underpinning the sovereigns throughout Europe and the collective way Europe has approached this.  That is why we took the approach we did in terms of the idea spoken about by the Deputy.  That is how we see it.<\/p><p> We have a progressive tax system in Ireland.  Those on higher incomes are taxed more.  That is a fact of the Irish taxation model.<\/p><p> There is a balance here.  We want to try to create and grow enterprise as we emerge from the pandemic.  We want to create new opportunities for people to create jobs as well.  GDP is forecast to expand by 4.5% this year and 5% next year.  Modified domestic demand is probably a more useful indicator and that is projected to go up by 2.5% this year and to reach 7% next year, which is significant.  There are large amounts of savings.  Can we trigger some of that back into the economy?<\/p><p> We have to work on many issues.  We are looking at developmental things.  How do we get construction back up and running?  How do we get greater delivery on the construction side?  How do we get more houses built in 2021 and 2022?  These are key parts of the agenda.  Can we get the skills side of that sector up and running?  The reason for the launch of the national apprenticeship programme is to get far more apprentices into the field to back up the national electrical programme and several initiatives we have under way.

I am flabbergasted this particular module has been going on for six years.  I understand that in recent weeks the Taoiseach has given the go-ahead for another extension until October.

I did not enter politics with an eye on salaries.  Obviously, I believe in the basic principle that a Deputy's salary should be linked to that of a principal officer because I can recall a time, before the principle was put into effect, when politicians were competing with each other to try to reduce pay to see who was the best in the class and to get the best media commentary.  I believed the reform many years ago to connect a Deputy's salary to that of a principal officer was good.  Now and again, of course, when there are public service pay increases more generally, the focus falls on the increase for Deputies.  When it comes to the salary of Ministers and the Taoiseach, the remuneration is high.  I do not have any issue with that other than that if we are trying to attract people from different careers and fields, we have to look differently at it.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting, if one thinks about it, that the State, at local and national levels, has no difficulty in contracting individuals and companies, but mainly companies, at much higher levels of expenditure.  We need to reconsider that.  Many issues have arisen in the Department of Health over many years.  Genuinely, given the nature of the budget, more than &euro;20 billion, the position is as I describe.  We saw issues associated with the children's hospital manifesting themselves.  I am of the view we have a chance and opportunity.  Through Covid, we can learn a lot.  Sl&aacute;intecare, with full Oireachtas agreement, has really transformed our approach to health.  I am not saying it is down to one individual &mdash; of course it is not &mdash; but it sends a signal that we are going to deal with health positively and constructively through giving it a higher focus in terms of both policy and execution.  We did that with the HSE, which was important, and we did it with the Garda Commissioner, the National Treasury Management Agency and other bodies.  It was effective.

We have seen that only three of the 23 applicants were international.  What really shocks people is that it turns out we have somebody who was working for the State who was more than capable of doing the job and more than willing to take it.

I was a Minister for Health and witnessed at first hand the enormity of issues and the rapidity with which they arrive on the desk of a Secretary General.  The Department of Health is not like other Departments.  Sometimes in the political debate, it is easy to have a go at these points.  I appreciate that and that people have different perspectives, but when it comes to the substance and detail of this, I am of the view that while my approach is not the only approach, it is a correct one.  There are other elements we have to put in place as well.  We have to fund health to a greater degree and reform it also.

There has been one very good series of all-island dialogues North and South.  Climate does not recognise any border so it is very important Northern Ireland would sign up to this and all of its implications.  There are opportunities here as well in terms of the creation of jobs.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see joint actions between ourselves and the Northern Ireland Executive on biodiversity projects.  I am saying to colleagues on the Border and in the North that there are opportunities for funding from the shared island fund in respect of the protection and so on of biodiversity.  That is just one concrete example of where we could do something really effective on the ground.  We also need to get alignment on awareness of the issues and on development of the debate around climate change.  We are anxious to pursue that through the dialogue series and to get an all-island approach to it.  We will work with all parties and, in particular, civil and environmental groups that are focused on this area to ensure we get unit of approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021042700002#K00900","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":729,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach raises important points in his responses in terms of interconnectivity and biodiversity, our inland waterways and the UK-Northern Ireland marine area as well.

The next decade in offshore wind will be very significant.  I also see the potential of collaboration.  I mentioned to the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce last week during my engagement with it that we are committed to the offshore wind agenda for the next number of years.

As vaccination increases, we hope we can avoid the scenario that has been outlined.  We know that the vaccines have been effective.  The incidence of death and severe illness has gone way down among those who have been vaccinated.  Within the week we will have 95% of all over-70s vaccinated with a first dose of a vaccine, which offers huge protection.  We have all the nursing home residents and front-line health care workers vaccinated with first doses, and also, substantially, the over-70s, more or less.  We are into the 60s age cohort now.

The north west regional group really impressed me because they leave politics outside the doors of their councils in Derry, Strabane and Donegal.  They look at themselves as an integrated region.  They look at what can be expanded and how they can get investment into the region.  Those are the kind of questions that they ask themselves and they create strategies around that.  I want to support that type of initiative.  We have made it very clear that we are there to support those kinds of initiatives.  The shared island fund gives us some type of financial capacity to support those initiatives over and above the rhetoric.

What we need now is to do a deeper analysis of how Brexit is working out in practice, both in terms of Britain and the British economy, and how that will impact us.  The early signs are of significant reductions in trade levels and the question is will that be sustained.  We see a dramatic increase in direct routes to the Continent.

This has nothing to do with the individual concerned; it has to do with the issue of transparency.  In October 2019, the Government was specifically asked by the Public Service Pay Commission to consider re-establishing a special review body similar to that which had reported in 2007.  The Department at that time was arguing that the then pay rates were determined on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis, similar to what happened on this occasion.  If we bear in mind how that &euro;82,000 was reached and the decision that was made on it, and I do not know the background to it, there were other employees within the HSE who were refused increases and increases were withheld from them.  It would appear report No. 42 was overlooked and that it did not deal with the matter, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 was not considered and, as a result, there are still a significant number of retired staff and others who are continuing to work in the HSE who are battling for pay increases that they were due.  The Taoiseach might compare this to the process the Army and the Defence Forces are going through to have their pay and conditions examined.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach can understand why there would be anger and upset over the decision that was so easily reached about the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  In Mr. Fraser's reply, he was explaining how these appointments and transfers were made.  He said it is usually dealt with by the use of an oral procedure to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the appointments process, and that it was usually dealt with at the end, as a last item on the agenda of Government business.  This is what the members and I are asking about: the transparency of the process, where the &euro;82,000 figure came from and the issues that are relevant to that increase, to do with other workers within the HSE, who did not get their increases when it was reported that they should, and who continue to fight for them.<\/p><p>I put it to the Taoiseach that giving someone a huge increase in their salary does not necessarily mean that projects like the children's hospital are going to come in within budget or, indeed, that all of the other ills of the Departments and the overspends that are recorded by the Comptroller and Auditor General are going to end.  I have not seen a massive improvement in the context of the clients of the HSE who are looking for their services to improve.  I have seen huge commitment from the front line but I have seen the waiting lists grow and grow.  It is similar with regard to the reforms that were necessary in the Garda.  We have not seen much of those either, despite the fact we gave the increases.  Giving someone an increase does not always necessarily mean they are going to transform and reform, as the Taoiseach suggested.<\/p><p>It is important we know the process by which the initial temporary appointment was made and the process by which the salary increase of &euro;82,000 was reached.  In addition, what it was benchmarked against is very important for us to consider.  I would again ask the Taoiseach to review the correspondence we have received and to come back to us then with his views on matters, to see if they have changed in any way.<\/p><p>I want to turn to the Estimates, in particular the Estimates in regard to the tribunals.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n went through some of these figures already.  They have cost the State considerable amounts of money.  I wonder if it is the intention of the Government to review all of these costs and the outcomes to date, with a view to amending legislation or dealing with this ongoing cost, which is like a runaway train that cannot be stopped.  What is the Taoiseach's view on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021042700002#M00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":746,"content":"<p>First, fundamentally, in regard to the Secretary General's position, it was a policy decision and I have made my points already in respect of my views on the need to genuinely move on the health service and transform it.  That does not depend on one position and I take the Chairman's point on that.  I understand where people are coming from and people are entitled to have different perspectives on this.  There has been a restoration of FEMPI, not fully or completely in all circumstances but in a substantial number of circumstances, and that will continue.  Work is under way in terms of the Army and Defence Forces.  Part of the programme for Government is to work on that and to set up a commission in respect of the future of the Defence Forces, and we have taken some early steps in regard to some aspects of the Defence Forces.  We are going to move on those things.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, the initiation and development of the children's hospital was before the current Secretary General arrived but, nonetheless, it is illustrative of the scale of projects that can come under the remit of the Department of Health, and that needs to be borne in mind as well.

Unlike other Votes, the Health Vote is not configured along programme lines.  My Department continues to work towards the development of programme budgeting and changing the structure of the Health Votes to reflect this.  It is going to take some time as financial systems in the HSE have to be adapted to allow for this in the context of a financial reform programme that is under way.  In line with Government policy, and in the context of Covid-19, budget 2021 provided an unprecedented level of investment.  The investment supports the resilience and preparedness of the health service to increase capacity and permanent staffing levels, to progress the implementation of a number of national strategies, and to advance the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of universal healthcare.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted to have secured a further &euro;4.039 billion in funding on top of the 2020 allocation.  The level of funding provided will enable the advancement of a number of important priorities this year, including the protection of vulnerable groups, service users, patients, health care workers, and the wider public in the face of Covid-19, in line with national and international public health guidance; the delivery of increased levels of healthcare to our people in community and primary care settings, encompassing the mainstreaming of the Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund initiatives; the delivery of the ambitious capacity enhancement and reform plan in line with the health service capacity review of 2018; improving access to mental health services, including progressing the implementation of the Sharing the Vision policy; improving access and enhancing specialist disability services with a focus on implementation of the Transforming Lives programme; continuing projects, including the development and adoption of an integrated financial management system by all statutory and larger executive-funded voluntary services, alongside further development of activity-based funding for hospitals and community services, together with enhancing procurement governance and systems.<\/p> <p>  The provision for the Health Vote in the 2021 Revised Estimates allows for a significant expansion of the health sector workforce, with an increase of 16,000 whole-time equivalents over the original January 2020 estimate of public service numbers.  The allocated pay budget has increased from &euro;7.95 billion to &euro;9.055 billion in 2021.  The impact of the latest Covid-19 surge in the first quarter of this year has had an obvious impact on service delivery.  Some areas, such as additional home support hours, are behind where we would have hoped they would have been at this point, but the HSE is working to bring these back on track.  Demand for the nursing home support scheme is also down on estimates, but this has not impacted on waiting times for applicants.  It is expected that, all things remaining as they are, certain pent-up demand will see expenditure reach estimated levels by the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  The Health Act 1947 was amended to provide for a system of mandatory quarantine at designated facilities.  This system of mandatory hotel quarantine is necessary to prevent and mitigate the risk of Covid-19, particularly variants of concern.<\/p><p>The Government has established a proportionate and carefully balanced system for mandatory quarantine, which is necessary to address the risk posed by travel from states where there is known to be sustained human transmission of Covid-19 and, in particular, variants of concern, or from which there is a high risk of importation of infection or contamination with Covid-19 and, in particular, variants of concern.  This is necessary to protect the public, our health system and our vaccination programme. <\/p><p> The cost of mandatory quarantine was originally estimated at &euro;7 million with costs to be recouped from the people placed in quarantine.  However, as further capacity and hotels are added this estimate will inevitably increase.  Funding to meet these costs is being provided from within the departmental allocation and will not impact on the allocation to the HSE.<\/p><p> The programme for Government reaffirmed its support for universal healthcare via Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare is being funded and is on track to improve access, expand eligibility, improve the patient experience and bring care closer to home.  In 2021, there is continued commitment to Sl&aacute;intecare with &euro;1.353 billion being provided to fund programme reforms, including increased acute and community bed capacity, providing enhanced community, social and primary care services and improving access to care including a new access to care fund. <\/p><p> The move to a public-only health system is a key priority for the Government and central to the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of universal healthcare.  The programme for Government provides for the introduction of the Sl&aacute;intecare contract.  Arrangements are currently being finalised to facilitate the introduction of the contract in the coming months, following the enactment of the Public Service Pay Bill 2020, currently referred for Committee Stage.  My officials will write to the representative bodies shortly inviting them to discussions on the contract.<\/p><p> There has been significant growth in consultant numbers recently, with numbers increasing by more than 200 in the past year to 3,470 but I recognise that further progress is required.  I want doctors to stay in the Irish health system and for those who have emigrated to return home.  As part of budget 2021 nearly 600 additional consultant posts are being created.  The introduction of the Sl&aacute;intecare contract will give us an opportunity to grow consultant numbers and move towards universal healthcare in a public-only system.  The introduction of the contract also represents a significant opportunity to address the current number of temporary and unfilled consultant post and I have requested the HSE to develop a plan to achieve this.<\/p><p> Following intensive engagement, my Department, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, have reached an agreement to the introduction of a fundamentally reformed and strengthened model for public health in Ireland in line with international best practice.  This will require the implementation of a consultant-led and consultant-delivered public health model.  Implementation of this model will enable recruitment and retention of public health consultants.  It will deliver an agile, dynamic, intelligence-led public health medicine service to protect the population from health threats, promote health, improve health services and tackle inequalities in health. <\/p><p> Women&rsquo;s health is a priority for the Government.  Commitments made in the programme for Government include specific support for the women&rsquo;s health task force and the development of a women&rsquo;s health action plan.  Budget 2021 allocated a dedicated multi-annual &euro;5 million women&rsquo;s health fund to implement a programme of actions from the work of the women&rsquo;s health task force and appropriate activity is being identified for implementation and funding.  The first two funded proposals, which were announced last week, are &euro;1.4 million for two community-based ambulatory gynaecology services governed by Tallaght University Hospital and University Maternity Hospital Limerick and &euro;.6 million for the expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital, which creates specialist service for very complex cases.  These proposals will significantly increase access to these services for women and support their care at the earliest point. <\/p><p> Some &euro;20 million is being provided to progress the implementation of the national cancer strategy, including surgical and medical oncology; rapid access clinics and early diagnosis and radiotherapy.  The national cancer control programme is allocating initial \"once-off\" funding to each hospital group to assist with the costs associated with their efforts in service recovery and continuity.  This funding will support measures to increase resilience and address clinic backlogs.<\/p><p> I now turn to the 2020 outturn.  The gross provision for the Health Vote in 2020 was &euro;20.875 billion, comprising &euro;19.801 billion in current expenditure and &euro;1.074 billion in capital expenditure.  This &euro;20.875 billion represents the gross funding position for both the Department of Health and the HSE and includes additional funding of &euro;1.777 billion made available for current expenditure in 2020 in response to Covid-19 and &euro;547.5 million granted by means of a Supplementary Estimate.<\/p><p> The initial 2020 capital allocation was &euro;854 million.  In response to Covid-19, an additional allocation of &euro;220 million was made bringing the total capital allocation that year to &euro;1.074 billion.  The total cost of Covid-19 supports provided by Government to the Health service in 2020 was &euro;2.5 billion.  Among the key measures covered by this expenditure was testing and tracing; supporting nursing homes and home support; enhanced GP services; community assessment hubs; caring for people in acute services; private hospital capacity; expanding and protecting our health workforce and essential workers; expanding physical infrastructure including isolation facilities; and maintaining access to essential health products, equipment and services.  These measures continue to be relevant in 2021 as the pandemic continues <\/p><p> In framing the 2021 budget, the Oireachtas allocated significant further additional Exchequer funding for the health sector.  I thank committee members for their support in this.  In 2021, gross health funding is &euro;22.13 billion comprising &euro;21.081 billion in current expenditure and &euro;1.048 billion in capital expenditure.  This represents an increase of &euro;1.28 billion, 6.5%, on the 2020 post-supplementary current expenditure budget and recognises the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing a health service that seeks to improve the health and well-being of the people of Ireland.<\/p><p> While the 2021 capital allocation is &euro;26 million below that of the final 2020 figure, it represents a significant increase on pre-Covid-19 allocations and reflects continuing investment to meet the infrastructural challenges in responding to the pandemic.  The capital funding for health in 2021 will contribute to the delivery of modern health facilities and equipment to improve and expand service provision and capacity across the country, both key aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare and Project Ireland 2040.  While the scale of this funding is significant, the value of the investment in protecting our people in the face of the Covid-19 is unquantifiable.  This Government is steadfast in our commitment to protect everyone and to enhancing the resilience of our health service.  This commitment is evident in the level of funding made available in 2021.<\/p><p> The issue of health funding is a major policy challenge internationally, as committee members will be very well aware.  Despite welcome funding increases over recent years, the need for effective financial management remains crucial.  The health service is dealing with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the increasing costs of health technology.  The costs associated with these service pressures will increasingly need to be managed, not solely through annual increased Exchequer allocations, but also through improved efficiencies, productivity and value from within the funding base in 2021 and beyond. <\/p><p> Demographic pressures, including a rise in chronic diseases and ageing populations, are major challenges to health funding internationally.  The additional funding secured over recent years provides a substantial basis for the health service to maximise the level and quality of service delivery while also implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.<\/p><p> A significant increase in funding for the health services has been achieved this year.  Much of the recent increases have been Covid-19 related.  The health system responded quickly and efficiently to the Covid-19 emergency.  Additional spending has facilitated the necessary and rapid introduction of testing, provision of essential personal protective equipment; enhanced support to critical health services; and the introduction of additional hospital capacity and community services.  Oversight structures are in place to ensure this significant investment is approved, monitored and reported in line with agreed sanctioning processes and financial procedures.<\/p><p> The programme for Government places a major focus on health service reform and investment in our public health system.  Building upon and learning from the Covid-19 response will be central to the Government&rsquo;s approach.  In addition to Covid-19, dealing with a growing and ageing population, more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the increasing costs of health technology, will all continue to pose a financial challenge into the future.<\/p><p>Improving the way services are organised and delivered and reducing costs in order to maximise the ability of the health service to respond to growing needs must remain important points of focus.  It is essential that those managing and delivering the service continue to demonstrate good practice in the year ahead by delivering the best possible healthcare within the limits of resources that have been made available by the Government.  I thank my colleagues and the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#A00400","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":773,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the presentation.  May I touch on one or two issues?  First, additional funding was provided to the private nursing homes to deal with the pandemic.  I did not see any figure for public nursing homes and community hospitals.  I believe there are 119 of them.  Could we have a breakdown of the additional funding that had to be made available, particularly to increase the level of care so the facilities could deal with the new demands and challenges posed by Covid.<\/p> <p>  Second, I want to touch on the expansion of home care.  The pandemic has created new demands.  As the Minister said, the number of people over 65 is going to continue to grow over the next ten years.  The number is about 720,000 now and it will be 1 million by 2030.  On the rolling out of additional home care supports and the regulation of the home care providers, what progress will be made during 2021?<\/p> <p>  The final point I want to touch on concerns Sl&aacute;intecare, to which the Minister referred quite a bit.  The Sl&aacute;intecare team produced a report on the three elective hospitals for Cork, Galway and Dublin.  It is a totally watered-down proposal.  I am getting no response from anyone regarding where we are going on this.  We put considerable money into new healthcare facilities in Dublin.  The population of Cork has grown by 130,000 over recent years and it is a question of new hospital beds, yet a Sl&aacute;intecare report is suggesting that Cork should have only a day facility, which could not cater for anyone with diabetes or other underlying conditions.  Where are we going with this Sl&aacute;intecare report?  Where is there provision in the budget for 2021 to deal with these issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#C00200","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":774,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for those questions.  Regarding the public nursing home supports, I will ask that a note be provided to the Deputy.  Obviously, a substantial amount of support was provided to the nursing homes across the country, and this was supported by Nursing Homes Ireland.  I will get a detailed note not just on the money but also on the additional capacity provided through the community healthcare organisations.<\/p> <p>  On the expansion of home care, we have a very ambitious target for this year, that is, to add an additional 5 million hours.  Some &euro;150 million for additional expenditure was allocated.  Of this, &euro;140 million was for the provision of the hours and &euro;10 million was for the provision of what is called the interRAI system.  We are fundamentally changing how home care is provided in the country.  The interRAI system will essentially allow for the individual assessment of patient needs and their care requirements.  There are many advantages to it, including around transparency, but I am very keen on the fact that it helps in terms of health equality.  It will allow us to ascertain what parts of the country have the level of service provision they need and the parts that need additional support.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned regulation.  I actually brought a memorandum to the Government today and we got agreement on the drafting of the heads of a Bill on the regulation of home care.  It is a really important move.  There is a major focus on it.  The Deputy is very aware of this, not least because he and Deputy Higgins tabled a Bill on it.  There was much progress today.  We will be drafting a very comprehensive Bill on the regulation of home care services and also expanding it, essentially bringing into line the regulation of nursing homes and the regulation of home care because there needs to be more of a continuum.  My view, which is shared by many members of the committee, is that we need to maximise home care over nursing home care, not that there is not a role for nursing home care.  Of course there is, but it is a question of keeping people at home as much as possible.  A really important step was taken today.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy continues to advocate very strongly regarding the elective facilities, including the elective hospital in Cork.  Some of the thinking of the Sl&aacute;intecare team is that the elective hospitals could be day care only.  The thinking is that if the quality and speed of care are maximised for less complex procedures, it frees up inpatient beds and acute beds for complex care.  However, I am aware that there are strong views on this in Galway and Cork.  The Deputy and other Deputies have expressed them, and some in the clinical community have done so in regard to wanting a mixture of inpatient and day care beds in any new elective hospital.  No decisions have been made on that.  The thinking is still being worked on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#C00300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":775,"content":"<p>Regarding the elective hospital, how long is this issue going to be kicked around the place?

We either go down that road or build a new hospital on a greenfield site.  The elective hospital proposed by Sl&aacute;intecare is a day facility.  A facility operating for six days per week for 50 weeks of the year will not be able to deal with a large number of patients because many patients coming in for minor enough procedures will also have underlying conditions.

The answer is that it is a combination of things.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy stated, the treatment abroad scheme is used.  If we had the level of capacity we ought to have here, the scheme really should not be needed.  I will give an example.  Funding is being provided for an ophthalmology unit in County Cork, which will be able to deal with many people with cataracts who are currently travelling to private hospitals in Northern Ireland for cataract operations.  To me, success is people no longer needing to travel but, rather, being treated in the unit in County Cork or another HSE hospital.<\/p> <p>  In the short term, to make progress on waiting lists we need to use a combination of things.  We need to use the treatment abroad scheme.  We need to provide additional funding to the HSE, both in terms of permanent capacity, such as the ophthalmology unit, but also in terms of additional short-term capacity, such as running operating theatres out of normal hours, payment by procedure within HSE hospitals and using the private system to treat as many people as possible as quickly as possible. The total funding being allocated this year is substantial.  We have an access to care fund of &euro;210 million.  There is an additional amount of &euro;30 million to the NTPF, bringing the total amount for the fund up to &euro;130 million.  There is &euro;33 million for alternative care pathways, which is part of the Sl&aacute;intecare work but essentially will help to tackle waiting lists.

There are two trajectories almost at intersection point now, namely, the vaccines versus a declining or at least a levelling of the Covid rate.  There is a much to hope for and it is hoped Thursday will allow for a safeish reopening of the country or at least the next step in that process.

Another potential budgetary constraint on Minister Department is the digital green certificate, which is being worked on at European level.  Although it deals with international air travel, my understanding is it will come under the remit of the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  A vote is to take place on it in European Parliament this week.  We know the technical specification of it was agreed and published yesterday by the European Commission. The meat is very much going on the bone.  We will be at the point shortly where this will be put to each member state to ratify and then to decide how they will implement it.  There are three pillars to it.  It will certify those across Europe who have been vaccinated, those who have been PCR-tested and who were negative at the time they presented themselves at the departure gate at an airport, and it will also carry data relating to those who have recovered from Covid.  The European Commission is intimating there will be a six-week lead-in or implementation period.<\/p> <p>  That concerns me a little with Ireland being geographically peripheral and a little more cut off from Europe, with our nearest neighbours having departed the European Union.

If we are going the whole hog of having a digital system in place to allow people to present themselves at an airport departure gate, would the Department consider operating that system, which will be up and running, in certain contexts around the country, for example, to allow people to go to matches, concerts, weddings and venues in which large numbers of people will congregate?

To pick up on the issue of the Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation on three elective hospitals, it is disappointing to hear there seems to be a watering down of that.  This was a key recommendation following on from the experience in Scotland and how it dealt with pressures on its acute hospital sector.  There is a very strong case for having elective hospitals but they have to go beyond day case, or while they could obviously do day cases, there is a need for inpatient cases as well.  For example, one of the key pressure areas is orthopaedics.  That is something that should be done as a matter of course, with people in and out in a matter of days, as some of the private clinics are doing very successfully.  What was done in Scotland was that a private hospital was bought to kick-start that whole new approach.  Has consideration been given to that?

It is not because we do not need more inpatient beds, and we all know we do.  It is really around providing the most effective healthcare possible.  Part of the thinking is, first, to separate it from emergency departments, so it is planned elective care only and it does not get disrupted by emergencies coming in, and so it is physically separated, for example, like Tallaght is doing with its unit.  Second, the thinking is that if we create it as day case, it is not that we are not creating additional inpatient beds because what we are doing is pulling the less complex care out of the bigger model 4 hospitals, and they can turn some of their day case into inpatient.  However, it is worth reiterating, as I did to Deputy Colm Burke, that no final decisions have been made on that.  I will certainly feed the views of Deputy Shortall and Deputy Burke into the team that are looking at this.

There is &euro;23 million in new measures and &euro;15 million in Covid-19 programmes.  Something that is below the radar, which some people would see as a technical adjustment but which is hugely important in getting the mental health services running, is the &euro;45.2 million also being allocated to existing level of service, pay rate funding and technical adjustments.  Essentially, the HSE has maintained a position for the past few years, of which the committee will be aware, where it said that it could not provide the new services because it was not getting a sufficient increase in its base funding for the existing services, which is covered under existing level of service, ELS.  This year we have put a huge amount of funding into ELS to cover the increases required for this year and the historical deficit.  This year we really need to see the health service providers stepping up to add all the new services.<\/p> <p>  There are a few things happening specifically around the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS.  New CAMHS staff have been funded.  We have an increase of 10% on last year in the CAMHS community mental health budget nationally, which is important.  This is for assessment and treatment.  There are three new CAMHS tele-hubs nationally, which goes back to the conversation on e-health.  There will be a new high-dependency unit in CAMHS in Galway, which will commence construction later this year, which is very welcome.  There is also additional bed capacity being put in place.<\/p> <p>  Specific to progressing the specialist mental health programmes, four that are getting particular attention are dual diagnosis.  There is a real problem with dual diagnosis whereby a mental health service states it cannot treat a person because he or she is in addiction, and addiction services state that they cannot treat the person because he or she has mental health issues.  We are cracking that nut.  Quite a lot of people who have fallen into the dual diagnosis are being failed.<\/p> <p>  I fully agree with the Deputy that early intervention in psychosis, eating disorders and mental health intellectual disability is a big focus.  It has become a real problem during the pandemic.  We are funding to scale up in staff, early assessment, treatment, beds and community healthcare provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#J00300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":863,"content":"<p>My other question is on the finer detail for the roll-out of the medical cannabis access programme, MCAP.

We have allocated funding for MCAP this year for the first time.  The Deputy has been a very strong advocate for this and he will be very aware that the programme has been in place for some time but there has never been any funding for it.  This year we are allocating several million euro from the new drugs budget.  We must wait to see what the uptake is.  Several million euro will be allocated, so it is now a funded programme.<\/p> <p>  I am aware, as is the Deputy, there are some drugs, such as Bedrocan, that are not included in the programme.  While much progress has been made, more is needed.  We are aware that some of the products, such as Bedrocan, fall outside MCAP.  Those who are using them, or their parents, are in an unenviable and unacceptable position whereby they are having to pay for the drugs upfront and then be reimbursed for them on a monthly basis.  It is a huge amount of money.  I have asked the Department to find a way to deal with this.  One of the issues we have with Bedrocan, unfortunately, is around exporting from Holland.  It is not that we do not want to do it; it is just that there are international constraints.  We are working through them.<\/p> <p>  I am very aware that the MCAP will be very useful for people.  We have put a multimillion euro funding package in place.  There are other outstanding issues, such as the one I just discussed, that are causing real difficulty for people.  This is a difficulty they should not have to experience.  I am working in the background with the Department to put solutions in place to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#J00500","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#J00600","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":866,"content":"<p>I have some questions for the Minister.  The national children's hospital has not been touched on today.  Do we know how much it will actually cost?  Earlier in the year some of the board members were before the committee to outline some of the difficulties they are experiencing.  We are aware that compensation claims are coming through the courts and that building was closed down for a period.  Do we have a ballpark figure or does the Minister know exactly how much it is going to cost?  It will be a big figure in relation to the Estimates.<\/p> <p>I do not raise this to frighten people but a conversation is needed around long Covid and people having difficulties with vaccine-associated illnesses.  I am currently dealing with two cases in my constituency with vaccine induced clotting, or VPIT.  This has required blood tests, treatment, in-stay beds, medication and an inability to work.  One person developed a clot on the brain.  There needs to be a conversation around this.  They have told me they have spent a significant amount of money and they are getting bills, having been released from hospital or while still in hospital care.  They are worried about being out of work and out of a job and about mortgages.  Two of these people are women in their 30s.  If a person gets a bill for &euro;1,000 from a hospital, it is a lot of money.<\/p><p>It is only right that there be some sort of support scheme to address costs incurred because of the side effects of vaccination.  When I recently asked a parliamentary question on the matter, the Department stated that a policy was being developed.  Has any amount been set aside in the health budget for vaccine-related costs incurred by people who have suffered side effects?  The State has indemnified many of the manufacturers and so on.<\/p><p> The Minister spoke about quarantining.  I am told that there is an avalanche of cases waiting in that regard.  Has funding been set aside for them?  Is he worried about the cases coming down the track?<\/p><p> I have been on my local drugs task force practically since it was established.  We seek funding every year.  The major challenge this year for many communities, particularly so in Dublin but it is spreading to other areas, is the rise of crack cocaine and its impact.  In November, there was a one-off funding bump of &euro;480,000 for the whole of the State.  That worked out at approximately &euro;20,000 per area, which was a drop in the ocean.  We know the challenges facing people.  Deputies mentioned the impact of Covid.  It is impacting on people who have difficulties with substance abuse, be it alcohol or drugs.  In that regard, has the Minister considered increasing funding for projects for vulnerable people in many of our communities?<\/p><p> St. Michael's ward in Beaumont Hospital has been closed during Covid.  It provided valuable work on the north side of the city.  There has also been the closure of residential beds and support services in Keltoi in the Phoenix Park, causing significant difficulties.  Alongside the question of funding, the issue of residential beds keeps arising at task force level.  Has the Minister spoken to the Minister of State in this regard?  The latter has been out in some communities looking at the challenges facing them.<\/p><p> When the Minister appeared before us previously, we asked him about the backlog in scoliosis procedures.  Has funding been found in this Estimate for that group of people, many of whom are young children who, as the Minister is aware, are suffering the horrible effects of scoliosis on their young bodies?  They could be left with deformities for the rest of their lives if their conditions are not dealt with sooner rather than later.  The Minister referred to difficulties at Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin in terms of staffing for the MRI machine.<\/p><p> The Irish Dental Association appeared before the committee recently.  Its representatives spoke about hundreds of dentists leaving the medical card scheme.  It was concerned that talks had not resumed.  Has funding been set aside in the Estimate for a possible deal?<\/p><p> One of the positive things that the committee did recently was to publish a report on the impact of vitamin D on Covid and general health.  The report made proposals in respect of nursing homes, front-line staff and areas with large Covid outbreaks and examined the role of vitamin D in building up people's immune systems.  A report from the Department did not go as far as ours in terms of the age group, given that we considered a much younger cohort, but is there funding available in this regard?<\/p><p> I have asked the Minister a number of questions.  If he cannot reply to them today, perhaps he will in future.  These are some of the main issues that are still outstanding where the work of this committee is concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#J00700","speaker":"1571","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":868,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his questions.  As the committee will be aware, the capital budget for the children's hospital, including the three satellites, is &euro;1.433 billion.  There will be commissioning costs on top of that.  However, that figure does not take into account the impact of Covid-19.  It would not be appropriate for me to speculate at this time as to what that might cost, given that it will be the subject of ongoing negotiation between the board and the contractor.<\/p> <p>  I agree regarding long Covid.  We need to get an important message out to people, particularly now as we see case numbers beginning to tip upwards again.  Even though those who are younger are significantly less likely to fall seriously ill or die from Covid, there are emerging cases of long Covid among all age groups.  It is concerning in some instances.  The Chairman referenced several cases.  I am aware of research into potential permanent neurological and heart muscle damage.  Part of the message that we need to get out while we are still in the gap between the most vulnerable people being vaccinated and others getting vaccinated is that, even if people are in a relatively safe category in respect of fatalities, what the Chairman just referenced in terms of long Covid is very serious.  People of all age groups are taking months and months to recover from Covid and are exhausted.  This matter is being examined.  Money has not been explicitly ring-fenced for it, but a substantial contingency fund relating to Covid is in place and can be tapped into.  The Government will not be found wanting in the research, treatment and supports required.<\/p> <p>  Regarding mandatory hotel quarantine,-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#K00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":869,"content":"<p>I am sorry.  While my question was on long Covid, it also related to vaccine-related illness.  I do not know if there has been a large number of cases, but we are all hearing anecdotally about side effects.

Will there be supports for people in that situation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#K00300","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":870,"content":"<p>We will need to see how that situation evolves.  The current position is that the vaccines are incredibly effective and very safe.  As the Chairman rightly stated, there are side effects within the normal parameters of people being vaccinated.  For the moment, that is the focus.<\/p> <p>  We are aware of a number of challenges to hotel quarantine.  I can share with the committee that, when the additional exemptions were put in place, particularly for those who were fully vaccinated, a few of the potential cases fell away.  Exemptions are also in place in respect of professional and elite sports.  The cases are being fought in the normal way.  A substantial contingency fund is in place for Covid-related issues, though, and I would not anticipate seeking additional funding from the Oireachtas this year for those issues.<\/p> <p>  I could not agree more with the Chairman regarding local drugs task forces.  I met the members of the local drugs task force in Ballymun early last year.  The stories they told about the impact that crack cocaine was having on the community there were horrifying.  We are seeing it in parts of Wicklow as well.  People working in addiction services and the drugs task force there are watching the situation closely and are very concerned.  Many of the team members I met in Ballymun had been involved in the response to the heroin epidemic.  They are hardened, seasoned professionals, but they said that they had never seen anything like the damage that crack cocaine was doing.  As the Chairman stated, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, is leading on this matter.  A sizable additional fund has been provided to Healthy Ireland, homelessness and addiction services.<\/p><p>It is certainly something on which I want to see more and more done.<\/p><p> There are other issues we are trying to fix in the background.  For example, if a person somewhere in Ireland is living in addiction, there is a fair chance that he or she will receive a rent supplement.  If he or she moves into a residential addiction programme, he or she will lose that.  One of the steps we are trying to take is to have a more co-ordinated approach in the State.  If, for example, that funding can be transferred to the addiction service providers, more and more people can get addiction help.  I could not agree more with the Chairman on the need to fund an increased capacity for the local drug task forces but also for the myriad services around them in order that we can treat addiction as a health, rather than criminal, issue, which is exactly what we want to do.<\/p><p> The next issue the Chairman raised related to scoliosis.  The current circumstances are not acceptable.  On 26 March this year, a total of 119 patients were waiting on spinal fusion, excluding the suspensions, which was an increase of 20 patients compared with March 2020.  We know that many waiting lists have increased because of Covid and the suspension of some surgery, but 70 patients were on the waiting lists for other spinal procedures, which was a decrease against March 2020.  Nonetheless, the current waiting times for scoliosis treatment, if someone needs to go through the public system, are not acceptable.  It is an area we are examining as we put together the detailed planning around the access to care fund.  All of us who are party health spokespeople or were involved in the Committee on the Future of Healthcare are acutely aware of the untold suffering of young men and women and boys and girls, and the awful implications of having to wait.  It is not acceptable.  There is going to be money available and we are going to crack this so that on the public system, these young men and women and boys and girls get not just the care they need but the care they need when they need it.<\/p><p> The next issue related to dentists.  I might get the committee a detailed briefing note on that, given that it is not related to the Estimates today.  I am aware that, as the Chairman referenced, the association has stated that more and more of its members are leaving the public list, which, obviously, we do not want.  Again, everything we are doing is about building up our public health system and increasing access, and there is no question but that in the area of oral health, very significant financial barriers are in place.  That is not acceptable and needs to be acted on.<\/p><p> On vitamin D, I saw the report and thought it was excellent.  All I can do is agree with the Chairman.  On foot of the report from the committee, I sought a review from NPHET of the relationship between vitamin D and Covid, and it reverted to say that while it did not have evidence of a reduction in risk specifically from Covid, it wholeheartedly endorsed taking the recommended dose of vitamin D for general well-being and a strong immune system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#K00400","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":872,"content":"<p>On the extension of free GP care, the Minister stated that nothing is proposed on that for this year, which is quite disappointing given that over a five-year period, there was to be an incremental extension of free GP care to the entire population.  We are probably the only country in Europe where the majority of patients have to fork out the full cost of visiting a GP, which very much goes against the principles in Sl&aacute;intecare of early intervention and lowest complexity of care.  I think it is a mistake not to accelerate that.  I accept there are industrial relation, IR, issues but I urge the Minister to revisit the issue and try to accelerate the extension of free GP care because it makes sense on many levels.<\/p> <p>  Is the Minister doing anything specific to reduce drug costs in this country, both for the State and for individuals?  As a proportion of the overall spend on health, they seem to be much higher than in most other European countries.  We know from when people used to go abroad that the cost of medicines in other countries is often much lower.  What is happening on that?  It is not a sustainable percentage to spend on drugs.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to the proposed restructuring and reform of the HSE.  It was parked for a while last year with all that was going on.  Where are we with that and when does the Minister expect recommendations and action to be taken on restructuring the HSE to make it more responsive and accountable at a regional level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#L00200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":873,"content":"<p>On universal access to primary care, including free GP care, I agree.  It is worth saying that the measures we brought in towards the end of last year increased the total number by several hundred thousand children.  The Deputy was critical of it at the time, as is her right, because she wants more to happen faster, but several hundred thousand children - I will seek the actual figure - were added.  It is a serious step in the right direction.  The Deputy will be aware that we have to have the capacity for this in primary care, and we are asking much of GPs at the moment.  Obviously, they have been instrumental in the test and trace system and the vaccination programme.  We are asking for pretty fundamental reform in terms of chronic disease management in the community.  We have got rid of dot matrix printers for prescriptions on the public list system, which GPs are very happy about, as they are about the access to diagnostics within the community.  The Deputy understands this issue very well.  I would like it to move as quickly as possible.  We increased provision by several hundred thousand last year but we have to ensure that the capacity is there as well.  Nevertheless, the Deputy's point is very fair.  We are signed up to universal healthcare and it is exactly what we need.  As she pointed out, we are an outlier.<\/p> <p>  On drug costs, there are two issues, one of which relates to the new drug budget of &euro;50 million.  It was zero last year, so that is a very sizeable increase.  A backlog of drugs from last year is being moved through at pace by the HSE.  The &euro;50 million will not reduce drug costs but rather provide for free, because it will be through the public system, some new drugs and existing drugs for new treatments, which will help.<\/p> <p>  A total of &euro;45 million in the budget was allocated specifically for prescription charges.  For prescription charges for the over-70s, it will reduce the charge per item from &euro;1.50 to &euro;1, while for the under-70s, the charge will fall from &euro;2 to &euro;1.50.  The net effect, it is believed, is that it will benefit more than 1.5 million people with medical card eligibility, and the drug payment scheme threshold will reduce from &euro;124 to &euro;114.  It is a &euro;45 million step in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  The question on restructuring probably demands a longer conversation than we have time for now.  I took a decision last year that during the pandemic, it would not be the right time to move to the regional structures.  It was not that they are not the right way to go, and much work has been done on them.  I think we are all broadly in agreement on the single greatest advantage of making the change, namely, joining up the budgets for acute care and community care because one of the big problems is the siloed budgeting activity.  I took the call that the pandemic was not the right time to do this.  Based on what has happened over the past year, I think that was probably the right call.  What we have not yet answered, and it is the question the Deputy is now posing, is whether we have a time at which we expect to move to the regional structures, given that the pandemic will be behind us soon enough.<\/p><p>We do not have time but I can tell her that people who are involved and very bought into it are already agitating for us to begin moving in that direction again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#L00300","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#M00200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":876,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to make any concluding remarks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#M00300","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":877,"content":"<p>I thank members for their time, questions and ideas.  There are several pieces of follow-up work that we will do, be it on the National Maternity Hospital and various technical notes people have.  My view is that this is a really exciting budget.  It is a lot of money.  There is a lot of technical stuff happening in the background in respect of financial reporting and IT systems on e-health and enablers but, ultimately, there are a few really exciting things happening in this budget.  The first is around beds.  It is a massive increase in beds at approximately &euro;342 million in terms of acute, critical care, sub-acute and community beds.  They will make an enormous difference and catch us up on the 2018 capacity review.  The first big chunk of investment is in building out the capacity.  Obviously, that funding is not just for the physical beds.  Arguably, that is the easy bit.  It is also about the staff and all the professionals we put around it.<\/p> <p>  The second is what I think is an unprecedented investment in community and social care.  This is the big structural change so we have &euro;408 million going into this.  It involves home care packages, community health networks, community specialist teams, GP access to diagnostics and some of the issues Deputy Shortall and I were just talking about in terms of reducing the costs of access to care.  <\/p> <p>  Significant additional funding is going into disability and mental health, something I know everyone on the committee is committed to.  A new piece about which I am really excited involves nearly &euro;150 million for the national strategies.  Before I sat down with the committee, I came from meeting the people involved in the national trauma strategy.  A lot of funding is now being provided for that.  There is also funding for maternity care and a lot of funding for women's health, paediatrics, dementia, palliative care, the carer's strategy and positive ageing.  The various clinical leads and clinical groups across the system in these really important care pathways have the funding to implement some wonderful strategies that have been put in place in recent years.  There is a big investment in public health and well-being.  The Chairman asked a question about the national drugs strategy, which comes to &euro;53 million.  There are new drugs and various things we discussed.  A really important piece is the access to care fund, which will involve &euro;130 million from the NTPF, an additional &euro;210 million, which is a new allocation, alternative care pathways, and screening and hospital restart grants.  That brings us to in excess of &euro;400 million, which we need to tackle these waiting lists.  <\/p> <p>  We have probably set ambitious targets right across the board.  We will hit as many of them as we can.  It is entirely possible we will not hit them all.  We have set really demanding targets in so many different ways.  All of our amazing clinicians have been working flat out and are, quite frankly, exhausted from the pandemic and all the additional work they have had to do in the pandemic.  The budget in front of us is really exciting because it allocates money in new ways, be it the national strategies or community and care services as well as building up acute services.  I ask for the committee's patience and understanding as we try to hit all these targets, ultimately to make things better for patients and the public in the year we are having and with our amazing clinicians and non-clinical staff across the system.  They are working so hard and are so tired.  They have done such an incredible job.  As the pandemic dies down, the focus of the committee and I along with that of the Oireachtas, our health service and the Department will quite rightly be on all of these wonderful areas and getting them going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#M00400","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il.","time":1619478000,"counter":878,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#M00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":879,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 101, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Select Committee on Health has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimate for public services for the year ending 31 December 2021: Vote 38 - Department of Health. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2021042700002#M00600","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619478000,"counter":880,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 5.26 p.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government","time":1619478000,"counter":881},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 09:30<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 09:30<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Francis Noel Duffy, Victor Boyhan, Joe Flaherty, John Cummins, Thomas Gould, Mary Fitzpatrick, Emer Higgins, Rebecca Moynihan, Paul McAuliffe, Mary Seery Kearney.

If members wish to contribute on this I would ask them to keep their contributions as brief as possible as these are quite straightforward exemptions to the planning regulations and, as the members will know, we are pressed for time on the second item we have on the agenda.<\/p> <p> On privilege, members are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their participation in this meeting.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything that they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty, as Chairman, to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  All members are fully aware of the rules regarding privilege.<\/p> <p>  The opening statement submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I call Deputy &Oacute; Broin to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#A00500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":887,"content":"<p>On a point of order and very briefly, as members know news has broken that a former member of this committee and former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy has resigned his D&aacute;il seat this morning.  Notwithstanding the very significant policy differences I have had with the Minister and his Government, I want to state that the Minister worked very closely with a number of us, including myself and the now Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on a number of pieces of legislation, including legislation which protected student renters.  Notwithstanding the political and policy disagreements, I want to acknowledge the work that he did during his time, in particular in those areas where we were able to find common ground and to collaborate in the better interests of those sections of society that we worked on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#A00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":888,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin and echo his comments that that is the spirit in which all of us on this committee work, which is in a collegiate and collaborative manner to try to forward, as best we can, housing policy.<\/p> <p>  I invite the Minister now to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#A00700","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I am aware that the Chairman is tied for time so I will keep my remarks brief.  I wish to follow in the vein of Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  I spoke with Deputy Murphy this morning.  Even though we crossed swords quite a great deal, members of the committee worked well together, particularly in respect of student rent.  It is quite coincidental that tomorrow we will begin with student rents again in the D&aacute;il.  I wish former Minister, Deputy Murphy, all the very best.  He is a decent guy.  We had policy differences but he certainly tried his best, was very earnest and was a good person to get on with.  I wish him very well in whatever his new choice in life is and in his new career.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Cathaoirleach and the members for affording me the opportunity to present to the committee today the two sets of proposed planning regulations which have been circulated.  First, we have the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (No. 3) Regulations 2021, which concern planning exemptions for restaurants to maintain operations as takeaways for the remainder of 2021.  That provision would have expired without these regulations.  Second, we have the Planning and Development (Street Furniture Fees) Regulations 2021, which will waive section 254 of the street furniture licence fees for the remainder of 2021.<\/p> <p>  A third set of regulations, which do not require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas but about which I also want to advise the committee, is being progressed simultaneously and provides for the erection of awnings, coverings and other similar apparatus for outdoor dining to be a licensed activity under section 254 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, when it is linked with a street furniture licence for tables and chairs under that section.  This means that we will take it out of the planning piece and put it in under section 254.  This will mean that proposals for the installation of awnings, coverings - which we do need from time to time this country, as members will know - and other similar apparatus to facilitate outdoor dining will no longer be subject to planning permission and will instead be dealt with under the street furniture licensing regime in association with the provision of outdoor tables and chairs.<\/p> <p>  As we all are acutely aware, like many other sectors, the hospitality and restaurant sector and the wider tourism sector has suffered the brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic both last year and this year.  We want them to have a summer where they can make up for lost ground.  They have been subject to both temporary closure and long-term closures for considerable periods.  It has taken a very heavy toll on their own businesses and staff.  I, as Minister, and the Government are committed to providing any necessary supports to assist these sectors as much as is possible with a view to facilitating recovery as the current Covid-19 restrictions are further eased and lifted.  Big decisions are to be made this week with regard to the next phase from May onwards.<\/p> <p>  The two sets of planning regulations that I am presenting to the committee today, in conjunction with the third set of regulations that I have just mentioned on the provision of awnings and coverings, are practical measures that have merit, are within my remit, can be done and will help businesses.  There is, thankfully, light at the end of the tunnel and with the further expedited roll-out of the vaccination programme and continued business supports, we want to ensure that those in particular in the hospitality and the food sector have an opportunity to recover and that any potential barriers are removed particularly for the summer.  I propose that we then, later in the year, review these regulations further.  <\/p> <p>  There is one permanent change on awnings and coverings and, second, the extension of the takeaway provisions for restaurants which will allow that to continue until the end of the year, together with the waiving of the fee for street furniture across the country.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, I note that some local authorities have already done this which I welcome, but I want there to be no ambiguity across all of our local authority areas that businesses are not to be charged for street furniture and that there are now practical changes in the regulations.  Hopefully we will have a good summer and when businesses open back up again they will be able to utilise the public space that we all enjoy for the safe reopening of their businesses.

This goes hand in hand with those measures and it is entirely sensible.<\/p> <p>  I have one comment on the requirement now that one does not need to apply for planning permission for awnings and other structures as long as they are associated with a licensing application; I ask that care and consideration for protected structures is included in this also.<\/p> <p>  Do members wish to contribute on this?

I congratulate the initiative and the pro-business and pro-living nature of these measures, for the living of our lives in all of the areas and businesses that will be impacted by this.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of requests for consideration.  First, as to disabilities where we have street furniture now being used to a greater extent, I ask that we consider having some mechanism in place to ensure that we are not inhibiting in any way ease of access for people, particularly those in wheelchairs, or, where there is visual impairment.  We must be accommodating and give these requirements some consideration in terms of where we locate street furniture on the footpath left after its installation, if provision is not made out on the street, as has been very sensibly done in Dublin city.  We need to consider ease of access for people to ensure they are able to sit if there are raised plinths or some such feature.<\/p><p> If we learned anything from \"Claire Byrne Live\" on RT&Eacute; last night it is the level of waste.  I would certainly be in favour of considering the added cost and added services that will be required if we allow continuity of takeaway, which is eminently sensible, to ensure that we are maximising the potential covers in sales for restaurants.  At the same time, if there is an associated waste we should make provision for being pragmatic, in the words of Councillor James Geoghegan last night, in how we address that.  We should take the dual approach of, ideally, educating people to bring home their waste but also putting in place adequate bins and ensuring we have that complementary provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#A01000","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":893,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  We were all heartened watching the scenes of the opening up of a variety of outdoor activities and certain sports yesterday, particularly for younger people and children.  That is giving people the sense that we are near the exit, which is to be welcomed.  Citizens, residents and businesses have had a hard number of months and anything we can do collectively as an Oireachtas to ensure we make the transition back to some level of normality as easy as possible is to be welcomed.  I fully support the two propositions.  I have some questions and I ask the Minister to come back on them in his r&eacute;sum&eacute; at the end.<\/p> <p>  Can the Minister clarify the timelines for the extensions about which he is talking?  With respect to the takeaways, can he confirm that the regulations are only for existing, operating and licensed restaurants, as opposed to new businesses that are looking to establish themselves?  Regarding street furniture, while local authorities will not be charging for that, there is obviously a cost involved.  I ask the Minister to outline what the Department is going to do to support the local authorities to address any costs incurred and any revenue lost.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions about awnings and coverings.  First, when does Minister intend to lay those regulations before the Oireachtas?  Second, some of our villages, and particularly urban villages, have much more stringent planning rules about street signage and signage on buildings.  How is the Minister going to deal with the interaction of those rules?  Those of us from Dublin Mid-West will know that Lucan, for example, has very strict rules about what people can and cannot do.  Is the Minister designing these regulations in a way that will remove the requirement for planning permissions while at the same time ensuring that is restricted where there is a certain heritage element or planning restriction in a given area, so as not to change the heritage character of said village?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#B00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":894,"content":"<p>I will start by paying tribute to my colleague, Eoghan Murphy, who was my director of elections in the by-election in 2019.

He was an exceptional Minister who had a fantastic record of engaging with all people on all sides of the Houses at this committee.  I also thank his staff because sometimes we forget it is the staff who serve the Minister and provide support.  They were a formidable team and I want to record my sincere thanks.  One of the great things about this is that there is life after politics.  Many people come into politics with a lot of experience but they go out with another set of experiences.  I wish him well in whatever he does because he is a gentleman.  He was diligent in his work and was always respectful of difference even if we had difference of opinion.  It is important that we put that on record.  I again welcome the Minister and I would apply the same principles and considerations to him and his staff.  I wish him well in what is a challenging job.<\/p> <p>  I have one main concern in respect of this matter, about which people will have known over the past few days.  I happen to live out in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I went around with shame on Sunday morning and took 22 photographs, which I sent to my local authority.  What disappointed me more than ever was that the streets were full of bottles, human faeces and urine.  The evidence was clear everywhere.  There are no public toilets.  We have public toilets within the local authority area that have been locked up for years.  People are consuming large volumes of food and alcohol.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire - and I want to be specific because that is where I live and have worked and that is where I know best - we have bye-laws that do not permit any citizen to consume alcohol in a public place.  Those laws have not been suspended.  The elected members of the council took that decision and have continued to keep that stipulation in place.  Therefore, we need clarity.  If we are to have outdoor tables and so on, of which I am supportive, we need absolute clarity that the Department and council officials will be empowered to support the elected members who seek to uphold bye-laws.  We talk about giving power to local councils and communities but if they put bye-laws in place and the establishment does not support the elected members in seeing those bye-laws through, there is a deficit.<\/p> <p>  I welcome having more outside trade and I welcome the development of the public realm.  I would go so far as to say that that development should not only be temporary.  We could see the potential of keeping some of these public spaces, subject to proper planning and regulations.<\/p> <p>  I also want the Minister to bear in mind the people who are disabled, the visually impaired and the problems they encounter on some of the many narrow footpaths there are, particularly in areas of architectural conservation and small heritage villages, of which we have many in the north and south of Dublin and all over the country.<\/p> <p>  I support what the Minister is trying to do but we need to give councils resources to clean up.  Great credit is due to the staff and the grounds maintenance people in local councils who are out there in Bray, on the seafront, Seapoint, Galway, Donegal and Fingal.  They are the people who have to get out at 6 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and clean up this absolute filth, dirt and rubbish that is dumped.  There is a price.  We can talk about greening and recycling and the responsibility of our citizens but that is not happening.  It is not the Minister&rsquo;s problem or my problem but we need extra resources for the council staff.  We have to acknowledge that they may need additional staff on a temporary basis to deal with the cleaning up of these areas.  Ultimately, we have to make the traders and owners of these businesses responsible because while they are rightly gaining and profiteering from their businesses, they also have to be involved in the cleaning up of this mess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#B00400","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":896,"content":"<p>Three more members are indicating so I ask everyone to keep their contributions as brief as possible because we have further items on agenda with which we have to deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#B00500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":897,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for coming in.  I apologise for being late.  I was in my office and thought we were having this meeting on Teams.  I would have hated to miss the party.<\/p> <p>  I pay tribute to the former Minister, Eoghan Murphy.  I served with him on Dublin City Council and while I disagreed with his politics, I always admired his energy, commitment and enthusiasm for the role.  I wish him well.  He is a bright and capable person and I hope he has much success after politics.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister for these proposals and amendments.  He is true to form.  He has supported businesses during this pandemic through the local authorities.  The decisions and proposals he is making are pragmatic.  My understanding is that while the Minister is waiving the fees, he is not abolishing the process by which businesses have to apply for the permissions.  It is important that that is understood by both the businesses and the local communities.<\/p> <p>  The issues that have been raised in respect of mobility and access are very important.  The Minister knows this and does not need any of us to tell him.  There is a valid point to be made that, while we are supporting businesses with the waivers and the Minister is supporting them by allowing them to operate a takeaway service, those businesses need to take responsibility for the waste that has been generated from those takeaway services.  Public space has never been more valuable in the city and around the country.<\/p><p>Our public spaces are there for all of us to enjoy but we must all protect them.  I urge the Minister, through the local authorities and their offices, to communicate with the businesses that are benefiting from the rates waiver and to actively encourage them to engage in responsible packaging and clean-up.  I also urge the Minister to ask the local authorities to review their cleaning schedules for our public places.  The schedule of once a week, or once every 12 weeks as it is in some residential and more suburban areas of Dublin, is not sufficient in Covid times.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could take those issues up with the local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#B00600","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":899,"content":"<p>I would like to support the amendments that are coming today.  It is a time when we need to support local businesses and to do everything we can.  It is only part of the issue.  A few members have touched on the fact the whole issue consists of providing the local authorities with resources for extra staff and bins and for more collections.  I was in Cork city centre last Saturday night and there was a fabulous atmosphere in there.  The business community has done its part and the city council is trying to work with it but it needs more resources to make this work.<\/p> <p>  Cork City Council has implemented a great initiative in closing off a lot of the streets to have more on-street dining, which was a tremendous success last summer.  The side effect of that last year was that it moved disabled parking spaces from where they were on these streets to peripheral streets.  All that was done in the majority of cases was to just paint a disabled parking sign.  That is not good enough.  There are areas in Cork city that have had disabled parking spaces that people cannot access because when they open their doors, it is onto a main road, and there are other examples affecting such people and others with limited mobility.  This is not acceptable for Cork City Council or any local authority.  The local authorities need the resources.  We welcome the initiative.  On-street dining is a good thing and we want to support businesses but we have to make it accessible to all.<\/p> <p>  I have raised the following issue a number of times in the D&aacute;il.  There is a plan to carry out walkability audits for all local authorities.  I asked Cork City Council if it would carry out a walkability audit in Cork but the problem is there are no resources to do it.  I do not see why people with disabilities must always campaign and fight to get things that every citizen is entitled to, accessibility being one of them.  They have the same rights as everyone else.  We welcome the amendments today but this is only part of the issue.  The whole issue is that of disability.  As other members have mentioned, everyone needs to have the same rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#C00200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":900,"content":"<p>I am anxious to move on to the votes on the affordable housing Bill so I will keep my comments to welcoming the amendments, which are positive.  I might forward the Minister a copy of the Dublin City Council caf&eacute;s and restaurants working group report from 2015, which looked at this area long before Covid.  It examined the positive impacts of the passive policing elements of having street furniture and so on.<\/p> <p>  One issue the Minister might look at between now and the end of the year when these amendments will lapse is fully devolving this responsibility to local authorities.  A Minister should not be setting the fees for tables and chairs in each local authority.  That is a power we could give to local authorities to allow them to be more nimble.  In places like Glasnevin, where we want to encourage the use of tables and chairs and where we do not have the same demand, we could have a different policy than we might have on Grafton Street or O'Connell Street.  This is an area where we could enhance local government over time if the right consideration is given to it.

I will be as brief as possible and any items I do not get to I can return to.  I thank members for their support for these measures.  They are practical and they will help.  There are other issues that have rightly been raised but I will deal with specific questions about the extension of the two regulations.<\/p> <p>  The extension of the takeaway provision and the waiver is until the end of 2021.  Senator Fitzpatrick has rightly said we are not waiving the process, just the fee.  It means the appropriateness of a set of tables and chairs or awnings would be a matter, under the licensing arrangement, for each local authority to decide upon.  I had asked them about this and I will be issuing a circular next week to every local authority.  I want them to be expeditious in their turnaround of applications as we need to get ready for the summer and the reopening of outdoor dining.  I will be saying clearly to all 31 local authorities that this should be treated as a matter of priority but it is only in the areas where they are appropriate.<\/p> <p>  Access for those who have mobility impairments, disabilities and are blind has rightly been raised.  Senator Seery Kearney mentioned that at the start.  If it is not appropriate for a table and chairs to be put in a certain area, that permission will still not be given.  We have looked at this in detail.  I mention awnings and the question about protected structures.  That will bring the awnings to be a licensed activity.  If it is deemed that awnings are not appropriate for a certain type of building, the local authority will still be able to decide on that.  I know our heritage towns and some local authorities like Fingal County Council are already looking at a uniform nature of certain awnings in different towns and villages.  I would encourage that to be done.  Our local authorities have quite a deal of autonomy.  Already some of them have moved with the installation of parklets as well.  That happened last summer.<\/p> <p>  I mention disabled parking.  I am certain Deputy Gould has raised it with Cork City Council and I have seen other local authorities that have dealt with it in a different way.  Disabled parking bays cannot be removed in some local authorities and the same goes for the new age-friendly parking, which I welcome in my local authority area of Fingal.  It is question of what is appropriate and where it is appropriate for these to be taken in.<\/p> <p>  This is a different summer.  We all recognise the fact that most of the businesses in our hospitality sector, in particular our restaurants, caf&eacute;s or gourmet pubs, are family-run businesses.  Thankfully, a lot of them have been here for generations.  Any help that can be given to help them trade more easily should be given.  We have had in excess of &euro;900 million so far in rates waivers and there will be up to &euro;1.2 billion in such waivers by the time they are finished.  Let us remember we have given a 100% rebate to local authorities, even those local authorities that did not collect 100% of rates.  Local authority budgets have never been bigger.  There are vacancies in local authorities I want to see filled.  I believe in local government and it has performed incredibly well throughout the pandemic.  It has been the tip of the spear of the national response on the ground.<\/p> <p>  Litter is something I am actively looking at with regard to additional crews and the system of cleaning.  I saw the Phoenix Park, St. Anne's Park, Malahide Castle and all of our beauty spots last weekend.  A small number of people are engaging in disgusting behaviour and showing no responsibility.  They should take their litter home with them.  Even if the bins are full, they should not be packing them up.  Some of the stuff you see is awful and it is our staff who end up cleaning the mess of other people.  I ask people in general to be much more responsible.  I will be asking the local authorities to look at their cleaning schedules and the provision of temporary bins, particularly as we come into the summer months and the two bank holiday weekends in May and June when we know we tend to have more people congregating.<\/p> <p>  This is an opportunity for us, and we are doing it as a Government and some local authorities are doing it to great effect, to reimagine our public spaces and realms.  It is an opportunity to look at our roads and streets in a different way, to make them friendly for pedestrians, cyclists and families, to start moving the car away from the middle of our towns and villages, and to let people get back into those open spaces.<\/p> <p>  I know the Cathaoirleach has a lot of work on this morning.

Average rents in Dublin, for example, are &euro;1,700 per month for a standard two-bed.  In fact, in many parts of Dublin city, in particular, rents are now at &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,500.  Purchasing a home is becoming increasingly difficult for larger numbers of people, including young people on good incomes.  A recent report by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland showed that in terms of live apartment-building projects currently under way in Dublin, the all-in development and sales cost is now somewhere around &euro;400,000.  It is important to stress that it is not just first-time buyers who are being locked out of affordable housing.  Many Deputies and Senators are contacted regularly by people at a later stage in their career who, because of the loss of their family home arising from  repossession or a relationship breakdown, are also unable to buy.  This is particularly affecting single people.<\/p> <p>  The measures we are discussing today and, in particular, the way in which the serviced sites fund, which this amendment relates to, is used is really important because if the serviced sites fund is used in the correct way, it can deliver genuine affordability.  We can use it to assist our local authorities and approved housing bodies to deliver homes at prices people can actually afford.  However, the problem is that if we continue to repeat the mistakes of the past, and if we allow private developers to have access to this finance, the consequence will be twofold.  The purchasers will end up paying higher prices and in some cases large numbers of affordable purchasers will not be able to afford those properties.  Also, the taxpayer will be cross subsidising developers profit.<\/p> <p>  For clarity, in this instance, I am not talking about private building contractors.  Private building contractors build all public homes.  This amendment does not refer to that.  Nor am I talking about finance.  Almost all public housing is built with some form of borrowed finance, whether it be from Government borrowing, the Housing Finance Agency or other groups.  This is specifically about private developers.  <\/p> <p>  Briefly, I will give two recent examples of the impact bringing in private developers into affordable housing provision has had, which demonstrates why it does not make any sense.  In my constituency, South Dublin County Council had a significant piece of public land named the Kilcarbery estate.  Members of this committee who were previously with me on South Dublin County Council will know the estate very well.  There was a proposition to build approximately 1,000 houses on that site, consisting of social rental, affordable rental, and affordable purchase.  However, in their wisdom a majority of members of that council decided to sell that land to a private developer.  As a consequence of that the all-in development cost of those homes, which are currently commencing construction, has increased significantly.  For example, the cheapest discounted home on that land will retail for more than &euro;325,000, which is way beyond the affordability reach of many of the people were are trying to target with the serviced sites fund.<\/p> <p>  The example is one we all know, because we debated it at length in the House previously, namely, O'Devaney Gardens where Dublin City Council, under instruction from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, engaged in a lengthy competitive dialogue with private developers and eventually signed a deal with Bartra.  In this instance, they have access to the serviced sites fund and yet the all-in cost that will be paid for the affordable homes is &euro;360,000.  The buyer will pay &euro;310,000 but will ultimately have to pay the &euro;50,000 serviced sites fund amount back as well.<\/p> <p>  Compare that to what happens when one allows only the local authorities of the approved housing bodies sector to use the serviced sites fund.  Homes are developed by, for example, &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance, whereby the homes sell for between &euro;160,000 and &euro;200,000.  This is well below, in fact, &euro;60,000 less, than what is happening in Kilcarbery or in O'Devaney Gardens.<\/p> <p>  This amendment only refers to the serviced sites fund.  We will talk about cost rental later.  The amendment clearly states the only people who should have access to this fund in terms of the developer are not-for-profit agencies, local authorities, approved housing bodies, and community housing trusts.  The consequences of allowing private developers access to this funding is that it pushes up prices, it locks people out from being able to afford these homes and it has the taxpayer cross subsidising private developers very substantial level of profit, which is not a good use of taxpayers' money.  Therefore, I commend the amendment to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#D01400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":918,"content":"<p>In saying what I am saying, it is important to put context on it.  What we envisage is a mix of housing based on what is needed in any given area.  In most cases, the State will be required to develop 100% social and affordable housing, particularly in the Dublin area, which the Minister is on record as having said.  However, there may be areas in the country that have only had social housing built over the last decade.  What we need to do is to ensure there is a mix in a given area, so we do not have areas which are predominately or solely private, predominately or solely affordable or solely social.  It is important in the context of what I am saying is that we are seeking to achieve a mix of housing tenure in any given locality.  We have to be mindful of areas in the country where there has been only one tenure type built over the last number of years.<\/p> <p>  I suspect the wording in the amendment, which includes the words \"private\" and \"for-profit developers\", has been put in there for a reason.  It was put in there to create the impression that Government parties are in some way supportive of this method at the expense of the approved housing body, the housing co-op or the community housing model.  That is not the case and I want to make that clear.<\/p><p>If we are supportive of this amendment, we may inadvertently exclude low-return funds from entering the State in order to provide affordable housing.  That is a model replicated across Europe; Vienna is held up as an exemplar.  The committee cannot inadvertently put blocks in place that may prevent a mixture of housing types in a given area and tie one hand behind the State's back as it tries to deliver affordable housing.  That is why we cannot support this amendment.  It is not because of the impression that might be given that we are in some way supportive of private development.  <\/p><p> We need a mix in this country.  We need low-return funds to provide affordable housing so it is not solely the State.  We also have to be very cognisant of the fact that approved housing bodies are on the State's balance sheet.  We have to be mindful that we may be in a financial squeeze over the next number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#D01500","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":920,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I advise the committee that we will not support this amendment.  We are very anxious to conclude our business today.  We are trying to facilitate the completion of the report on the affordable housing Bill so that legislation can be introduced to start to address the housing crisis in a meaningful way, with the provision of affordable housing to rent and purchase by local authorities, approved housing bodies and not-for-profit organisations.<\/p> <p>  The political motivation behind this amendment is fairly clear but the reality is that the serviced site fund is set up under regulation.  It is a &euro;310 million fund dedicated to supporting the provision of affordable housing not for-profit housing.  The second criterion mentioned in this amendment is private developers.  It is a very broad term to use.  It is used, in this instance, to signal a certain political position but it excludes ethical, sustainable investors.  We are determined to use every mechanism to address this housing crisis, which is one of both supply and affordability.  On that basis, the Fianna F&aacute;il group will not support this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#E00200","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":921,"content":"<p>I will support this amendment.  I agree with previous speakers that a housing mix is very positive and should be encouraged.  I do not see an issue with this amendment in regard to that.  This is about whether we give public subsidies to private developers in delivering affordable housing and whether it is a good way to proceed if we want affordable housing.  This amendment does not preclude low-return funds and ethical investment in housing and affordable housing.  Currently, low-return investment funds and ethical funds are quite successfully investing in social and affordable housing through approved housing bodies.  If this amendment is passed, and followed through in the legislation, that would continue to be the practice.  The question is whether or not we give public subsidies to private developers.<\/p> <p>  As regards providing affordable housing at a rate people can genuinely afford in terms of their income, rather than a percentage discount off a full market rate, we need to ask whether private developers are good at delivering that.  Are private developers good at that, as opposed to private builders who can be contracted by approved housing bodies or local authorities?  The evidence, certainly to date, is that they are not.  They have a more costly form of delivery than approved housing bodies or local authorities.  <\/p> <p>  We can see that quite clearly in the example of the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance and what it is building which ranges from about &euro;160,000 to &euro;250,000.  Its houses are coming in at a significantly more affordable cost than those of private developers.  It is worth noting that &Oacute; Cualann contract private builders, but as a developer managing the project it has lower finance costs and lower risk margins.  While it takes a margin, which it uses to reinvest in its next project, its overall profit margin or reinvestment take is lower than private developers.  It is not just &Oacute; Cualann.  Approved housing bodies and, in general, local authorities, are more effective in terms of delivery.<\/p> <p>  There is the issue of the State balance sheet.  If we are serious about what needs to be invested in affordable and social housing, the only approach that can be taken is one where we are willing to break the EU fiscal rules.  This is in the context of such low interest rates, especially.  Other countries have done this in the past.  It is absolutely justifiable to break fiscal rules in the context of a housing and homeless crisis.  I have no issue with that at all.  Every party in the Oireachtas should support it.  I am strongly supportive of the European Union but there are countries in the EU flouting much more serious breaches in its fiscal rules and the rule of law.  There is no proper action being taken against them so we should have no fear in breaking those rules, if needs be, in addressing our housing and homeless emergency and investing in affordable and social housing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#E00300","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":922,"content":"<p>Deputies Duffy and Gould and Senator Boyhan are indicating.

It is why we are in the housing crisis.<\/p> <p>  Government policies, whether it is the enhanced leasing scheme, local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, excessive tax breaks for real estate investment vehicles or the shared equity loan scheme proposed by Fine Gael and either supported or facilitated through the abstention of Fianna F&aacute;il, say to private developers the Government will give them profit in exchange for development.  There is a cost to it and people need to be clear, which is why I raise it.<\/p> <p>  The cost is that it reduces the volume of affordable houses delivered and increases the cost.  I take Kilcarbery, in my constituency, as an example.  For a decade, we campaigned for Government to invest with South Dublin County Council to deliver 1,000 homes on the site.  Some 300 would have been social rental, approximately 300 would have been affordable rental and approximately 300 would have been affordable purchase.  It would have given the social mix Senator Cummins proposed, but Fine Gael would not fund it and instead the council was forced, if it wanted to develop the land, to sell it.<\/p> <p>  The consequence is we will have 30% social housing, which I welcome, but 70% of the homes on the site will be open market unaffordable.  If one takes O'Devaney Gardens as an example - none of the Deputies or Senators on the Government side addressed this point - the consequence of bringing in a private developer with the serviced sites fund is those homes are &euro;60,000 more expensive than if one restricted it to the approved housing body, local government or community housing trust sector.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the off balance sheet - Senator Cummins knows this - &Oacute; Cualann is the largest supplier of affordable homes with the serviced sites fund and they are off balance sheet.  One can have off balance sheet vehicles with this financing and, therefore, it is not an issue.  It is not the case this amendment would prevent ethical investors.  In fact, last week Cl&uacute;id Housing announced a deal with an ethical investor, a long-term, low-yield pension fund, for the delivery of more than 500 homes, so, again, it is absolutely not the case.  With respect to Deputy Duffy, the Land Development Agency, LDA, cannot access the serviced sites fund, so it does not apply this sense.<\/p> <p>  The central issue is whether or not we want to continue with the failed Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael housing policy of privilege and private developers using public money to cross-subsidise very significant profit while driving up the price of homes.<\/p> <p>  Senator Seery Kearney is wrong.  Supply, in and of itself, will not fix the problem.  The supply must be affordable which the Senator's Government has failed to take into account for the last number of years, so we either use the funding-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#F01100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":942,"content":"<p>It is a good summation.

Obviously it is related to No. 1 in the sense that I am arguing that the cost rental equity loan should not be available to private developers, and there are two key elements here to make that case.  The way cost rental works is twofold.  As members know, you look at the financing, development, management and maintenance costs of the unit and the idea is that whoever provides the unit has to get full cost recovery over a period of time.  However, you can make the rent more affordable if you structure the finance in such a way as to allow the full cost recovery to happen over a longer period of time, thus bringing down the entry level rents to an appropriate point.  This is really significant because the current cost rental schemes that are under development, including the Enniskerry Road cost rental pilot scheme, for example, will have rents of between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,300 per month.  Other cost rental projects in D&uacute;n Laoghaire could have rents of &euro;1,300 per month and, in Cork city, of &euro;900 per month.  That is going to cause a very significant problem for a large cohort of working people not eligible for social housing and for whom we would like to have cost rental as a viable option.  These are often workers who are just above the income threshold for social housing, and we know from very detailed research by the ESRI that they are people who do not experience significant levels of wage growth.  Therefore, the entry level rent of cost rental projects is really key if this is to be affordable.  Mr. Brendan Kenny, the director of housing at Dublin City Council and officials from the Department of Finance told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2019 that if the financing of this is structured correctly, we could bring entry level rents down to between &euro;700 and &euro;900 per month for a one, two or three-bedroom unit, which is substantially below what is currently being proposed as the guiding rent of about &euro;1,200 per month.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty with bringing in private developers is twofold.  First, it adds a significant additional layer of cost above the cost of financing, building, managing and maintaining because developers are required to have a 10% to 15% profit and risk margin.  That is an extra layer of cost that makes things more difficult.  That 10% to 15% cost margin is taken from four separate reports by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland of private sector development and it is a well-established principle.  There is a more significant consequence of bringing in private developers.  The key about cost rental is that once the financing loans are paid down, let us say over 20, 30 or 40 years, the accommodation generates a surplus.  It generates a revenue stream for the housing provider.  That is how, for example, the not-for-profit and voluntary sector providers in other European jurisdictions actually have a housing stock that is self-financing after a period of 20, 30 or 40 years.  The revenue surplus on the cost rental side helps providers to cross-subsidise social rental as well as to fund future stock.  The best way of delivering cost rental, whether it is through local authorities or other public agencies or not-for-profit entities, is to have social and cost rental units together and when the cost rental loans are paid down, the providers will benefit from the surplus.  Those of us here who have been councillors know the great difficulty our local authorities have had getting adequate resources from central government for the management and maintenance of social housing stock.  That is why they often have to opt for very expensive refurbishment projects and so on.<\/p> <p>  If we say that private developers can have access to the cost rental equity loan, what we are essentially doing is giving that revenue surplus, which would be about half of the rent that would be paid at that stage, permanently to the private sector at a future point in time.  In that way, we are denying the not-for-profit sector, particularly the local authorities but also the Land Development Agency, LDA, which I do not support, and the approved housing bodies, AHBs, access to that surplus.  Again, this will make the rents more expensive and will deny our local authorities and other not-for-profit providers access to a really valuable revenue stream into the future.  It is completely contrary to the logic of cost rental.  I am not aware of any jurisdiction where for-profit private developers deliver cost rental because the whole point is that it is meant to be about full cost recovery and is not profit driven.  I do not see why we should use taxpayers' money to deliver more expensive rental accommodation and cross-subsidise private developers indefinitely into the future when that funding could be used for more affordable accommodation to the benefit of our local authorities indefinitely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#G00800","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":968,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il will be opposing this proposal.

As with the serviced sites fund, funding can only be applied to affordable homes that are provided for purchase or rent.  The funding cannot be applied to for-profit housing.  I do not know exactly what is meant by for-profit, which is a really broad description.  I know what the Deputy is getting at when he uses the term but just in case anybody missed it, the LDA legislation and the affordable housing legislation that we are bringing forward are designed specifically to insert the State into the picture, using public lands to deliver affordable homes for purchase and rent and to increase our social housing stock.  That is what the aforementioned legislation is about, very simply, and this type of delaying tactic is very unhelpful.  It displays a complete disregard for everybody who is trapped by the housing crisis, for those on the social housing list and those whose family has broken down because of the inadequacy of their housing conditions.<\/p> <p>  We will not be supporting this proposal and I would urge the Chairman to call a vote on it as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#G00900","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":969,"content":"<p>The Green Party will not be supporting this proposal.

There will be a tendering process within which one invites contractors to tender to the agency to deliver the housing.  It will work with the best contractors to give the best price.

We are looking to attract special vehicles where there is a low return of 3% or 4%.  That is what builds houses across Europe.  If we are going to get party political about it, as was the case in the first debate on the first motion and if Sinn F&eacute;in wants to tie one hand behind the State's back to make sure we can only provide cost rental accommodation through AHBs or local authorities, it will do that and make sure we cannot scale up the model.  What matters with cost rental is the more units that are delivered over time, the more affordable those units become because they rise in line only with the consumer price index whereas the wider rental market is probably increasing at a higher rate if one looks at it over a ten, 20, 30 or 40-year period.  These cost rental properties will become more affordable for the tenants over time and Deputy &Oacute; Broin knows that.  To tie the State's hands is not what we should be doing here.  We should provide affordable homes and cost rental by any means possible.  Senator Boyhan said that he did not mind who provided housing.

We can disagree with those amendments, which is fine, but to suggest that we are tabling them for anything other than the reason that we believe they would improve the policy in the Bill is wrong.  I respect all members of this committee.  I might disagree profoundly with the policies they propose.  Coming into this committee and tabling these amendments is legitimate.  It is not, to quote Senator Fitzpatrick, a \"delaying tactic\".  In fact, we are making good progress.  For the record, I suggested in private session that I would be quite happy if we took these votes without debate to speed up the process but it was Government members who legitimately, and I have no objection to this, wanted to have this debate publicly.  They cannot then criticise us for wanting to have that debate.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Duffy, the LDA does not have access to this cost rental equity loan.  This is currently a loan for AHBs.  This is how it is designed and, therefore, his reference to the LDA is not factually correct.  The next point in respect of the 10% to 15% figure is really important because it seems some members on the Government side might misunderstand either my intention in tabling this motion or the way these funds will work.  When a private developer is developing, and private developers are a very clear entity, they are required both through their private financing and standard practice to have what is called a profit and margin line on their development of between 10% and 15%.  I am quite happy to send Senator Cummins the four SCSI reports that deal specifically with this.  The reports itemise that and they are from real live development projects over the past number of years for houses and apartments.  The consequence of that is that separate to the cost of finance, which members will also see as a line item in the SCSI reports, bringing in developers adds an extra 10% to 15%.  That is on top of the cost of the finance and other costs.  The key issue is that if we allow that to happen, entry rents would increase.  I have not heard a single member on the Government side respond to my key concern, which is a genuine concern, that opening the door to private developers accessing this scheme, as with the previous scheme, would push up prices.  We have real-life examples where that has happened.  When the row over O'Devaney Gardens was happening in Dublin City Council, there was a proposition that the local authority and an AHB should acquire at full market value additional properties from Bartra and rent them out as cost rental.  Any calculation of what rent repayment would look like over a 40 or 50-year period was &euro;1,600 to &euro;1,800 per month.  That is the consequence of bringing in a private developer.  Thankfully, so far, the Department has refused to fund that proposition because it is not affordable by any stretch of the imagination.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of scaling up, the reason we do not have cost rental accommodation in this State is Governments have refused to fund it.<\/p><p>It has been Government policy since 2014.

In fact, that has been our problem for too long.  It is that we are not providing the necessary funding in budget after budget to allow local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts, to deliver at scale.  That will still be the case even when this legislation passes.  Members have to make a decision.  Either they want to drive down the cost of renting or buying these units or they want to let in private developers to maximise profit at the expense of the taxpayer and make these units less affordable.

It is important that we have a definition linking it to indicators.  There are a number of different indicators.  I picked the CSO net income figure.  The CSO sometimes only does gross income.

One thing that we discussed at the committee was significant ESRI housing research which was published in summer 2018.  It asked a simple question, which is how many households not eligible for social housing support, including people who cannot get HAP, RAS or social housing, have high housing costs.  It did extensive research, going right back to 2002.  It looked at renters and owner-occupiers.  The findings of the survey were startling.  It found that, in general, about 30% of those households not eligible for social housing support have high housing costs.  That was defined by the ESRI as over 30% of take-home pay with some factors taking into account the ability to afford an ordinary basket of goods afterwards.  What was most startling about the survey is that in those two income deciles just above the income thresholds for social housing, 70% of those people had high housing costs, above 40% of take-home pay in many cases.  These are people who are in steady jobs but with low pay.  Sometimes there are one and a half or two incomes in a household.  They are people who, unless something dramatic changes, are unlikely to ever be able to purchase a home and obviously are not eligible for social housing.  We have to ensure that that group of people, who would be a main target cohort for affordable cost-rental, will be able to afford the rent that is being proposed.<\/p> <p>  The great difficulty at the moment is that some of the rental projects that have been proposed would be charging rent above that 30%, because there is no requirement to have a maximum level.  The best way to deliver cost-rental is to make it affordable cost-rental, with full cost recovery over the lifespan of the repayment of the loans.  The entry level rent should be affordable.  I think having affordable rents linked to a maximum of 30% of net income, if the Senator is willing to take that friendly amendment to insert the words \"a maximum of\" before \"30%\", would be eminently sensible.  If we do not do this and find some way of linking affordability with full cost recovery, which I think can be easily done, there will be a big group of people in between the thresholds for social housing and the actual price that is being charged who will be either locked out or have high housing costs.<\/p> <p>  Since the Government has repeatedly set itself against raising the thresholds for social housing eligibility, on the basis of the most recent oral questions we had with the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, we have to ensure these people get in.  Between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,300 a month is not affordable for large sections of people.  We need rents of between &euro;700 and &euro;900.  This amendment would ensure that that would be achieved, especially in local authority developments.

I understand the motivation behind it.  We are putting this legislation before the House for a reason, which is to have a significant intervention in the market to provide affordable purchase and affordable rental.  The programme for Government was put together to respond to the issues which Deputy Gould and other Deputies in this House, including the Minister, have spoken about over the past ten years.  Therefore, in order for us to have that intervention, we have to put forward legislation in these two significant policy areas, for affordable purchase, which we have discussed, and for affordable rental.  It is important that affordable rental is let out by affordable housing bodies and by the State, initially on balance sheet.  In order for us to provide a broad base of affordable properties in the State, provided through a public housing model, we have to scale up.<\/p> <p>  I believe that a full cost-recovery model is the key to affordable rental.  It is also the key to ensuring that the model can be scaled up so that affordable rental actually becomes the predominant rental model in the market.

Housing is either affordable or not affordable.  Affordability judged by what one has in one's pocket at the end of the day.<\/p> <p>  We must simplify and demystify the debate on housing.  Many people outside these Houses are bellyaching about their commitments to affordable housing.  They should be honest and keep it simple.  Affordability is about what one has as disposable income.  I consider 30% of net income to be a maximum. That is the key message about affordable purchase, rental or whatever scheme.  It is the one line that constantly resonates with people outside.  People talk about whether rents \"are linked to our income\".  Nothing is affordable if it is not based on net income.  This amendment is perhaps the strongest message that we can send out today.  It is something I wish to echo and hang on to, because it is simple and clear.  We need some clarity in this debate.  We must reflect on what the people outside understand by the term \"affordable\" and what they are calling for.  They are calling for equity, fairness and affordability.

In that sense, if we are opposing this recommendation for the Department to come up with a formula that defines affordability, we may as well rename this Bill the market discount Bill, because that is essentially what the Government side has argued.  Market discount is not necessarily affordability, and all the experts who came in to us described what that was.  This recommendation was to go to the Department to ask it to come up with a formula, and I thought that would have been a very reasonable assessment.  I am surprised the Government side is opposing it.  Fundamentally, this shows that the Government side is not concerned with affordability.  Rather, they are concerned with market discount and using market forces in order to shave a couple of euro off housing.<\/p> <p>  This should have been a straightforward amendment that was accepted, although I am not going to change their minds at this stage.  I would have been open to amendments such as that suggested by Deputy McAuliffe, because I think up to 35% is generally the agreed definition of affordability.  If they are willing to do that and reach a compromise, I would also be willing to move and reach a compromise.  However, I do not get the impression from the deliberate misunderstandings and the deliberate statements from the other side of the House in response to this that they are willing to reach a compromise.  It was very clearly communicated by both the ESRI and the National Economic and Social Council that it was a generally internationally recognised definition of affordability.

We have to find ways of delivering homes at prices that working people can genuinely afford, both to rent and particularly to buy.  The shared equity loans scheme does not do that and, therefore, should not, in my view, be called an affordable housing scheme and should not be included in this Bill.<\/p><p>It is significant to note that this is the one element of this Bill that was not under consideration and development by the outgoing Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and his departmental team.  Both cost rental and the serviced sites fund had a long gestation under the last Government and, in fact, no political party advocated a serviced sites fund during the general election of last year, when we all had different propositions around how to deliver affordable purchase homes.  The origin of this proposal lies in two documents that were developed by two industry lobby groups, Property Industry Ireland and Irish Institutional Property, which came and did a round of meetings with housing spokespeople between February and May 2020, after the general election, and I was one of those spokespeople.  Both of those lobby organisations had very well developed propositions and called on the Government to introduce a shared equity loan scheme based on, and similar to, a controversial and unsuccessful scheme that operates in Britain, and which they wanted the Government to do here.<\/p><p>It is very clear that the proposition the Minister is developing, because he has put so much of it into the public domain, albeit through leaks and unofficially, is based on these two lobby documents.  This is the clearest example I have seen in all of my time in the Oireachtas of private industry writing the policies of Government.  Because of that, it has proven very controversial.  We heard, for example, from the ESRI that it had very significant concerns about this scheme as it is currently proposed.  We received written correspondence from the Central Bank outlining, again, very significant concerns in terms of the scheme as it understands it.  The former Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in a freedom of information request that I received has widely criticised the scheme.  They are all saying the same thing.  They are all saying this is a demand-side scheme that will push up house prices at a time of limited supply.<\/p><p>Our problem at the moment, particularly in the context of Covid, is that supply is even more limited.  If it was sluggish before the pandemic and the closure of, and then restrictions on, construction activity, it is even more sluggish now.  What we are proposing is to put a pot of money into a fund that will allow hard-working people, desperate to own their own home, to take out a secondary loan, and that secondary loan will be used to buy unaffordable, overpriced houses up to &euro;400,000 in Dublin and lower prices elsewhere, according to the Minister.  There will also be an interest charge and that interest charge will be set at 15-year intervals and will increase over that time.  By my calculation, on the basis of the information that is in the public domain, if people were to take the full shared equity loan of &euro;100,000 on a property of &euro;400,000 in Dublin, by year 30, if they do not pay it down, and there is no obligation on them to pay it down and the Minister has given that commitment, they will have accumulated an additional &euro;50,000 of debt on top of whatever the increased equity value of that 25% stake is.<\/p><p>Thus a person could actually owe not &euro;100,000, not &euro;150,000 but &euro;175,000 or &euro;200,000.  What this is doing, therefore, is saddling hard-working people with a very high level of debt.  That is why there are a great many people in Fine Gael who are deeply uncomfortable with this scheme.  All the Fine Gael councillors on Dublin City Council called for it to be scrapped because it would push up house prices.  They wrote to the Minister and urged him to transfer the &euro;75 million of finance allocated for the budget this year into the two other funds we have just been discussing, namely, the serviced sites fund and the cost rental equity loan.  We also know from some of the coverage in the newspapers that within both the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance there are real concerns, shared by the respective Ministers, about what this scheme will do.<\/p><p> This being the case, I do not understand how anybody who says he or she wants to help working people buy their own home could support such a scheme.  If we look at the evidence from Britain, for example, it has pushed house prices in London up by 6%.  While it has led to an increase in supply, it did so on the English-Welsh border where houses are not needed.  The most independent research into that scheme from the London School of Economics has made it very clear that this is about putting money in the pockets of developers and pushing up house prices and it is putting working people at very significant risk of mortgage default and loss of property into the future.<\/p><p> The last thing I will say is that Fianna F&aacute;il has done this before.  The last shared ownership scheme, which members will remember, and which was closed by Fine Gael, was modelled on something similar.  It was a shared equity product where the cost of the equity and the interest charged increased over a period of time.  That meant people who bought into that shared equity scheme at the end of the Celtic tiger experienced a doubling of their mortgage repayments if they chose to pay it down over a decade and a half.  There was four times the level of mortgage default and mortgage arrears among that cohort of borrowers, when the crash hit its depth after 2010, than there was among regular borrowers.  This, therefore, is not affordable housing, and any Deputy who supports the shared equity scheme is not doing right by hard-working people.  He or she is saddling them with debt and pushing up house prices.  I cannot stand over it and that is why the amendment would delete all the recommendations in the report related to shared equity, it would call for the shared equity loan scheme to be removed from this Bill, and it would call for the &euro;75 million to be transferred to the cost rental and serviced sites funds for genuinely affordable homes.  If the Minister, when he has finalised the scheme and the Central Bank and European Commission have given their views, wants to introduce a separate Bill, let him come and defend that but he should not title it an affordable housing Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#L01400","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>The motion before us is seeking to reallocate the &euro;75 million that is going to support 3,000 couples, young families and individuals caught in the rental trap to own their own home.  There is planning permission for 40,000 housing units in Dublin alone but these approved plans are not being turned into homes fast enough.  We all agree on that.  This shared equity scheme will stimulate housing delivery by stimulating building on these approved sites, and by enabling the State to take a 30% stake in new homes, it will make those homes affordable to people who want to buy.  Therefore it is going to boost supply and increase affordability.<\/p> <p>  The Opposition is saying we do not know enough about the scheme yet, so we should scrap it, but let us look at what we do know.  We know there is no charge on 30% for the first five years and we know that there is no onus to pay off the 30% until, or indeed if, the house is sold.  We know this will enable people to afford their own home, and that is the main difference between what the Government is proposing and what Sinn F&eacute;in is advocating for.  We want people to be able to own their own home and to sell it at market value to whoever they want.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s housing plan means people would be able to buy a home in a public housing estate if they earn a certain amount under a threshold but they cannot buy the land it is on so they could not sell it on to whoever they want.  They would have no freehold.

They will not be saddled with it.  Nobody is going to come with a gun, put it to their head and tell them to take out this loan.  It is an option.  It is giving people who are paying more money in rent than they would on a mortgage the opportunity to afford their own home.<\/p> <p>  We completely agree that this is not the definition of affordable housing.

On that, we have heard from the ESRI, the Central Bank and senior officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who have expressed concern that this will increase demand and prices rather than supply.  We know from the UK what happened after a similar scheme was introduced, namely, that in the more than four years since the scheme was introduced there, the share prices of the main construction companies that availed of the scheme increased by 230% over the period.  We know from looking at the price of homes availed of under this scheme that, if we take the east midlands as an example, while the average first-time buyer bought a home for &pound;157,000, homes sold under this scheme were going for an average of &pound;235,000.  In the north east of England, the average first-time buyer was buying in at &pound;109,000 whereas the average home sold under this scheme was at &pound;182,000.  Thus we know from the UK that this has pushed prices up.<\/p> <p>  We have a history of subsidies and tax breaks which developers have availed of and which have pushed up prices and had very serious consequences.  We also know we already have an issue with house prices in Ireland.  Prices are increasing here at the moment.

We have the second highest house prices in the EU if one looks at it in terms of square metres and we are being warned this measure is going to increase those prices again.

I understand the committee wishes to focus upon the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2019 and, in particular, the potential legislative provision for the use of e-scooters.  To assist me in dealing with the committee's subsequent questions, I am joined by Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO with the authority.<\/p> <p>  The authority recognises that e-scooters and e-bikes can contribute to the increased use of sustainable transport and provide an alternative to the private car mode.  However, these new forms of transport do give rise to new issues that require careful consideration in developing an appropriate legislative framework.  Some of the issues that are relevant to those considerations include the quality of road surfaces, given the small wheel diameter of e-scooters and the more significant implications of road surface defects for e-scooters than for other vehicles; minimum age requirements for the use of e-scooters on public roads; whether certain safety equipment such as helmets should be mandatory or discretionary; the speed limitations that should apply to such vehicles; whether e-scooters should be required to use cycle tracks instead of the main carriageway where such cycle tracks are provided; and the types of roads and specific traffic lanes that e-scooters should be permitted to use.<\/p> <p>  Many of these issues involve balancing competing demands and seeking to achieve the optimal equilibrium in respect of those demands.  This is particularly so when road space is constrained and perfect solutions such as separate facilities for e-scooters are simply not feasible.  However, in carefully addressing the relevant considerations, an appropriate legislative framework can be put in place to support the operation of this new form of micro-mobility.  That concludes my introductory statement.  I trust that I can answer any queries that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Graham for being so concise.

I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend today.  I am joined by my colleagues, Pat Maher, director of network management, and Dr. Suzanne Meade of TII&rsquo;s road safety section.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the committee is undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2019.  The section of the general scheme specific to TII is in Part 6, which relates to making provision for variable speed limits.  I will first describe the work that TII is undertaking in this area and I will then go on to set out what is required in the Bill to support this work.<\/p> <p>  Since 2014, TII has been developing, and is currently constructing, a project on the M50 referred to as enhanced motorway operation service, eMOS.  This project will allow for the availability of lanes and the applicable speed limits of relevant stretches of roads to be controlled in a dynamic way.  This system of motorway control will improve safety and efficiency and reduce environmental impacts of traffic.  We think of this as dynamic traffic management.<\/p> <p>  The eMOS system is needed to address the increasing numbers of collisions and levels of congestion on the M50.  In 2019, M50 operations crews attended 1,161 incidents, which represents an average of 22 incidents each week of the year.  The M50 is congested.  In 2019, an average of 350,000 trips were undertaken on the M50 each day.  This represents an increase of 40% on 2011 figures.  The objective of eMOS is to improve safety for both road users and the people who respond to collisions and other incidents on the M50.  This improvement in safety will be achieved by establishing speed limits that are appropriate to the traffic and weather conditions and by closing lanes when required.  This level of control will also contribute to a reduction of carbon and particulate matter emissions through the elimination of \"stop-start\" driving.<\/p> <p>  The eMOS project has a budget of &euro;80 million and a benefit-to-cost ratio of 2.8:1.  The business case for the project has been reviewed and in accordance with the public spending code and has received ministerial approval.approved <\/p> <p>  Implementing eMOS involves the installation of 380 dynamic lane control signs on 98 gantries over 38 km of the M50.  Fibreoptic cabling, connecting to roadside weather stations and traffic sensors, will transmit information to computers at the TII&rsquo;s motorway control centre.  These computers will continuously run algorithms to determine the appropriate speed required to achieve the safest and most efficient operating conditions for those 350,000 trips undertaken on the M50 every day.<\/p> <p>  This dynamic speed limit and lane control system is used on motorways in the UK, in continental Europe and in North America on the approaches to major cities.  The M25 around London, the M6-M40-M42 Birmingham box and the motorways of the Netherlands are good examples.  These systems are reliable and have provided significant improvements to the safety and emissions performance of those roads.<\/p> <p>  Work on construction of the required infrastructure has been ongoing, almost entirely at night, for the past two years.  Work on this project relates to critical transport infrastructure.  TII personnel and contractors have worked continuously throughout the Covid-19 restrictions.  I will take this opportunity to acknowledge their work and, in particular, to thank the foreign specialist workers who have observed all quarantine restrictions and, as a consequence, have been away from their families for periods longer than initially planned for.  The work of construction and installation has progressed well and the system will be capable of going live by October of this year.<\/p><p> In the context of the Bill, what is required to support this work?  The setting of speed limits is a reserve function of local authorities.  The M50 motorway passes through the administrative areas of the four Dublin local authorities.  It is not feasible to seek the approval of each local authority to dynamically set and revise speed limit zones in response to rapidly changing traffic or weather conditions.  TII is not a road authority for this purpose and does not have powers to set speed limits on national roads.  The Bill must provide TII with those powers.  The Bill must also provide it with the ability to close lanes when needed.<\/p><p> The power of TII to provide, manage and operate the eMOS system needs to be clear.  A legislative framework that allows the system to be deployed and enforced in a practical and effective manner is required.  The legislation must reflect the dynamic nature of the system.  Speed limits will be set by the motorway control centre based on the outputs from the system, which will take into account a wide range of factors, including the computer analysis of weather and traffic conditions.  The motorway control centre staff must also be empowered to restrict the availability of traffic lanes through the use of red X and lane divert arrows displayed on over-lane digital signage.  This is required to improve the safety of road users, emergency services personnel and road workers.<\/p><p> This system will only be as good as the enforcement relating to it.  TII recommends that the approach reflected elsewhere in the Road Traffic Acts regarding the correctness of equipment should be applied in respect of this system.  There should be a presumption, capable of being rebutted in court, that the system is working correctly in the context of a prosecution.<\/p><p> The conclusion of the committee's work in the context of the pre-legislative scrutiny relating to this Bill will go a long way towards providing the legislative framework required to allow this project to deliver the benefits that it is capable of.  I invite all members who might be interested in seeing how the system is intended to operate to view a demonstration of the system if that would be of assistance to their considerations of this important legislation.  I am happy to attempt to answer any questions that the committee may have.  If my colleagues or I cannot provide a comprehensive answer today, I will provide a response as soon as practicable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>I am here in Leinster House.

We spent many months talking about road haulage but the reality is that over the past 18 months, e-scooters have become an increasing feature on our roads.  The first time I saw one was probably about two years ago in Dublin.  It was a head-turner and a novelty factor but suddenly they are everywhere.  Another form of transport, if we can call it that, is probably less official than the e-scooter.  Hoverboards are being used by teenagers and young people quite a lot.  They may not be as formal in terms of a mode of transport but they are certainly being used by some children going from friends' houses to the local shop or even to school.  They should not be omitted from our discussions.<\/p> <p>  I read the briefing note.  It is quite interesting how this is being regulated in different countries.  The first thing we need to look at is some kind of age limit.  In some continental European countries, a person must be 14 to 16 years of age to operate an e-scooter.  They are great.  We have seen people be able to travel independently of their parents in and around their communities.  However, there are hazards associated with them.  A person needs to be a certain age to have the level of responsibility necessary to take these vehicles out on the open road or cross busy intersections.  Anything that brings about regulation in that regard is good.<\/p> <p>  Something that falls under different road usage is sulky racing.  This is a big feature throughout Ireland.  We are being told that section 47 of the Roads Act 1993 regulates the use of carriage driving and horse racing on open roads yet the reality is that throughout the country, including my constituency, every so often, four or five pick-up vans or jeeps barricade a motorway going four or five vehicles wide, set up a racecourse in front of all the traffic, hold all the traffic behind them and have lucrative and heavily betted on races on these motorways.  A message needs to be sent.  This is something this committee needs to do a bit of work on.  Deputy Mattie McGrath tried to bring in tighter legislation on this two years ago.  It is another abuse of our roads that this committee needs to look at.<\/p> <p>  I have followed the issue of dynamic speed limits with interest.  I hope I am being accurate but a major flaw in our speed limit system is the fact that local authorities get to review speed limits every five years.  This is a source of significant frustration for communities and the politicians who represent them.  It needs to be somewhat more fluid.  As politicians, we are continuously lobbied by schools or housing estates that are located in areas which, for one reason or another, have become unsafe and they want the speed limit lowered but that has to be agreed by council engineers and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The window relating to carrying out review in that regard is every five years.<\/p> <p>  We were informed recently that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a hugely impressive plan for Lough Dearg, with funding of more than &euro;70 million for enhancements.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland stated that by means of co-operation with the NTA, there would be an enhanced Local Link bus route around the shores of Lough Dearg taking in the Clare and Tipperary sides with a stop in Portumna in Galway.  Could Ms Graham provide an update on that?<\/p> <p>  We have been discussing motorway safety.  One major road safety hazard on motorways that I know of - other representatives from Clare might want to speak about - is the N18 junction exit for Barefield.  Motorist travel on a motorway at 120 km per hour, with some even exceeding that speed, and suddenly they must come off it at a 60&deg; angle and onto the off-ramp for the Barefield exit.  It is so sharp.  Cars have lost control there.  This also needs to be in the mix.  Yes, we should be talking about dynamic speed limits and enhanced speed regulation coming into Dublin, which is the biggest arterial route in the country, but we also need a focus on that junction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#C00400","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>Which person does the Deputy wish to answer questions first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#C00500","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>I rambled on a bit but could Ms Graham respond concerning the Lough Derg initiative and could Mr. Walsh tell me whether exits from motorways are under review?

Has Ms Graham given any thought to what recommendation she might make on an age limit for the use of e-scooters and e-bikes?  Is the NTA looking into what is being done on age limits in other European jurisdictions and globally?  Obviously, people need to be of a responsible age to be using these types of vehicles.  Has the NTA done any review of what the speed limit should be for electric vehicles in general?  They are very low to the ground and concerns have been raised regarding the impact of the quality of road conditions.  If a user were to hit a bump travelling at a particular speed, he or she could end up in great difficulty.  Injury or possibly even the loss of life might arise from using the vehicle irresponsibly.  What are the witnesses' views in this regard?<\/p> <p>  We see people using these vehicles on a regular basis on the streets of Dublin.  Their use is not strictly confined to cycle lanes.  Would the witnesses recommend that these devices be used only in cycle lanes, or should they be permitted on open roads?  Should they be limited, for example, to a particular classification of roads in urban areas?<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Wash for his presentation.  I welcome his practical suggestion that TFI would invite the members of the committee to look at the eMOS system.  It seems we are only catching up with other European jurisdictions in implementing this type of technology.  It seems to be very complex.  What type of driver education does TFI intend to introduce around what looks like a fundamental and dramatic change in how the M50 will be used?  High-tech, cutting-edge technology will be employed to deliver the new system, with speed limits changing based on volumes of traffic, weather and so on.  For someone who travels to Dublin occasionally but not on a regular basis, it could be a real culture shock to find that parts of the M50 have a limit of 100 km per hour or 80 km per hour instead of 120 km per hour.

It takes in a lot of factors.  The easiest way to illustrate it is that currently, during congested conditions, a trip from the M1 to the M11 in uncongested conditions takes 22 to 24 minutes.  In congested conditions it can take in excess of 70 minutes, three times as long.  An awful lot of stop-start driving is occurring.  It has been demonstrated on many road networks that if we can achieve continuous driving at an appropriate speed, many benefits can be gained, including a reduction in accidents because there are not the varying speeds across all the road users and there is a much better result in air quality in both carbon emissions and particulate matter.  We have curves on the performance of internal combustion engines.  At higher speeds, the curve is relatively flat, a minor change in operating speed at 100 km\/h has very little difference for particulate matter or carbon emissions but at lower speeds, when going from below 10 km\/h or 20 km\/h, it is a much steeper curve.  There will be benefits from that.  If the committee wishes to see the business case, we can provide it.  It enumerates all these things.<\/p> <p>  On the concerns from the UK committee and smart motorways, it is a different issue.  As the Deputy points out, it is the all-lane running and the dangers to two road users in the event of them having a breakdown.  We are not introducing all-lane running.  We are conscious of the safety concern.  <\/p> <p>  We agree about information and clarity.

I understand that the proposals are for cycle lanes and bus lanes only.  Do Ms Graham and Mr. Creegan have an opinion on road conditions and how they should be considered?

We believe that a case could be made for e-scooters to be used on low-speed local roads up to 30 km\/h, not just to confine them to cycle lanes and bus lanes.  We have made the point that road condition is something to be considered, not just for e-scooters but also cyclists who tend to cycle on the edge of the road where there is the potential for gullies and the like.  That is why in a move to provide better infrastructure for cyclists, it could also provide better infrastructure for e-scooters.  Our preference would be, where possible, that where there is a cycle track alongside a bus lane, that the bus lane would be reserved for buses only and the cycle lane is for cyclists and e-scooters, if they are provided for in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>Has the NTA made a recommendation on personal helmets and protective equipment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#F00100","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":1096,"content":"<p>We have said that the wearing of helmets should be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1097,"content":"<p>The NTA has not recommended that it be mandatory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#F00300","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":1098,"content":"<p>We have said that it should be considered, given the speed associated with e-scooters and the vulnerability of persons on a road with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>That is fair enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#F00500","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>We will move to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#F00600","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1101,"content":"<p>Is it not a Fine Gael slot?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#F00700","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1102,"content":"<p>My apologies.

In some locations, a bus can only travel at the speed of the cyclist it is behind because there is not enough space for them to operate side by side.

That is the easiest way of looking at it.  The purpose of analysing flows is to enable continuous smooth flow.  That is what will determine the appropriate speed limit to be applied at a particular time.  The Senator is absolutely right that the proximity of junctions on the M50 contributes to those circumstances we are trying to dynamically control.  One of the things we have seen recently is that, when traffic volumes on the M50 dropped due to the Covid restrictions, there was a disproportionate drop in the number of accidents on the motorway.  This is proof positive that, as congestion levels rise, there is a disproportionate rise in the number of accidents and incidents on the motorway.  We need to deal with this.  The causes are the volumes of traffic and the weaving required because of the close proximity of junctions on that particular stretch of road.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.  It is not our intention at the moment to roll this system out to other sections of the network.

I have a couple of questions, following on from the information given, particularly that given by Mr. Walsh.  This variable speed limit proposal is very interesting.  There would be both positive and negative consequences to it.  This is being implemented on the M50 and will probably end up operating on the M1 and in Cork on the N40 in Senator Buttimer's constituency and on the N25 in my own.  These are highly congested motorways and dual carriageways on which this technology will probably eventually become commonplace.  Is it a two-way street in the sense that the limit on different sections of roads such as the M50, which will be empty at 11 p.m. or 12 midnight, might be increased from 80 km\/h up to 100 km\/h or from 100 km\/h to 120 km\/h  at those times, given that it is a motorway grade road?<\/p> <p>  Everybody who comes up to Leinster House from the south of the country will know, and others listening today will also know from travelling to matches or going to Dublin or elsewhere in the country via the N7 whether for business or pleasure, that the section of the road beyond Naas and up towards Citywest has a speed limit of 100 km\/h rather than 120 km\/h.  Some people who work in transport whom I have asked have told me that the reason for this is that this section is not technically motorway.  My response to this is that the limit on the N25 in Cork between Carrigtwohill and Dunkettle, which is a national road and a dual carriageway, is 120 km\/h.  I will put that question to Mr. Walsh first.  Is it a two-way street or is this just another way of slowing cars down and reducing speed limits, which obviously reduces the efficiency of the national road network and which could damage the economy with regard to people driving small goods vehicles and so on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#G01600","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>I am glad the Deputy raised this question because it illustrates a misconception as to what we are implementing.  The system only imposes a lowered speed limit when congestion or weather conditions require it.  At all other times, the default speed limit will apply - 100 km\/h, 120 km\/h or whatever the current design speed or speed limit on that road is.  Reduced speed limits will not be introduced at times when the congestion or weather conditions do not require them.  I hope that is clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#G01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1143,"content":"<p>In response to that, I do not believe it is a bad suggestion.  It definitely might be worth looking at.  Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting many taxi drivers from around the country.  Many members of the committee were on that call.  One particular concern for many of them were the new changes to speed limits in Dublin.  This is of great concern to them because, obviously, when one is a taxi driver or operating a hackney service, time is of the essence.  If we are to install this multimillion euro software to control speed limits, we should consider increasing the limit from 100 km\/h to 120 km\/h in a safe manner at night on roads that are capable of allowing for such a speed limit, which is the same limit as prevails across the entire national motorway network with the exception of the M50 and the N7, which is classified as a national road.  That is a suggestion I would like to put forward.  It would be wise to consider it now while work is ongoing.  I will finish with Mr. Walsh on that point.<\/p> <p>  It is great to have Ms Graham here again.  I know there is a lot going on in the NTA at the minute with regard to sustainable travel.  I thank her for meeting me recently.  With regard to the changes coming down the line in respect of e-scooters, we have all been contacted by people who work in this industry and hope to get involved in e-scooters from an economic standpoint.  I have a concern with regard to road safety.  As the CEO of the NTA, is Ms Graham confident that the RSA's current curriculum for new drivers coming on to the road in Ireland is at the standard required to ensure the safety of people operating e-scooters, or propelled vehicles as I believe they are currently described by the Department of Transport?  Does it need to be changed to reflect these coming changes?  I will give my own perspective in the time I have.  Compared to many on this call, it is only recently that I secured my full licence.  We have to do an awful lot more to teach drivers how to share the road with people who are cycling or using e-scooters.  The number of people utilising sustainable travel is booming.  I refer to cycling and the use of other devices.  From my recollection, there was very little on the driver training curriculum at the time I was doing my driving test with regard to sharing roads, particularly in densely populated urban areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#G01800","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.

People can see the collegiality with which the committee operates.<\/p> <p>  I will start with Mr. Peter Walsh.  On some level with eMOS there is probably an element of being won over in the sense of a variable speed limit.  There is not much point in asking the TII representatives whether this will be reviewed in the sense that this will be on the basis of minute by minute and hour by hour.  This will be reviewed on every timeline from the point of view of producing best results in real time.  We have all been on the M50 when it has been in free flow and when it has been a car park.  Obviously, if there were applicability to other serious parts of infrastructure in future, it is something that will come and that needs to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  There is an element of this that relates to the providers.  The TII representatives mentioned algorithms that will be operated for best-case scenarios.  There might even be some artificial intelligence and learning so that what works one day is improved for the next day.  I am seeking an answer in respect of providers and whether they have been tried and tested in doing work like this previously.  I am keen to ensure we get the best bang for our buck.  There have been various difficulties at times with State procurement of IT systems and we should try to avoid that.<\/p> <p>  The TII representatives might have to reply to me in writing in answer to another question.  It has nothing to do with this topic and I apologise for that.  The issue was brought up to me by National Broadband Ireland, NBI, and Eir.  It relates to TII and local authorities when they deal with infrastructure.  One example is when there is a plan put in place for poles.  Then, site investigation forces a change and there is a requirement for a new road opening licence.  That can involve a delay of between two to eight weeks at times.  Obviously, that can be significant.  Could this be streamlined to a degree?  At this stage I would like to think that even the Department of Transport has had communication with TII on the matter.  I am talking about where planning permission is signed off in the end.  It is simply that we do not need necessary works being held up, especially as regards the roll-out of broadband and communication systems.

The tenderers involved were all highly experienced people and included service providers and software developers and operators across Europe and North America.  I am satisfied that their expertise and competency in this matter is well-proven.  Mr. Walsh outlined the approach earlier.

We are part of the process involving the road management office, RMO, which was the office set up by the Department of Transport to deal with road opening licences generally.  I am aware that there have been certain issues in respect of changes and consequential delays due to the process involved in issuing updated approvals.  My understanding is that, insofar as this affected a particular section of national road, the matter was resolved expeditiously.

We are also aware that perhaps a change in travel patterns might result post-Covid.  We are open to being able to provide a more flexible ticket.  There are three main issues.  One is that a technology change will be required.  It will have to be developed significantly to provide a particular type of ticket.  The idea is to provide something other than the structured monthly and annual tickets.  The idea is a replacement for those given that people may only be travelling for two or three days per week rather than the full five days.  They will not get value out of their monthly or annual tickets in the new environment.  Technology development has to take place.<\/p><p> The other issue is that the monthlies and annuals are Taxsaver schemes so they are actually tax benefits and there is a requirement to change the legislation to allow for a tax benefit for a different form of salary sacrifice.

I really appreciate it.  It is great we are down to the nitty-gritty of pre-legislative scrutiny on the issue of e-scooters.  An awful lot of work has been done on this, and we cannot lose sight of that or fail to recognise work that was done by the previous transport committee.  Members of the previous committee such as Noel Rock did an awful lot of work on this to get it to where we are today.  To what extent has the proliferation of e-scooters as we see them taken the NTA and TII by surprise over the past year, particularly the past few months?  It seems, as Deputy Cathal Crowe mentioned in his initial contribution, that they are everywhere now and have really become part of the transport infrastructure in the big cities, at least, but I presume everywhere else.  I am excited by them.  I am excited by anything that could deliver solutions for that last kilometre or first kilometre of a journey or commuting journey.  Has the NTA looked at studies on modal shift here?  We need to get people out of their cars and to reduce gridlock.  Air quality in Dublin and our other cities is really poor.  Are e-scooters the solution to this and, if so, to what extent?  If we are to meet our emissions targets of 7% annually for the coming years, Ireland's towns, cities and villages will look very different.  Are e-scooters a part of that look, in the witnesses' view?  Has the NTA conducted a detailed analysis of this in other territories, and has it reviewed this in the context of its deliberations?  Has any analysis been conducted as to what this would mean for vulnerable pedestrians such as people with disabilities and people who are visually impaired?  I met recently with Labour Disability, which has issues with the BusConnects designs and how some of the buses stop, and then there is a cycle lane and a pathway and the challenges that throws up.  Where do e-scooters fit in there?  It may sound like I am getting parochial, but on big projects, be it BusConnects or MetroLink, which is coming down the tracks, to what extent have e-scooters impacted the planning and the production of the railway orders that are coming up?  I would be interested in the witnesses' thoughts on that.  It may not be written in the railway orders but surely there must be some kind of consideration of how these will impact these major projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#J00800","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1162,"content":"<p>Deputy Smith, whom do you wish to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#J00900","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1163,"content":"<p>Ms Graham first, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#J01000","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":1164,"content":"<p>I will start.  No, certainly the NTA has not been taken by surprise, given that we have seen the use of e-scooters throughout Europe and in other jurisdictions and the fact that there is scooter sharing in many cities throughout Europe as well.

I will defer to my colleague, Mr. Creegan.  I am not aware of any modal shift analysis that has been done on e-scooters, but we recognise their mobility.  They are now part of  sustainable mobility within our cities and towns.  It is really about how we make provision for that for the future in the most appropriate way from the point of view of road safety, etc.  Yes, we have to look at the impact on vulnerable pedestrians in particular.  It is a matter of looking at where it is appropriate for them to be used.  Are footpaths or shared facilities appropriate, given the fact that there are vulnerable pedestrians in those locations?  That certainly should be considered as part of the legislative scrutiny.  I will defer to my colleague.

Therefore, they have the potential to be more attractive to replace single car trips, which is to be encouraged.  The other thing to mention is that this is an opportunity and if we are getting a new mode of transport to use cycle lanes, we will possibly have to consider that.  I refer to increased volume in those circumstances, a new use for them and their facilitation.  Another thing has come from the introduction of these facilities, particularly shared type use.

In the next week or two, post the lifting of some of the level 5 restrictions, the clerk will engage with him to set up a date for that visit.  It would make sense for the committee to do that.<\/p> <p>  I would like to touch briefly on a few areas.  Senator Buttimer referenced Dr. Meade's analysis on e-scooters.  We are scrutinising legislation which is effectively a road traffic Bill and yet a substantial proportion of it is around e-scooters and scramblers.  The committee has written to the Department of Transport inquiring as to the timeframe for implementation of this legislation because there are elements of it that are being held up owing to the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny of the e-scooter provisions.<\/p> <p>  There is clearly an urgency around legislating for e-scooters, e-bikes and quad bikes in terms of safety.  In that context, I refer again to Dr. Meade's analysis.  In Dublin, in particular, there has been a huge increase in the number of people cycling, which I have noted while sitting in traffic in a taxi on route to catch a train home, and I am surprised more cyclists are not seriously injured on the roads in Dublin.  Dr. Meade makes a telling observation, namely, that she believes e-mobility should not be permitted to use bus or tram lanes and yet cyclists are allowed to use them.  How does one reconcile that?  I would have thought bus and tram lanes are as dangerous for cyclists as they are for those on e-scooters.  We need to have a discussion around how we make roads safer for cyclists, pedestrians and vehicles.  There is a massive roll-out of cycling infrastructure, which I welcome, but I am concerned about safety.  I am concerned that many of the cycleways are very narrow.  I am concerned also about cyclists using bus lanes, although I accept the need for people to be able to get where they are going.<\/p> <p>  My first question is to Dr. Meade.  Is there a body of work to be done on a safety code around driver and cyclist interaction?  How does she reconcile people on e-bikes not being permitted to use bus lanes when cyclists can do so?  I would welcome a response from Dr. Meade on those two questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#K00300","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":1171,"content":"<p>On the question regarding safety around these users in particular, in the report mentioned by the Chairman, we refer to a safe systems approach.  In road safety, we would look at everything, not just the infrastructure.  A very pertinent point was made by Deputy O'Connor about education.  It is not only about infrastructure and the vehicle someone will be using, be that an electric bike and so on, it is about driver education.  I will answer the Chairman's question in general rather than be specific.  The safe systems approach would examine every element, including other users, infrastructure and whether we are providing enough segregated infrastructure for the number of people that are using it.<\/p> <p>  On how one reconciles the use of bus lanes by cyclists and not e-vehicle users, in my response to Senator Buttimer earlier, I said that, perhaps, a case-by-case response is needed.  In some cases, bus lanes are very infrequently used, while in other cases they are very frequently used.  Perhaps in light of the comments made and the sheer frequency of buses, they are also not suitable for cyclists.  My next point goes back to the point made by Deputy O'Connor that this is a relatively new piece of the transport infrastructure environment here.  The question is whether drivers have caught up to it.  E-mobility is a relatively new addition to our road space, so the awareness of other roads users is very important.  Other countries would take education on board.  In that regard, I refer to Dutch Reach.  For the benefit of those who do not know what that is, it is about drivers opening a car door with their left hand such that they have to turn their head and check for cyclists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Suzanne Meade"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1172,"content":"<p>I would like to expand on that issue with Mr. Walsh and Ms Graham.

Deputy O'Connor spoke earlier.  Several of us went to a meeting with taxi drivers that was organised by the three main groups.  They have issues with the fact that they have missed out on several supports.  Their main request is Government support to deal with the ten-year rule and its regulation.  One issue that came up in the meeting was the scrappage scheme for a taxi driver who is going electric.  The contention of the groups was that it was not fit for purpose.  The contention is also that in large parts of Dublin and especially outside Dublin we do not have the infrastructure to facilitate electric cars, especially an increased number of electric cars.  That infrastructure would be vital for taxi drivers.  Has there been much interest in the scheme?  I know that it is applied by the NTA.  Do the officials have a view on it?  Is Ms Graham free to give that view?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#M00800","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":1206,"content":"<p>It is a Department of Transport scheme that we administer on behalf of the Department.

I would appreciate if Ms Graham comes back to me with an exact figure.  It was the contention of several of the groups that it was not necessarily fit for purpose.  Like many schemes that are introduced, it will need to be looked at and improved anyway.<\/p> <p>  I have another question for Mr. Walsh.  He referred to building cycle networks.  There needs to be an element of common sense in respect of some of our towns.  We are not starting where we would like.  One example is Dundalk.  Cycle lanes were introduced at one stage that created major logistical difficulties in the sense that fire engines were unable to get around corners and so on.  There were some improvements of Clanbrassil Street and further on into the St. Nicholas Quarter and so on.  No cycle lane was introduced there on the basis that a shared space would make more sense.  It is down to logistics.  A more common-sense framework needs to be designed beyond that.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about trying to deal with some of the issues in rural Ireland with regard to connectivity and so on.  Have something been considered?  What about facilitating the likes of Bus &Eacute;ireann from a point of view of something that is almost hybrid compared to the systems we have?  We need fixed-time services but we also need services that can deal with fluctuating demand.  This is somewhat similar to what Mr. Walsh is trying to introduce in respect of speeds and requirements on the motorway.  It is a system that can deliver on the basis of need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#M01000","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":1208,"content":"<p>I might respond first by speaking on rural Ireland.  As the Deputy may know, we are working on Connecting Ireland, which is about improving the connections between our towns and rural parts of Ireland.  We will be going out for public consultation on an improved network of services later on this year.<\/p> <p>  Services are currently operated by the Local Link offices on our behalf.  There is a combination of fixed schedule services as well as demand responsive services.  These were primarily set up to provide services to isolated rural areas where the demand is lowest.  It ensures that there is a connection at certain times of the day.  It can be a door-to-door service to bring older vulnerable users into their local towns.  It is a model we have in operation with our Local Link services.<\/p> <p>  I imagine the model the Deputy is thinking of is more urban-based.  There may not be demand for a scheduled service in an urban area and I think he is talking about the potential of looking at a demand responsive service mixed with a scheduled service.  That is something we would like to pilot if we were in a position to do so.  It would probably start in Dublin, where there are potential gaps, although we do not see many gaps in our proposed BusConnects network.  There is the possibility that areas could be better served by a demand responsive service.  It requires subsidisation.  It is simply that we have not been in a position to pilot this in the past two years given where we are with funding.  However, it is definitely something we would like to pilot in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#M01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1209,"content":"<p>Can I thank both witnesses-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#M01200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":1210,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Walsh have any comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021042700002#M01300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":1211,"content":"<p>We largely deal with the inter-urban road network.
