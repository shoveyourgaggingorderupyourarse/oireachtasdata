I remind them that apart from me and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and all members are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex only.<\/p> <p>  Today we will give consideration to the draft Protection of Young Persons (Employment) (Exclusion of Workers in the Fishing and Shipping Sectors) Regulations 2021.  These draft regulations are required to complement the full transposition of EU Directive 2017\/159 on the implementation of the social partners agreement on the Work in Fishing Convention.  The directive is primarily a matter for the Department of Transport.  However, certain requirements of the directive require sectoral amendments to the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 to ensure full implementation of said directive.  The draft regulations have been referred to the committee for consideration, after which the committee is required to report back to the D&aacute;il and to the Seanad.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, to assist the committee in consideration in this matter today.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and to the practice of the Houses as regards reference the Minister of State may make to other persons in his evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  Today's witness, however, is giving his evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.<\/p><p>Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p><p> The opening statement has already been circulated to all the members.  We will commence our consideration of this matter now.  I invite the Minister of State, Deputy English, to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042700002#A00200","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for giving me the opportunity to address them on the draft Regulations on the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) (Exclusion of Workers in the Fishing and Shipping Sectors) 2021.  The draft regulations are before the committee by virtue of the procedural requirements of section 28 of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996.  This provides that a draft of every regulation proposed to be made under the Act shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that the proposed regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.<\/p> <p>  The draft regulations amend the Protection of Young Persons in Employment Act 1996, providing for additional protections for young people engaged in the fishing sector.  The Act must be amended by these regulations to complement the full transposition of EU Directive 2017\/159 on the implementation of the social partners' agreement on the Work in Fishing Convention.  This directive is primarily a matter for the Department of Transport but certain requirements of the directive require sectoral amendments to the Protection of Young Persons in Employment Act 1996, which falls under my Department.  These will ensure that the directive is fully implemented in Irish law.  It is important to emphasise that the protections offered by the directive are already applicable to all young persons in employment under EU law but that Ireland is required to fully transpose the directive to ensure its protections are carried over into our national law.<\/p> <p>  These short draft regulations are solely concerned with enhancing protections for young persons who are employed in the fishing sector, including by restricting night-time work, working hours and holiday work.  They are not connected to general working conditions on fishing vessels and do not have an impact beyond young persons aged between 16 and 17.<\/p> <p>  The draft regulations will need to be read in conjunction with SI 179 of 2020, entitled European Union (International Labour Organisation Work in Fishing Convention) (Minimum Age) Regulations 2020.  This statutory instruction, which was introduced by the Minister for Transport, sets out the enhanced protections introduced by the EU directive that apply to young persons aged between 16 and 17 who are employed in the fishing industry.  These are now included in the draft regulations for consideration by the committee today.<\/p> <p>  These regulations provide that a young person may be in engaged in night-time work in the fishing industry only if it is required for essential training purposes and provides for appropriate rest periods.  The regulations also mean that a person aged 15 may only do light work on board a fishing vessel during school holidays provided that the hours of work do not exceed seven in any day or 35 in any week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042700002#B00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The first member who has indicated a wish to speak is Deputy Louise O'Reilly, who has 14 minutes if she wishes to use them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042700002#B00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I doubt if I will need 14 minutes.

It is probably unfortunate that we are in the space where that requires regulation.  If my understanding is correct, this is about the transposition of a directive so there is no, or very little, wriggle room for the Minister of State.  Has there been consultation with the National Inshore Fisherman's Association?  If not, can there be?  The association would have a particular view.  How many young people are we talking about?  I am deeply uncomfortable about regulating a work environment for people aged 16.  To be honest, I worked at 16 but it was not what would be considered hard work.  The work we are talking about could be very hard.  It shocks me a little.  How many people are we talking about?  Although they probably should not be doing any work at all, how will the light work they are only supposed to be doing be regulated and policed?  How will potential breaches be dealt with?

The directive is from the EU, so I guess we have to transpose it into international law as it stands.  We consulted all the various players, including those mentioned by the Deputy, as part of the process.  I believe it started in January 2020 under a previous Minister in my position.  We went through the procedure to invite submissions and engage in consultation.  There is a procedure set down to introduce these regulations, and we will follow that completely.<\/p> <p>  As with all our legislation in this space, this measure is communicated in the various languages to make sure it reaches the sectors it needs to reach.  Three Departments are involved, namely, the Department of Justice, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, along with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, the main agency for us in this space.<\/p> <p>  We will monitor what the Deputy has described but I do not believe it is very common.

If the young people in question are to be engaged in any work at all, it needs to be tightly defined and heavily regulated.  I honestly do not know how that can be done.  I do not know a great deal about fishing but, since I live in a coastal community, I know some fishers.  I do not know how regulation can be achieved when a ship is out at sea.

Are we correct in saying the majority of them are Irish nationals?  Could the Minister of State indicate whether there are any contracts of employment for those in the age category?  The work is more or less part-time, involving short hours and summer work when school is not in session.<\/p><p>I take it that it does not involve people who are involved in the atypical scheme, which is another area.  There were some reports in 2015 of abuses of the scheme and I know quite a lot of fishermen who were very annoyed because they were all painted with the same brush.  Many fishermen I know are very careful and look after their employees very well.  They are very anxious to ensure everything is done correctly.

It generally reflects family situations and people working for families but it is still important that we have a very clear directive.  People might want to bring forward cases to us and this will strengthen the national law to deal with them.  I will raise it with the Minister to see whether there is data on the numbers.  We do not think they are large.  It is generally family situations.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanton mentioned the atypical scheme and a number of Departments are involved in it.  As the Deputy did, I picked up the frustration among some in the sector who run a very tight ship and follow the letter of the law and look after everybody.  In any sector there will always be some who try to abuse the law or regulations.  As I said in reply to Deputy O'Reilly earlier, this is a very strong area for investigation and follow up, and every boat in the situation is investigated and checked quite regularly.  We reckon the figure gets close to 100% quite regularly and, naturally, any information we receive is dealt with as well.  The scheme has been put in place because we understand and to make sure the Departments of Justice, Agriculture, Food and the Marine and ourselves try to police this.  In the majority of cases, employers are responsible and work within the law with regard to their staff.  We have to keep monitoring this, of course, because there will always be cases, and this is why the protections through the various agencies are there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042700002#C00200","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Going back to what we said earlier with respect to education and school, will the Minister of State give us an indication as to what qualifications or training might accrue from young people at that age spending time working on ships?

This is important in the context of night-time work.  Perhaps this question is a reflection of my lack of knowledge of the work that goes into regulations.  I know that rest periods are set out in the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 but it would be very useful in this specific instance to be able to set out an appropriate rest period for these young workers.<\/p> <p>  It is suggested that the exemption from the prohibition on night-time work will be permitted for essential training purposes.  Is it possible to put in place notification procedures so that when an employer proposes to have a young worker on board at night-time for essential training purposes there is a log and a record is kept?  This would be specific to young persons.  I have significant concerns about enforcement in this area.  Obviously there has been a long history of difficulties with regard to enforcement in the sector.

This means that fishermen have to land their catches at Howth or Castletownbere.  This is an issue on which I and a number of Deputies are pressing the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We would appreciate the support of the Minister of State in seeking to have Dunmore East included as an approved harbour for the landing of catches by Northern Ireland and UK boats.<\/p> <p>  In terms of this provision, has the Department considered what affects it might have on casual work take-up in the sector by people in the designated age group?  The Minister of State pointed out that the protection is in place largely to give support to family members.  It is important, however, that we do not criminalise fisherfolk because they are bringing their children out on trawlers, particularly those who may have to be out at sea overnight, as many do.  We need a balance there.<\/p> <p>  How is this scheme regulated?  The Minister of State and other Deputies mentioned the Workplace Relations Commission a number of times.  In essence, is it that a complaint has to be filed by an adolescent to the effect that he or she has been mistreated in the context of the scheme?  I ask the Minister of State to respond to that question.  As already stated, we do not want to be criminalising fishing operations, particularly the smaller ones.  It may be that some of the worker rights issues that have been spoken about occur on much larger vessels that are fishing very far offshore and are away from port for a number of days, but I do not think that is the case in the context of small fishing vessels.

The Deputy is correct that an investigation can be brought about by way of complaint or issue raised by a member or somebody representing him or her, such as a union or other body, but investigations are also commenced as a result of targeted inspections.  There have been a number of high-profile inspections involving all of the State agencies on a number of occasions in the past.<\/p> <p>  On access to ports and Brexit, again, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the lead and decision-making body in that regard.

I acknowledge and commend its recent work in helping to produce and strengthen a climate Bill which puts Ireland on a path to net-zero emissions and mandates a 51% reduction in emissions over the next decade.<\/p> <p>  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Justin Moran, who is our head of public affairs, and Paul Blount, who is the portfolio director at Coillte and who is here in his capacity as chairperson of our 70by30 policy committee.<\/p> <p>  Wind Energy Ireland is Ireland&rsquo;s largest representative body for renewable energy, with more than 150 members.  Wind energy has transformed Ireland&rsquo;s electricity system over the past ten years, cutting millions of tonnes of CO2 emissions every year &ndash; 4 million tonnes in 2019 alone &ndash; and steadily reducing our dependency on imported fossil fuels.  We are proud of the contribution our members have made but it was only possible by the work of EirGrid, ESB Networks and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, in developing the grid and integrating renewable energy.<\/p> <p>  It is to the credit of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Rya&rsquo;s, that the policies he put in place when last in government enabled us to develop the onshore wind sector, which last year produced 38% of our electricity.  This makes us number one in the world for the share of electricity demand met by onshore wind and it ensured we exceeded our 2020 renewable electricity target.  We are also a major contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  The recent Economic Impact of Onshore Wind in Ireland report from KPMG showed that onshore wind energy is supporting more than 5,000 jobs and is worth more than  &euro;400 million annually to our economy.  Both of these figures will rise.<\/p> <p>  As we develop onshore wind, it will be alongside an entirely new industry.  Offshore wind energy has the potential to transform our energy system and our economy.  It is a multibillion euro opportunity for coastal communities and will deliver unprecedented savings in carbon emissions.  This achievement puts us in a strong position to meet our 2030 ambitions.  The 2019 climate action plan and the programme for Government set out ambitious goals of developing 5 GW of offshore wind and doubling our onshore wind capacity to 8.2 GW by 2030.  I wish to take the opportunity this morning to commend Deputy Bruton on his work in developing and delivering the 2019 climate action plan.<\/p> <p>  We know we have the pipeline of projects to achieve these targets but the most significant challenge we face is whether the grid will be strong enough to integrate this renewable energy.  Last year, Wind Energy Ireland published a series of four reports known as the 70by30 implementation plan, which set out what needs to happen across planning, grid and market policy to decarbonise our electricity supply.  Implementing those four reports gives us our best chance of reaching our 2030 targets.  I want to focus today on the Saving Power report, which sets out how to integrate more renewable energy onto the grid.<\/p> <p>  Last year, more than 10% of renewable generation was lost because the grid could not accommodate it.  In the first six months of last year alone, enough renewable energy was lost to power all of Galway city for a year.  We need a complete redesign and reinforcement of the transmission system, with a focus on parts of the country where large volumes of renewable energy will be developed.  Our fossil fuel back-up generation must be replaced with zero-carbon solutions such as demand response and energy storage.<\/p> <p>  An electricity grid and market designed for fossil fuel generators are not suitable for a future where most of our electricity comes from wind and solar.  We must reform the market to ensure the new system we are building is efficient and cost-effective.<\/p> <p>  Implementing these reports and developing the electricity grid will not be easy.  We must work with and listen to communities who will be hosting new wind farms or new grid infrastructure.  We must ensure they are empowered to be part of our energy transition and we must find ways to adapt, where we can, to meet their concerns.  The reality, however, is that we will not decarbonise our electricity system without new overhead lines, underground cables, substations, battery projects, wind farms and solar farms.  The public and political support must be there to enable EirGrid and ESB Networks to deliver the infrastructure we need to decarbonise Ireland.  Without it, we will fail.<\/p> <p>  We look forward to playing our part in EirGrid&rsquo;s Shaping Our Electricity Future consultation and the Government&rsquo;s consultation on the 2021 climate action plan.  To inform our contributions, we engaged energy consultants, Baringa Partners, to analyse how the electricity sector could deliver even more CO2 savings.  Initial results show it is possible to reduce power sector emissions to at least below two million tonnes of CO2 by 2030, which is less than half that envisaged by the climate action plan.  This will require EirGrid and ESB Networks to deliver essential grid reinforcements and to continue their world-leading success in integrating renewables onto the power system, thus enabling us to go beyond 70% renewable electricity by 2030.<\/p><p>We look forward to engaging with EirGrid, the committee and the Department when the analysis is complete.  Finally, I note that we recently published our Our Climate Neutral Future: Zero by 50 report, developed for us by UCC MaREI.  This is a call to action for every level of Irish society.  The report sets out our pathway to becoming energy independent and delivering warmer homes, cleaner air and tens of thousands of new jobs.  We can decarbonise our energy system while building a foundation for the Irish economy and our society based on zero carbon energy.  Delivering this future will require unprecedented leadership and it will not happen unless we can bring people with us by showing them the benefits of a truly just transition.  Our members can and will rise to the challenge.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cunniffe.

On future development for communities around the country, how many additional onshore wind farms might we expect to see across the Twenty-six Counties before 2030?  I would just like some sense of that situation.  Turning to public acceptance, I would like to hear the perspective of the witnesses regarding that aspect.  We had the planning regulator in with us some weeks ago and he talked about the possibility of designated areas for renewable energy.  He also referred to there almost being an effective ban in policy in some counties.<\/p> <p>  From my experience, I know the great public resistance there can be concerning what is seen as opportunistic development that is not well thought through and not well connected with communities.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that point about public acceptance.  The wind energy guidelines are still outstanding as well and I ask if the witnesses have opinions on that aspect from their experience.<\/p> <p>  Representatives from EirGrid will be appearing before the committee in the next hour.  There is some sense that EirGrid's ambition is not what it should be.  I note the wide range of proposals that Wind Energy Ireland has in respect of policy development which would have to change to meet our 2030 targets.  Will the witnesses comment on the ongoing EirGrid public consultation and the type of submission Wind Energy Ireland will be making to that consultation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#B00300","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I will take a few of those questions and then I will pass the question on public acceptance to my colleague, Justin Moran, who leads much of our public engagement work.  Starting with the number of onshore wind farms that can be expected across the country, it is safe to say that onshore wind farms are getting more efficient.  Turbine technology is always progressing well.  This means that to deliver the equivalent amount of onshore wind energy to that we already have in the system will require far fewer wind farms and turbines.  That is because they are more effective and efficient and can deliver more energy for the same number of turbines.  I do not have an exact figure for how many wind farms can be expected.  They range, quite dramatically, in size from perhaps 5 MW up to more than 100 MW, and the exact number will depend on how successful various wind farms are at auctions.  It is safe to say, however, that meeting the capacity needed will require fewer wind farms and turbines than we have today.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the planning aspect which was mentioned by the Deputy regarding the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, I think that is definitely an issue.  Much planning of renewable developments today is done on a county-by-county level and often one county might designate a certain portion of its area as suitable for wind energy development, whereas a neighbouring county might have ruled out the area right on the other side of the border for renewable development.  What we are looking for, therefore, is a more regional approach to planning, which is led by the three regional assemblies where there is an overarching renewable policy framework for developing renewable energy across the country, rather than on a county-by-county level.  <\/p> <p>  Moving to the wind energy guidelines, those are still outstanding.  We are very keen to see them, and I imagine we want to see them more than anyone else.  For us, there are several issues in the draft wind energy guidelines, especially related to the noise element.  We want the final guidelines to be based on scientifically robust and implementable solutions.  Whatever is published in the wind energy guidelines from a noise perspective, therefore, needs to be deliverable and implementable.  <\/p> <p>  I refer also to several other areas of the wind energy guidelines, such as set-back distance being increased to four times the tip height of turbines.  That is a change from the current set-back distance of about 500 m.  It is likely to go out to 750 m or 800 m, which will reduce the land area available for onshore wind energy generation by about 40% compared to today.  However, we recognise this is necessary and it is something we are absolutely willing to work with.  There is also a point in the wind energy guidelines on reducing shadow flicker, which is an issue.  We again absolutely accept that is something that needs to happen.  For us, therefore, we want to see those guidelines published quickly and they must be based on scientific evidence, especially concerning the aspect of noise, and they also need to be implementable. <\/p> <p>  The last point I will mention concerns EirGrid's consultation, and then I will pass over to Mr. Moran to comment on the public acceptance issue.  This is the biggest consultation I have ever seen EirGrid do.  Its level of engagement has been exceptional and it is reaching out to all parts of society.  The consultation proposals regarding the future of the electricity grid, the markets and how the system is operated are well considered.  There are four options for grid and network development.  We will be asking for a blend of those four options.  We do not believe that any one option will be the solution and I think EirGrid acknowledges this point as well.  Our focus is on trying to deliver the capacity targets set out in the Climate Action Plan and the programme for Government, and we would like to see an electricity grid developed which can help to meet those capacity targets.  I will pass over to Mr. Moran now to respond to the aspect of public acceptance.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I will pick up on one point Mr. Cunniffe mentioned about the number of turbines and give a practical example.  We have a wind farm at Barnesmore in County Donegal that one of our members is repowering.  This example will give the committee members an idea of how the change in technology is occurring.  That wind farm has 25 turbines and a generating capacity of 15 MW.  We are going to take down those 25 turbines and 13 will be put up instead, halving the total number.  However, the generating capacity will go from 15 MW to approximately 60 MW to 70 MW.  That gives an idea of how rapidly the technology is changing, to the point where we now need fewer turbines to get the same amount of power.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of public acceptance, opinion polling consistently shows substantial levels of support, 70% to 80%, for wind energy in Ireland.  Even when people are asked a question about a wind farm near them, we still see majority support even in rural Ireland.  On our end, we need to engage with those people who have questions and concerns about projects.  Frankly, we must be improving that aspect continually and always doing a better job.  One of the ways we do that is by listening and then changing projects as they are ongoing.  It would be very rare today for an onshore wind farm project to finish as it started.  The project will change as the concerns of people are listened to and adjustments are made accordingly.  <\/p> <p>  For example, one project in the midlands started out with either 27 or 29 turbines and it is now going to be built with 23 turbines.  The substation has also been moved to a different location.  Those changes have all been based on the feedback that came from people in the community.  I think the Deputy is right, therefore, and this issue touches on the point made by Mr. Cunniffe at the end of his contribution.  The only way we are going to develop wind farms and grid infrastructure is through enhanced public engagement as early as possible.  We must not just listen to people, which is obviously valuable, but also take their views into account and adjust accordingly wherever that is possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Moran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Mr. Paul Blount might have something to add on these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I reiterate and emphasise the point that Mr. Cunniffe was making about the importance of a blend to enable the installed capacity targets to be met.<\/p><p>In many respects, the grid is a key enabler of competition.  If we are to deliver this transition at the least cost to consumers, the grid is what will enable competition.  By going for a blend of the options that EirGrid has put forward, we enable the competition that will allow transition to be delivered at least cost and with the ability to flex to the higher levels of ambition that I expect will inevitably come.  I really want to emphasise that point.  EirGrid has done the work and analysis on this and it is a case now of making the right decisions.<\/p><p> There can be a tendency to focus on the cost of providing the grid infrastructure.  We need to start thinking of it as an investment that will enable cheaper forms of renewable energy to come onto the system.

We need to invest the right amount in order to create capacity and enable competition.

There is some concern at this time regarding the development of wind energy, which is happening apace.  That development is needed because we have our targets to meet.  However, there are concerns as to whether the environmental considerations are being taken fully into account when we are planning where the farms will go.  The provisions relating to the marine planning framework are going through the D&aacute;il this week.  My understanding is that there will be a very limited consultation on those proposals, with only a 50-minute debate scheduled in the D&aacute;il.  Even that discussion had to be campaigned for quite strongly.  Mr. Moran spoke about bringing communities on board, having full discussions and consultation and making sure everyone knows what is happening.  That is really important and I am very glad to hear it is a priority for Wind Energy Ireland.  Does Mr. Moran have any concerns that rushing through the proposals for the marine planning framework without having a full debate in the D&aacute;il could undermine that community engagement and set a scene whereby communities will already feel disadvantaged coming into the process?<\/p> <p>  My other question follows on from the point raised by Deputy O'Rourke.  In my constituency of Wicklow, there are three major wind farms planned for the coastline.  I cannot find a map showing those three farms and indicating the capacity or target relating to each.  That is the kind of information communities need.  Will providing that information be something Wind Energy Ireland can either facilitate or seek to get done, perhaps through the Department?

We are really conscious of the responsibility we have to do that effectively and in such a way that we can be held to account by the planning authorities.<\/p> <p>  One of the areas in which it would be great to see some additional support or investment is in terms of ensuring that other actors in the environmental space are able to participate in the process.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, for example, is drastically underfunded.  It really needs to have the resources available to look not just at onshore wind farm development but also at offshore development in the years to come.  The same can be said of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We are going to see the development of offshore wind farms, including those the Deputy mentioned, and we will need to ensure they are adequately resourced.  We must ensure not only that the planning process is carried out in a responsible, transparent and accountable way but that it is seen by the communities involved to be carried out in that way and that they are able to participate in the process.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the national marine planning framework, I am not sure what the D&aacute;il schedule is for discussing it this week.  I see it as a document that is critical to the development of renewable energy and putting in place an effective planning framework.

I understand the Government extended the consultation period to give people an opportunity to have an input into the proposals.  We need to ensure the document is properly scrutinised.  Whether that is done by allocating time for debate in the Oireachtas is a decision for members of the committee and the people who are responsible for scheduling.  It is really important to ensure that what we put in place is robust, will last five, ten or 15 years, and will provide a system that enables us to develop the offshore renewable energy production which, as the Deputy mentioned, is absolutely critical.  It must do so in a way that enables communities to participate in that process, both through the framework system and through submissions, which many communities have made, and also in respect of decisions on individual projects.<\/p> <p>  Mapping offshore wind farms can be quite a challenge.  At this point, many of those involved in the projects are simply carrying out surveys of specific locations on the seabed.  They might be carrying out a survey on a much wider space than they plan to use for the development of the wind farm infrastructure.  We need to find ways of getting that information collated better and making it more available and transparent.  If there is something we can do to work with the relevant authorities to achieve that, we would be very happy to take it on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#C00400","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cunniffe for his presentation.  We all recognise the importance of renewable energy as a significant part of meeting our electricity generation needs and the increased demand in that regard over the coming years.  Where it gets a little more difficult is in the perception, or perhaps the reality in many cases, of the saturation point having been reached for onshore wind in many of the most attractive areas from a wind capture point of view, and the significant impact that is having on communities.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on how they intend to engage more effectively in this regard and to the broader benefit of communities.<\/p> <p>  Heretofore, wind energy developers tended to do deals with community enterprises, namely, the local GAA club, a community council or similar, and provide some funding in that way.  This model, in my view, does not work and does not address the impact on some of the communities involved.  A decision can be made to go for the setback distance and put the farm out to 1 km, but there still will be people who feel impacted by the intrusion of a wind farm.  Let us be honest about this.  Some people are concerned about noise and some are concerned about flicker.  If one drills down into their real concerns, some people will talk about health issues, which are certainly not proven and probably not real.  They are also concerned about the visually intrusive nature of wind farms.  Are the witnesses considering a greater level of involvement for communities in discussions on matters of this nature?  I am not referring to situations where people are participating with their own equity.  Is Wind Energy Ireland going to share the profit or gain with a wider cohort of the community than just the community groups, local GAA clubs or landholders?  That is critical in getting some of the areas to a point where they can be developed.  There are certain areas in which I expect the witnesses will never get the support of people for development.  That will have to be taken into account.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that there has been a lack of engagement through the Covid period.

Then I will pass over to Mr. Moran to talk about the community benefit and some of our work there.  Then I will pass over to Mr. Blount to talk about the engagement during Covid.<\/p><p> On the saturation issue mentioned, there was a very interesting presentation last week by the planning consultants MKO at the Wind Energy Ireland conference.  That showed that delivering the 4 GW of additional onshore wind energy we need between now and 2030 would require 0.3% of the land area in Ireland.  The amount of land area that is required to develop 4 GW is getting smaller all the time because the turbines are getting more efficient and fewer are needed, effectively.  When that 0.3% is dispersed across multiple counties, it should not lead to an oversaturation in particular parts of the country.<\/p><p> In terms of how we see development with communities over time, Wind Energy Ireland carries out a pipeline survey of its members every nine months to understand how the onshore and offshore wind pipeline is progressing in the country.  If you look back over the pipeline surveys over the past two years, it has been very interesting to see projects at very early stages of development go from one survey to another and, very often, get smaller over time.  That is because they have engaged with communities in the early stages of development.  They have optimised the placement of turbines and removed them in certain instances, like Mr. Moran mentioned earlier.  We really are trying to bring communities with us and have those discussions at the earliest possible opportunities we can.  I might let Mr. Moran and Mr. Blount talk a little bit more about that separately.<\/p><p> The potential for offshore wind energy in Ireland is enormous.  We have a challenge of getting to 5 GW by 2030.  That challenge is not set by a lack of projects being developed or the developers that are there to deliver it.  The challenge is ensuring we get a planning system up and running as quickly as possible, we have a grid system up and running so that projects can be connected to the grid, and we have a route to market so that we have auctions available to deliver 5 GW.<\/p><p> It was a fantastic announcement by the ESB a couple of weeks ago and it is real evidence of the just transition happening from coal to the future of offshore wind energy.  The vast majority of offshore projects developed this decade will likely be fixed bottom offshore facilities, predominantly located off the east coast, but certainly some will be required off the south and west coast, most likely, to hit the 5 GW target.  We can see floating offshore wind projects playing a role towards the latter half of this decade and certainly into the future.<\/p><p> The programme for Government set a target of 30 GW of floating offshore wind potential.  What we saw in our recent UCC report, which looked at getting to a zero carbon economy by 2050, was that we need about 25 GW of renewable energy between now and 2050 purely for our own domestic demand.  That is not even taking into account the export potential that was referenced in the programme for Government.  I have no doubt we need to continue developing onshore and progressing our offshore development, especially floating technology, as we go out into the 2030s and 2040s, and we need to develop solar energy because we need diversity across the renewables portfolio.<\/p><p> I will pass over to Mr. Moran on the community benefit and he will be followed by Mr. Blount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>There is a real opportunity for Senator Dooley and other members to get involved in shaping how those community benefit programmes will run.  As members may be familiar, under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, that was launched last year, every wind farm participating in that scheme will need to put in a payment to the community benefit fund of &euro;2 a megawatt hour.  That works out at roughly between &euro;4,000 and &euro;5,000 for a megawatt of installed capacity.  For a 20 MW farm, it will cost somewhere between &euro;80,000 and &euro;100,000 a year for 15 years going into a local community.  The really impressive part about the renewable electricity support scheme is that it has put community control and influence over where the money goes at the heart of how it is being developed.<\/p> <p>  The reason I said there is an opportunity here for members is because the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is running a consultation asking people to provide input on how community committees should be structured, set up, the powers they should have, and the supports and resources that should be available.  We are very keen to see communities empowered and enabled as much as possible to ensure the SEAI provides them with the resources that enable them to take best advantage of this.  A wind farm, for example, could be a transformative opportunity for a small rural community or a coastal community when offshore wind farms come together.  Let us think about how we can use this money over ten or 15 years to leave a real lasting legacy in that community.  It is not just investment in small pockets.  It is actually investing in capital in that community and making a difference over the long run.  I will share with the members of the committee details of the consultation because the issue is quite live.  Certainly, the principle of ensuring maximum community control over the community benefit fund is one we absolutely support and it is one that is embedded in the renewable electricity support scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Moran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>From a community perspective, the first priority for us when we design wind farms is that we apply best practice and design them in a way that we do not create genuine noise or shadow flicker issues for communities.

The committee has been very strong in wanting to double the ambition we set out in the climate action plan, which is welcome.

We all want more but, as we have seen with housing, it is often politicians themselves who, having declared a housing emergency, want to block each individual case and want every piece of a case heard.  We need to find a better way of doing this, and that is not to criticise politicians who feel frustrated, because I know that happens.  If we find that every case is going to be pursued by a group of politicians or judicial reviews, we will never get this done and we are wasting our time declaring an ambition of 51%.

We need public and political support to deliver what we are trying to do here.  It is not just wind energy, but also grid infrastructure.  If we really want to deliver a net zero-carbon economy, we need renewable energy because the electricity grid will be the backbone of not just our electricity supply but of our heating and transport sectors and all our services.  We need to start looking at things through the lens of an investment rather than as a cost.<br\/><br\/>Regarding international best practice, many European countries are trying to double their wind energy resource.  This is a challenge faced throughout Europe and across the world based on some of the announcements in other jurisdictions.  We work with partners in Wind Europe, our trade association body at European level, to try to identify best practices of engaging with communities.  The Deputy is right that we need to do more by going into communities and explaining the benefits not just of wind energy but of infrastructure in general, be that transmission grid, distribution grid, broadband, transport networks, etc.  It is a challenge for all of us.  <br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked about the backup capacity.  Security of supply is paramount, and we need to ensure that the supply of electricity can remain secure and reliable as we transition to a zero-carbon portfolio.  The diversity of renewable energy will certainly help with that.  Onshore wind, offshore wind and solar generation have diverse availability patterns.  At times when solar might not be available, wind might be available and <i>vice versa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>We need to look further at interconnection and how it works.  We need to see the Greenlink interconnector delivered in 2023.  We need to see the Celtic interconnector delivered by 2026.  This will diversify our security of supply to other jurisdictions and will allow the efficient trade in power so that when we have excess power we can export it and when we do not have power, we can bring it in from other jurisdictions.<br\/><br\/>In the short to medium term we need to look at long-duration storage.  Several technologies today provide multi-hour battery storage, for example.  Very often our issues when it comes to security of supply are of a multi-hour timeframe, for four to five hours over the evening peak, as we saw during the wintertime just gone.  Multi-hour storage devices charged with renewable energy ideally during other times can be used to provide cover at those evening peaks.  They represent one zero-carbon solution that does not depend on fossil fuels.  <br\/><br\/>In the longer term we need market incentives in order to drive a transition towards a carbon-free molecule to combust, be it hydrogen or something else.  We really need to think about how we evolve the thermal portfolio of our system away from one that is focused on coal and gas more towards clean carbon source.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked if there were any obstacles to delivering this.  The biggest obstacle for both onshore and offshore wind energy is grid infrastructure.  We need the grid to be capable of exporting the available power to where it is needed.  There are several examples of wind farm projects on the onshore side which have planning permission but are not progressing because the grid infrastructure to deliver the power to where it needs to be is not there.  <br\/><br\/>Similarly, the EirGrid consultation has shown that significant investment is required on the east coast in order to deliver our ambitions there for the 5 GW capacity.  We will also need to look at the south coast and west coast in that regard.  <br\/><br\/>Mr. Moran may wish to make comments about the investment in the recent KPMG report that we used.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>An investment of approximately &euro;2.6 billion or &euro;2.7 billion will be required for developing the electricity system and developing onshore wind farms and solar farms over the next few years.

I can think of a poor project in Galway now and contrast it with the Galway Wind Park which got great support.

Last year we published a report, entitled Harnessing Our Potential, which looked at the investment opportunities for offshore renewable energy.  It found that there is a commercial opportunity for port infrastructure off the west coast and east coast which can help become a supply base and create an indigenous supply chain to support the offshore wind energy industry in Ireland.  It is certainly something that is worth looking into.  We believe we could have a commercial opportunity for a staging port which would be worth about &euro;70 million.  There would be a commercial opportunity for an operations and maintenance port worth about &euro;350 million.<\/p> <p>  This report was based on the climate action plan target of 3.5 GW rather than the increased target of 5 GW.  Between now and 2030 we will need an investment in offshore wind energy of approximately &euro;18 billion.  Looking forward to post-2030 potential, we believe an additional &euro;42 billion is on the table.  It is all about how much of that opportunity Irish companies can tap into and harness.  We are very much minded of that and we have a very active supply chain working group looking at those opportunities.<\/p><p> One of the final comments was on the west and north west.  To return to the grid infrastructure, one of EirGrid's current options, as part of its consultation, concerns the savings that can be made in grid infrastructural requirements if some large energy users can be moved from the Dublin region to other parts of the country, and it is examining the west and north west as options in that regard.  Delivering that will require public policy support to achieve the transition and infrastructural development in things such as fibre broadband that are very important to the large information-driven industries developing around the Dublin region at the moment because of their broadband infrastructures.

One company, off the top of my head, is Enercon, a turbine manufacture from Germany whose Irish national headquarters is located in Tralee.  It employs about 150 people across the country, most of whom are turbine technicians who travel throughout the country.  These are jobs in rural Ireland for engineers and technicians who, in many cases, have come back from other countries.  When we move to offshore, a typical 500 MW or 600 MW offshore wind farm would have between 80 and 100 operations and maintenance jobs once it is up and running in whatever port or harbour is identified as its support.<\/p> <p>  On the point about public engagement, we need to get out there as early as possible and constantly try to find ways to improve.  It is fair to say that as an industry, the approach and the investment of time, money and resources we put into community and public engagement today is very different from what it would have been, say, ten years ago, and we are getting better and stronger in that regard.  I accept the point that it can be confusing if a project changes or is amended.  There is a communications task in being able to explain to people that a project has changed because they asked us to change it.  It is about giving them a sense of empowerment and control over the decisions being made in their area.

I take this opportunity to plug that we have just launched our all-Ireland pollinator plan with the National Biodiversity Data Centre.

I share Mr. Cunniffe's excitement about the potential for offshore wind in the context of meeting our 2030 targets, but my concern is that if we fast-track marine planning but do not have the designated zones in place, it will only lead to more judicial reviews and planning objections.  While Deputy Bruton stated that politicians and communities are objecting, in general judicial reviews arise because we do not screen out the bad applications in the first instance.  The way in which we could do that is by having the marine protected areas zoned before dealing with the marine planning, or by having the two go hand in hand.  I would like to hear our guests' perspective on that.  Surely the industry, too, wants that type of certainty in regard to the marine protection zones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#F00500","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>There is an acknowledgment that there has been an improvement and engagement, but in reinventing engagement it is important to be clear that it is not accompanied by reinventing the planning process.

Will our guests comment specifically on the use of environmental impact assessments, that is, not appropriate assessments for Natura 2000 sites but environmental impact assessments and social impact assessments?  Is there an acknowledgment that many community concerns early on have improved the industry?  We saw that in terms of noise.  A significant aspect of offshore relates to seismic activity and its impact.  That is another really important area where there is a precautionary principle.<\/p> <p>  I heard a reference to \"science based\".  To be clear, the European principles are a precautionary principle that does not mean that nothing is done but rather that an attempt is made to be even ahead of where the research is headed.  Specifically on the issue of the marine protected areas, do our guests anticipate that the industry will contest the zoning of marine protected areas, based on any planning applications that may have been granted or are pending?

One issue I will take now, because I know it is the topic of the meeting, relates to the grid.  Deputy Devlin asked about the measures we need in order to reduce the number of dispatch-down instructions, given that that is a grid challenge with EirGrid coming in.  There are two elements to dispatch-down, namely, constraints, which are a local area problem, and curtailment, which is a system-wide problem that deals with the inability of the system to manage securely the level of wind energy on the grid.  To take the system-wide issue first, the main step we need to take over the next ten years is to substitute fossil fuel generators with clean, zero-carbon sources of providing services to the grid.<\/p><p>These services relate not only to energy but to stability as well.  Examples include things like demand side response, battery storage and some of the newer technologies involved.  The ESB announcement some weeks ago is relevant too.  These factors will be really important.  We see this as the primary way to make space on the grid for renewable energy.<\/p><p> We carried out some work with Baringa last year.  It showed that if we can transition to these zero-carbon services, then we can remove 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the power sector.  That is approximately one fifth of our emissions today.  That does not require any new large-scale grid infrastructure.  It can be done.<\/p><p> Another point is that we absolutely need investment in our grid infrastructure.  We need to use the existing grid better.  There are ways to do this and new technologies that can better utilise existing lines.  One area in particular is hybrid connections.  This was referenced in the 2019 climate action plan but it is not in the 2021 climate action plan goals for this year.  We would like to see this improved.  The idea is to better utilise hybrid connections and have existing grid connections with technologies like onshore, offshore and solar energy as well as battery storage all from the same part of the grid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Cunniffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Cunniffe.

I am joined by Ms Suzanne Collins, our head of public relations, and Mr. Liam Ryan, our chief innovation and planning officer.<\/p> <p>  The climate action plan, underpinned by the recently published Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, will set out a pathway to reduce carbon emissions across society and the economy by 50% between now and 2030.<\/p> <p>  EirGrid operates the power system on a 24-7 basis across two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland, thus ensuring people have electricity at all times.  EirGrid is also responsible for planning the power system of the future.  Our planning horizon runs for decades.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is a world leader in renewable energy integration, namely, onshore wind.  Last week, we reported the fact that Ireland achieved 43% of all electricity from renewable sources in 2020.  This was an extraordinary achievement and ahead of the 40% target set back in 2008.<\/p> <p>  As recently as March of this year we signed off on our capability to operate the power system at 70% renewables on the system on an instantaneous basis.  We are the only island country in the world operating at this level.  We expect to be able to operate at 75% by the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has exceptional untapped wind resources, particularly offshore.  They equate to approximately ten times what is currently installed on the island of Ireland, namely, 5,000 MW.  As we look to 2030 targets and ultimately to net zero emissions in 2050, offshore wind has a key role to play.<\/p> <p>  The forthcoming climate action plan seeks to transition the electricity system from the aforementioned 43% from renewable sources last year to at least 70% by 2030.  We are among an elite group in the world with such ambition.<\/p> <p>  I will set out some context.  The task of meeting the target of 70% of electricity from renewable sources in 2030 represents a whole-of-system challenge, one that has to be dealt with across three dimensions.  I will elaborate on these three dimensions.  First, the total system demand for electricity is going to increase by as much as 50% in the coming ten years due primarily to data centres, electric vehicles for transportation and heat pumps for homes.  Second, the generation portfolio is changing dramatically as fossil fuel plant exit the system and the fleet of renewable generators increases by between 100% and 200% through continuing investment in onshore wind - something Ireland is excellent at - new solar generation and a major new industry centred around offshore wind generation.  Third, EirGrid occupies the space in the middle, completing the jigsaw and delivering the balancing act across the three dimensions, including operations, the market and the network, more commonly referred to as the grid.<\/p> <p>  While operations and markets are fundamental to achieving the renewable energy target of 70% by 2030 I will focus on the role of the grid in this discussion because it tends to attract the most attention and is the most controversial.  Let us consider demand and generation of electricity.<\/p><p>To understand the grid, one must understand generation and demand.  Today, we have a mixture of fossil fuel generation, including coal, peat and oil, as well as onshore wind spread across the country.  In fact, we have onshore wind in 80% of counties in the Republic of Ireland.  As we transition to 2030, more onshore wind will be required in most counties, solar generation will be developed in the southern half of the country and offshore wind will be developed in the Irish sea on the east coast.  The following questions have to be answered: where is demand going to be located?  What is the optimum balance of renewables technologies?  Where should generation of renewables be located when looked at through the lens of the necessary supporting grid infrastructure?  The grid is what holds the system together.  Our Shaping our Electricity Future programme, which we are discussing, is designed to answer these questions and thus provide a clear picture of our power system in 2030, including setting out the optimum pathway to delivering this future of a power system with 70% of electricity coming from renewable sources.<\/p><p> To find the optimum grid solution we have distilled a major body of work, which we have been engaged in over the past year and a half, into four fundamental approaches, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.  Before I speak to the four approaches, I stress a number of points.  First, the approaches are not mutually exclusive; it is not about picking one option at the expense of all others.  The issue is more complex than that.  Second, all approaches require significant grid infrastructure &ndash; there are no easy options.  Third, almost every county in Ireland will see some level of impact.  Fourth, the objective of the process we have designed is to find the best solution in consultation with a vast array of stakeholders.  What I mean by the best solution is that it delivers the objective of 70% by 2030, and it does so at an acceptable cost.<\/p><p> I will briefly go through the four options.  The first option is called \"generation-led\" and the concept is that Government policy would inform where electricity generation will be located, particularly with reference to where demand for electricity is high and where the grid network is strong.  The second option is called \"developer-led\", which is the current approach.  I must emphasise that the current approach has served us well in getting us to in excess of 40% renewables on the power system last year.  The third option is called \"technology-led\".  It is somewhat more radical, using technology that is deployed on offshore wind farms to move large volumes of electricity across the country to high demand regions.  The fourth option is called \"demand-led\" and involves Government policy informing where large demand users might be located, particularly with reference to strong grid infrastructure and adjoining renewables generation, thus moving away from a Dublin-centric emphasis, which is the way things have developed in the past.<\/p><p> I refer to engagement.  We cannot achieve this ambition on our own.  We need support across a vast range of stakeholders, but particularly in the community and political domains.  We launched Shaping our Electricity Future on 8 March last and so far the response has been positive and very measured.  It has been genuinely inquiring as people seek to understand what the future will look like and what voice they can have in that future.  This all-island engagement programme will do four things.  It is reaching deep and wide, both at national and regional levels, involving more than 20 set piece events.  It is highly transparent.  The high-level document in plain English runs to 20 pages and the detailed technical document runs to approximately 200 pages.  It is backed up by a major communications programme, national, regional, local, radio, newspapers and social media.  It is be underpinned by a real commitment on the part of EirGrid to listen to all views.<\/p><p> I will summarise my message.  Enhanced electricity generation using renewables is at the centre of EirGrid's approach.  This transformation will have a significant impact across the country and will impact every county.  Our engagement process will reach into all levels of society and business across the country, North and South.  We have options, but all options include unpopular choices.  Shaping our Electricity Future will provide the roadmap to deliver the policy objective of 70% renewables by 2030.<\/p><p> I and my colleagues will be delighted to take questions from the members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Foley.

My understanding is that unless we push through with this we cannot achieve the level of renewables penetration we would like on the grid either in the North or South.  Perhaps you will discuss that, the method of delivery and how you see the project progressing.<\/p> <p>  Second, I refer to the consultation EirGrid is running until the middle of June, which Mr. Foley mentioned in his statement.

I will ask Ms Collins to speak to that shortly but, first, I will deal comprehensively with the North-South interconnector project.  It has attracted a great deal of controversy and I have been involved in engagements on it as recently as last week.<\/p> <p>  First, all four approaches in Shaping our Electricity Future assume that the North-South interconnector will be built.  I will frame my answer about this project in three questions.  First, why is this project needed?  Ours is an all-island integrated system, not two systems.  Long before me, people worked very hard to create the exemplar of North-South co-operation, the integrated single electricity market.  We look at the system as an integrated, all-island system.  Second, the current link between Northern Ireland and Ireland is very basic and might best be described in lay language as a modest, single-lane carriageway, to use the analogy of a road network.  It is a line that runs up through County Louth and into County Down.  This very constrained link threatens security of supply, makes the overall system much more expensive and inhibits greater integration of renewables across the island.  Frankly, we are currently moving inexorably towards a two-tier electricity system on the island if we do not address the constraints that are currently in play.  To use the roads analogy, in essence, we need a motorway to link Ireland and Northern Ireland.  This motorway would function like the spine of a body, transmitting very large volumes of electricity traffic between the North and the South and, essentially, enable the island to be truly one and fully integrated as a power system.<\/p> <p>  The second question is: why is it proposed to be overground?  Alternating current, AC, using overhead lines has been around since electricity was invented 100 years ago.  It is safe and reliable.  It is the universal network approach in every developed country across the world.  Unfortunately, AC lines are very restricted in terms of the extent to which they can be deployed safely and reliably underground.  That limit is currently at approximately 50 km and only when there is real strength in the system at both ends.  This is an undisputed technical fact.  It is a function of physics.  The 50 km is at the absolute upper boundary of what can be achieved.  The North-South interconnector cannot be delivered using an underground AC cable today.  It is close to 140 km long and the enabling infrastructure at both ends is very weak.  It is unlikely that such a length of underground AC cable will be possible for decades to come, if ever.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to the third question: what about using high voltage direct current, HVDC, underground?  This question is continuously asked of me and my colleagues in respect of a possible alternative to the North-South interconnector.  HVDC involves converting the AC form of electricity into high voltage direct current, transferring it as direct current and converting it back again at the other end.<\/p><p>This technology is available in many parts of the world.  In fact, it is used by EirGrid on our east-west interconnector with the UK, it is used extensively on offshore wind farms, and it will be used in EirGrid's proposed Celtic interconnector with France, which is to be commissioned around 2026.  This is established technology.  The big \"but\" is that it is not used anywhere in the world in what I would call the central nervous system of a synchronous power system.  It is always used on the periphery, where the consequences of failure can be managed.  It does fail because of its complexity.  It will fail and, therefore, it cannot be relied on in the mission critical environment of our all-island power system.  To be clear - when I speak about failure and the consequences of same, such a failure is inevitable.  We would see a system collapse in both jurisdictions worse than what happened in Texas recently.<\/p><p> Speaking as someone with no history with this project - I only took up my office with EirGrid in June 2018 - but who has personally investigated the options, the project is only viable as an overhead AC cable.  There is no viable alternative.  The consequence of not delivering it is that we will effectively end up with two systems across the island with a limited link on the current line.  That will drive cost increases in both jurisdictions, send us backwards in terms of the vision that those who came before us had of an all-island integrated system, and make the job of achieving 70% renewables more difficult because we will almost be doing it as two separate projects in two separate jurisdictions.  These are the honest facts about the North-South interconnector.  There is a great deal of noise about the project and many people are suggesting that A, B and C are possible, but these are the facts.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for indulging me.  It was a long answer, but it had to be that full.  I will pass over to Ms Collins to address the second part of the question on how Shaping our Electricity Future is going, what have we done and what is to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":98,"content":"<p>As Mr. Foley outlined, we are midway through a consultation that is unprecedented for EirGrid and probably the public sector in terms of its scale and scope.

As such, it is critical that we have meaningful engagement.  It is an ambitious all-island engagement programme and we want to make it as inclusive as possible.  It is amplified by media - traditional print and broadcast with a focus on regional media, and social and digital media to increase our reach.<br\/><br\/>We have been holding a series of workshops and meetings across the country.  They have been online due to Covid restrictions.  We have leveraged our stakeholder partners in the delivery of this consultation.  It has had a positive and powerful impact.  For example, Irish Rural Link is hosting workshops for us with communities across the country.  Chambers Ireland is doing the same with its business membership.  We present at these workshops and answer questions.  The National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, held a series of workshops, culminating in a youth assembly last Wednesday evening that Mr. Foley and Mr. Robbie Aherne from the project team attended.  It was fantastic and well moderated by the NYCI.  The challenge and questions coming back from the group of young people who were assembled were interesting and gave us much to think about.  We had an industry forum the same week.  It was for generation companies, developers and large energy users.  There were approximately 250 attendees.  Over the coming weeks, we will hold a civic society forum that brings together NGOs, academia and agricultural, community and environmental bodies.  We will also hold a public forum that is modelled on the Citizens' Assembly to consider issues of recruitment, demographics, geographical balance and so on.  There has been a great deal of political engagement in the form of meeting local authorities, sometimes before whole councils, sometimes before smaller groups depending on what they request.<br\/><br\/>We have had more than 80 dedicated stakeholder events at the midpoint of the campaign, covering business, civil society, statutory bodies, farming organisations and various other groups, and there have been more than 100 consultation submissions so far.  We have tried to meet people where they are and give them the kind of information and level of engagement that they want and need.  As Mr. Foley outlined, a great deal of work was done to make the information as accessible as possible.  We worked with our partners in the National Adult Literacy Agency on the language to ensure that it was accessible.  We also have a dedicated consultation portal, <i>consult.eirgrid.ie<\/i>.

We have heard that projects of common interest in the EU would have preferential access to the grid.  Is that the witnesses' understanding?  What measures will ensure that renewable energy will have preferential access?<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the context of the four options.  I read the detail of the consultation.  The witnesses have told us that the options are not set against one another, but they seem to be in the way the consultation is framed.  We are told that one option will lead a certain way but that it will not be available if another option is chosen.  There might be a sense of playing different elements against one another.  Will the witnesses give us a reassurance in this regard?  I am particularly concerned that policy is one of the four options.  While this relates to demand and policy driving where projects are situated, it would be good to provide a stronger understanding of the fact that policy is the context within which whatever we do will operate, for example, our environmental protections and so forth.  Marine protected areas are due to be designated.  Do the witnesses anticipate that the part of their map that maps out where they expect energy will be produced in 2030 will change as a consequence of that designation?  Will their planning respond positively to that or could the two be at odds?  It is positive that there is consultation, but the policy elements that will exist regardless of what drives the locations are important, as are our planning infrastructure and the importance of access to justice.<\/p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on the issue of storage?  Are we hitting the right balance currently between investing in storage versus focusing on potential carbon capture technologies?  How can we scale that up?  Do the witnesses anticipate Ireland having a national renewable energy reserve at some future point, perhaps by 2030, to replace our national oil reserve?  Could that happen?<\/p> <p>  I wish to comment on the question of large energy users.<\/p><p>Specifically, we are talking about data centres and that is clear from the graphics.  Is there a concern that, if we have heavy demand from data centres, that could affect us reaching the target of 70% by 2030?  What are EirGrid's plans if the requirement moves up?

As Mr. Foley and the Chair have indicated, it is a piece of infrastructure of critical importance.  I have followed this since 2006, read every publication by EirGrid and engaged in numerous meetings with them.  The assertion in Mr. Foley's opening statement that the engagement approach is underpinned by a real commitment to listening to all views is not the experience of people living alongside the North-South interconnector.  I would go so far as to say that EirGrid's approach to the communities in that region has been driven by arrogance and a refusal to acknowledge that there are any valid concerns or alternatives to their own, despite the fact that the rationale outlined by Mr. Foley as to why this project cannot be undergrounded has changed on a number of occasions since the mid-2000s.<\/p> <p>  EirGrid has learned some of the lessons on the consultation and engagement process, and we see that in the outcome of the Kildare-Meath line and the consultation process there.  The problem is that it has not learned it in the region of the North-South interconnector.  Why is there a different approach to consultation and engagement for the North-South interconnector line than for other lines?<\/p> <p>  Second, is Mr. Foley aware of the 2007 independent expert group appointed by the then Minister?  Is he aware that report described the undergrounding using DC technology as \"a credible option\"?  Does Mr. Foley accept that statement or does he think the expert group was wrong?  Its strongest argument against using underground technology was that it had not been used before to this extent.

Mr. Foley said much of the increase in demand comes from electric vehicles, heat pumps and data centres.  It is true to say that the bulk of it is coming from data centres.  In managing our grid infrastructure, would EirGrid favour a change in the planing regulations?  Dr. Ryan said that he works with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Should our planning regulations not now be taking account of the cumulative impact of data centres on our emissions targets and on our infrastructural capacity?

This has happened and contracts have been awarded to carry out design work.

I am looking forward to that engagement because the dialogue will help.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Rourke asked about EirGrid's role in the review.  EirGrid is another stakeholder.  We were not part of the terms of reference.  We have been advised that the process has been kicked off.

We will participate in an open and transparent manner, along with other stakeholders, in that review.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the timeline for the North-South interconnector and that the dates have slipped due to the court hearing.  We are fortunate in the sense that the growth in electricity demand in Northern Ireland has been very flat over the past years post-recession and continues to be so.  To some extent, this has helped us by not making the situation so acute that the lights would go out in Northern Ireland.  We are happy that the current programme, which sees completion around 2024, will be adequate in supporting the security of supply needs in Northern Ireland.  I believe I have answered the questions there.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boylan asked a very important question about data centres and I would appreciate if she would indulge me in trying to get my arms around all of the dimensions she raised.  Should I have said the Member of the European Parliament?<\/p> <p>  The data centres are a big part of the Irish economy today.  That is a fact.  The most recent report from IDA Ireland, as I understand it, on the economic benefits of data centres suggest the overall economic benefit is approximately &euro;7 billion to the Irish economy.  This is not inconsiderable and is something we should be conscious of.<\/p> <p>  Let us acknowledge the fact that we are living and experiencing the most spectacular social experiment in human history where millions of us are working from home.  Thanks to the information and communications technology sector, I currently have 600 staff working seamlessly from home today.  I have been working from home for nearly 15 months.  Data is the currency of the 21st century so it is absolutely critical to business.  The reality is that data permeates every aspect of our lives, including the social and the non-working element of our lives.  It is ubiquitous and part of everything that happens from the time we get up in the morning to the time we go to bed.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland we must ask ourselves a number of key questions.  I will pose those questions and maybe give the committee some of the thinking that EirGrid is sponsoring at the moment.  What road do we see for data centres in the Irish economy over the next decade and beyond?  It appears that they will continue to play a central role because they are so important to the economy and to society.  What level of growth can be reasonably accommodated?  We have to ask this question.  Where can this growth be accommodated?<\/p> <p>  One will see from the four options we have presented that EirGrid brought up the possibility of high-demand centres being located not in the Dublin area but in the regions, to be less impacting.  How should it be accommodated and what should the rule-set be?  Should there be a pecking order for firm capacity, for example?  Should we reward those who deliver on their promises?  Should those who have a track record get preference?  What price or risk should be borne by the developers?  Is it time to start asking developers of data centres to bring some part of the solution such as on-site low-carbon generation?  We pose those questions with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and with the Department with a view to a new framework that would inform the growth and development of data centres into the future.<\/p><p>I hope that has answered the question from MEP, Ms Lynn Boylan. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Foley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>It is Senator Boylan these days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#M00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1619478000,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I beg your pardon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021042700002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Foley"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Foley.

That is part of evolving the transmission system of how we do it.  Also, we see that some energy users are growing more quickly than the infrastructure can be built.  It takes a number of years to build infrastructure and, therefore, during that period some of the large energy users are putting solutions in place which allow them to grow it at the rates they want to grow it while we are developing the system.<\/p><p> The final point that was raised related to wind farms in various jurisdictions.

I wish to follow in the vein of Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  I spoke with Deputy Murphy this morning.  Even though we crossed swords quite a great deal, members of the committee worked well together, particularly in respect of student rent.  It is quite coincidental that tomorrow we will begin with student rents again in the D&aacute;il.  I wish former Minister, Deputy Murphy, all the very best.  He is a decent guy.  We had policy differences but he certainly tried his best, was very earnest and was a good person to get on with.  I wish him very well in whatever his new choice in life is and in his new career.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Cathaoirleach and the members for affording me the opportunity to present to the committee today the two sets of proposed planning regulations which have been circulated.  First, we have the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (No. 3) Regulations 2021, which concern planning exemptions for restaurants to maintain operations as takeaways for the remainder of 2021.  That provision would have expired without these regulations.  Second, we have the Planning and Development (Street Furniture Fees) Regulations 2021, which will waive section 254 of the street furniture licence fees for the remainder of 2021.<\/p> <p>  A third set of regulations, which do not require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas but about which I also want to advise the committee, is being progressed simultaneously and provides for the erection of awnings, coverings and other similar apparatus for outdoor dining to be a licensed activity under section 254 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, when it is linked with a street furniture licence for tables and chairs under that section.  This means that we will take it out of the planning piece and put it in under section 254.  This will mean that proposals for the installation of awnings, coverings - which we do need from time to time this country, as members will know - and other similar apparatus to facilitate outdoor dining will no longer be subject to planning permission and will instead be dealt with under the street furniture licensing regime in association with the provision of outdoor tables and chairs.<\/p> <p>  As we all are acutely aware, like many other sectors, the hospitality and restaurant sector and the wider tourism sector has suffered the brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic both last year and this year.  We want them to have a summer where they can make up for lost ground.  They have been subject to both temporary closure and long-term closures for considerable periods.  It has taken a very heavy toll on their own businesses and staff.  I, as Minister, and the Government are committed to providing any necessary supports to assist these sectors as much as is possible with a view to facilitating recovery as the current Covid-19 restrictions are further eased and lifted.  Big decisions are to be made this week with regard to the next phase from May onwards.<\/p> <p>  The two sets of planning regulations that I am presenting to the committee today, in conjunction with the third set of regulations that I have just mentioned on the provision of awnings and coverings, are practical measures that have merit, are within my remit, can be done and will help businesses.  There is, thankfully, light at the end of the tunnel and with the further expedited roll-out of the vaccination programme and continued business supports, we want to ensure that those in particular in the hospitality and the food sector have an opportunity to recover and that any potential barriers are removed particularly for the summer.  I propose that we then, later in the year, review these regulations further.  <\/p> <p>  There is one permanent change on awnings and coverings and, second, the extension of the takeaway provisions for restaurants which will allow that to continue until the end of the year, together with the waiving of the fee for street furniture across the country.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, I note that some local authorities have already done this which I welcome, but I want there to be no ambiguity across all of our local authority areas that businesses are not to be charged for street furniture and that there are now practical changes in the regulations.  Hopefully we will have a good summer and when businesses open back up again they will be able to utilise the public space that we all enjoy for the safe reopening of their businesses.

First, as to disabilities where we have street furniture now being used to a greater extent, I ask that we consider having some mechanism in place to ensure that we are not inhibiting in any way ease of access for people, particularly those in wheelchairs, or, where there is visual impairment.  We must be accommodating and give these requirements some consideration in terms of where we locate street furniture on the footpath left after its installation, if provision is not made out on the street, as has been very sensibly done in Dublin city.  We need to consider ease of access for people to ensure they are able to sit if there are raised plinths or some such feature.<\/p><p> If we learned anything from \"Claire Byrne Live\" on RT&Eacute; last night it is the level of waste.  I would certainly be in favour of considering the added cost and added services that will be required if we allow continuity of takeaway, which is eminently sensible, to ensure that we are maximising the potential covers in sales for restaurants.  At the same time, if there is an associated waste we should make provision for being pragmatic, in the words of Councillor James Geoghegan last night, in how we address that.  We should take the dual approach of, ideally, educating people to bring home their waste but also putting in place adequate bins and ensuring we have that complementary provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#A01000","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  We were all heartened watching the scenes of the opening up of a variety of outdoor activities and certain sports yesterday, particularly for younger people and children.  That is giving people the sense that we are near the exit, which is to be welcomed.  Citizens, residents and businesses have had a hard number of months and anything we can do collectively as an Oireachtas to ensure we make the transition back to some level of normality as easy as possible is to be welcomed.  I fully support the two propositions.  I have some questions and I ask the Minister to come back on them in his r&eacute;sum&eacute; at the end.<\/p> <p>  Can the Minister clarify the timelines for the extensions about which he is talking?  With respect to the takeaways, can he confirm that the regulations are only for existing, operating and licensed restaurants, as opposed to new businesses that are looking to establish themselves?  Regarding street furniture, while local authorities will not be charging for that, there is obviously a cost involved.  I ask the Minister to outline what the Department is going to do to support the local authorities to address any costs incurred and any revenue lost.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions about awnings and coverings.  First, when does Minister intend to lay those regulations before the Oireachtas?  Second, some of our villages, and particularly urban villages, have much more stringent planning rules about street signage and signage on buildings.  How is the Minister going to deal with the interaction of those rules?  Those of us from Dublin Mid-West will know that Lucan, for example, has very strict rules about what people can and cannot do.  Is the Minister designing these regulations in a way that will remove the requirement for planning permissions while at the same time ensuring that is restricted where there is a certain heritage element or planning restriction in a given area, so as not to change the heritage character of said village?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#B00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I will start by paying tribute to my colleague, Eoghan Murphy, who was my director of elections in the by-election in 2019.

He was an exceptional Minister who had a fantastic record of engaging with all people on all sides of the Houses at this committee.  I also thank his staff because sometimes we forget it is the staff who serve the Minister and provide support.  They were a formidable team and I want to record my sincere thanks.  One of the great things about this is that there is life after politics.  Many people come into politics with a lot of experience but they go out with another set of experiences.  I wish him well in whatever he does because he is a gentleman.  He was diligent in his work and was always respectful of difference even if we had difference of opinion.  It is important that we put that on record.  I again welcome the Minister and I would apply the same principles and considerations to him and his staff.  I wish him well in what is a challenging job.<\/p> <p>  I have one main concern in respect of this matter, about which people will have known over the past few days.  I happen to live out in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I went around with shame on Sunday morning and took 22 photographs, which I sent to my local authority.  What disappointed me more than ever was that the streets were full of bottles, human faeces and urine.  The evidence was clear everywhere.  There are no public toilets.  We have public toilets within the local authority area that have been locked up for years.  People are consuming large volumes of food and alcohol.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire - and I want to be specific because that is where I live and have worked and that is where I know best - we have bye-laws that do not permit any citizen to consume alcohol in a public place.  Those laws have not been suspended.  The elected members of the council took that decision and have continued to keep that stipulation in place.  Therefore, we need clarity.  If we are to have outdoor tables and so on, of which I am supportive, we need absolute clarity that the Department and council officials will be empowered to support the elected members who seek to uphold bye-laws.  We talk about giving power to local councils and communities but if they put bye-laws in place and the establishment does not support the elected members in seeing those bye-laws through, there is a deficit.<\/p> <p>  I welcome having more outside trade and I welcome the development of the public realm.  I would go so far as to say that that development should not only be temporary.  We could see the potential of keeping some of these public spaces, subject to proper planning and regulations.<\/p> <p>  I also want the Minister to bear in mind the people who are disabled, the visually impaired and the problems they encounter on some of the many narrow footpaths there are, particularly in areas of architectural conservation and small heritage villages, of which we have many in the north and south of Dublin and all over the country.<\/p> <p>  I support what the Minister is trying to do but we need to give councils resources to clean up.  Great credit is due to the staff and the grounds maintenance people in local councils who are out there in Bray, on the seafront, Seapoint, Galway, Donegal and Fingal.  They are the people who have to get out at 6 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and clean up this absolute filth, dirt and rubbish that is dumped.  There is a price.  We can talk about greening and recycling and the responsibility of our citizens but that is not happening.  It is not the Minister&rsquo;s problem or my problem but we need extra resources for the council staff.  We have to acknowledge that they may need additional staff on a temporary basis to deal with the cleaning up of these areas.  Ultimately, we have to make the traders and owners of these businesses responsible because while they are rightly gaining and profiteering from their businesses, they also have to be involved in the cleaning up of this mess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#B00400","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Three more members are indicating so I ask everyone to keep their contributions as brief as possible because we have further items on agenda with which we have to deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#B00500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for coming in.

I served with him on Dublin City Council and while I disagreed with his politics, I always admired his energy, commitment and enthusiasm for the role.  I wish him well.  He is a bright and capable person and I hope he has much success after politics.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister for these proposals and amendments.  He is true to form.  He has supported businesses during this pandemic through the local authorities.  The decisions and proposals he is making are pragmatic.  My understanding is that while the Minister is waiving the fees, he is not abolishing the process by which businesses have to apply for the permissions.  It is important that that is understood by both the businesses and the local communities.<\/p> <p>  The issues that have been raised in respect of mobility and access are very important.  The Minister knows this and does not need any of us to tell him.  There is a valid point to be made that, while we are supporting businesses with the waivers and the Minister is supporting them by allowing them to operate a takeaway service, those businesses need to take responsibility for the waste that has been generated from those takeaway services.  Public space has never been more valuable in the city and around the country.<\/p><p>Our public spaces are there for all of us to enjoy but we must all protect them.  I urge the Minister, through the local authorities and their offices, to communicate with the businesses that are benefiting from the rates waiver and to actively encourage them to engage in responsible packaging and clean-up.  I also urge the Minister to ask the local authorities to review their cleaning schedules for our public places.  The schedule of once a week, or once every 12 weeks as it is in some residential and more suburban areas of Dublin, is not sufficient in Covid times.

It is a time when we need to support local businesses and to do everything we can.  It is only part of the issue.  A few members have touched on the fact the whole issue consists of providing the local authorities with resources for extra staff and bins and for more collections.  I was in Cork city centre last Saturday night and there was a fabulous atmosphere in there.  The business community has done its part and the city council is trying to work with it but it needs more resources to make this work.<\/p> <p>  Cork City Council has implemented a great initiative in closing off a lot of the streets to have more on-street dining, which was a tremendous success last summer.  The side effect of that last year was that it moved disabled parking spaces from where they were on these streets to peripheral streets.  All that was done in the majority of cases was to just paint a disabled parking sign.  That is not good enough.  There are areas in Cork city that have had disabled parking spaces that people cannot access because when they open their doors, it is onto a main road, and there are other examples affecting such people and others with limited mobility.  This is not acceptable for Cork City Council or any local authority.  The local authorities need the resources.  We welcome the initiative.  On-street dining is a good thing and we want to support businesses but we have to make it accessible to all.<\/p> <p>  I have raised the following issue a number of times in the D&aacute;il.  There is a plan to carry out walkability audits for all local authorities.  I asked Cork City Council if it would carry out a walkability audit in Cork but the problem is there are no resources to do it.  I do not see why people with disabilities must always campaign and fight to get things that every citizen is entitled to, accessibility being one of them.  They have the same rights as everyone else.  We welcome the amendments today but this is only part of the issue.  The whole issue is that of disability.

A Minister should not be setting the fees for tables and chairs in each local authority.  That is a power we could give to local authorities to allow them to be more nimble.  In places like Glasnevin, where we want to encourage the use of tables and chairs and where we do not have the same demand, we could have a different policy than we might have on Grafton Street or O'Connell Street.  This is an area where we could enhance local government over time if the right consideration is given to it.  I will be happy to forward the Minister that report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#C00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I strongly welcome these necessary measures.

I will be as brief as possible and any items I do not get to I can return to.  I thank members for their support for these measures.  They are practical and they will help.  There are other issues that have rightly been raised but I will deal with specific questions about the extension of the two regulations.<\/p> <p>  The extension of the takeaway provision and the waiver is until the end of 2021.  Senator Fitzpatrick has rightly said we are not waiving the process, just the fee.  It means the appropriateness of a set of tables and chairs or awnings would be a matter, under the licensing arrangement, for each local authority to decide upon.  I had asked them about this and I will be issuing a circular next week to every local authority.  I want them to be expeditious in their turnaround of applications as we need to get ready for the summer and the reopening of outdoor dining.  I will be saying clearly to all 31 local authorities that this should be treated as a matter of priority but it is only in the areas where they are appropriate.<\/p> <p>  Access for those who have mobility impairments, disabilities and are blind has rightly been raised.  Senator Seery Kearney mentioned that at the start.  If it is not appropriate for a table and chairs to be put in a certain area, that permission will still not be given.  We have looked at this in detail.  I mention awnings and the question about protected structures.  That will bring the awnings to be a licensed activity.  If it is deemed that awnings are not appropriate for a certain type of building, the local authority will still be able to decide on that.  I know our heritage towns and some local authorities like Fingal County Council are already looking at a uniform nature of certain awnings in different towns and villages.  I would encourage that to be done.  Our local authorities have quite a deal of autonomy.  Already some of them have moved with the installation of parklets as well.  That happened last summer.<\/p> <p>  I mention disabled parking.  I am certain Deputy Gould has raised it with Cork City Council and I have seen other local authorities that have dealt with it in a different way.  Disabled parking bays cannot be removed in some local authorities and the same goes for the new age-friendly parking, which I welcome in my local authority area of Fingal.  It is question of what is appropriate and where it is appropriate for these to be taken in.<\/p> <p>  This is a different summer.  We all recognise the fact that most of the businesses in our hospitality sector, in particular our restaurants, caf&eacute;s or gourmet pubs, are family-run businesses.  Thankfully, a lot of them have been here for generations.  Any help that can be given to help them trade more easily should be given.  We have had in excess of &euro;900 million so far in rates waivers and there will be up to &euro;1.2 billion in such waivers by the time they are finished.  Let us remember we have given a 100% rebate to local authorities, even those local authorities that did not collect 100% of rates.  Local authority budgets have never been bigger.  There are vacancies in local authorities I want to see filled.  I believe in local government and it has performed incredibly well throughout the pandemic.  It has been the tip of the spear of the national response on the ground.<\/p> <p>  Litter is something I am actively looking at with regard to additional crews and the system of cleaning.  I saw the Phoenix Park, St. Anne's Park, Malahide Castle and all of our beauty spots last weekend.  A small number of people are engaging in disgusting behaviour and showing no responsibility.  They should take their litter home with them.  Even if the bins are full, they should not be packing them up.  Some of the stuff you see is awful and it is our staff who end up cleaning the mess of other people.  I ask people in general to be much more responsible.  I will be asking the local authorities to look at their cleaning schedules and the provision of temporary bins, particularly as we come into the summer months and the two bank holiday weekends in May and June when we know we tend to have more people congregating.<\/p> <p>  This is an opportunity for us, and we are doing it as a Government and some local authorities are doing it to great effect, to reimagine our public spaces and realms.  It is an opportunity to look at our roads and streets in a different way, to make them friendly for pedestrians, cyclists and families, to start moving the car away from the middle of our towns and villages, and to let people get back into those open spaces.<\/p> <p>  I know the Cathaoirleach has a lot of work on this morning.

Average rents in Dublin, for example, are &euro;1,700 per month for a standard two-bed.  In fact, in many parts of Dublin city, in particular, rents are now at &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,500.  Purchasing a home is becoming increasingly difficult for larger numbers of people, including young people on good incomes.  A recent report by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland showed that in terms of live apartment-building projects currently under way in Dublin, the all-in development and sales cost is now somewhere around &euro;400,000.  It is important to stress that it is not just first-time buyers who are being locked out of affordable housing.  Many Deputies and Senators are contacted regularly by people at a later stage in their career who, because of the loss of their family home arising from  repossession or a relationship breakdown, are also unable to buy.  This is particularly affecting single people.<\/p> <p>  The measures we are discussing today and, in particular, the way in which the serviced sites fund, which this amendment relates to, is used is really important because if the serviced sites fund is used in the correct way, it can deliver genuine affordability.  We can use it to assist our local authorities and approved housing bodies to deliver homes at prices people can actually afford.  However, the problem is that if we continue to repeat the mistakes of the past, and if we allow private developers to have access to this finance, the consequence will be twofold.  The purchasers will end up paying higher prices and in some cases large numbers of affordable purchasers will not be able to afford those properties.  Also, the taxpayer will be cross subsidising developers profit.<\/p> <p>  For clarity, in this instance, I am not talking about private building contractors.  Private building contractors build all public homes.  This amendment does not refer to that.  Nor am I talking about finance.  Almost all public housing is built with some form of borrowed finance, whether it be from Government borrowing, the Housing Finance Agency or other groups.  This is specifically about private developers.  <\/p> <p>  Briefly, I will give two recent examples of the impact bringing in private developers into affordable housing provision has had, which demonstrates why it does not make any sense.  In my constituency, South Dublin County Council had a significant piece of public land named the Kilcarbery estate.  Members of this committee who were previously with me on South Dublin County Council will know the estate very well.  There was a proposition to build approximately 1,000 houses on that site, consisting of social rental, affordable rental, and affordable purchase.  However, in their wisdom a majority of members of that council decided to sell that land to a private developer.  As a consequence of that the all-in development cost of those homes, which are currently commencing construction, has increased significantly.  For example, the cheapest discounted home on that land will retail for more than &euro;325,000, which is way beyond the affordability reach of many of the people were are trying to target with the serviced sites fund.<\/p> <p>  The example is one we all know, because we debated it at length in the House previously, namely, O'Devaney Gardens where Dublin City Council, under instruction from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, engaged in a lengthy competitive dialogue with private developers and eventually signed a deal with Bartra.  In this instance, they have access to the serviced sites fund and yet the all-in cost that will be paid for the affordable homes is &euro;360,000.  The buyer will pay &euro;310,000 but will ultimately have to pay the &euro;50,000 serviced sites fund amount back as well.<\/p> <p>  Compare that to what happens when one allows only the local authorities of the approved housing bodies sector to use the serviced sites fund.  Homes are developed by, for example, &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance, whereby the homes sell for between &euro;160,000 and &euro;200,000.  This is well below, in fact, &euro;60,000 less, than what is happening in Kilcarbery or in O'Devaney Gardens.<\/p> <p>  This amendment only refers to the serviced sites fund.  We will talk about cost rental later.  The amendment clearly states the only people who should have access to this fund in terms of the developer are not-for-profit agencies, local authorities, approved housing bodies, and community housing trusts.  The consequences of allowing private developers access to this funding is that it pushes up prices, it locks people out from being able to afford these homes and it has the taxpayer cross subsidising private developers very substantial level of profit, which is not a good use of taxpayers' money.  Therefore, I commend the amendment to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#D01400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>In saying what I am saying, it is important to put context on it.  What we envisage is a mix of housing based on what is needed in any given area.  In most cases, the State will be required to develop 100% social and affordable housing, particularly in the Dublin area, which the Minister is on record as having said.  However, there may be areas in the country that have only had social housing built over the last decade.  What we need to do is to ensure there is a mix in a given area, so we do not have areas which are predominately or solely private, predominately or solely affordable or solely social.  It is important in the context of what I am saying is that we are seeking to achieve a mix of housing tenure in any given locality.  We have to be mindful of areas in the country where there has been only one tenure type built over the last number of years.<\/p> <p>  I suspect the wording in the amendment, which includes the words \"private\" and \"for-profit developers\", has been put in there for a reason.  It was put in there to create the impression that Government parties are in some way supportive of this method at the expense of the approved housing body, the housing co-op or the community housing model.  That is not the case and I want to make that clear.<\/p><p>If we are supportive of this amendment, we may inadvertently exclude low-return funds from entering the State in order to provide affordable housing.  That is a model replicated across Europe; Vienna is held up as an exemplar.  The committee cannot inadvertently put blocks in place that may prevent a mixture of housing types in a given area and tie one hand behind the State's back as it tries to deliver affordable housing.  That is why we cannot support this amendment.  It is not because of the impression that might be given that we are in some way supportive of private development.  <\/p><p> We need a mix in this country.  We need low-return funds to provide affordable housing so it is not solely the State.  We also have to be very cognisant of the fact that approved housing bodies are on the State's balance sheet.

We are very anxious to conclude our business today.  We are trying to facilitate the completion of the report on the affordable housing Bill so that legislation can be introduced to start to address the housing crisis in a meaningful way, with the provision of affordable housing to rent and purchase by local authorities, approved housing bodies and not-for-profit organisations.<\/p> <p>  The political motivation behind this amendment is fairly clear but the reality is that the serviced site fund is set up under regulation.  It is a &euro;310 million fund dedicated to supporting the provision of affordable housing not for-profit housing.  The second criterion mentioned in this amendment is private developers.  It is a very broad term to use.  It is used, in this instance, to signal a certain political position but it excludes ethical, sustainable investors.  We are determined to use every mechanism to address this housing crisis, which is one of both supply and affordability.  On that basis, the Fianna F&aacute;il group will not support this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#E00200","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I will support this amendment.  I agree with previous speakers that a housing mix is very positive and should be encouraged.  I do not see an issue with this amendment in regard to that.  This is about whether we give public subsidies to private developers in delivering affordable housing and whether it is a good way to proceed if we want affordable housing.  This amendment does not preclude low-return funds and ethical investment in housing and affordable housing.  Currently, low-return investment funds and ethical funds are quite successfully investing in social and affordable housing through approved housing bodies.  If this amendment is passed, and followed through in the legislation, that would continue to be the practice.  The question is whether or not we give public subsidies to private developers.<\/p> <p>  As regards providing affordable housing at a rate people can genuinely afford in terms of their income, rather than a percentage discount off a full market rate, we need to ask whether private developers are good at delivering that.  Are private developers good at that, as opposed to private builders who can be contracted by approved housing bodies or local authorities?  The evidence, certainly to date, is that they are not.  They have a more costly form of delivery than approved housing bodies or local authorities.  <\/p> <p>  We can see that quite clearly in the example of the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance and what it is building which ranges from about &euro;160,000 to &euro;250,000.  Its houses are coming in at a significantly more affordable cost than those of private developers.  It is worth noting that &Oacute; Cualann contract private builders, but as a developer managing the project it has lower finance costs and lower risk margins.  While it takes a margin, which it uses to reinvest in its next project, its overall profit margin or reinvestment take is lower than private developers.  It is not just &Oacute; Cualann.  Approved housing bodies and, in general, local authorities, are more effective in terms of delivery.<\/p> <p>  There is the issue of the State balance sheet.  If we are serious about what needs to be invested in affordable and social housing, the only approach that can be taken is one where we are willing to break the EU fiscal rules.  This is in the context of such low interest rates, especially.  Other countries have done this in the past.  It is absolutely justifiable to break fiscal rules in the context of a housing and homeless crisis.  I have no issue with that at all.  Every party in the Oireachtas should support it.  I am strongly supportive of the European Union but there are countries in the EU flouting much more serious breaches in its fiscal rules and the rule of law.  There is no proper action being taken against them so we should have no fear in breaking those rules, if needs be, in addressing our housing and homeless emergency and investing in affordable and social housing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#E00300","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Deputies Duffy and Gould and Senator Boyhan are indicating.

Tens of thousands of people are on the waiting lists.  We also have people trapped in the middle who are earning too much to be on social housing but cannot qualify for a mortgage.  This is where affordable housing comes in.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is trying to make affordable housing as affordable as possible.

It is not the case to say the Government is not supportive of facilitating private developers to make profit.  If one looks at the housing policies around social housing, in particular, over the last five to ten years, it has all been about trying to attract high cost, private finance through the provision of profit because the State did not want to directly deliver large volumes of social and affordable homes.  It is why we are in the housing crisis.<\/p> <p>  Government policies, whether it is the enhanced leasing scheme, local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, excessive tax breaks for real estate investment vehicles or the shared equity loan scheme proposed by Fine Gael and either supported or facilitated through the abstention of Fianna F&aacute;il, say to private developers the Government will give them profit in exchange for development.  There is a cost to it and people need to be clear, which is why I raise it.<\/p> <p>  The cost is that it reduces the volume of affordable houses delivered and increases the cost.  I take Kilcarbery, in my constituency, as an example.  For a decade, we campaigned for Government to invest with South Dublin County Council to deliver 1,000 homes on the site.  Some 300 would have been social rental, approximately 300 would have been affordable rental and approximately 300 would have been affordable purchase.  It would have given the social mix Senator Cummins proposed, but Fine Gael would not fund it and instead the council was forced, if it wanted to develop the land, to sell it.<\/p> <p>  The consequence is we will have 30% social housing, which I welcome, but 70% of the homes on the site will be open market unaffordable.  If one takes O'Devaney Gardens as an example - none of the Deputies or Senators on the Government side addressed this point - the consequence of bringing in a private developer with the serviced sites fund is those homes are &euro;60,000 more expensive than if one restricted it to the approved housing body, local government or community housing trust sector.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the off balance sheet - Senator Cummins knows this - &Oacute; Cualann is the largest supplier of affordable homes with the serviced sites fund and they are off balance sheet.  One can have off balance sheet vehicles with this financing and, therefore, it is not an issue.  It is not the case this amendment would prevent ethical investors.  In fact, last week Cl&uacute;id Housing announced a deal with an ethical investor, a long-term, low-yield pension fund, for the delivery of more than 500 homes, so, again, it is absolutely not the case.  With respect to Deputy Duffy, the Land Development Agency, LDA, cannot access the serviced sites fund, so it does not apply this sense.<\/p> <p>  The central issue is whether or not we want to continue with the failed Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael housing policy of privilege and private developers using public money to cross-subsidise very significant profit while driving up the price of homes.<\/p> <p>  Senator Seery Kearney is wrong.  Supply, in and of itself, will not fix the problem.  The supply must be affordable which the Senator's Government has failed to take into account for the last number of years, so we either use the funding-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#F01100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":207,"content":"<p>It is a good summation.

Obviously it is related to No. 1 in the sense that I am arguing that the cost rental equity loan should not be available to private developers, and there are two key elements here to make that case.  The way cost rental works is twofold.  As members know, you look at the financing, development, management and maintenance costs of the unit and the idea is that whoever provides the unit has to get full cost recovery over a period of time.  However, you can make the rent more affordable if you structure the finance in such a way as to allow the full cost recovery to happen over a longer period of time, thus bringing down the entry level rents to an appropriate point.  This is really significant because the current cost rental schemes that are under development, including the Enniskerry Road cost rental pilot scheme, for example, will have rents of between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,300 per month.  Other cost rental projects in D&uacute;n Laoghaire could have rents of &euro;1,300 per month and, in Cork city, of &euro;900 per month.  That is going to cause a very significant problem for a large cohort of working people not eligible for social housing and for whom we would like to have cost rental as a viable option.  These are often workers who are just above the income threshold for social housing, and we know from very detailed research by the ESRI that they are people who do not experience significant levels of wage growth.  Therefore, the entry level rent of cost rental projects is really key if this is to be affordable.  Mr. Brendan Kenny, the director of housing at Dublin City Council and officials from the Department of Finance told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2019 that if the financing of this is structured correctly, we could bring entry level rents down to between &euro;700 and &euro;900 per month for a one, two or three-bedroom unit, which is substantially below what is currently being proposed as the guiding rent of about &euro;1,200 per month.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty with bringing in private developers is twofold.  First, it adds a significant additional layer of cost above the cost of financing, building, managing and maintaining because developers are required to have a 10% to 15% profit and risk margin.  That is an extra layer of cost that makes things more difficult.  That 10% to 15% cost margin is taken from four separate reports by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland of private sector development and it is a well-established principle.  There is a more significant consequence of bringing in private developers.  The key about cost rental is that once the financing loans are paid down, let us say over 20, 30 or 40 years, the accommodation generates a surplus.  It generates a revenue stream for the housing provider.  That is how, for example, the not-for-profit and voluntary sector providers in other European jurisdictions actually have a housing stock that is self-financing after a period of 20, 30 or 40 years.  The revenue surplus on the cost rental side helps providers to cross-subsidise social rental as well as to fund future stock.  The best way of delivering cost rental, whether it is through local authorities or other public agencies or not-for-profit entities, is to have social and cost rental units together and when the cost rental loans are paid down, the providers will benefit from the surplus.  Those of us here who have been councillors know the great difficulty our local authorities have had getting adequate resources from central government for the management and maintenance of social housing stock.  That is why they often have to opt for very expensive refurbishment projects and so on.<\/p> <p>  If we say that private developers can have access to the cost rental equity loan, what we are essentially doing is giving that revenue surplus, which would be about half of the rent that would be paid at that stage, permanently to the private sector at a future point in time.  In that way, we are denying the not-for-profit sector, particularly the local authorities but also the Land Development Agency, LDA, which I do not support, and the approved housing bodies, AHBs, access to that surplus.  Again, this will make the rents more expensive and will deny our local authorities and other not-for-profit providers access to a really valuable revenue stream into the future.  It is completely contrary to the logic of cost rental.  I am not aware of any jurisdiction where for-profit private developers deliver cost rental because the whole point is that it is meant to be about full cost recovery and is not profit driven.  I do not see why we should use taxpayers' money to deliver more expensive rental accommodation and cross-subsidise private developers indefinitely into the future when that funding could be used for more affordable accommodation to the benefit of our local authorities indefinitely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#G00800","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il will be opposing this proposal.

I do not know exactly what is meant by for-profit, which is a really broad description.  I know what the Deputy is getting at when he uses the term but just in case anybody missed it, the LDA legislation and the affordable housing legislation that we are bringing forward are designed specifically to insert the State into the picture, using public lands to deliver affordable homes for purchase and rent and to increase our social housing stock.  That is what the aforementioned legislation is about, very simply, and this type of delaying tactic is very unhelpful.

There will be profit included with any of those tendering processes but it is not 10% to 15% based on my experience.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#G01000","speaker":"1574","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Following on from Deputy Duffy's points, a return of 3% or 4% through ethical funds or special vehicles that will deliver cost rental in addition to the LDA is profit.  That is profit.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin's proposal is an attempt at grandstanding by presenting for-profit housing by private developers as something that is not in existence in this country.  We are looking to attract special vehicles where there is a low return of 3% or 4%.  That is what builds houses across Europe.  If we are going to get party political about it, as was the case in the first debate on the first motion and if Sinn F&eacute;in wants to tie one hand behind the State's back to make sure we can only provide cost rental accommodation through AHBs or local authorities, it will do that and make sure we cannot scale up the model.  What matters with cost rental is the more units that are delivered over time, the more affordable those units become because they rise in line only with the consumer price index whereas the wider rental market is probably increasing at a higher rate if one looks at it over a ten, 20, 30 or 40-year period.  These cost rental properties will become more affordable for the tenants over time and Deputy &Oacute; Broin knows that.  To tie the State's hands is not what we should be doing here.  We should provide affordable homes and cost rental by any means possible.  Senator Boyhan said that he did not mind who provided housing.

We can disagree with those amendments, which is fine, but to suggest that we are tabling them for anything other than the reason that we believe they would improve the policy in the Bill is wrong.  I respect all members of this committee.  I might disagree profoundly with the policies they propose.  Coming into this committee and tabling these amendments is legitimate.  It is not, to quote Senator Fitzpatrick, a \"delaying tactic\".  In fact, we are making good progress.  For the record, I suggested in private session that I would be quite happy if we took these votes without debate to speed up the process but it was Government members who legitimately, and I have no objection to this, wanted to have this debate publicly.  They cannot then criticise us for wanting to have that debate.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Duffy, the LDA does not have access to this cost rental equity loan.  This is currently a loan for AHBs.  This is how it is designed and, therefore, his reference to the LDA is not factually correct.  The next point in respect of the 10% to 15% figure is really important because it seems some members on the Government side might misunderstand either my intention in tabling this motion or the way these funds will work.  When a private developer is developing, and private developers are a very clear entity, they are required both through their private financing and standard practice to have what is called a profit and margin line on their development of between 10% and 15%.  I am quite happy to send Senator Cummins the four SCSI reports that deal specifically with this.  The reports itemise that and they are from real live development projects over the past number of years for houses and apartments.  The consequence of that is that separate to the cost of finance, which members will also see as a line item in the SCSI reports, bringing in developers adds an extra 10% to 15%.  That is on top of the cost of the finance and other costs.  The key issue is that if we allow that to happen, entry rents would increase.  I have not heard a single member on the Government side respond to my key concern, which is a genuine concern, that opening the door to private developers accessing this scheme, as with the previous scheme, would push up prices.  We have real-life examples where that has happened.  When the row over O'Devaney Gardens was happening in Dublin City Council, there was a proposition that the local authority and an AHB should acquire at full market value additional properties from Bartra and rent them out as cost rental.  Any calculation of what rent repayment would look like over a 40 or 50-year period was &euro;1,600 to &euro;1,800 per month.  That is the consequence of bringing in a private developer.  Thankfully, so far, the Department has refused to fund that proposition because it is not affordable by any stretch of the imagination.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of scaling up, the reason we do not have cost rental accommodation in this State is Governments have refused to fund it.<\/p><p>It has been Government policy since 2014.

In fact, that has been our problem for too long.  It is that we are not providing the necessary funding in budget after budget to allow local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts, to deliver at scale.  That will still be the case even when this legislation passes.  Members have to make a decision.  Either they want to drive down the cost of renting or buying these units or they want to let in private developers to maximise profit at the expense of the taxpayer and make these units less affordable.

One thing that we discussed at the committee was significant ESRI housing research which was published in summer 2018.  It asked a simple question, which is how many households not eligible for social housing support, including people who cannot get HAP, RAS or social housing, have high housing costs.  It did extensive research, going right back to 2002.  It looked at renters and owner-occupiers.  The findings of the survey were startling.  It found that, in general, about 30% of those households not eligible for social housing support have high housing costs.  That was defined by the ESRI as over 30% of take-home pay with some factors taking into account the ability to afford an ordinary basket of goods afterwards.  What was most startling about the survey is that in those two income deciles just above the income thresholds for social housing, 70% of those people had high housing costs, above 40% of take-home pay in many cases.  These are people who are in steady jobs but with low pay.  Sometimes there are one and a half or two incomes in a household.  They are people who, unless something dramatic changes, are unlikely to ever be able to purchase a home and obviously are not eligible for social housing.  We have to ensure that that group of people, who would be a main target cohort for affordable cost-rental, will be able to afford the rent that is being proposed.<\/p> <p>  The great difficulty at the moment is that some of the rental projects that have been proposed would be charging rent above that 30%, because there is no requirement to have a maximum level.  The best way to deliver cost-rental is to make it affordable cost-rental, with full cost recovery over the lifespan of the repayment of the loans.  The entry level rent should be affordable.  I think having affordable rents linked to a maximum of 30% of net income, if the Senator is willing to take that friendly amendment to insert the words \"a maximum of\" before \"30%\", would be eminently sensible.  If we do not do this and find some way of linking affordability with full cost recovery, which I think can be easily done, there will be a big group of people in between the thresholds for social housing and the actual price that is being charged who will be either locked out or have high housing costs.<\/p> <p>  Since the Government has repeatedly set itself against raising the thresholds for social housing eligibility, on the basis of the most recent oral questions we had with the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, we have to ensure these people get in.  Between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,300 a month is not affordable for large sections of people.  We need rents of between &euro;700 and &euro;900.  This amendment would ensure that that would be achieved, especially in local authority developments.

I understand the motivation behind it.  We are putting this legislation before the House for a reason, which is to have a significant intervention in the market to provide affordable purchase and affordable rental.  The programme for Government was put together to respond to the issues which Deputy Gould and other Deputies in this House, including the Minister, have spoken about over the past ten years.  Therefore, in order for us to have that intervention, we have to put forward legislation in these two significant policy areas, for affordable purchase, which we have discussed, and for affordable rental.  It is important that affordable rental is let out by affordable housing bodies and by the State, initially on balance sheet.  In order for us to provide a broad base of affordable properties in the State, provided through a public housing model, we have to scale up.<\/p> <p>  I believe that a full cost-recovery model is the key to affordable rental.

Housing is either affordable or not affordable.  Affordability judged by what one has in one's pocket at the end of the day.<\/p> <p>  We must simplify and demystify the debate on housing.  Many people outside these Houses are bellyaching about their commitments to affordable housing.  They should be honest and keep it simple.  Affordability is about what one has as disposable income.  I consider 30% of net income to be a maximum. That is the key message about affordable purchase, rental or whatever scheme.  It is the one line that constantly resonates with people outside.  People talk about whether rents \"are linked to our income\".  Nothing is affordable if it is not based on net income.  This amendment is perhaps the strongest message that we can send out today.  It is something I wish to echo and hang on to, because it is simple and clear.  We need some clarity in this debate.  We must reflect on what the people outside understand by the term \"affordable\" and what they are calling for.  They are calling for equity, fairness and affordability.

We have also stated that we are going to limit the model to a 3% or 4% return so that high-yielding funds cannot come in and make a quick buck.  We have also agreed that cost rental will have a minimum of a 25% discount on market rents.  In the eight hours of debate that we had in private session, where we agreed more than 40 amendments or recommendations for this report, what we did was set the formula and the model, and that essentially is what determines the rental cost.  That is what cost rental is.  That is what we are trying to emulate across Europe.  It is right that there are other State mechanisms in place should someone need assistance.

In that sense, if we are opposing this recommendation for the Department to come up with a formula that defines affordability, we may as well rename this Bill the market discount Bill, because that is essentially what the Government side has argued.  Market discount is not necessarily affordability, and all the experts who came in to us described what that was.  This recommendation was to go to the Department to ask it to come up with a formula, and I thought that would have been a very reasonable assessment.  I am surprised the Government side is opposing it.  Fundamentally, this shows that the Government side is not concerned with affordability.

I would have been open to amendments such as that suggested by Deputy McAuliffe, because I think up to 35% is generally the agreed definition of affordability.  If they are willing to do that and reach a compromise, I would also be willing to move and reach a compromise.  However, I do not get the impression from the deliberate misunderstandings and the deliberate statements from the other side of the House in response to this that they are willing to reach a compromise.  It was very clearly communicated by both the ESRI and the National Economic and Social Council that it was a generally internationally recognised definition of affordability.

We have to find ways of delivering homes at prices that working people can genuinely afford, both to rent and particularly to buy.  The shared equity loans scheme does not do that and, therefore, should not, in my view, be called an affordable housing scheme and should not be included in this Bill.<\/p><p>It is significant to note that this is the one element of this Bill that was not under consideration and development by the outgoing Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and his departmental team.  Both cost rental and the serviced sites fund had a long gestation under the last Government and, in fact, no political party advocated a serviced sites fund during the general election of last year, when we all had different propositions around how to deliver affordable purchase homes.  The origin of this proposal lies in two documents that were developed by two industry lobby groups, Property Industry Ireland and Irish Institutional Property, which came and did a round of meetings with housing spokespeople between February and May 2020, after the general election, and I was one of those spokespeople.  Both of those lobby organisations had very well developed propositions and called on the Government to introduce a shared equity loan scheme based on, and similar to, a controversial and unsuccessful scheme that operates in Britain, and which they wanted the Government to do here.<\/p><p>It is very clear that the proposition the Minister is developing, because he has put so much of it into the public domain, albeit through leaks and unofficially, is based on these two lobby documents.  This is the clearest example I have seen in all of my time in the Oireachtas of private industry writing the policies of Government.  Because of that, it has proven very controversial.  We heard, for example, from the ESRI that it had very significant concerns about this scheme as it is currently proposed.  We received written correspondence from the Central Bank outlining, again, very significant concerns in terms of the scheme as it understands it.  The former Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in a freedom of information request that I received has widely criticised the scheme.  They are all saying the same thing.  They are all saying this is a demand-side scheme that will push up house prices at a time of limited supply.<\/p><p>Our problem at the moment, particularly in the context of Covid, is that supply is even more limited.  If it was sluggish before the pandemic and the closure of, and then restrictions on, construction activity, it is even more sluggish now.  What we are proposing is to put a pot of money into a fund that will allow hard-working people, desperate to own their own home, to take out a secondary loan, and that secondary loan will be used to buy unaffordable, overpriced houses up to &euro;400,000 in Dublin and lower prices elsewhere, according to the Minister.  There will also be an interest charge and that interest charge will be set at 15-year intervals and will increase over that time.  By my calculation, on the basis of the information that is in the public domain, if people were to take the full shared equity loan of &euro;100,000 on a property of &euro;400,000 in Dublin, by year 30, if they do not pay it down, and there is no obligation on them to pay it down and the Minister has given that commitment, they will have accumulated an additional &euro;50,000 of debt on top of whatever the increased equity value of that 25% stake is.<\/p><p>Thus a person could actually owe not &euro;100,000, not &euro;150,000 but &euro;175,000 or &euro;200,000.  What this is doing, therefore, is saddling hard-working people with a very high level of debt.  That is why there are a great many people in Fine Gael who are deeply uncomfortable with this scheme.  All the Fine Gael councillors on Dublin City Council called for it to be scrapped because it would push up house prices.  They wrote to the Minister and urged him to transfer the &euro;75 million of finance allocated for the budget this year into the two other funds we have just been discussing, namely, the serviced sites fund and the cost rental equity loan.  We also know from some of the coverage in the newspapers that within both the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance there are real concerns, shared by the respective Ministers, about what this scheme will do.<\/p><p> This being the case, I do not understand how anybody who says he or she wants to help working people buy their own home could support such a scheme.  If we look at the evidence from Britain, for example, it has pushed house prices in London up by 6%.  While it has led to an increase in supply, it did so on the English-Welsh border where houses are not needed.  The most independent research into that scheme from the London School of Economics has made it very clear that this is about putting money in the pockets of developers and pushing up house prices and it is putting working people at very significant risk of mortgage default and loss of property into the future.<\/p><p> The last thing I will say is that Fianna F&aacute;il has done this before.  The last shared ownership scheme, which members will remember, and which was closed by Fine Gael, was modelled on something similar.  It was a shared equity product where the cost of the equity and the interest charged increased over a period of time.  That meant people who bought into that shared equity scheme at the end of the Celtic tiger experienced a doubling of their mortgage repayments if they chose to pay it down over a decade and a half.  There was four times the level of mortgage default and mortgage arrears among that cohort of borrowers, when the crash hit its depth after 2010, than there was among regular borrowers.  This, therefore, is not affordable housing, and any Deputy who supports the shared equity scheme is not doing right by hard-working people.  He or she is saddling them with debt and pushing up house prices.  I cannot stand over it and that is why the amendment would delete all the recommendations in the report related to shared equity, it would call for the shared equity loan scheme to be removed from this Bill, and it would call for the &euro;75 million to be transferred to the cost rental and serviced sites funds for genuinely affordable homes.  If the Minister, when he has finalised the scheme and the Central Bank and European Commission have given their views, wants to introduce a separate Bill, let him come and defend that but he should not title it an affordable housing Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#L01400","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":290,"content":"<p>The motion before us is seeking to reallocate the &euro;75 million that is going to support 3,000 couples, young families and individuals caught in the rental trap to own their own home.

This shared equity scheme will stimulate housing delivery by stimulating building on these approved sites, and by enabling the State to take a 30% stake in new homes, it will make those homes affordable to people who want to buy.  Therefore it is going to boost supply and increase affordability.<\/p> <p>  The Opposition is saying we do not know enough about the scheme yet, so we should scrap it, but let us look at what we do know.  We know there is no charge on 30% for the first five years and we know that there is no onus to pay off the 30% until, or indeed if, the house is sold.

We know from the UK what happened after a similar scheme was introduced, namely, that in the more than four years since the scheme was introduced there, the share prices of the main construction companies that availed of the scheme increased by 230% over the period.  We know from looking at the price of homes availed of under this scheme that, if we take the east midlands as an example, while the average first-time buyer bought a home for &pound;157,000, homes sold under this scheme were going for an average of &pound;235,000.  In the north east of England, the average first-time buyer was buying in at &pound;109,000 whereas the average home sold under this scheme was at &pound;182,000.

People, and not shared equity schemes, build these houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#N00600","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Due to time constraints I must put the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#N00700","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I have a right to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#N00800","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I gave you a lot of time at the start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#N00900","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>A number of charges have been made against the party and I have a right to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#N01000","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>You do but I am asking you to waive that right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#N01100","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>We are already over time so another two minutes will not hurt us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#N01200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Could you do it in a minute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021042700002#N01300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1619478000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I can.

That is the inequity in all this.  We have seen how the help-to-buy scheme increased house prices.  Fianna F&aacute;il extended it and it has increased house prices since.  Worse still, 60% of the people who got it did not need it.  This is not affordable housing but instead it is Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael doing what they always do in housing policy, which is putting money in the pockets of developers.
