I am joined today by my colleagues Ms Kate Duggan, national director of services and integration.  I want to welcome her to the agency having joined us in August.  I am also joined by Mr. Pat Smyth, director of finance, and Mr. Ger Brophy, chief social worker.<\/p> <p>  The clerk to the committee pointed out to me that there are several new Members of the Oireachtas in the committee and that it would be helpful to have some general overview information on Tusla and its brief.  In this regard I have provided via the clerk a presentation slide deck which I used earlier in the year to brief Oireachtas Members on the 2019 annual report of the Child and Family Agency.  I hope the Members who were not at that presentation or are new to the Houses will find the information helpful.  I am happy at any time, as I have done since coming to Tusla in late 2019, to engage with any individual member of the committee or indeed the Oireachtas on any aspect of the work of Tusla.<\/p> <p>  I am aware the committee wishes to discuss some specific matters today, and I will be happy with my colleagues to address those both in this statement and in any questions might arise.<\/p> <p>  I would like to address some of the key issues that have been a feature of Tusla in recent times.  Tusla is considered an essential service provider within the meaning of the Government plans for managing the response to Covid-19.  In March of this year when it became obvious that normal life and activity for all of society would be fundamentally altered, I prioritised and have maintained focus on three essential services: front-line child protection; supports to children in care; and response to domestic and sexual gender-based violence.<\/p> <p>  In the first phase of lockdown significant and serious concerns emerged in these three aspects of our work thereby justifying the focus on them.  Of concern was the initial significant reduction in referrals to the child protection and welfare system, our restricted ability to visit children at home, challenges in maintaining contact between children in care and their families, and a then anticipated surge in domestic violence-related need.<\/p> <p>  Significant planning and crisis management on a 24-7 basis were used to mitigate some of the attending risks.  To give members some indication of the concern, we saw instances of referrals going from an average of 1,500 per week to 960.  Visiting children at home reduced to 30% of normal activity and while many remote means were used to connect with children and families this was nonetheless a concerning time.  However, I can assure the committee that those cases requiring priority response and visit received them.  Contact visits, known as access visits, for the majority of 5,900 children in care were in the main replaced with remote technology.<\/p> <p>  Now that we have reached level 5, we must remain focused on these priorities.  However, we are now receiving referrals of 1,300 per week.  We are visiting children at home on a routine basis and access visits for children in care are routinely happening.  Domestic and sexual gender-based violence services continue to report high demand and activity.<\/p> <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s education support service has been working to support children, families and schools to adjust to the new and challenging circumstances as they returned to school.  Additionally, our alternative education assessment and registration service noticed a significant increase in applications for home education in recent months.<\/p> <p>  I pay tribute to our staff, their representative organisations, F&oacute;rsa and the INMO, our partner organisations and statutory colleagues for their enormous flexibility and hard work as we continue to provide essential services during the pandemic.  I pay particular tribute to those in the community and voluntary sector who continue to support many children and families for whom the pandemic brings additional vulnerability.<\/p> <p>  Regarding improving services and performance, many members of the committee will be familiar with periodic commentary and reports on different aspects of the performance of Tusla across a wide range of services.<\/p><p>In the context of an ever-increasing demand, the agency continues to make improvements and these are often validated by external sources such as HIQA.<\/p><p> When I joined Tusla in September 2019, I assured the previous committee and the public that I would work to a position whereby Tusla would increasingly identify its own challenges, openly communicate these with the public and take the necessary steps to address those issues.  One recent system-wide example of this was in respect of the obligation of Tusla to report suspicion of child abuse to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Tusla identified a problem in its Kerry services; however, the approach was not, as traditional, in responding to this as an isolated incident.  Tusla immediately conducted a self-assessment nationwide, identified a 13% problem in this obligation and put in place the necessary corrective actions and audit to be assured in the future.  There was open and responsive engagement with key partners, the public and the media on this problem.<\/p><p> I fundamentally believe Tusla must continue to approach its problems and challenges in this fashion.  Serious issues and challenges arise for the agency, whether that is in compliance with the high bar set in regulations overseen by HIQA, achieving improvement in GDPR, which is a particular problem, or in consistently providing a timely quality service to all children in our brief.<\/p><p> The single biggest challenge in Tusla is consistency and whereas progress is and continues to be made on many fronts, we cannot be complacent because we know that the improvements are not everywhere.  In this context I expect we will continue to learn of problems and issues for some time to come while we work towards achieving this consistency.  It is for this reason that the reform of the agency on three fronts is critical.  These are practice, culture and structure, which all require attention and change.<\/p><p> I am aware that the board of the child and family agency is seriously concerned at the pace of progress in respect of the change of the governance structure that we have decided, and which requires approval outside of the agency.  This change is central to addressing several deficits, including in performance and accountability.  The current structure and organisation of the agency is, to put it simply, not good and while it remains, many problems will continue to occur and will require an overly centralised reactive response.  The board has raised the matters with the Minister, who has been very supportive of Tusla in his short time in office, and we look forward to an early and positive decision on this critical matter.<\/p><p> On the subject of the mother and baby home commission database, members will be aware of the recent attention to the mother and baby home commission database and the Government&rsquo;s intention for Tusla to be the host organisation for the database, pending new legislation to deal with many challenges for many people regarding their information and identity.  I am conscious of the commentary about Tusla during recent weeks.  I assure the committee that notwithstanding the very complex legal issues that remain to be resolved, the only focus of Tusla regarding adoption information will be to give the maximum support to all people, to treat them with kindness and understanding and to respect not only the rights but the needs of all.  The absence of legislation to deal with the provision of information will continue to be a source of great anxiety for people and the resolution of this issue is beyond the reach of Tusla.  We welcome intended legislation to address this.<\/p><p> Committee members had some additional specific matters which the clerk brought to my attention and I will briefly address those here and in our subsequent discussion.  With regard to social work recruitment, Tusla now has for the first full year a clearly understood pay and numbers framework.  This ensures that there are clear targets for recruitment by grade and profession, there is clear certainty as to what the agency can afford and not, there is a more realistic investment of energy in workforce planning and there is a greater likelihood that new resources can be allocated in an evidence-based approach.<\/p><p> The target workforce for 2020 is 4,784 whole-time equivalents, and with 4,698 in place at the end of the third quarter, this is the most stable the agency has been in respect of almost full employment since its establishment, and this is a significant milestone.  I expect in the coming weeks to be able to add to that number following the recent welcome budget decisions of the Government.  <\/p><p> Of the 4,698 whole-time equivalents in place, 1,674 are social workers, which is approximately 100 below the funded target.  Of the staff, 1,360 are social care workers and the increasing emphasis of any new developments has and will be in front-line grades.<\/p><p>I advised the previous committee shortly after taking up post that I was concerned about the dependency on agency staffing, which then stood at more than 650, and I undertook to address this matter as a priority.  By March of this year we had completed a large-scale conversion of agency staff to Tusla employment, and more than 400 took up that offer.  Agency staff use is now set at a maximum of 250 for the entire organisation, and we have in fact consistently operated below that since March.  This has not only had financial benefits to the public purse and benefits to our overall approach to retention but has also contributed to improved continuity of service for the children and families we serve.  Social work graduates are relatively low in number for the needs of the country as there are now many employing authorities all seeking social workers.  One hundred graduates this year expressed an interest in working with Tusla, some 70 of whom have been successfully hired.  Overall, 238 social workers started with the agency in the first nine months of this year.  That is more than the total for any full year since 2015.  In the same period there have been 130 leavers, including 14 retirees.  I have recently met the new Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science regarding the possibility of increased supply, and the board of the agency will consider corresponding measures to attract new graduates to this most complex area of work.  I also wish to note that in addition to this work being complex, I am concerned about the increasing threats and intimidation of individual staff.  While this comes from a relatively small cohort of people and we enjoy good relationships with so many, the online treatment of some individually identifiable staff is a source of serious concern.<\/p><p> As for foster care recruitment, we are very fortunate in the Irish context to have an alternative care system which is an international leader when it comes to the numbers of children placed with foster carers as distinct from residential care.  More than 90% of children in State care are now with foster carers, and increasingly we see a strong representation of relatives as foster carers.  There is little doubt but that recruiting foster carers remains a challenge.  The agency has recently completed its second annual national campaign aimed at raising awareness and encouraging others to consider fostering.<\/p><p> As for the making of reports to Tusla, I understand and am aware of the interest of the committee in the steps after a referral - or what the committee refers to in its invitation letter as a complaint - is made to Tusla and information or feedback that goes to the person making the referral, particularly where this comes from a school.  The agency receives a very substantial number of referrals from schools, both mandated and welfare, and local staff will support the school as part of the overall approach to ensuring safety for children.  Schools have, and use regularly, access to our local duty teams to discuss approaches to concerns in addition to the actual formal referral being submitted.  I am happy to address with my colleagues any more specific questions on that process.<\/p><p> The Child and Family Agency has many challenges in one of the most complex areas of personal social service provision.  Despite these challenges, enormous good work of a very high quality is carried out every day by our staff in responding to 20,000 open cases, 6,000 children in care, 6,000 children in education support, many thousands in receipt of family support and specialised teams upholding regulation in more than 4,000 cr&egrave;che and preschool services.  There are many other discrete parts to Tusla providing important services.  I am happy to take any questions and, again, I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gloster.

All of that combined led to the very substantial concern that I talked about and was reflected in the significant reduction in our normal referrals by almost 540 per week for a number of weeks.<\/p><p> By the time we had reached level 5 we had attuned our services to ways of working.  We also accepted that we are an essential service provider in the sense of public and statutory services.

There is a lot of frustration among those who are mandated to refer complaints due to a lack of consistency, which is something Mr. Gloster mentioned in his opening statement.  They feel that there is a lack of consistency, particularly regarding thresholds.  As to when complaints come in, depending on who one deals with on a particular day, he or she either follows through and comes back very rapidly.<\/p> <p>  Increasingly, a lot of schools have found that Tusla is bouncing back on principals and designated liaison persons with the child ultimately losing out.  In the words of one designated liaison person in a school, \"there is a cover your ass culture in Tusla.\".  They take a complaint, one will hear something back but, invariably and increasingly,  it falls back on the school staff who have training but training that does not equal what Tusla personnel have in terms of competency.  I have heard about that failing from the grassroots up in terms of education and those who are mandatory reporters.  I hope that the witnesses can address this matter, particularly the consistency of thresholds.  Is there consistency within counties, regions and public health regions?  Does Tusla look at cases where it has come up short and train people inhouse in its support centres?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#E00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>The Deputy is 100% correct that there is no consistency.  That is why I have pointed it out as being the significant challenge for Tusla and that is what Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, pointed out to us.  Is there an improvement agenda?  Absolutely.  We have a nationwide practice model called Signs of Safety, which is central to our approach to protecting children.  I am not a social worker but the model is very significant to our professional staff and is progressing.<\/p> <p>  I share the Deputy's concern about thresholds.  With 55,000 referrals a year, the processing of those does, unfortunately, end up ensuring that the most critical and higher end cases come first.  There is an increasing attempt to make pathways for all of the other concerns, including the use of extensive family support services.  The chief social worker will now comment on the school referral issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>When referrals come in to the social work department from schools and a variety of other sources, and schools are one of our top two referrers, the referrals are assessed in the first instance.  As Mr. Gloster has said, we have introduced a programmed called Signs of Safety.  Teachers may experience a series of questions that come from the duty intake social worker who, again, is trying to establish if harm is present.  We have gone around each of the 17 areas to ensure that there is more consistency than what there has been in terms of the application of thresholds.  That means, with the Signs of Safety model, we ask more questions, establish whether harm has happened and provide appropriate support.  Often times that would be welfare services that are based in the local community.  Working through that, if concerns continue, schools are perfectly free to, and often do, come back and have that discussion with duty staff on the second or third occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Brophy"},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Is an inhouse document on threshold criteria circulated to people when they are put on the payroll of Tusla?

I note that time is against us, so perhaps Mr. Gloster can respond at the end and he could send me written responses to any questions he cannot answer.  I would appreciate that.<\/p> <p>  The first issue is the significant drop in referrals to Tusla and the child protection and welfare system during the restrictions.  As Mr. Gloster said, referrals dropped from 1,500 to 960.  What supports were put in place for children at risk given that many of the usual supports, such as cr&egrave;ches, schools, sports clubs and other activities and agencies they are involved in, were not available to them?  What has he learned from this process and what would he do differently on the next occasion?  In addition, Mr. Gloster referred to the increase of referrals to 1,300 per week, but that is still a drop of 200 on the number before the pandemic.  This concerns me and raises a red flag because in other sectors we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of those trying to access services such as mental health services, addiction services and domestic violence services.  The reduction goes against the norm so perhaps Mr. Gloster will comment on that.<\/p> <p>  To return to domestic violence, there has been a dramatic and heartbreaking increase in the number of people seeking help due to domestic violence.  I have been in contact with refuges in my constituency and they have been inundated.  They often operate above capacity and have had to place mothers and children in hotels to keep them safe because there is not enough room in the refuges.  Tusla received an increase of &euro;68 million in funding in the last budget.  How much of this will be ring-fenced for domestic violence services?  For what, exactly, will the money be used?<\/p> <p>  I note Mr. Gloster's comment that the structure and organisation of Tusla are not good, and appreciate him acknowledging it.  I wish to focus on two areas.  According to data I received in a reply to a parliamentary question, at the end of August this year there were 3,799 children waiting to be allocated a social worker.  There is a clear pathway for a child to be allocated a social worker, and Mr. Gloster can correct me if I am wrong in this regard.  First, a concern is raised that a child is at risk.  That could be by a family member, member of the public, a teacher or youth worker, for example.  The case is then screened and if it is decided that there is still a risk, it is referred to the duty social worker.  If the duty social worker decides there is a risk to the child, the case is sent for assessment.  After the assessment stage, the child is put on a waiting list for allocation of a social worker.  At every stage from concern, screening and duty social worker to awaiting allocation of the social worker it is deemed that the child is at risk.  Having 3,799 children at risk while waiting for a social worker is simply not good enough and must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I was also shocked to see that the area I represent has the highest number of children waiting for a social worker.  Some 833 children in Dublin South-West, Kildare and Wicklow have gone through the process I outlined and are deemed at risk, but they still have not been allocated a social worker.  Too many children are falling through the gaps.  What changes will be made to address this issue and to ensure that the position improves dramatically and very quickly?<\/p> <p>  My last point relates to retention of staff.  In my previous role as an addiction support worker, I attended numerous case conferences with Tusla.  These often occurred over time.  The people in attendance were the parent or parents of the child at risk, the teacher, support workers like me, social workers and area managers from Tusla.  Often the area manager and social worker who attended the follow-up meetings were not the same people who attended the first meeting.  This would have an impact on the continuum of care and continuity in the process.  I was the same support worker and the parent and teacher were the same, but the representation from Tusla was not always the same.  As Mr. Gloster mentioned, up to September this year Tusla has hired 238 new staff, but in the same time 116 people left Tusla and are not returning.  What is the impact on the service provided to children at risk of losing so many experienced people and replacing them with people who are only learning the role?  What will Mr. Gloster put in place to retain staff and ensure the continuity of care I mentioned earlier?<\/p><p>I did not need much time and I will take any answers I can get to my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#F00200","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The questions I want to deal with first are the unallocated cases and the issue of domestic violence.

I will deal with two aspects regarding the unallocated cases and the provision regarding domestic, sexual and gender based violence, DSGBV, services.  As the Deputy said, the number of unallocated cases remains a concern for us.  However, 94% of children in care have an allocated social worker and 75% of other children in care also have an allocated social worker.  Of those who are awaiting allocation, 44% of them are active on duty.  That means - to return to the Deputy's reference to the risk of harm or of abuse that may be in place - actions are being undertaken for those children's care by a dedicated duty team, social workers or by a rotating social worker off the roster.  It is a significant challenge for us.  It is one on which we have put a significant focus.  Certainly, since I joined the agency in August it has been a priority for me.  Since January to date, there has been a 31% decrease but, as the Deputy said, there are a number of areas with respect to Dublin-South-West, Kildare-west Wicklow and Dublin South-Central where it still remains a problem for us.  That is linked to a number of factors, including increased referral and the staffing rates within those areas.  Towards the end of the year we allocated initial once-off funding of about &euro;150,000 and have taken in additional staff to address that need.  Regarding additional resources in the allocation for 2021, the chief executive officer, CEO, might deal with that.  Our focus will be on those specific areas where the unallocated cases are a problem for us.  I reassure the Deputy those children who may not have a dedicated named social worker are actively being managed by the social work service within the Department.<\/p> <p>  Regarding DSGBV services, we all share the concerns in the demand we have seen for them in the context of Covid-19 and throughout the pandemic since March.  In terms of our services, I will leave it to the CEO to talk about the additional funding in the 2021 budget.  However, directly in respect of Covid, Tusla funds 60 agencies currently across Ireland to provide DSGBV services.  In terms of the accommodation we support, currently there are 143 accommodation units open, 103 of which are our normal units.  As the Deputy said, with the impact of Covid, there has been a reduction in about 36 with respect to social distancing and staffing.  There are 103 of the original 139 allocation.  We have funded 25 additional off-site units and an additional 15 safe homes.  The capacity currently is for 143 units and 106 of those are currently occupied.  Certainly we do share the concern about access being an issue, particularly in certain parts of the country.  We have commissioned an accommodation review which Tusla is undertaking, which will be finished in quarter 2 of 2021.  It will map out the existing accommodation units that are available in terms of geographical location and the type of service they offer, also identifying, as part of that, the future requirements, including the service model, as we move beyond 2021.  I will defer to the CEO to deal with the additional budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Duggan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Briefly, the funding for domestic violence services within Tusla is a spend of &euro;25 million.  That is the current core budget.  The budget is increasing next year essentially to &euro;30 million, which is what the Deputy would have heard the Minister refer to in recent days.  That money is essentially broken into a &euro;2.7 million increase in core funding and another &euro;2 million will go directly to the funded agencies providing services as part of contingency support for them, as we see how the impact of Covid unfolds in the first half of 2021.  The impact is as much in the post-easing of restrictions as is it during the restrictions.  That addresses the money aspect.<\/p><p>I take the point about the structure and the Deputy was acknowledging what I had said.<\/p><p> On referrals, we are running at between 1,300 and 1,350 per week and we had previously been up between 1,490 and 1,500.  Those variations can happen, partly because the schools are settling down in the reopening phase and a lot of health professionals who would have been seeing children in routine circumstances are not seeing them in the same routine way because the health services are significantly redeployed and focused on different parts of the response to Covid-19.  There are a variety of reasons for that and it also has to do with catch-up in our system.  Once the referrals started to recover, the concern eased.<\/p><p> I mentioned the support for children at risk during the first lockdown.  I thanked the community and voluntary sector, in particular, as well as the school completion programmes and our staff in centres around the country.  The amount of work that went into making contact with and keeping an eye on children and families in a supportive way was extensive and I am satisfied with that response.  In addition, I mention children who might have been seen as being at risk in the context of the domestic violence space.  The Garda's Operation Faoiseamh was an outstanding contributor to public safety for some of the most vulnerable people during that March and April phase.  Now that schools and everything else are open, that is the most significant change.  I know there was a lot of commentary and discussion about schools as we were going into level 5.  Everybody clearly understands and accepts the need to keep the school system as open and safe as possible, not just for the educational benefits but for all the other issues that have been mentioned.<\/p><p> I could not agree more with the Deputy about the retention of staff.  It is part of the consistency issue that I and the agency are seeking to address but it takes time.  Our retention rates have improved, however, and our capacity to increase recruitment has improved.  The Deputy mentioned the additional funding in the budget adjustment of &euro;61 million to Tusla.  Part of that is correcting a deficit of &euro;13 million that was already there but I envisage being able to deploy approximately 100 to 120 additional front-line staff in 2021.  That would go a substantial way towards addressing the concern the Deputy expressed about the allocated cases because that is exactly where the resources and money will go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I have a lot of things to ask about but I will try to focus on five minutes' worth of issues.  The agency conversion was good work and it has helped with that stability of staffing and workforce, which is so important for all sorts of reasons.<\/p> <p>  The investment in mobile working through laptops, remote access, Wi-Fi dongles and so on not only reflects the way social workers work and enables them to work but it has been a major benefit in the face of Covid-19 to enable working from home and working remotely.  That has to be highlighted as a success of Tusla in recent years.<\/p> <p>  On the targets for the workforce, I would love to know more about the figure of 4,784 and how Tusla got that.  If one looks at the UK, a huge amount of work goes into trying to estimate the demand for social work services, both in staffing and in fostering and recruitment.  There are measures of flow in which one can guess the number of children who are likely to come into care based on demographics.  We have measures for the pressure so we know how many cases a social worker should be carrying.  Therefore, we should be able to work out how many social workers we need.  However, what I hear from social workers on the ground is frustration at the lack of administrative support.  The cases they carry still have a huge amount of paperwork.  I hear frustration from some senior managers on a hiring freeze and a struggle to get posts filled.  I would love to hear more about that kind of work from the witnesses because that ties in with all of the important points that were previously raised.<\/p> <p>  One of the other matters I would like to jump to is fostering.  How many people within Tusla do nothing but recruitment?  Recruitment of general foster carers is on a knife-edge.<\/p><p>We have an excellent system with excellent carers who provide an excellent service to vulnerable young people and it is really on a knife edge if we cannot keep recruiting.  How many people do nothing but recruitment?  How many of them come with a marketing or similar background?  My concern regarding keeping the service going is that we will rely more on private fostering, which has a significantly higher marginal cost, and children placed in private care also tend to be placed further from their home, which has all sorts of other impacts.  We also have huge runaway costs in terms of private residential units, so any information Mr. Gloster has on steps being taken on cost control for private fostering and private residential units would be useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#H00200","speaker":"1570","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>That is a long list.  I will do the best I can to quickly respond.  Deputy Costello is correct that the agency conversion was very significant and it brought many benefits.  Our mobile technology went from about 3,800 people at the start of Covid and we took it right up to the maximum of about 4,300 to ensure that we could remotely work across the system and that has brought huge benefits.<\/p> <p>  To be clear, the workforce of 4,784 is not indicative of need.  The Deputy is quite right that is not based on a needs assessment.  What I am talking about is the funded workforce within Tusla.  In other words, that is the number we have money to employ.  There are lots of models around need and need identification.  I will let Ms Duggan speak in a moment about some of the approach taken to 2021 because the approach up to more recent years was somewhat historical.<\/p> <p>  Administrative staff have substantially increased in terms of grade 3 and grade 4 clerical officers, who support social work teams.  While there was an increase, it could always be more because, as the Deputy is aware, the regulatory burden on child protection services is very high.  The paperwork requirement is very high, but the situation has improved substantially from what it was.<\/p> <p>  I find the reference to a hiring freeze a little bit frustrating because since I came to Tusla there has been anything but a hiring freeze.  What there has been is complete clarity for each of our regions as to what its affordable workforce was, and they were allowed to recruit to that.  In 2020, that included an agreement with the Minister not to reduce any services because we had a deficit.  The deficit has now been dealt with in the allocation coming into 2021 but we were going to finish 2020 with a deficit and that was going to happen because we were not going to cut services.  The hiring freeze is somewhat debatable.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Ms Duggan to talk about the fostering campaign in terms of fostering recruitment.  I do not have the exact number of people solely focused on the recruitment of foster carers.  I will have to come back to the Deputy on that.  We do have communications experts involved.  Ms Duggan might wish to briefly comment on the recruitment of foster carers and recruitment generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>As the Deputy said, the foster caring service performs very well internationally in terms of the overall number of children in care and those that are in foster care.  Within Tusla at the moment, there are approximately 5,913 children in care in Ireland and 91% of those are in foster care.  Some 29% of them were with relative foster carers and 71% were with non-relative foster carers.  Approximately 8% are within private foster care.  As the Deputy referenced, there has been a small increase in the number of children within private foster care placements.  That is linked either to the availability of foster carers within a particular area or within the match that is required in terms of the presentation of the particular child or children within the family.  Our priority within Tusla, as the Deputy is aware, is to provide the best placement for a child, relative to what the child needs or requires.<\/p> <p>  To date in 2020, we have 194 new foster carers approved within Tusla and 28 private applications for foster caring.  That is compared to 226 for the whole year in 2019, which was 193 approved within Tusla and 33 private foster carers.  I share the view that we need to look at fostering staff having almost an expertise in marketing because we are up against the private agency in terms of its capacity and the type of marketing it uses to attract carers and families within geographical regions.<\/p><p> What I can say is that in this year's Tusla fostering campaign, called Raising Amazing, a significant amount of work went into it from a marketing perspective, particularly in relation to debunking some of the myths that exist about the types of people who we want to become foster carers within communities.  A lot of work was done in respect of attracting minority families and letting them know that we want them to apply and to become foster carers.  Within that campaign we received a total of 311 enquiries, which was up 67 on last year's total.  A huge part of the campaign this year was around social media, and we had social media expertise supporting us on that campaign.  We had around 240,000 hits across all of the different social media platforms in Tusla, so we recognise the need to move into a different space in terms of attracting foster carers to Tusla and in debunking the myths so that people across Ireland, from all different types of families or units, understand that we want to hear from them in expressing an interest in becoming foster carers for Tusla.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their opening remarks and their answers so far.

Of the &euro;25.3 million provided in 2020, the majority of that, about &euro;23.5 million, has been given directly to the 60 provider agencies that operate on our behalf in the space of domestic violence response, including Safe Ireland and many others.  All of the increase in funding in 2021 is going directly to that sector, so Tusla's own internal direct spend is not increasing.  The increase will essentially break down as follows.  A total of &euro;2.7 million will go into what is called core funding, so from January, the sector will increase by &euro;2.7 million.  The actual allocation to individual agencies has not yet been finalised within that because it is not simply a case of dividing &euro;2.7 million by 60 agencies, because although they all have needs, some have different pressures.<\/p> <p>  That funding takes the funding for the sector up to &euro;28 million, and in addition to that, provision has been made to set aside &euro;2 million specifically to support the sector through those organisations to respond further to what are unknown challenges that Covid has yet to bring for the sector.

It is a good training programme on which there is very good feedback.  Our target is to reach over 3,000 front-line workers by the end of January and to date we have reached around 1,100.  A huge effort is going into it but we are some way off reaching a satisfactory level of GDPR compliance because we process information in tens of thousands of interactions throughout the year.

I begin by thanking Tusla for the work it does.  I thank all the area managers, the individual social workers and all those in the emergency services who work day in, day out with very vulnerable children who are going through a lot in their lives.  I can see that these people are under a lot of strain and I thank them because they are providing our society with an invaluable service.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions about aftercare.  What is the fallout for those who do not go into education or training?  Where do those children go?  Are there any supports for those young people?  Recently I have noticed that there is a lot of sexual and gender-based violence towards the children who are coming into care.  Maybe that is something we need to teach in all our schools or go through with parents.  I do not know how Tusla will deal with that.  Many of the children coming into care now are struggling with their sexuality or struggling with having those conversations with their parents, who may not be as understanding as we would like them to be.<\/p><p>That is when relationships can break down.  I was not aware of the family support services that exist in Tusla.  I want more information on them because they are new to me.  I understand there is a support service for existing family units that may be struggling with issues.  What supports does Tusla put in place for those families, rather than having them break up?  <\/p><p> I am concerned about the 1,300 new inquiries being received weekly.  That is a massive amount.  Considering Tusla's staffing, there will be children who will not be seen as quickly as they should be.  It is important that children and young people know that if they are suffering, they should speak to the one good adult in their life who can be their voice in a very tough time, and that they can seek refuge somewhere.  Some people take the young people to Garda stations and they are taken into care under section 12 in that way.  There is help for children and young people who are suffering and it can be immediate if they are in danger.  I want people to know that.  Some people think there is a long wait for care, but that is not the case.  The services kick in very quickly when a child or youth is in danger.  <\/p><p> I want to know about aftercare and foster care recruitment.  I attended a number of meetings.  It is incumbent on people who are involved in the foster care system to encourage other parents and other family units, regardless of what they are, to get involved and to provide a safe, loving and caring home for a young child.  Recruitment meetings are really important and getting testimonies from parents and foster parents is the key to winning over new foster parents.  It is probably one of the best things I have ever done.  Sitting here is important but there is nothing quite like creating a safe place for a child.  I do emergency care now.  That is really important.  Parents, families and individuals need to know that they can make a difference in a child's life.  What is Tusla doing about recruitment, which is so important?  It is much better for a child to be in a family unit or family home than in a residential unit.  How many residential units are in the State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#L00400","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>The Senator's commentary based on her lived experience probably says far more about the value, benefit and necessity of foster care than I ever could.

In many cases, these supports are provided up to the age of 23.  I am concerned that many of the supports are sometimes limited within the parameters of traditional continuing education.  There must be other options for people in this category.  We provided a great deal of additional supports during the Covid-19 response.  We extended all the dates on which people might have been due to leave care or exit formal aftercare.  We have extended those dates right up to Christmas to ensure that additional vulnerability was not brought to them.  There is no doubt that there is an increasing need for additional aftercare supports.  I am very glad to see it on the agenda, being driven by care leavers along with many groups such as EPIC and Aftercare Ireland that we engage with.

As Mr. Gloster outlined, a significant number of children and families access Tusla welfare services.  Those services are delivered by Tusla staff in conjunction with the community and voluntary sector.  Mr. Gloster referred to that when he spoke about how we have supported families and children in the context of Covid-19.  Simple examples would include how services, staff, and the community and voluntary sectors worked in partnership in each of the 17 local areas to support families during Covid-19, for example by providing advice and guidelines, offering food parcels or helping people to access online education at home.  It is very much around supporting families within the area of welfare.<\/p> <p>  Prevention, partnership and family support, PPFS, is a significant service in Tusla which looks at children and families who do not meet the threshold of being at risk of harm or abuse when there are concerns about supporting them to remain as a unit or access education or helping them to meet any of their wider holistic needs.  A significant part of that programme is the Meitheal assessment, which is done with families with inter-agency involvement to assess the particular needs of a child who is presenting with a welfare need, for example, or has a complex disability and is living at home.  It is a question of how the services in a child&rsquo;s life wrap around the child in identifying what they best need to support them and their families at home and prevent them from reaching a threshold for protection services or coming into care.  In the first six months of 2020, over 1,075 Meitheal processes were requested, which is an increase on last year.  Each of the 17 areas has family support networks that wrap around the child.  The needs are very much around welfare in relation to care, being able to access education and early intervention.<\/p> <p>  Another very significant group in relation to welfare are the children and young people's services committees that are in place in the various areas.  Again, this is a multi-agency approach to responding to the needs of particular families and communities.

We are very aware of that and are raising it through our own services so that people would be additionally aware of it.  People in that community need to circulate and socialise outside their own families, because sometimes they do not feel accepted in a more community setting.  Our fostering services are really attuned to the needs of each child in care and for those who have particular needs in terms of sexuality, they would certainly be addressed.

The inspection in Cork was very specifically concerned with the child protection notification system.  Approximately 1,000 children in Ireland are on the child protection notification system today.  They have been through a very specific process.  HIQA's concern was about organisation, governance and the process of following up on the details of those cases.  A very detailed plan for this area was drawn up.  The plan was tested, scrutinised and monitored by HIQA and was to that body's satisfaction.  The plan has been accepted by HIQA and is well under way.  As I said in my opening statement, if I was asked for one word to define all the challenges that arise throughout a complex system like ours I would say \"consistency\".<\/p> <p>  To be fair to the Deputy, a report like that can crystallise concern in the mind of the reader and rightly so.  However, there are very significant examples and validated reports of very good work done by Tusla in Cork.  I would not want to lose sight of that balance.  The real test will be whether HIQA is satisfied with what it sees.  There are other concerns in the Cork area and other parts of the country, concerning not only child protection but the children in care service, the follow-up to care plans and so on.

As he rightly stated, in late 2019 Tusla became aware of an issue concerning the timeliness of referrals to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Such referrals were not being made within the desired timeframe.  We have to deal with approximately 1,200 cases per year in the Kerry area.  This audit indicated that of that number, 365 referrals were not made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a timely way.  As the Deputy noted, 122 of those were current cases and 243 were what we call \"retrospective cases\".  It is unacceptable that the Garda notification was not made in a timely manner in 122 current cases.  However, a social worker would be actioned to deal with any identified risks.<\/p> <p>  Immediate action was taken when Tusla identified that problem.  The notifications have all been made.  Tusla then examined the contributing factors.  As the Deputy noted, one of them concerned staffing.  There were also issues concerning practice and structure.  As the Deputy rightly said, interpretation of the correct timing of notifications was not consistent.  Views on when the notification should be made differed among social workers.  That can be caused by inconsistencies in practice in a certain area or varying levels of experience among social workers.  To immediately rectify that, a practice memo was developed in consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That was shared with everybody.  A staffing deficit was identified and additional staff have been assigned.  Services have also been restructured. <\/p> <p>  To ensure consistency, Tusla did not just look at the incident in Kerry.  The incident was understood as a symptom of a problem that could arise anywhere.  Other areas were audited to detect problems with Garda notification.  Tusla carried out an audit of 1,535 cases across 17 areas.  The organisation determined that there was a timeliness issue in 13% of those cases.  The practice memo and the associated guidance was shared throughout Tusla.  Our own audit team, which identified the first problem, will carry out another audit in early 2021 to check that this is no longer a problem.  We expect the changes to have been made by that point. <\/p> <p>  Returning to the Deputy's question on resources, the chief executive noted earlier that Tusla has a funded workforce of a certain size.  That is not to say that it is able to meet the increased demand arising from the increased number of referrals or the complex types of presentation we are seeing among children.<\/p><p>As Mr. Gloster referenced, there are going to be approximately 100 to 120 front-line posts going into the system in 2021.  My office is looking at targeting where that need is.  That work involves, for example, looking at the number of social workers per thousand children within the population.  It also looks at where there are issues with dealing with matters such as unallocated cases.  That is not to say that if we feel there are practice concerns or issues with how things could be done more efficiently, we will not look at those.  It is not about rewarding waiting lists but about recognising where there is a real need for additional resources.<\/p><p> In the challenging environment of recruiting additional social workers, we also have to look at the multidisciplinary approach to what a team looks like within a particular area.  One of the Deputy's colleagues referenced the administrative burden.  A report we have done demonstrates that we would be looking at a ratio of around one member of administrative staff to every four social workers to reduce that administrative burden.  We have to look within those extra 100 to 120 extra staff to see where they will deliver the greatest impact and where they are of greatest need to improve resources for 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.

I accept the statement of the CEO today in respect of moving the culture on or changing practices, culture and structures.  We accept the bona fides of the CEO in that respect.  When we use a term such as \"variation\", it is meaningless to me.  It suggests to me there is a massive variation in practices in different parts of the country when it comes to timelines and to how cases are dealt with.  If we are to be helpful to our constituents, we need to have a greater understanding of the culture that exists within.  To be frank about it, notwithstanding the CEO's statement today, which I find very helpful, my perception is that there is still a long way to go before a lot of the practices that are happening within the Child and Family Agency are deconstructed such that the services flow more seamlessly, as constrained and all as it is by staffing and other administrative challenges.

I missed the start of the meeting as I was at a meeting of the Committee on Justice, so I apologise if any of these points have been touched on previously.  I get the feeling that the majority of them may be for Ms Duggan on social work.<\/p> <p>  Child protection is the biggest turnover and it is the most front-facing part of the profession.  Where are we at in the retention of social workers?  How many cases on average would a social worker have or how many social workers would a child have, say, in a ten-year period?  In many of the families I support, some of the kids are in the system for six to ten years and they are already on their tenth social worker.  There would not even be any recognition or acknowledgement from Tusla that the social worker is changing and then a call will be made by the new social worker to introduce himself or herself.  Then the process begins again of the same old questions the child has had to reveal for many years.  This is a real issue.<\/p><p>Does Tusla have an idea of the average number of cases a social worker would have?  Also, what is the average number of social workers a child could have throughout his or her time in foster care or on the files of Tusla?  Where can one access the exit interview data of the hundreds of social workers who have left in recent years so that we can fix the issues?<\/p><p> I also have questions on Tusla's view on the imbalance between the foster parent and the child having a social worker but the parent not having his or her own social worker who would be his or her primary advocate and support in what is a difficult situation.  Many parents seek family reunification and engage in the process but they are at a complete disadvantage when they enter a room in relation to a social worker's advocacy and who it is for.  I would like to know Tusla's views on introducing a system whereby the parent who is looking for reunification has his or her own social worker support and representation.  Sometimes Tusla will allow a family member to be present at those meetings but as the witnesses can imagine, many of these families come from disadvantaged backgrounds.  While the family member might be able to emotionally support the person, he or she definitely cannot advocate in the same way a social worker can for the foster family or the children.<\/p><p> I would also like to know what supports are in place in regard to family reunification for a parent leaving the prison system, especially if the other parent is absent or may be deceased and if the children are living with a family member.  I am supporting two men and one woman who are in the process of looking for family reunification on their release from prison.  They have all said the same thing to me, that they are being discouraged at each meeting in regard to the potential for them to have their families reunified, even if they meet the criteria.  Given that Tusla states that family reunification is a priority, what supports does it provide and what emphasis does it place on people leaving the prison system in terms of supporting  family reunification?  I hope the witnesses managed to take note of all those questions.  I can repeat them if they did not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#Q00900","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>In the general sense, the average number of staff involved throughout a child's is very variable.

That will always add to the movement of staff.  Child protection work is, of itself, extremely complex.  It is recognised as being quite a stressful aspect of the work.

Tusla has developed a caseload management system over the past eight or nine years.  We have worked out this system with front-line practitioners where each social worker, with his or her team leader, works out what is a manageable caseload for that particular worker and then we monitor that in terms of manageable and unmanageable caseloads.  That is what we are doing to measure whether caseloads are manageable or not.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked a question about the reunification of families, how important that is and providing support for parents.  That is a subject that is dear to my heart.  We have made great efforts with the introduction of Signs of Safety, which has been a significant move on this.  In this, we are involving the networks of families in supporting parents to create safety for children.<\/p><p>It is not just that we want a family member to come in with a parent, for example, but we want parents to actively get friends and family - people who they trust and know, and who are their allies - to be involved in creating safety for children.  We will work with that network with the parent.<\/p><p> There is a process involved with this and a series of steps in the Signs of Safety model, including the creation of danger statements and safety goals.  We work with children and we use the three houses method to get their views and incorporate them into the process as well.

It is a very broad remit, and as a first-time committee member there is much for me to take in.  It is great that the witnesses could come in and go through that.<\/p> <p>  My first question relates to Covid-19.  Has Tusla come across many children who have completely disengaged from education because of Covid-19?  I know it has been a really difficult time and children who were already finding school harder or had difficulties at school or at home would have found it harder to go back.  Has Tusla identified how many children did not go back into education and what level of supports is it providing to those children?<\/p> <p>  I am trying to work to see what Tusla's processes are and how it engages with different families in different instances.  I imagine there are very many difficult positions in which Tusla is involved.  From a process perspective, I imagine that for each of the scenarios, Tusla has an identified process that staff would follow.  In particular, if there is an allegation of sexual abuse of a child by a party within his or her own family, what process does Tusla follow?  Is that articulated anywhere or publicly available?<\/p> <p>  I have heard anecdotally that families are having different experiences.  It is clearly very distressing for families and children.  They are wondering if their experience is standard.  In the event that families feel they have had experiences that would not be best practice in their mind, what would be their comeback?  Do they have anywhere they can go or anybody they can speak to about the experience they had with Tusla?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#T00300","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>As the Deputy knows, we operate the Tusla education support service, which is the former educational welfare officer service.  That service continued to work, even during school closures, supporting the vulnerable children who would have already been known to those officers.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 6,000 children per year are made known to the Tusla education support service because of various aspects of concern around attendance and associated matters.  It is a relatively small but nonetheless important number in the context of approximately 1 million schoolchildren in the country.  Schools report to us twice per year with a particular emphasis on absence over 20 days.  Where the absence over 20 days is explained and understood by the school, it is not an issue for our service.  Where it is not explained, the focus of attention must be to ensure children's right to an education.  We also want to see that the many other needs and supports that help children to access education are followed through.  That is what the service does very well.<\/p><p>We do not yet have full reporting back from schools on the returning to school phase, but in addition to the twice yearly report of school attendance, the service has followed up with a large number of schools and is obtaining data.  It has nearly completed that process.  These data will identify the number of children who did not return to school after the Covid restrictions.  While those data are not finalised and need to be scrutinised with the Department of Education, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and our own service, the head of the education support service has indicated to me that there is no major concern with regard to the number of children not returning to school after the Covid restrictions, as distinct from the number of children who would have been at risk of dropping out of school even in previous years, outside of the pandemic period.<\/p><p> Having said that, any child dropping out of school is a concern.  The support system for children who may not return to school is very extensive.  It comprises our education support service, the school completion programmes we fund in DEIS school areas and many other supports.  To be fair, the Department of Education itself went a significant distance to recognise the challenge for schools with regard to returning after the Covid restrictions.  Quite significant supports have been put into in that space.  It remains a work in progress but, at the moment, it seems to be going in accordance with what all the professionals would expect.<\/p><p> With regard to the process around referrals relating to sexual abuse and the different experiences people have had, I may ask the chief social worker, Mr. Ger Brophy, to comment briefly.

We also work very closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in providing services to the family, but again, if they are dissatisfied or if the services they need are not available, they may complain to the local social work department.

It seems to work very well in certain parts of the country but not so well in other parts.  Is there a way to identify where there is best practice and to mirror that in other areas?  Perhaps that is something Tusla is doing but this may increase public confidence.  Those are the only points I wished to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#U01000","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Plans for the budget allocation for 2021 will be published in the 2021 business plan, which has not yet been finalised.  We have only just heard the budget announcement.  The board of the agency will consider the outline approach to allocating the funds we have for next year this Friday.  To be clear, a significant portion of that &euro;61 million has already been spent.  The board of the agency will outline those plans after Friday.  I will certainly have no difficulty in providing information on that approach to committee members, even ahead of the publication of the actual plan.  We had particular costs this year and last year associated with disability cases in which there was also a child protection interest.  That represented a significant part of our deficit.<\/p> <p>  With regard to consistency, the Chairman is correct.  Approaching consistency across practice models has already been mentioned with regard to things like the child protection and welfare strategy, the Signs of Safety, and consistent approaches to family support.  The real issue to pursue, which I mentioned in the opening statement and which I have mentioned to Tusla as many times as I could and to the Chair  the first time I appeared before the committee in November 2019, is that Tusla is overcentralised, highly siloed and has an out-of-date structure for doing what the agency is charged with doing and tries to do.  <\/p> <p>  We have designed a fully changed structure, which the board of the agency approved earlier this year, at the end of January.  Since this involves changes to the structure of the agency and to some of the grading and positions involved in how the agency does its business, as opposed to money necessarily, it will require the approval of both the line Department, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is between the two Departments at the moment.  As I said, I am hoping that an engagement with the Minister very shortly will lead to a conclusion because implementing that type of change takes time and we really need to get on with it.  We are, however, continuing will all other aspects of change in the meantime to try to improve consistency.  <\/p> <p>  At the moment, we are operating in 17 areas where we have historically operated, divided into 32 smaller areas.  These are supervised through four regional offices and co-ordinated through a national centre.  The nature and type of response to cases will continue to be over-centralised.  The system is heavily burdened.  This adds to the impression of crisis given whenever there is an issue.  Child protection systems in most jurisdictions do not operate in this way.  There is no doubt but that there are many benefits to having a national agency, but we need to change the structure to achieve what we are attempting to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster"},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairperson for facilitating me.  I will take up some of my earlier questions and extend them a bit further.  The witnesses may recall that I raised the whole issue of consistency in reporting and in how thresholds are adhered to.  It is confusing and incredible that while Tusla has been around since 2014, the Children First Act was enacted in 2015 and training across all tiers of child protection services has been fully rolled out, the very agency that co-ordinates child protection in this country has not achieved consistency.  I find that hard to fathom.  I speak as someone who received training and who was on the front line in this area just a few months ago.  Many of my colleagues in the teaching sector are still very frustrated.<\/p><p>I would like to hear how Tusla will address that lack of consistency in thresholds.  It is one thing to train people and to know how to handle sensitive information and relay it up that chain of command but it is an entirely different thing to have confidence that the mechanisms of Tusla are working to protect that child at the end of that supply chain.<\/p><p> Tusla deals with many serious and genuine cases but as with all reporting mechanisms of State, there are those reports that turn out to be false or even vexatious.  I received an email in this regard some weeks ago and sometimes in an acrimonious break-up, everything gets thrown across the table in terms of accusations.  How does Tusla deal with an accusation that has clearly been established to be vexatious without a shred of truth to it?  Does it ever refer cases on to the Director of Public Prosecutions when its time as a State body has been wasted, when court time has been wasted and when real cases are being backlogged and kept out of those courts?  I would like to hear from the witnesses on that.  It would offer some assurance to people, so I hope for a response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#V00300","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I want to make one or two follow-up points on workforce planning and pick up on some of the other things that were said.

Has a needs assessment been done?  What sort of modelling is Tusla looking at?  There was talk of multidisciplinary teams.  Do the multidisciplinary teams and the nature of that make it into the needs assessment?  For example, if there are no access workers, it is possible that social workers could be looking at transport to and from access and supervising access eating a huge proportion of their time, which impacts on their ability to run other cases and all sorts of other things.  I am asking about that balance of the multidisciplinary teams, access workers, social care workers and therapeutic staff as part of that needs assessment.  The witnesses can give me a written answer on the workforce planning.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the family court Bill and the new family court building.  The Child and Family Agency will be a significant user of both and I trust that there has been adequate consultation with the Child and Family Agency from the Courts Service and the Department of Justice on both.

On what might be seen as vexatious reporting and the Deputy's reference to family law, in particular, there is a view abroad that Tusla is involved in every family law case, separation and divorce and in every issue in which there is a dispute around children.  That is not the case.  There are many thousands of those cases in the family courts that Tusla does not come into contact with.  There are facilities available to the court under the Act where, if in the course of those proceedings, a concern is expressed about the well-being of a child, the court can direct assessment under the provisions of the Act and Tusla carries out that assessment to the best of its ability.  In those cases, because Tusla's primary role is in relation to the safety and support of the children, we tend to look at what the safety and context is for the child, as distinct to looking at whether a particular incident or issue is substantiated or proven to be false or not.  I am not aware of any case in which Tusla would have made a complaint to the Garda or the Director of Public Prosecutions about what might be called a vexatious case.  There are many avenues for people to do that.<\/p> <p>  On the schools, I accept the Deputy's bona fides about the difference.  I have said that I accept there is a difference.  That is why it is extremely important to continue family support as opposed to just child protection.<\/p><p>Where I am anxious to get to in responding to the type of children teachers are concerned about is that we do not get to a stage where we are consistently talking about thresholds and that we are able to start talking about pathways for children.  If it is not at the threshold of child protection, that should not mean it is closed or stays standing.  It should get directed into a pathway in which the school and the family can still be supported in a meaningful way by the services and the State.  That is what the pathway of practice reforming in Tusla is targeted at and geared towards.  I accept that, for now, there are many situations in which that is a source of frustration for people and there is no point in me trying to deny that.  When a system is being changed, that takes a considerable period of time.  The Deputy's concern about the Child and Family Agency having that level of variation when it is, of itself, the protecting agency, is indicative of the history that the agency has come from through the health board and HSE eras to become Tusla, an agency operating across 17 areas of the country.<\/p><p> I will have to look more into the needs assessment issue that Deputy Costello raised.  I would not be prepared to commit to saying that a definitive needs assessment of what is needed will be done but there is comparative analysis with Northern Ireland, England and other jurisdictions as to the level of social work that is available in Ireland.  We are on the lower end of that.  I must confess that I have not heard of any particular activity involving Tusla and the family court building so I would need to check what might or might not be in that and to come back to the Deputy on that.<\/p><p> On the workforce plan, Deputy Costello asked me about recruitment earlier and I know he was talking about foster carers as well.  On staff recruitment, we have 22 dedicated staff working full-time in recruitment to try to manage and approve the recruitment process itself.  We are doing workforce planning for next year and we are looking at an evidence-based allocation of any new resources.  I do not see much point in trying to change the resource allocation of what has existed heretofore.  We would lose too much energy trying to move things around that way but workforce planning is critical.<\/p><p> On the needs assessment side, that is all tied into an interdepartmental group on social work education that is looking at that range of issues.  I entirely agree with the Deputy on the skill mix transfer of skills and on employing multidisciplinary teams, including social care workers and other staff, led by social workers providing responses.  That is as distinct from every child in every situation having to have a social worker assigned in the traditional model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2020112400002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Gloster","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":95,"content":"<p>The inconsistencies are a huge issue.

I am accompanied by Mr. Bernard Nolan, assistant principal and, by video link, Mr. Tom Woolley, marine planning adviser, both of whom are also members of the unit.<\/p><p> In order to support a marine that Ireland can use, enjoy and benefit from socially, environmentally and economically, the Government is putting in place a comprehensive new approach which will result in the biggest reform of marine governance in a century.  Two key work programmes for which my unit has responsibility are the national marine planning framework, NMPF, which sets out overarching and sectoral planning policies to shape marine development and activities to 2040, and the proposed marine planning and management Bill, which underpins the new planning system.  As the Bill is a key enabler of Ireland&rsquo;s decarbonisation goals, the programme for Government has committed to prioritising the passage of this balanced and Aarhus-compliant Bill through the Oireachtas by April.<\/p><p> The maritime area comprises approximately 490,000 sq. km and extends eastward in excess of 200 nautical miles in parts.  This area is seven times our land area: Ireland is 85% water.  The current marine consent system only covers the foreshore area, which covers some 12 nautical miles offshore.  A planning system generally comprises three main elements: forward planning, development management and enforcement.  The existing system lacks coherence and consistency.  There is no forward planning framework, multiple development management systems are operating independently and enforcement is fragmented.  This Bill is the State&rsquo;s vanguard response to the pressing need for reform of marine governance.  The draft Bill gives legal underpinning to an entirely new marine planning system for a coherent, end-to-end forward planning, development management and enforcement regime.<\/p><p> Our marine planning system will move towards being plan-led through the NMPF.  The NMPF is a parallel document to the national planning framework, NPF.  Both of these spatial plans are concerned with the long-term future of our land and sea areas and with identifying opportunities for protection, growth and development so that our land and marine areas can be managed in the best interests of the public.  The NPF recognises the importance of integration and co-ordination with the land planning regime at national, regional and local levels.<\/p><p> In future, it will be equally important in turn that national, regional and local terrestrial plans are consistent with the NMPF, and they will be required to do so under the provisions of the proposed Bill.  Many activities and uses that take place on land or in the sea can have impacts on the land and the maritime area.  This Bill will require that these interactions be considered.  This Bill provides for strategic marine activity zones.  Any Minister can bring forward zone designation proposals, subject to public participation and collective Government decision.  Once approved, the zone becomes part of the NMPF.  This ensures there is a joined-up approach to marine forward planning, with binding considerations for decision makers.<\/p><p> The proposed Bill will replace the antiquated Foreshore Act 1933 with a new maritime area consent, MAC, to manage the occupation of the maritime area.  This means that a MAC will be issued by the relevant Minister.  On receipt of the MAC, a developer can then, and only then, proceed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la or a local authority for planning permission as appropriate.  This streamlines the application process into a two-stage procedure.  This sequential regime, with clearly delineated roles for Ministers and planning authorities, streamlines the existing disjointed system and ensures a single environmental assessment.  Following a recent decision by the Government, an independent enforcement body will be established to assume the marine planning enforcement role.  The Department is currently reviewing advice from the Office of the Attorney General concerning the establishment of this agency and will update the Bill accordingly. <\/p><p> The pillars of the Aarhus Convention are the foundation on which the marine planning and development management Bill regime stands.  Effective and meaningful public participation is a fundamental feature of the new regime at policy and project levels.  Participation at a policy level maximises the opportunities for the public to influence how decisions are made.  Pre-application requirements ensure visibility of projects and early consideration of issues by developers.<\/p><p>Established planning procedures provide the formal engagement opportunity in the context of comprehensive project information.<\/p><p> Marine planning and development management will deliver a better planned and better managed maritime area, with a co-ordinated, inclusive and coherent approach to decision-making and governance, including the long-term vision for proper management, enforcement and environmental protection of our seas.

I am the principal officer in the offshore energy environment and consenting unit of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  I am accompanied today by Anne-Marie Clancy, who is an assistant principal in the unit.<\/p> <p>  The Government has committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, which was recently published, will commit Ireland in law to move to a climate resilient and climate-neutral economy by 2050.<\/p> <p>  The target of delivering 70% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity by 2030 from renewable sources will play a key role in delivering on our overall energy and climate targets.  Onshore wind, which supplied almost one third of electricity in 2019, has underpinned recent progress in greening our electricity supply, with renewables accounting for 38% of electricity generated in 2019.  The programme for Government has further increased the level of ambition, committing to 5 GW capacity in offshore wind by 2030 off Ireland&rsquo;s eastern and southern coasts.  It also includes a commitment to explore the longer-term potential for at least 30 GW of floating wind in the Atlantic.<\/p> <p>  As our colleagues said, our sea area is seven times our land area, one of the largest sea-to-land ratios of any EU state.  Consequently, the offshore wind sector has very significant potential to substantially contribute to meeting our energy and climate needs.  Targets set out under EU Green Deal and recently published offshore energy strategy affirm this direction, with increased focus on the potential offered by technology developments in the areas of wind, wave, tidal energy and green hydrogen.<\/p> <p>  Investment required to meet the 5 GW target by 2030 is estimated to be of the order of &euro;10 billion.  This has the potential to deliver many high-quality jobs, while also contributing towards the sustainable growth of our economy.<\/p> <p>  Offshore renewable energy, ORE, projects typically take eight to ten years from inception through planning and development to become operational.  Certainty and stability are crucial for triggering the significant levels of upfront investment required for these large-scale projects.  The delivery of a streamlined, modern and up-to-date regulatory planning framework is one of the essential steps to enable this and is a priority for this Department.<\/p> <p>  We have been working closely with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the development of the marine planning and development management Bill.  In tandem, we are building out the State consenting process that will be required for the ORE sector.<\/p> <p>  We believe the approach set out offers a robust regime for the effective management of our significant maritime resources, while ensuring appropriate protections for the marine environment, with public consultation a fundamental feature.  The provisions specific to ORE will enable the transition to a plan-led regime in the long term, while also enabling projects that have been initiated under the current foreshore regime to progress under the marine planning and development management Bill.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that these relevant projects will be required to apply separately for both marine area consent and planning permission under the proposed new regime.  These applications will require full assessment against all financial, technical and environmental standards, with public consultation and environmental assessment key components at the planning permission stage.<\/p> <p>  We view the proposals within this Bill, taken together with the marine spatial planning work being progressed by Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as offering significant advantages in moving to a planned, holistic approach to the sustainable development of our marine resources.  In this context, it is important to note that strategic marine activity zones can allow for shared use by different sectors.  In the case of ORE, we can learn from the many successful examples in Europe of a range of marine activities coexisting alongside wind farm developments.<\/p><p>The sharing of information and constructive engagement by all marine users will be critical to achieving this coexistence and this Department is fully committed to initiatives in this area, including those proposed to engage with fishing communities in the first instance.<\/p><p> In summary, the offshore renewable energy, ORE, sector offers significant potential for greening our energy supply and meeting our climate goals while also enabling the sustainable growth of our economy.  The timely establishment of a robust, transparent and effective planning regime for our maritime resource is essential to enable the ORE sector to become established while also improving the management and protection of our valuable offshore resources.  That concludes my statement and we are happy to respond to any questions the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Martina Hennessy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for the briefings we received in advance of the meeting.  It is important to say, on behalf of the Government, that this is a key commitment in the programme for Government and how we tackle climate action.  Much human activity has an impact on our environment and there is a balance of compromises in many ways.  If we are to continue our current level of human activity on the planet, we will have to look for ways for it to be sustainable.  Offshore renewable energy is one of the key ways we can do this.  Inevitably, there will be compromise but any such compromise would be far better than many of the fossil-led ways in which we have provided energy to our society.<\/p> <p>  This legislation will also provide major opportunity for Ireland.  The operations in the UK have approximately 15% or 16% of all ORE activity on the planet, so we can see the potential for a small island nation like Ireland to be able to tap into a renewable resource.  Not only do I welcome it, I encourage the Departments to do everything in their power to ensure the programme for Government commitment to legislate for this within the first year is realised.  We must do our bit as well.<\/p> <p>  There are areas of some concern.  How will the projects picked for the transitional period be dealt with?  The second question relates to community benefit.  It is a concept that is well understood by many public representatives and often there is an immediate impact.  For an offshore project like this, it is harder to define what is a community.  Does a visual detraction necessarily mean there must be a community benefit for the area?  Should it be a community benefit for the State in how it uses energy?  There are no hard and fast guidelines but I know in Scotland there is a figure of 20% that is used.<\/p> <p>  My last question relates to the 18-week period.  Is there some discussion that this could perhaps be pushed to 26 weeks or is the Department opposed to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#E00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>We will address the third question if our colleagues address the first two parts of the contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor McCabe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Relevant projects have been designated as part of the transition and it is important to note that they have already been involved with significant work over a number of years in the Irish Sea.

I will start with just a comment and then ask five specific questions.  I might have some additional questions in the next round if we get to it.<\/p> <p>  This is once-in-a-generation legislation.  It seeks to put in place a comprehensive planning regime for foreshore and deepshore.  It is the single longest piece of legislation I have ever dealt with, which means we have a particularly onerous responsibility to make sure we scrutinise it fully and get it right.  It is important to emphasise that this is not just about wind but about how we treat our entire marine area.  Therefore, it is not just about windfarms but also about aquaculture, fisheries, biodiversity - all those activities.  It is probably unfortunate - and it is no criticism of anyone here - that we are dealing with the planning Bill before we have considered the planning framework in terms of the process because the planning framework, if I understand it right, is the overarching context within which any planning legislation and planning decision would have to take place.  It is important Members understand that we have a legal obligation to produce that planning framework by March of this year.  Part of that includes having both a spatial and a temporal plan for the marine within which decisions such as decisions on planning applications can then be made.  In that context, my questions are as follows.<\/p> <p>  There is some concern that the marine planning framework in its draft form is not fully compliant with the marine spatial planning directive, particularly Article 8.1 of the directive, to have a spatial and temporal plan for the marine.<\/p><p>How satisfied are both Departments that when the final marine plan is in place, it will fully comply with the directive, particularly Article 8.1?<\/p><p> I have raised a concern before with respect to the marine protected areas.  We were meant to have 10% by this year but we have chronically failed to do that and we have a very ambitious target of 30% by 2030.  Can the witnesses update us on progress? <\/p><p> In the absence of having properly designed marine planning areas, in parallel with the planning legislation, what is the potential for conflicts of interest between applications for wind farms, for example, and concern over marine biodiversity in what could be marine protected areas?  Could these conflicts end up in judicial review thus delaying, for example, some of the seven transitional projects or other projects after that?<\/p><p> I am very concerned about the consent process and the absence of an environmental impact assessment, EIA, and public consultation.  Have the witnesses been given advice by the Attorney General to say that the non-inclusion of environmental impact assessments and public consultations in the consent decision complies with both the Aarhus Convention and the EIA directive?  Can they explain why fishing and aquaculture have not been covered in the general scheme?  Is there an intention to include deep-sea mining and liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals?<\/p><p> Finally, when will the report of Dr. Tasman Crowe will be published?  The Department and the Minister have seen it but we, the public and other organisation with a vested interest have not.  The report is materially relevant to a lot of these discussions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#F00800","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>There were a lot of questions there and we will try to work through them.

As the Deputy has rightly said, a report has been submitted to my Minister by an expert group chaired by Dr. Tasman Crowe.

On the back of that public consultation, the expectation is that legislation will follow in 2021.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of fishing and aquaculture, fishing is a European competence so it would not be appropriate to put it into this regime.  There is potential for aquaculture to come into this regime at a later date but that is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The regime, as we have tried to construct it, is not just geared towards offshore wind, telecommunication cables, etc.  It is geared so that any marine activity could come under this regime, which was very much at the forefront of our minds when we constructed it so aquaculture could well come in, in the foreseeable future.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor McCabe"},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>What about liquefied natural gas, LNG, and deep-sea mining?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#G00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Deep-sea mining is not currently part of the Bill.

We have worked hard to include as much of that information as possible.  One of the questions we asked during the consultation on the baseline report was exactly how spatial people wanted the plan to be.  The overriding response we received was that people would prefer a strategic focused plan at this stage.  While it is true that the plan does not include many varied spatial policies which state that in the next 20 years we want this activity in this exact space and that is how it is going to work, what we have done is respond to stakeholder direction and outline clearly, for the first time in Ireland, the distribution of the multiple activities that happen in Ireland's maritime area.<\/p><p> We worked very closely with the Marine Institute on a series of quite detailed and, in some cases, minute maps that appear in the MNPF.  The aim of that and communicating the spatial distribution of those activities is to ensure that all users of the maritime area are aware of what is happening where.  To support that effort further, we are working again with geographic information system, GIS, colleagues in our Department and the Marine Institute to develop a digital tool that will communicate those maps, which we hope to have in place to accompany the launch of the NMPF.  Not only will we have the static maps that show distribution of activities in the maritime area in the PDF and paper version of the plan at the launch, we are also committing to ensuring that data is kept up to date in line with the plan.  While the plan policies stay in place and they are relevant for the 20-year period of the plan, the best available data and spatial information that people could use in applying the plan in their decisions are updated regularly.<\/p><p> We hope that approach will address Article 8.1 thoroughly.  We have been working closely with, and looking at the work of, other jurisdictions on this to inform how we approach spatial representation and support tools for marine spatial planning.  We hope we are pursuing routes to ensure that we are meeting that Article.

I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee and giving their presentation.  As has been described, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to set the framework that will ultimately guide our policy over the coming decades in this critical area.  It will be responsible for delivering our renewable energy into the future and meeting our very ambitious targets in this area.  I welcome the comment on the Bill that more items can be added into the future.  It is not just for wind, even though that is the way it is being understood.  With regard to the five relevant projects that have been picked, could the witnesses give me an idea of how they were arrived at?  I am more interested in future projects and the pipeline of projects that exist that will ultimately be able to use this legislation in the future.  I am from Waterford and there is an extensive plan for offshore wind energy between Helvick and Dunmmore East.<\/p><p>That plan is in process but where does it fit in with the next stage of this process and the timelines around that, which will be reflected in how long it takes us to get this legislation through the Houses?

The five relevant projects the Senator referenced are very much the initial number of projects we see being necessary as part of a pipeline.  If we are to reach the 5 GW target by 2030, more projects will be required because the current projects that have been identified will only deliver half of that target if they get through the full planning system but there are no guarantees of that.  It is important we view that 2030 target as a milestone.  It is not a ceiling or an endpoint.  The ambition is that whenever this Bill is enacted we would see a range of projects progress through the planning system whereby there would be a staggered delivery of projects over a period up to 2030 and beyond.  We would expect the current relevant projects if they begin to go through the planning process, if this Bill is enacted, start to come on line from around 2026 onwards.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of reasons the initial focus is on the east coast.  The current technology that offers the best commercial opportunities is based on fixed turbines.  The east coast has shallow water that is best suited to fixed turbine devices being installed.  There is a necessity to be able to connect to the grid.  While EirGrid is building out its roadmap to support the extension of offshore renewable energy projects it will primarily be focused on the east coast and then move on to the south coast over the next decade or so to enable connection to the grid.  <\/p> <p>  The greatest demand is on the east coast.  There are a number of reasons the developments are concentrated initially on the east coast.  The south and west coasts, because they have deeper water, are more suited to different types of technology that are at the earlier stages of development such as floating wind power and there are also opportunities for tidal and wave energy.  Those developments on those coasts will offer future development opportunity beyond 2030 to get into the export market.<\/p> <p>  We envisage the initial project would start to progress through the marine planning and development management, MPDM, regime, once the legislation is enacted.  We are working on identifying the next batch of viable projects.  That is an important consideration.  We have to examine what has the potential to be delivered and become operational.  We are still working through the criteria to identify what those projects in the next batch need to look like to progress through the planning system so that we would start to build this pipeline to enable delivery to 2030 and beyond.

Anything that would help our environment should be encouraged and assisted.  It was stated in one of the presentations that work is taking place with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and an energy review has been carried out of Ireland's energy requirements.  Local Government and councils played their part in the planning framework to make houses more efficient, putting in air to water heat pumps, geothermal systems and solar panels.<\/p><p>When it comes to a lot of these systems such as air to water, it goes back to the energy reviews.  The current air to water system within a housing system only covers a house up to roughly 2,000 sq. ft and after it is being said that three-phase electricity is needed.  If one does not have that then one is backing up the heating system through the immersions and through the ESB.  Energy ratings are fine on paper but when the temperatures drop below -2&deg;C or -3&deg;C, a lot of these air systems do not work as efficiently as they say they will on paper.  The energy ratings seem to be based on a platform on which everything is nice and calm.<\/p><p> I welcome the investment in offshore and onshore wind generation.  The witnesses are saying it is starting on the east coast and we see from the point of view of ratings that a lot of energy comes from fossil fuels.  The hospitals and schools are on fossil fuels because there is no other alternative.  We have worked out throughout the years that anything that is being upgraded is in a highly populated area, such as Dublin and the large cities.  They seem to be getting the first run at this, even though the wind farms and so on are going up in the countryside, where we live and where they are visual to us.  To me, it is in the rural areas that this should be provided because they are doing their bit by supplying the land and having to look at these wind farms.  They should get the first bite at the cherry and get some rewards for what they are doing to help the likes of Dublin and the other areas.  I would like to see the rural areas, where we are working with the Government to create energy, to get the good energy ratings.  If I drive an electric vehicle, I have to travel 20 miles to get to the nearest plug-in point from where I am living so it is not viable for me.  The wind farms are in the countryside and the rural areas.<\/p><p> From an energy point of view, it was said that our targets for this year are 10% and for 2030, they are 30%.  Ambitiously, the target for 2050 is 70%.  I believe that is ambitious, especially when I consider that we do not have the proper energy ratings that are wanted for this country.  As ambitious as these targets are, I welcome them and I will do whatever I can that is within my power to help.  I would like to see it spread throughout the countryside.  Electricity is expensive at present and it is outweighing a lot of the costs for people to run on fossil fuels.  If we are encouraging people to work with energy, we need to make it efficient.  We do not want to have a one-stop-shop that can dictate prices to people who are making the changes towards electricity and are going a greener way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#J00600","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Does someone from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications want to make a comment on energy requirements versus energy efficiency?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#K00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":139,"content":"<p>The Deputy's points are well made.

For example, we know that one of the projects that is planning to go through the planning system on the east coast has designated Arklow as where it will base its operation and maintenance activities.  That would generate 70 to 80 jobs, which would be high quality jobs.  We see the industry offering that potential around coastal communities more broadly.  Then there is the community benefit my colleague has already spoken about, where that fund will be set up and will look at benefiting the broader community.

I wish to add another point on community gain, a point raised by Deputy McAuliffe.  I think the community gain for the coastal community was referenced.  We have to consider that the marine environment is seven times larger that the terrestrial environment, and that the marine space is all of Ireland's space, so I would not like to see community gain just being directed at coastal towns or villages.  The entire country should benefit from any community gain in that, especially as the transition to renewables will also see the reduction in the more traditional fossil fuel reliant industries, which tend to be concentrated in midland areas, so there are opportunities for that community gain to supplement just transition funds also.

There are two areas on which I wish to ask questions.  First, this is a very significant Bill in terms of what it is doing to facilitate wind turbines and actions being taken around climate.  That is very welcome and significant.  In addition to having a climate change crisis, we also have a biodiversity crisis, and it is that side on which I want to focus.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of marine protected areas only being at the 2.4% designation currently when the commitment in the programme for Government is 30%, is there a concern that not having that in place in advance or in tandem with this legislation could lead to judicial reviews, and therefore delays in the planning process in respect of wind turbines, in particular?  Is that a concern and has it been looked into?  Is there advice on that?<\/p> <p>  Second, the Bill does not cover commercial fishing and aquaculture, which is a concern particularly in respect of the damage done to the marine environment and biodiversity by bottom trawling or dragging, and that can lead to pollutants entering the food chain as well as causing damage to biodiversity.  The witnesses were asked about that, and they said that it cannot be covered in this Bill because fisheries is a competence of the EU.  The EU Common Fisheries Policy specifically states that member states have the opportunity to design fishing conservation measures.  Therefore, would that not allow this Bill to cover the area of fishing conservation measures and commercial fishing in that respect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#M00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I will start with the Deputy's final questions and I thank him for his comments.  Fisheries is outside my area of responsibility, so I am not going to answer any questions on it, because it is a matter of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his Department.  As I said previously, we are building a regime, and it is not a stand-alone regime that will be used only once.  We will want to use it many times, so there is always the option for other activities that are not included at this point in time to become part of that regime at a later date, however the two activities that the Deputy mentioned are under the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, so it is for him and his Department to make that call.<\/p> <p>  The second point I would make, which is almost a subpoint, is that regardless of whether an activity is included in this marine planning and development management Bill, all marine activities are subject to the national marine planning framework.  Fisheries, aquaculture, wastewater treatment and things that are not obviously named in the marine planning and development management Bill are all covered.  Some 16 sectoral activities are covered, so regardless of whether aquaculture is included in the Bill, any decisions taken, policies created, programmes or developments must take into account and meet the objectives of the national marine planning framework.  It is already legislated for under Part 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2018, and we are restating that in the marine planning and development management Bill, so decision-makers are legally bound to take the national marine planning framework into account.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the marine protected areas and the potential for judicial reviews, I do not wish to comment on that, simply because the Minister is currently considering a report of the expert group led by Dr. Tasman Crowe, which Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned earlier.  I understand that the report will be published in the next couple of months, and a full public consultation will be held on it.  I presume that is the appropriate arena in which to focus on those issues.<\/p><p>I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for raising the issue of marine protected areas because it is important to reach that target of 30%.

Reference was made to developer engagement with impacted stakeholders.  What is envisaged by that?  Who would the impacted stakeholders be and what statutory basis do the witnesses consider that to have?

To be clear on how the new regime is intended to operate, it is a two-stage procedure.  The first stage, the maritime area consent, MAC, looks very closely at the property, the person and whether that person can actually do what he or she is proposing, and then agrees the financial terms.  That MAC is then subject to a development consent which would be considered by An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the local authority, depending on the development type.  The larger scale offshore stuff would definitely be considered by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The formal environmental impact assessment is within that development consent procedure, and that also includes the formal opportunity for public participation in the development consent decision-making.  Related to that, and this might relate to some earlier questions as well so hopefully this will give some clarity, before a developer applies for a MAC obligations are set out that it will have to engage with impacted stakeholders.  It is not possible to set out who those stakeholders will be in primary legislation because we are building a regime for a variety of scales, from slipways all the way up to wind farms.  The level of engagement required in any particular case might be quite different but the principles are the same.  The purpose of this is to identify issues of importance for the public and identify the potentially impacted marine users.  The national marine planning framework will help do that and when the guidelines are developed, they will provide even more detail regarding who might potentially be impacted.<\/p> <p>  At the moment, public consultation in the context of development consent is quite often adversarial and we have found that under the Foreshore Act, there is an established application and there is opposition to it.  This Act seeks to mitigate that by placing the obligation on developers to engage with impacted stakeholders before a MAC application is made.  This has a number of purposes.  It ensures early and widespread awareness of proposals, it ensures developers engage with the stakeholders, and there is clarity among the public on what the proposal actually is.  Issues of concern are identified very early in the process by the developer at the project concept stage and necessary considerations, accommodations and synergies can be built into the project design rather than bolted on later.  We will be setting this out in the statutory obligation within the guidelines themselves.  However, we are also examining the possibility of putting it in as a set criteria in the MAC that if the Minister was not satisfied with the level of public or stakeholder engagement relevant to the project, the application would be deemed incomplete and would not even pass the first gate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Nolan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her questions.

At the moment we are committing in the NMPF to establishing initially two sets of statutory guidelines that we will work on in earnest following the publication of the NPF.  These will focus on development management.  As Mr. Nolan pointed out, the marine planning and development management Bill and the NMPF will have an effect on a huge range of decision-making.  They will have an impact on lots of different scales and types of development and activity, and on planned development and policy development upon which the NMPF also has an effect.<\/p> <p>  Given that complex picture, one role for the development management guidelines is, first and foremost, to see who is affected and what are the processes that are needed to consider the plan.  Beyond that, the guidelines would look at the individual policy areas and pick out areas, and new areas in particular, that these development decision-making processes will need to account for.<\/p> <p>  We spoke earlier about stakeholders.  It is important to note, for example, that the Bill changes the people who will make decisions in the maritime area from the foreshore team to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the local authorities.  Traditionally, those two organisations have been very land focused.  Now they will be working with marine stakeholders.  Therefore, there is something for development management guidelines to say about who typical marine stakeholders might be, where they might be found and how they might be contacted.  For example, standing groups might be used for engagement.  In principle, it is about helping that transition and helping development management to move as envisaged by the marine planning and development management Bill.  That is the development management side of things.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the offshore renewable energy aspect.  Offshore renewable energy is a relatively new and emerging sector in Ireland.  Again, there is a lot to be said for supporting transition.  There are new assessments that need to be thought about, such as visualisation assessments.  We need to reflect on how to establish the best available evidence to accompany decisions and identify how people can get involved with the processes related to offshore renewable energy.  Both sets of guidelines will be subject to consultation and assessment as required under the nature directives, the strategic environmental assessment directive and others as necessary.  We will seek to include all relevant people to inform the development of those guidelines to make sure everyone is involved in setting a course for making the changes and making the progress required in Ireland's maritime area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Woolley"},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.

With respect to Mr. Woolley's answer in regard to Article 8.1 of the directive that in response to consultation feedback there was less a focus in the revised draft on the spatial and temporal aspects of it, surely, Article 8.1 is legally binding and, therefore, whatever about people's views of the detail there is a requirement under the directive to have that detail in it.  I ask Mr. Woolley to respond on that issue.  It is important we do not have a planning regime and framework that falls foul of a legal obligation under the relevant EU law.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the marine planning framework, when will the environmental assessment and an appropriate assessment and public consultation around that be undertaken?  My understanding is that this is also a legal requirement in the process.  I am confused as to the relationship between the strategic maritime activity zones - I am finding the acronyms tricky to deal with - and the marine planning framework in terms of how we ensure consistency and public consultation in regard to the zones.  I ask one of the witnesses to talk me through that process.<\/p> <p>  I asked the following very specific question in the first round but it was not answered.  Has the Attorney General provided advice that the consent regime is compliant with the EIA directive and the Aarhus Convention in terms of not having an EIA requirement and public consultation?  I want to return to the point raised by Deputy O'Callaghan, which I also raised, in regard to the marine areas of protection.  I am genuinely concerned that the lag here is going to cause a difficulty.  While we are rightly pushing ahead on the need to have a planning regime for renewable energies, we are potentially doing it to the detriment of biodiversity and, again, the requirement under Article 1 of the directive for sustainability.  How can the witnesses reassure us that notwithstanding there is a different timeframe for the publication of the Crowe report and the necessary legislation for the marine protected areas, we are not going to end up with that lag and we will not be in a situation where planning applications, for example, for wind farms are being carried out in the absence of having the marine areas of protection fully in place?<\/p> <p> I ask the witnesses to also explain the differences between the two general schemes.  I am still unsure as to whether the general scheme that is on the website of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is identical to the one that was published last year or whether there have been amendments to it.

The plan does have policies that refer to and have a spatial element.  For example, the offshore renewable energy section talks about the need to ensure that those seeking to conduct activities in Ireland's maritime area are precluded from the development of offshore renewable energy in areas that are subject to ongoing application.  There is a map accompanying that policy which sets out the lines and the polygons so people understand exactly where applications are being considered.  Similarly, there is a map accompanying aquaculture which provides people with insights into where permissions are in place for people to conduct aquaculture activity relating to fin fish, shellfish or seaweeds, and there is a policy stating that if people are going to do things in these areas, even if it appears no-one is engaged in aquaculture there, they need to be aware that there is a permit in place for those activities and they need to speak to the relevant people to make sure there is compatibility.  Some of the work we have been doing in ports and shipping, for example, involved working very closely with the Marine Institute which contacted and worked with the ports across Ireland to ensure that the jurisdictions that port authorities control are brought together in a national map for the first time.  We are incorporating that into the plan and we have policies tied to those spatial areas to make sure that conflicts are managed appropriately and that consultation happens as early as possible, with the right people and at the right time.  I hope that provides some assurance that the plan is spatial where it can be.  In taking that approach, we have responded appropriately to Article 8.1.<\/p> <p>  For every single matter that the plan engages with and for every activity that the plan has policy for, the level of information available, be it spatial or otherwise, varies wildly.  We had a discussion earlier about hydrogen and there are certain industries that do not have a strong policy background yet but we make reference to them in the plan because we know they are coming but there is not really something that can be said spatially with certainty at the moment.  Where we can, we have been spatial and have set things out.  They are on best available knowledge on the activities as they happen.  Over time, that spatial specificity in relation to the plan and policies will be built upon through guidelines and the SMAZ process which the Deputy identified and on which Mr.  Nolan can elaborate.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of environmental assessments, we consulted on those with the draft plan beginning last November and closing in April.  We had substantial comment on those which we are factoring into the plan revisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#R00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Woolley"},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for today's briefings and those we received last week, which provided really useful background information for those of us who are new to this space.

I welcome the decision by the Government to put together an independent enforcement body which will assume responsibility for marine planning enforcement.  I am hoping to get a little more information about how that body will be established, the timelines for putting it together, its terms of reference and its potential make-up, to ensure it is representative of all the stakeholders in that area.  I appreciate that the Attorney General is providing legal advice on that but I would welcome the Department's view on how to set this new body up for success because that is imperative.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the relevant projects which will have to apply separately for MACs and planning permission under the new proposed regime, can the witnesses confirm whether a twin-track approach is involved or whether these applications must be made in a particular sequence?

This consent is essentially a gateway to planning.  It is rather different from the consent process under the Foreshore Act 1933, which is much broader and more technically complex.

I put on record my thanks for the document on frequently asked questions, which was very helpful.  It is a very complex Bill in many ways.  I would love to see a dumbed-down simpleton's guide to the Bill because we have to communicate with coastal communities.  I think that is really important.<\/p><p>I am not sure whether the witnesses are privy to the briefing paper prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  I suggest they contact their Minister and get a copy of it.  It is an excellent piece of work and I want to acknowledge the enormous effort the service put into it, as it does with everything.  I will start by referencing a few points from that paper.  Some of these comments do not really require an answer, but I will share them with the committee. <\/p><p> One issue concerns the functions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and those of the coastal planning authorities.  We need greater clarity on that relationship.  Many of the witnesses will be aware of the controversy surrounding the strategic housing development, SHD.  The common complaint concerns the right of citizens to appeal.  We are talking about An Bord Plean&aacute;la having a function in major infrastructural projects.  That will always be an issue of contention and concern.  I am concerned about it.  I was a director of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company for ten years so I know the challenges and difficulties of foreshore and coastal development.  I am also aware of the great potential there.  I think this Bill needs to be tweaked in places but on the whole I welcome it.  It is a very positive contribution.  This is something that should happen.  I would like to touch on the issue of shareholder engagement.  We know from the general scheme that the Bill has not been subject to public consultation at this stage.  I am concerned about that.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on it.  I apologise if they have already covered this.  <\/p><p> I refer also to the community benefit scheme for offshore renewables.  One of the previous speakers spoke about developing a communications protocol for it.  That is important.  This is a really important aspect of the Bill.  Perhaps we could hear more about it.  <\/p><p> I share the witnesses' concerns about aquaculture.  I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine, which is due to meet this afternoon.  I can commit to raising this issue with that committee.  We need to be aware of what is going here.  I will suggest an examination of this by the other committee.  It is very important that we provide bits and pieces of consultation on that. <\/p><p> Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin spoke about the general scheme of the marine planning and development management Bill, which is featured on the website of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Has it been amended since it was originally posted on the Department's website on 9 December 2019?  If so, perhaps the witnesses could comment on the changes.  What is the status of the general scheme featured on the website? <\/p><p> I also wish to raise the issue of consultation.  The Irish Environmental Network and other environmental NGOs have a huge role to play in this.  This committee is interested in engaging with them.  It is important that the Department also taps into that rich source of information and commitment.  I have some questions in this regard.  Why do we need strategic marine activity zones if we have proper spatial plans?  Can the witnesses give me the rationale?  Moreover, why has there been no public consultation on the designation of strategic marine activity zones and maritime area consent?  Finally, is there any role for the Office of the Planning Regulator in the development of this legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#S00900","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>There were several questions, so I apologise if I miss some of them.  I ask the Senator to alert me if I do.  I am not 100% sure, but I believe a further version of the general scheme of the Bill was published.  That included changes to formatting and corrections of errata, but no substantial changes.  We have not drafted a fresh version to reflect the major changes in policy development that have happened in the course of drafting.  We have identified the major changes in the answers to frequently asked questions.<\/p> <p>  Several members of the committee referred to the scale of the Bill.  Thanks to sterling work by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the eventual legal text will be a far shorter and more concise document than the general scheme.  It will be able to do many things which we thought would require specific provisions.  Our hope and intention is for the eventual legal text to be much shorter, more concise and more legible.  I think everyone will be happy to hear that.<\/p><p>On consultation, I reiterate that there is consultation on strategic marine activity zones, in respect of their designation and in the strategic environmental assessment.  There will, therefore, probably be consultation on the double within that process for different purposes.  Regarding the maritime area consent, there are good reasons for there not being consultation within that process, mainly concerning what is under consideration at that stage in the process.  There simply will not be that much meaningful information.<\/p><p> The questions people will ask will be specific, such as about the visual impact of a development, the impact on a certain species and the pollution impact.  That level of information will not be available until the environmental assessments are done, until there is a detailed project design and until the complete application is made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is at that point that the most meaningful consultation can happen, as well as the appropriate environmental assessment.  As I mentioned, however, we have a pre-application process, which happens before the MAC, to try to draw out at the earliest possible stage what those potential issues will be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Briefly, will there be a role for the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, in this area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#U00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>There will be a role for the OPR.

There were very practical considerations in that the Department had to move resources to more urgent areas.<\/p><p>That certainly created a time lag but thanks to the good work of the team we will come in on time in terms of both the Bill and the national marine planning framework or NMPF.<\/p><p> In terms of the resources required, we have two reference points.  One is a recent air wind report that pointed to the fact that 30 human people are needed into the future to run the marine planning system.  We are undergoing our own review that will look at the resources required in our Department, post the Bill, in the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, again post Bill, in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and in the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, most likely.  The report and review should be carried out over the next couple of months so we will be in a better position to answer that question.  The air wind report is a good report.   .     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#W00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>There was a question on timelines.

I greatly appreciate the briefing documents, opening statements, presentations and I have also read documentation from law firms that have put out a view on this matter.  I find myself very excited about the employment potential and seismic shift in our nation to develop so that a whole new industry opens up, and one that was never envisaged before.<\/p> <p>  I have had to move between meetings but I watched this debate on the monitor in my office.  Most of my questions have been answered and I apologise in advance if my next question on competencies in professional pathways has already been addressed.  Is there a pipeline of professionals available so we have a successful marine industry?  Have the Departments engaged with universities and colleges?  Is there a sufficient number of courses?  Are courses wide enough?  Should we have a chat with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science about this industry?  What courses do we need to develop?  It is only in the last two years that I have noticed that the children of my peers are studying marine biology with a view to a very definite future in Ireland and not having to travel to Fiji or somewhere like that to develop this work.  Therefore, I am curious about education and professions.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boyhan addressed my concern about competencies and whether we need additional personnel in local authorities.  The witnesses have addressed the matter but perhaps they have something further to say.

She asked a very good question and we take education very seriously.  We want to make sure that when the system is launched that it can stand on its own two feet and there are people who can really make it work properly.  With that in mind, we plan on working very closely with the Irish Planning Institute and the Office of Planning Regulation.  Earlier I mentioned to Senator Boyhan that the planning regulator will play a lead role in the training that is needed, particularly in the local authorities system.  I am very keen to work with universities or third level institutes.  My colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communication might want to comment on this but part of the supply chain will consider that aspect in terms of the future knowledge that is needed in this society.  I agree that the next few years will be a very exciting time for us.  It is not often that a brand new industry is brought into an economy or society so we want to prepare and make sure that we have the right foundations to support the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#X00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor McCabe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>On that point, there is work going on at a senior level across the various Departments that may have a role to play in working towards building on the potential opportunities that are available.

I have a question and Deputy Gould also has a question.  Regarding timeframes, I realise the MAC is time limited when consent is given.  Is the development permission also time limited?  Again, I am comparing it to land development, whereby permission can be given and somebody can sit on a site for a long time knowing that the demand is there and that it increases the value.  I know the person does not own it, but is development consent time limited as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#Y00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":218,"content":"<p>The maritime area consent will have a time limit, an appropriate period of time in which to secure the planning permission.  The developer will get the MAC and then try to get the planning permission.  If permission is refused, the MAC will terminate or if a period of time elapses, the MAC will also terminate automatically, unless there is a good reason to extend.  That possibility exists.  There will be a time-bound period in which to secure development consent, after which the MAC terminates.  Again, somebody else can come in and use it.  Likewise, there will probably be an appropriate period - we have to nail down precisely how this works - in which to begin construction.  That will likely be tied closely to the lifetime of the development consent.  I believe the standard in planning is five years.  It would be tied closely to that.  However, there will be limits and there will be strong levers on behalf of the State to prevent any type of land hoarding, squatting or-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>It is similar to the use it or lose it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#Y00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1606176000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Yes, essentially.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2020112400002#Y00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1606176000,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Thank you.
