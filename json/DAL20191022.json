These revelations are very grave and go to the heart of the credibility of our parliamentary process.  As I said in my public statement, the integrity of the voting process in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is of the utmost importance.  The public must have total and absolute confidence in it.  Given the gravity of the matter, I have directed the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to prepare an urgent report to establish the facts of what transpired last Thursday, 17 October.  Work on this is well under way and I have now requested him to speak with a number of Members, with the tellers on the day, and with the party and group Whips.  I also ask all concerned to co-operate with this process as I believe it is imperative that we get to the facts without any delay to restore public confidence in our voting system.<\/p>  <p>  I should also say at this juncture that last Thursday's events are also the subject of a complaint under the Ethics in Public Office Acts of 1995 and 2001.  This statutory process must take its course but in the meantime, it is essential that the facts be established and that the Committee on Procedure considers any recommendations that may be required in the short term relating to the electronic voting system and the operation and procedure of it.  This afternoon, at 4 p.m., the Committee on Procedure will meet at my request and I will take the opportunity to brief Members on the process so far.<\/p>  <p>  Let no person in this House and beyond be in any doubt that this is a very serious situation which requires urgent action.  I am absolutely committed to establishing the facts and making any changes to the electronic voting system that are deemed necessary following the review.  The electronic voting system is integral to our parliamentary system and has been since 2001.  Any recommendations on changes to the system that emerge from the review will be given immediate attention.  In the meantime, any votes this week shall only be taken when all Members are seated in their designated seats.  Furthermore, I have directed that each Whip certifies the Members who voted from his or her party or group.  This certification will be given to the tellers.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, it is my intention to convene a meeting of the Committee on Procedure on Thursday morning to consider the completed report of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  I will revert to the House on that at a later stage.  I should point out that the D&aacute;il Business Committee met earlier today and provision will be made, if necessary, on Thursday for a debate on this matter, that is on the report of the Committee on Procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200005#B00100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1571749800,"counter":7,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200005#B00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1571749800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his statement, with which I agree.<\/p>  <p>  On Leaders Questions on 1 October I raised with the Taoiseach concerns about the escalating costs at the national children's hospital.  He undertook to reply to me.  Last week, I received his written response, which again clearly points to escalating costs at the national children's hospital.  It is all a far cry from April 2016, when the Taoiseach, then Minister for Health, announced that the hospital would cost &euro;650 million all-in.  Those costs increased year by year and the current Minister for Health had to apologise to Deputy Barry Cowen in the D&aacute;il for misleading information about those costs.  As the Taoiseach said in his reply to me, the guaranteed maximum price established through the two-stage tender process does not provide a contractual ceiling on cost and significant residual risks remain of additional further costs.  These include the risk of construction inflation in excess of 4% which are allowed by the contract to be recovered.<\/p><p>We also learned from the Taoiseach's response and from the August minutes that the main contractor has submitted claims to the board, which I understand to be quite significant as well.  For some reason, ICT is not covered in these costs, neither are the costs associated with the children's hospital integration programme.  I suggest that is designed to reduce the overall cost for appearances and so on.  I ask the Taoiseach to give me specifics on the costs of the ICT programme and the integration initiative.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach will recall that PwC's report on the construction of the new children's hospital was a shocking indictment of a badly-managed project.  Critical phrases leap off the pages of that report, such as &quot;Significant failures&quot; and the &quot;lack of sufficiently comprehensive or robust planning&quot;.  The report said the understanding of the risk profile was &quot;poor at all levels of the governance structure&quot; and that &quot;red flags ... were missed.&quot;  The report said the business case: &quot;contained material errors and did not adhere to the Public Spending Code.&quot;  It also described the execution as: &quot;poorly coordinated and controlled.&quot;<br\/><br\/>We have learned from the August minutes, as revealed in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>yesterday, that the State's chief procurement officer, Mr. Paul Quinn, who appears not to have alerted the Government to the original spiralling costs of the hospital, has resigned from the hospital board.  This follows the resignations of Mr. Tom Costello and the project director, Mr. John Pollack.  The minutes state that all we have at the moment is &quot;a best estimate&quot; on the overall cost of this project and that a significant increase in financial claims is being made by the contractors at the Dublin site, about which the board is very concerned.  Can the Taoiseach indicate to me why Mr. Quinn has resigned?  Does he know something the rest of us do not?  How robust are the procedures, given the resignation of the chairman, director and the State procurement officer?  Would the Government agree to an oversight mechanism from the Oireachtas to rigorously monitor the costs of this project, given its capacity to devour the health capital budget and delay and perhaps prevent other badly-needed projects from developing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200005#B00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571750100,"counter":10,"content":"<p>At the outset, I want to welcome the Ceann Comhairle's earlier statement.  The integrity of the voting process is at the centre of our democracy.  Whether it is people going to the polling station to cast their vote on election day or referendum day or whether it is Deputies or Senators voting in these Houses, people need to know the system is robust and valid.  I welcome the fact you have acted swiftly, that an investigation is being carried out, that there will be a report this week and I welcome the fact the Deputies concerned will be invited to make statements to the House on Thursday to explain their roles in all of this.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question, the cost of the capital element of the national children's hospital project, as agreed by Government in December 2018, is &euro;1.433 billion.  There has been no change in the Government decision since then, and that includes VAT.  The &euro;1.433 billion is the cost of the capital build in the project.  That is the main hospital at the St. James' Hospital campus, as well as the urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown and at Tallaght University Hospital.  There have been references to figures such as &euro;1.7 billion or even &euro;2 billion but those figures can only be approached when lots of other elements of the project are included such as ICT equipment, the electronic health record and the entire cost of the children's hospital integration programme - which is decommissioning Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals and is moving those hospitals to the new site.  Those figures also include pre-2013 expenditure on the failed attempt to build the national children's hospital at the Mater Hospital, which I know the Deputy will be familiar with, having been involved in same.  They also include the children's research and innovation centre, as well as contingency provision.  There is also a clause in the contract to allow for an uplift if the rate of construction inflation exceeds 4%.<\/p>  <p>  These figures we often hear used such as &euro;1.72 billion, are much more than the cost of the project at St. James' Hospital.  People are including Connolly, Tallaght and the Mater project that never happened, as well as the moves out of Crumlin and Temple Street, the cost of ICT equipment, the electronic health record, the entire integration programme and the research and innovation centre.<\/p>  <p>  On claims, as was stated last June at the joint committee, it is possible, as is the case in any construction contract, for a contractor to make claims for additional expenditure that was not covered in the contract.<\/p><p>Where those occur they are independently assessed before any decision is made on whether they should be granted.<\/p> <p> With regard to the resignation of Mr. Paul Quinn from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, it happened in July 2019 and is not news and certainly not new news.  He has not resigned from his day job working as a civil servant but he has resigned from his position on the board.  His decision on this is a matter for himself.

Over the weekend, as we know, it emerged that Deputy Niall Collins voted on behalf of Deputy Dooley on six separate occasions.  Subsequently, questions have been asked of other D&aacute;il Deputies as to whether they cast votes for absent colleagues.<\/p><p>This has been portrayed by some as a controversy over who sits in what seat - a game of political musical chairs, Deputies sit in the wrong seats and press the wrong buttons.  We must acknowledge that the real world outside looks on gobsmacked at the fact that highly-paid officials cannot manage to sit in the right seats or hit the right buttons.  I suggest that we collectively decide that, from hereon in, we will sit in our designated seats and endeavour to press the right buttons.  That would resolve the concerns over musical chairs.<\/p> <p> The real story here is much more serious and alarming because Deputies have cast votes on behalf of colleagues who are not present before also casting their own vote and, thereby, voting twice on a given question.  Article 15 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann states that the decisions of this House are determined by a majority of the votes of Members who are present and voting.  Our own Standing Orders echo that position.  Standing Order 77 explicitly sets out that Members must be present to vote.  We are elected to make laws, amend laws, pass budgets and make decisions that impact society and the lives of real people.  Measures have been voted on in this House that have denied respite care, taken away home help hours, prevented meaningful action on runaway rents and I could go on.  It is because of the gravity and reach of our decisions that we must be present and vote.  That is why it is spelled out so explicitly in the Constitution and Standing Orders.<\/p> <p> The behaviour of Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies has discredited the D&aacute;il.  It conveys a complete lack of regard for the Oireachtas and institutions of governance.  It demonstrates, above all, an absolute disrespect for those who have elected those Deputies and who they represent but it is even more serious than that because if the behaviour of the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies represents a pattern of behaviour in that party, it calls into question the validity of decisions and votes taken here.

When people go out to vote and cast their ballots on election day or on referendum day, they expect the procedures to be followed properly.  It would be a crime if an ordinary citizen cast a vote on their own behalf and that of someone else.  To vote on behalf of somebody else is impersonation and to vote twice is a crime.  It would be no defence to say that it did not matter because the person who won the election did so by a wide margin anyway.

Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann states that any votes that occur in this House must be decided by majority vote cast by Members who are present and voting.

I, too, regard it as a most serious matter that deserves to be addressed urgently and resolved.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recently announced plans to extend free GP care to children aged seven and eight years.  As the Taoiseach will know, the previous Government provided GP care for all children up to the age of six years and for those over the age of 70.  The move to provide it for the under-eights is a slow realisation of the pledge made by the previous Government to provide free GP care for all.  It suggests the current Fine Gael-led Government is not convinced by the arguments made in the Sl&aacute;intecare report for a single tier public healthcare system, rather than the current two tier one.  It is also another example of the poor use of public finances.  The Government will have to negotiate with the GPs again to agree a new contract to cover the under-eights.  What then?  If it free GP care is expanded further to the under-tens or the under-12s, it will require new contracts.  How many contracts will it take before the Government reaches the objective of providing free GP care for all?  How much more time and money will it take to go through the various rounds of negotiations?  Every time there is a new contract, the public finances lose leverage over the whole project and the next phase becomes more expensive.  It would be much better value for the money to move directly to providing free GP care for all those above the age of 18 years, which is what we had envisaged, rather than take a series of incremental steps.  We know from medical statistics that older people and the under-sixes use GP care services more than most and they already have access to free GP care.  By and large, people with major medical needs have a medical card.<\/p><p>There is simply less medical need among the population of older children, teenagers and working adults.  It does not require an incremental approach.  It should be done as one negotiation.  It is inefficient to drag this process out and it represents a failure of Government to deliver.  We were able to negotiate care for children under the age of six in the worst of times but no progress has been made on this critical issue over the past three years.  I have two questions.  Will the Government agree to extend free GP care to everyone or at least to those under 18, rather than the policy announced by the Taoiseach of simply adding another two years to include those under eight?  If not, will the Government at least produce a cost-benefit analysis of both courses of action?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200009#F00300","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571751900,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The year after that, it will be extended to children aged nine and ten, and the year after that to those aged 11 and 12.  That does not preclude us from also doing other things by changing income limits, but that is our current plan.<\/p>  <p>  The incremental approach is right.  When I was introducing free GP care for children aged under six, I remember seeing the research from health experts and all of the people who go on the radio and tell us about health expertise.  They said there would not be a big increase in attendance of GP services by those under six.  They were wrong because there was.  We know that now.  When free GP care for children aged under six was introduced there was a big increase in attendance at GP surgeries, particularly at out-of-hours services.  I do not want to do this too quickly and overwhelm the capacity of general practice to deliver.  The NHS is a pretty good health system, but people using it have to go on waiting lists to see their GPs.  A two-week or three-week wait to see a GP is normal in the NHS.  I know that happens in Ireland, but it is pretty uncommon.  I do not want us to overwhelm the capacity of primary care and general practice to deliver.  That is why I think it is better to do this in an incremental manner, and that is what we have decided to do.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation is required to deliver on the commitments.  It is relatively straightforward.  The Minister for Health is working on it.  We think we can have that through the Houses before Christmas, or if not, in the early part of next year.  It requires consultation with GPs on fees.  However, because we have agreed with the GPs that this will not be compulsory and they do not have to provide the service, it does not require negotiation to be concluded.  We just need to consult GPs on fees.  They can then decide whether they want to opt in to providing care to children aged seven and eight.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200010#G00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751900,"counter":65,"content":"<p>There will be another budget now and we will try to get it all sorted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200010#G00700","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"speech","time":1571751900,"counter":66,"content":"<p>If the Minister of State reflected on what the Taoiseach has just said, he would be shocked.

The closer we get to getting the final tranche done, the more it will cost.  That has been the experience of any incremental contract system.

However, it highlights in the most acute way the utter failure of the Taoiseach and the Government to focus on public health and the hospital in Galway.  As recently as 25 September in the Taoiseach's absence, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, answered questions and I raised the hospital in Galway.  I specifically raised it in the context of the INMO statement that warned that Saolta management should be gravely concerned due to the high levels of missed care, delayed care and poor patient outcomes arising from the number of nursing and midwifery vacancies.<\/p><p>I went on to highlight the 200 vacancies.  The Taoiseach mentioned primary care which is an illusion.  I mentioned the <i>de facto<\/i>embargo in primary care and I mentioned 11 posts.  I mentioned the continued closure of a theatre at Merlin Park and a consultant telling us that the situation was unbearable and that management could not cope with it.  Since then I have discovered that there have been 13 external reviews into the situation at the hospital over a ten-year period, which is more than one a year.  It looks like we are heading for another external review.<\/p><p>A family contacted me about what happened to their 74 year old mother.  I ask the Taoiseach to listen and put himself in the shoes of that woman or, indeed, on the trolley on which she spent 72 hours even though the policy and ethos in the hospital require that it be no more than 24 hours.  That woman was admitted from another hospital with a suspected infection which I might add was hospital acquired.  Subsequently, during her three days on the trolley she was found on the floor screaming in pain.<\/p><p>Nobody knows how it happened.  She was taken back to a bed or trolley and left for five solid hours without having an X-ray or pain relief.  The family who have no medical training diagnosed that she had a broken hip.  As the Taoiseach can imagine, it must have been very obvious.  Subsequently, when they had a little energy, almost two and a half weeks later they made a formal complaint, but they heard nothing from the hospital until the formal complaint was made.  Once it was made, they received a telephone call and learned that some investigation was in being.  We do not know what type of investigation is being carried out, who is behind it, when it started or when it will be completed.  I want the Taoiseach to take a hands-on approach.

I do so having listened to many of those affected and do so guided by the Scally inquiry report.<\/p>  <p>  Today we say \"Sorry\" to those whose lives were shattered.  We say \"Sorry\" to those whose lives were destroyed and to those whose lives could have been different.  We know that cancer screening programmes cannot detect all cancers, but we also know that many failures have taken place.  We are sorry for the failures in clinical governance.  We are sorry for the failures in leadership and management.  We are sorry for the failure to tell the whole truth and to do so in a timely manner.  We are sorry for the humiliation, disrespect and deceit, the false reassurance, the attempts by some to play down the seriousness of the debacle and inaccuracies and claims from others, all of which added to confusion and public concern.<\/p>  <p>  We apologise to those who survived and still bear the scars, both physically and mentally, as do their families.  We apologise to those who are here in our presence and to those watching from home who have always kept this matter to themselves.  We apologise to those who have passed on and cannot be here.  We acknowledge the failure that took place with CervicalCheck.  I know that today's apology is too late for some who were affected and that for others, it will never be enough.  Today's apology is offered to all of the people the State let down and to their families who also paid the price for those failings - a broken service, broken promises, broken lives, a debacle that left a country heartbroken, a system that was doomed to fail.<\/p>  <p>  We apologise to our wives, daughters, sisters and mothers.  We apologise to the men who lost the centre of their lives and who every day have to pick up the pieces - single fathers and grandparents.  We apologise to the children who will always have a gaping hole in their lives.  We apologise to all those who are grieving for what has been taken from them; the happy days that will never be.  A State apology may not provide closure, but I hope it will help to heal.<\/p><p>I have met some of you and your families in recent weeks.  I have heard your stories, told to me with dignity, courage and integrity, about families turned upside down; the grief of losing loved ones; the guilt of those who survived, thinking they were the lucky ones; those who have lost their jobs and careers, their ability to have children, and their feeling of self-worth; those who feel mutilated inside; and about those who feel they have robbed their partner out of the possibility of having a child, with a future stolen from them.  A State apology will not repair all that has been broken or restore all that has been lost but we can make it count for something.  Thanks to Dr. Scally's three reports into CervicalCheck, we have discovered many truths and now know many of the facts.  There are some things that we will never know but we can act on what we know about.  The Government has accepted all of the recommendations set out in Dr. Scally&rsquo;s reports and all will be implemented.<br\/><br\/>In the words of Vicky Phelan, I too want something good to come out of all of this.  Speaking as a doctor, as well as a politician, a brother and a son, I know the lessons we must learn.  We need to build a different and much better culture in our health service, one that treats patients with respect and always tells the truth and which is never paternalistic, because the doctor does not always know best.  We must share full information with our patients, admit mistakes and put the person first.  There is no information about a patient that the patient should not know.  No patient should ever feel stonewalled by the system.  We should never fail to act out of fear of litigation or recrimination even if those fears are real.  The involvement of patient advocates such as Stephen Teap, Lorraine Walsh and others has shaped and enhanced our response.  We revised the open disclosure policy so that in future patients will have full knowledge about their care and treatment.  They will be informed when things go wrong, will be met to discuss what happened, and will receive a sincere apology if an error was made while caring for them.  Above all, patients will be treated with compassion and empathy.<br\/><br\/>The new patient safety Bill will provide for the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events and will establish a statutory duty of candour.  We will soon establish a new independent patient safety council.  The first task of that council will be to undertake a detailed review of the existing policies on open disclosure across the whole healthcare landscape.  As a State, we aim to make cervical cancer a very rare disease.  It is almost impossible to eradicate a disease but we can come very close.  We are switching to primary HPV screening and Ireland will become one of the first countries in the world to adopt this new, more accurate screening test.  We are also extending the ever-developing HPV vaccine to boys.  We are educating and informing parents about the benefits of the vaccine.  We are investing in better facilities in Ireland, such as a national cervical screening laboratory, in conjunction with the Coombe.  This enhanced facility will take some time to develop but will provide a better balance between public and private provision of laboratory services to the cervical screening programme, always putting quality ahead of cost, and it will bring more testing back to Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I also want to recognise the staff of the HSE, of CervicalCheck in Limerick, and the people working in smear clinics, colposcopy clinics and outpatient departments across the country.  They too got caught up in the system's failure.  I know they are not individually to blame and have been working hard ever since to put things right.  We need to restore confidence in screening.  We need to listen to those who have suffered and learn from their stories so that we can find justice and truth.  In July, this House established the CervicalCheck tribunal, a statutory tribunal to deal with the issue of liability in CervicalCheck cases.  It will not be perfect but it will be quicker, with a dedicated judge and independent experts, and it will be less adversarial than court.  Women will still have the right to go to court.  Separately, we established an <i>ex gratia<\/i>compensation scheme for those affected by the non-disclosure of CervicalCheck, to provide financial compensation without the need to go to court.  However, this was never about money.  It was about accountability, discovering what happened and why, providing justice and finding peace.  It was about making a meaningful acknowledgement of what happened and giving an assurance that this will not happen again to anyone else again.  Sadly, as we have seen further errors in some laboratories since the publication of the Scally report, causing confusion and anxiety, I know we have more to do to restore confidence and we are determined to do so.<br\/><br\/>What happened to so many women and their families should not have happened.  While every case was not negligence, every case was a lost opportunity for an earlier diagnosis and treatment.  It was a failure of our health service and our State, its agencies, systems and its culture.  We have found the truth and the facts and are making changes to put things right.  We need to restore trust and rebuild relationships that have been severely damaged.  On behalf of the Government and the State, I am sorry that all this happened and I apologise to all those hurt or wronged.  We vow to make sure that it never happens to anyone else ever again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200018#P00600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571755800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I strongly support and welcome the apology by the Government for what women and their families were put through as a result of the cervical cancer screening scandal.

The facts of this scandal and the failings it exposed have posed a direct and urgent challenge to a vital part of our health system and those who oversee it.  However, our first duty today must be to honour the fight of those affected in order to obtain information, accountability and, above all, change.  They fought for themselves, but they also fought for the women of today and the years ahead who need a screening service and a system which they can trust at one of their most vulnerable moments.  This scandal has touched on many important issues relating to the oversight of our health services and, more fundamentally, how the rights of individuals can be too often ignored in the design, delivery and oversight of women's health services.<\/p>  <p>  Screening services are one of the greatest advances of modern medicine.  The ability to identify diseases in time for early and more effective treatment is now a fundamental part of helping people to live longer and healthier lives.  In this case, the introduction of national screening for cervical cancer directly targeted one of the diseases most responsible for the early deaths of women.  Let us never forget that this service has saved thousands of lives.  No screening or diagnostic service in the world is without error.  However, every patient who uses such a service has the right to know that everything possible has been done to reduce potential error and that they will be quickly and fully informed when those errors are spotted.<\/p>  <p>  As the High Court heard and as the Scally and MacCraith reports showed in detail, hundreds of women were badly let down on these fundamental points.  Since the system believed in the value of its work and because of a failure to put the patients' interests at the centre of every decision, vital information was withheld, appalling errors were made and it took immense legal, public and political pressure for action to be taken.  As the reports demonstrated, there was an aversion to open and full disclosure.  Multiple examples were exposed of what Professor MacCraith described as women being frustrated in their search for results and clarifying information.  They were given incorrect information, often after another serious delay and for many, the information they were given was still inaccurate.  The paternalistic approach of deciding what women could be allowed to know about their own health was demonstrated at important moments, with vital results often only supplied to doctors with no intention to inform the women involved.<\/p><p>The reports also pointed to the central lack of proper corporate governance within the HSE.  The replacement of the HSE's independent board by a system that directly reported into the Minister's office was an enormous error by the Government and underpinned a culture where there was no one focusing on general oversight.  Dr. Scally particularly pointed to the need to restore this essential governance layer and for the voices of patients to be included at this level.  The Government's decision to reverse its abolition of the HSE board is welcome and we hope it will become the driving force for reform, which is so badly needed.<\/p> <p> The series of recommendations made in the Scally and MacCraith reports are detailed and there appears to have been progress in important areas.  However, the history of the handling of this scandal and of other scandals in recent years means nothing can be taken for granted and pressure must be maintained so the reports are implemented in full.  Errors were clearly made in that response and lessons will have to be learned.<\/p> <p> I would like to remind the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, that in the full spirit of this apology, we need to bear in mind the sense of grievance one whistleblower, Ms Sharon Butler Hughes, still has about how she was treated.  She feels her integrity was wrongly impugned.  She did some important work for the public good and service.

We cannot let the programme of change for the planning, delivery and oversight of screening services become yet another area where early publicity is followed by a failure to deliver.  This apology by the Government is an important step, but the true measure of it will be seen in the action which is taken today and in the months and years ahead.  It will particularly be seen in the judicial system, where the State must follow through on the spirit of this apology in not being adversarial.  An adversarial judicial system has become the essential mechanism for the cover-up of scandals of this kind.

I also want to acknowledge the many women and their families who are watching this apology at home.  Today's apology is important and welcome.  A formal State apology is a serious thing.  It is an acknowledgement the State has caused or has been complicit in causing, the most serious hurt to people, and it is undeniable many thousands of women across Ireland have been treated appallingly in the last year and a half.<\/p>  <p>  Every woman should have been told of the results of previous audits of their tests.  No woman should have had to battle both the laboratories and her own State in court.  No woman should have been asked by her own State to sign a non-disclosure agreement.  Women and their families should have had access to supports quickly once this was uncovered.  Some 80,000 women should not have had to wait up to nine months to receive their test results and many thousands more should not have had to go for retests.  No woman should have been shut out of the public healthcare system because, in desperation, she went and paid privately for a test.  When that happened, the HSE should not have apologised for any \"confusion\" caused: it should have been very frank, very open and very apologetic.  It should not have taken the work of one woman to uncover the serious issue of many test results not being issued to either the women nor to their GPs.  Preconditions should not have been given to that women about what she could and could not discuss with Government when they met.<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Scally's report into the governance failings was comprehensive.  It is good to see and I acknowledge the progress being made on his recommendations.  However, as the Taoiseach has said, there is far more that needs to be done and I agree with that.  The HPV test will save lives and it was meant to be in place last September.  We must all work together to get it in place as quickly as possible.  Many women who face delays seeking smear tests are now facing delays in their follow-up specialist care and we must all work together to bring those waiting lists down to zero.<\/p>  <p>  It is essential these issues are resolved, that public confidence is rebuilt, that as many women as possible engage in the screening service and that men engage in the other screening services, because they save lives every day.  It is thanks to the service of women and their families, some of whom are with us today, and it is thanks to their fight, their refusal to be silent, their bravery and their extraordinary perseverance that we are here today and that we have identified many of the failings.  We must and can work together to fix those failings, to make sure we have the best and most effective screening services on Earth, and that all patients, women and their families are treated at all times with dignity, respect and openness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200020#R00400","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1571756400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Before I begin, I want to acknowledge the women and their families who join us today.  The Taoiseach's apology is most welcome.  It is important the apology not only relates to the initial failures, but also to how women were treated in the wake of this scandal.  Women and their families were dragged through the courts to access their vital medical information.  Women had to fight to access information on assistance payments.  The initial investigations were slow and struggled to gain the confidence of the women affected.  Unfortunately, as the Taoiseach has acknowledged, delay and obstruction were the overriding themes of the response to this catastrophe.  Mistakes were made again and again, as more women received incorrect results.  Labs were added to the CervicalCheck programme without the proper checks being conducted.<\/p>  <p>  I hope I am wrong but unfortunately it seems that some of the lessons of this crisis have still gone unlearned, because beyond this welcome apology, Government must fix the system.  Dr. Gabriel Scally called this apology momentous, stating that: &ldquo;The three things that really matter to people when things really go wrong badly in the medical system are for someone to tell them the truth, what went wrong, why it went wrong; secondly to say sorry and to really mean that, and from someone with some skin in the game; and the third is to say how it is going to be avoided in the future.&rdquo;  This means that in addition to this apology, there needs to be real reform of the screening programme, because screening saves lives.  We must see the recommendations of the Scally and MacCraith reports implemented because we can give apologies here with words, but words are hollow without the actions to back them up.  We can say that lessons have been learned from this and that this will never happen again, but without putting in place the recommendations of the Scally and MacCraith reports, this could happen again.<\/p>  <p>  A real and tangible apology consists of words and actions.  Let us say honestly that because of what happened and in the memory of those who are no longer here, real change has been made, our services are better and this will never happen again.  Central to ensuring this is the repatriation of the smear testing process to Ireland.  This was recommendation No. 7 of the MacCraith report.  It is imperative that a plan, along with funding, is put in place to do that.<\/p><p>It is clear that outsourcing played a part in this scandal and in the further mistakes that were made as regards delays in tests and the issuing of results.  We know that this cannot be achieved overnight, but we need to work towards it because we have to fix the system.  We have to ensure that women can enjoy absolute confidence in the screening processes on which we rely.  Fixing anything in the health service means funding, as the Taoiseach knows.  His words today need to be followed with actions and those actions need to be backed up by funding.<\/p> <p> It was disappointing that in this year's budget no specific funding allocation was allotted to the CervicalCheck programme.  This needs to change.  The programme needs additional funding to ensure it can change and to implement the recommendations of the MacCraith and Scally reports.  I hope, after this moment of apology, that in the coming weeks additional funding can be put forward for the CervicalCheck programme.<\/p> <p> We also need to see the implementation of the patient safety Bill.  This will provide for mandatory open disclosure of serious reportable patient safety incidents and notification of reportable incidents as well as other changes.  The general scheme of the Bill was published in July 2018 but we are still awaiting pre-legislative scrutiny and holding out for its implementation.  It is a matter of utmost urgency that the Bill be progressed and that we have full open disclosure.<\/p> <p> In the summer of 2018, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na spoke outside the gates of the D&aacute;il.  She stood with her young children at her side, who were facing the unbearable reality that they would lose their beautiful mother so early in life.  With the mic in her hand, Emma was a force a nature &ndash; sharp, witty, funny and utterly unbroken.  One line from her speech sticks in my mind to this day.  I recall that Emma said; \"I am not going to die and leave this country in unsafe hands.\"  I stood in awe of this young mother fighting for her life and yet still having the courage and determination to speak out for others.  She was grace itself, a wonderful person whose tomorrows were stolen from her.  She was a beloved mother, daughter, sister and friend whose life was cut short.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge there were many other Emmas, other women whose names we might never read in our newspapers but whose families too now live with the sorrowful reality of the empty chair.  Beyond the headlines and the heat of the political crisis, Stephen Teap gave an insight into life without his wife, Irene.  It is the simplicity of what he had to say that revealed the utter heartbreak.  Stephen said; \"For instance, I look at Noah [one of his boys] and I ask myself: do I start him in school in September or do I wait until next year?  Who do I bounce that thought off?  You end up discussing it with relatives and friends and it's like all decisions then are just you and you alone.\"  Every parent inside and outside the House can relate to the loneliness of those words.  This is the scale of the devastation.  This is the depth of the loss.  This is the CervicalCheck scandal.  We can never lose sight of the human cost of the failures and we should never ever underestimate it.  I know we do not.<\/p> <p> We also should never forget that if it was not for Vicky Phelan revealing her personal agony in such a very public way that all of this agony may have been borne very privately.  Vicky Phelan did not stay silent.  Vicky spoke up.  What dignity and what bravery.  She is owed an immense debt of gratitude.  Thank you, Vicky.<\/p> <p> As I said, the State&rsquo;s apology is welcome but the Taoiseach's words must mark real and tangible change.  It is our responsibility now to honour the memory of women such as Emma and Irene by fixing our system.  This is the very best thing we can do for all of the women affected by the CervicalCheck scandal and for all of the women, girls, men and boys of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200020#R00500","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571757000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>When Vicky Phelan stood outside the High Court in April last year, following her decision not to sign a confidentiality agreement regarding her case, she changed Irish healthcare provision forever.  Her campaign for justice since then has been one of the most courageous any of us has ever seen and certainly the most courageous I have ever seen.  When she, along with her fellow campaigner, Stephen Teap, attended the Committee of Public Accounts a few weeks later, they opened a scandal to us that was unprecedented, complex and deeply troubling.  I swore to them that day walking back to their taxi that I would do all I could to help them and I hope I have honoured that.<\/p>  <p>  We, as a State, are today acknowledging that we let down the women of Ireland.  We let down the women affected by the cervical cancer scandal and we let down their families.  It is a watershed moment.  I thank the Taoiseach for listening to the continuous requests that I and many others made for this day to happen and for meeting the 221+ group and their patient representatives on a number of occasions recently.  It also helped him to understand that this day was necessary.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge all of the women in the Gallery and their families.  I also acknowledge all of the young people who will look back on what we are saying today.  They have been affected by it but they are that little bit too young to fully understand it.  I am particularly thinking of Noah and Oscar Teap.  This record will be there for them and many other young people who have been affected.  It will record the mistakes that deprived many of them of a loved one.<\/p>  <p>  An apology today will not bring back any of the women who have passed on, including Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, change the terminal diagnoses others have, prevent the fact that some women, such as Lorraine Walsh, cannot have children, or make up for many of the medical complaints from which many of the women continue to suffer.  What it is though, is the beginning of a healing process.  Finally, we have a proper informed official acknowledgement of the wrongdoings that happened.<\/p>  <p>  Collectively, we have all learned so much since Vicky spoke outside the High Court.  We have had the Scally and MacCraith reports.  They have shed so much light on what happened.  They also raised ongoing questions regarding the Department of Health, the HSE, healthcare professionals and many others.  I and others will continue to pursue those questions.<\/p>  <p>   We in the Chamber also have questions to answer but they are certainly for another day.  However, one thing is very clear: The decision to outsource the laboratory work many years ago was the wrong one.  In fairness to some Deputies, one of whom is sitting beside me and one a few seats away from me, they questioned this and pointed it out at that time.  The laboratories were not fine.  The quality assurance that was necessary was not in place, the contracts were not managed appropriately and the accreditation in some cases was done retrospectively.  These are the facts.  It was not acceptable.  I do not believe we have found out everything about some aspects but perhaps with the passage of time, we will.<\/p>  <p>   Today, I am hugely thinking of another lady, Ruth Morrissey, who had to take on the State to get justice.  She spent over two weeks in total in the High Court only to have the judgment appealed again.  Today, I stand in solidarity with her.  The Taoiseach said no woman would have to go through what Vicky Phelan went through and no woman would have to face the adversarial setting of the High Court given what had happened to them.<\/p><p>It was an error by the Taoiseach but I accept that he has subsequently acknowledged that and it is important that he did.  The way Ruth Morrissey is being treated by the State is not something that I accept, however, and I am thinking of her and her family today.<\/p> <p> I want particularly to acknowledge the patient advocates who have worked so hard on behalf of the 221 Plus support group.  I acknowledge Mr. Stephen Teap, who lost his beautiful wife Irene, and Lorraine Walsh, who lost the opportunity to have children.  I also acknowledge the amazing Vicky Phelan.  The work and advocacy they have done has been frankly incredible.  Three finer, more decent and caring people I have never met.  They deserve to be respected by us all and particularly by the Department of Health in a way that has not happened to date.  This must change and they, along with other patient advocates, deserve to be acknowledged and if we are going to have patient advocates across many different settings, we also need to remunerate them.<\/p> <p> This long battle has had some good results: better awareness of screening, a developing understanding among the public that screening is not diagnostic and the introduction of HPV screening.  We, in this Chamber, need to row in behind the HPV vaccine, not just for its health benefits but also to acknowledge and honour the work of Laura Brennan and others.<\/p> <p> The provision of HPV vaccinations in schools for boys to help create herd immunity is another important step.  We can actually get rid of cervical cancer in this country.  We can get it down to the minimum level as has been done in other countries.<\/p> <p> We have also learned throughout this process to question health professionals in a way that simply did not happen before, even when it needed to.  People are taking control of their healthcare and that is good.  Of course, we are in the process of ensuring that open disclosure becomes ingrained in our healthcare provision, which it always should have been.<\/p> <p> However, there are many challenges ahead.  The implementation of all the Scally recommendations must happen quickly.  The audit of cervical screening has stopped and must recommence from the day the previous one ceased.  I have never got confirmation that will happen and I ask the Taoiseach to confirm it.  Audits are good things and the recommenced audit must start from the day after the previous one stopped.<\/p> <p> We also need to provide an optional, low-cost vaccination programme for adults.  Dr. Doireann O'Leary, a general practitioner from Cork, has pointed out there is growing evidence that the vaccine is effective past adolescence and beyond the age of 26.<\/p> <p> The review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, also needs to be completed.  I am making a clear point to the Taoiseach today.  The fact that the review is behind schedule and that there are issues with validating the data is not acceptable.  The State must get this right and cannot mess it up.  At present, I am not supremely confident the State will not mess it up and that cannot happen.  When did an independent review by RCOG have to be revalidated by the HSE?  This is something I hope the Taoiseach and his Minister will prioritise.<\/p> <p> Today has been a long-awaited day for the women of Ireland, particularly those at the centre of this scandal.  It is a critically important day for all of the people in the Gallery who have been affected.  What has happened to these women and their families over the past two years has been a black mark on our State's history.  If the right steps are now taken, many of which have been outlined here today, it will mean we never allow such a black mark to happen again.  I have talked to many of the people who are in the Gallery today and that is the true legacy that they want from today's apology.  They want us to have a screening programme of which we can be proud, one that is open with patients and tells them everything, gives them the best care and looks after them as citizens of our State.  We, collectively, must do that and if we do, that will be the ultimate impact of this apology for all of those watching from the Gallery and for all those who are watching these proceedings now and in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200021#S00200","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571757600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Coppinger.  Like others, I warmly welcome the 221 Plus group and their families to the Gallery today and we should all be extremely proud of the calibre of women in this country and the courage they have had in fighting this terrible battle and tragedy.<\/p>  <p>  One cannot help but notice there was a familiar ring to the apology although it was heartfelt from the Taoiseach and the Ministers involved.  It is, once again, an apology to the women of this country whose lives have been unutterably altered by the actions and inactions of this State.  While I am happy for the 221 Plus group, their families and the many others outside these Houses who are receiving this apology, I question what it actually means and the lessons and changes in policy that led to this tragedy.<\/p>  <p>  I want to start by making what seems an obligatory statement, particularly for a woman in this Chamber.  I support the screening programme fully.  As a woman, I want to emphasise the importance of not undermining the national CervicalCheck screening programme.  I support the programme and know too well that it is vital for women but I will not take lectures or mansplaining from Ministers or officials who try to patiently explain to me the difference between a screening service and a diagnostic service, that screening services have limitations and all of them have statistically proven numbers of misread or false negative slides among the reads.  I know that, as do the women here and many of the women in Ireland.  We also know all too well that we must question what today's apology is for.  It is for treatment and non-disclosure, which is good but the apology would sit better with all of us in this country if we did not know that, in the near future, the Taoiseach, his Cabinet and the State will take the finest legal minds to a courtroom to argue against Ruth Morrissey in an effort to have a decision overturned that this State ultimately bears responsibility for the catastrophic errors in the laboratories in her case.  The State is responsible.  <\/p>  <p>  Today's apology should be for the decision taken in 2008 by the then Government, and reiterated by Ministers of Health since, including the now Senator Reilly, the now Taoiseach and the current Minister, Deputy Harris, to continue the outsourcing and privatisation of the screening service.  The State was responsible when it did not check whether the laboratories to which it contracted out the services were ISO accredited.  The State was responsible when it made cheaper costs the chief criteria in awarding contracts to those outside laboratories and when it did not bother checking the condition and volume of work of screeners in the laboratories to which the service had been contracted.  It is incredible that, to this day, the State has failed to investigate what happened in those laboratories when catastrophic errors were made in reading the slides.<\/p>  <p>  For two years, I have asked for a breakdown of the laboratories involved in the misread slides and have been told it is complex, not straightforward, and a breakdown of these misread slides from the laboratories would not capture the full nuance of the issue.  I have been told that the laboratories' standards and practices were beyond reproach.  We have been told repeatedly by the Minister and the HSE that there is nothing to see, that all laboratories make errors and the errors that were made were statistically in line with what might be expected.  Professor Scally was and is invoked to confirm that standards and practices in private laboratories are not the issue.  Why, then, is the Taoiseach so assured by the good Professor Scally when the State specifically required him not to look at the medical records or slides of the 221 women?  The Scally report never looked at the errors that have so far left 22 women dead with, sadly, more to follow.  Scientists have been paraded out to confirm that we just do not understand the complexities and limitations of the screening but we now have the laboratory audit of the 221 women and 354 slides.  We can now have some light thrown on these narratives.  What does these statistics and figures show?  One public laboratory, with cytologists and technicians trained here in Ireland to standards over which we had oversight, which were publicly funded and run not for profit, had an error rate of misread slides that was statistically a fraction of that found in Quest Diagnostics and CPL.  The error rate for Quest in Illinois was five times that of the Coombe.  The error rate for Quest in Teterboro was three times that of the Coombe.  The error rate for CPL in Texas was seven times that of the Coombe and even the error rate for CPL in Dublin was five times that of the Coombe.  It is incredible to say that, in every abattoir and meat factory in this country, an inspector sits there full time to oversee as cattle are slaughtered and meat is rendered to ensure that standards in end products are adhered to.<\/p><p>But for almost ten years we contracted out work to private laboratories because they were cheaper than our own public service and we did not think to monitor or have oversight of the quality and standard of the work.<\/p> <p> I would hugely welcome this apology, and it would sit better, if the Government would cease to pursue Ruth Morrissey and reopen the audit for all women.  My secretary's best friend is currently privately paying for an audit of her slides because she has been diagnosed with terminal cancer.  Her community in Lucan is fundraising so she can pay that.  There is a huge limitation to what has gone on and ending the review has unfortunately not stopped the addition of more cases of women who will face this trauma in the months and years to come.  I welcome the apology, as I will welcome the next apology from the next Taoiseach or Minister when they finally apologise for the outsourcing of the service, which has dearly cost lives and created tremendous pain for thousands of families throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200022#T00200","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571758200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I welcome the women, men and families who have come to the House today.  I realise that, for them, it must be at least somewhat of an important step that there would be a formal State apology.  It is an apology in words but is it an apology in deeds?  We continue to outsource a vital health service and still women are being pursued by the State through the courts.  Those two vital issues have not been changed one iota by the Government.  Women are still not believed or assisted after all they have had to go through.  The rights of the companies that profited from the issue continue to be placed before the rights of women in this country.  What does it say that during this crisis, a group called Womens Lives Matter sprang up throughout the country?  Is it not something else that women have to set up a group to tell the country their lives matter?  That is exactly what has happened.  Women's health, as we know, has been second place and second class in this country for a long time.  The lack of communication during this crisis and the finding by Dr. Scally of medical misogyny constituted the Ireland of old, where male doctors often knew best and women were not consulted about their own healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  The repeal the eighth campaign, the marriage equality campaign and the action of women in this campaign are positive developments in this country because they are a statement of the unwillingness of those who are being discriminated against to accept it any longer.  One of the main slogans in the repeal campaign was, \"Our bodies, our choice\", which has been repeated thousands of times in recent years.  So many spoke about the issue of not being heard or consulted about their own lives, health and future, and here we are again in the case of the women in question.<\/p>  <p>  This is not unique to Ireland.  Gender discrimination is an international feature of medicine.  In the US, for example, there are 96 health schools but only nine run what are called women's health courses.  There are many international statistics on the matter.  In Ireland, such discrimination is particularly pronounced, given that there is a strongly patriarchal society, but moreover, the women in question have been victims of capitalism.  A decision to outsource vital public screening was taken in the House by Fianna F&aacute;il.  While I do not know if Fine Gael voted for it at the time, it nonetheless carried it through.  Others, including the former Socialist Party Deputy, Mr. Joe Higgins, spoke out against it at the time.  The result, according to Dr. Scally, was that cost became more important than quality, while quality dropped as a weighting factor from 25% in 2008 to 15% in 2012.  Price increased as a factor to 40% of the consideration for tendering in 2012.  The outsourcing to laboratories thousands of miles away, whose work practices the Government is not privy to, has been the result.  If the Government really is sorry, it should stop the outsourcing and commit to providing vital women's health and other health screening programmes through the public health service, and stop pursuing women in the courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200023#U00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1571758200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an deis p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.<\/p><p>I accept the apology, which was the right thing to do, but for it to mean something, we will need action.

When Caranua appeared before us, it was a perfect example of an institution having become far more important than the people it was there to serve.<\/p><p>Apologies can be given.  They are very important.  It is what the women in question deserve, but action is also necessary.  I regret that within the Taoiseach's statement, of which I do not have a copy, I did not hear the Government take responsibility for the mistakes made by each Government during the debacle.  In the chapter of his report entitled Women's Health, Dr. Scally states:<\/p><blockquote>One key point that surfaced on several occasions was that most of the doctors involved in the disclosure (or non-disclosure) process were male.  This, and the general way in which they felt they had been treated, led the women to develop concerns that the attitudes and lack of openness were accounted for by paternalism in the healthcare system.<\/blockquote><p>The culture of paternalism and &quot;we know best&quot; has been mentioned but there are many further serious issues with decisions made by Government after Government.  On the same page, Dr. Scally states, &quot;There was a period when women&rsquo;s health was taken very seriously.&quot;  Can the Government imagine that?  It should be grateful for that.  He does not go on to say it is taken seriously now but states:<\/p><blockquote>In 1997 the then Health Minister established The Women&rsquo;s Health Council (WHC) with a remit to advise the Minister ... It had a comprehensive list of functions ...<\/blockquote><p>That was then.  Over the period CervicalCheck was in operation, I sat on a health forum in Galway.  We knew then that the wrong decisions were being made by the then Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney, and her colleagues in respect of the matter.  It simply should not have been done.  More important, the people involved in the laboratories appealed to us and begged us not to allow it to happen but still it went ahead, in a manner whereby women's lives did not matter but the cost did.  That is the underlying theme of the issue, namely, that women's lives were incidental to the cost, which was uppermost at all times.<\/p><p>A few passages of the report are worth highlighting.  I have read all three reports, the first of which was minimal.  It was followed by an interim report and then the final, detailed report by Dr. Scally.  What strikes me as I read his report is that if we let him continue to investigate, he will uncover more issues.  When we gave him free rein to return to his inquiry, he discovered there were laboratories in Honolulu and many other places.  The more he searched, the more he discovered, which is interesting.  Where do we stop Dr. Scally in his uncovering of issues about which the HSE and the Government knew nothing?  The system in place was not perfect but, gradually, Government after Government made decisions including, as has been mentioned, abolishing the health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the independent board of directors.<\/p><p>We are told by Dr. Scally that from 2010, CervicalCheck did not have an accountable senior person responsible for the delivery of the programme.  That is a Government decision.  Staff recounted how the bank guarantee occurred three days after CervicalCheck was launched nationally in September 2008.  As the financial crisis contributed to an economic recession, public sector programmes and organisations saw a reduction in the level of resources afforded to them, with CervicalCheck no different.  As its budget was reduced, CervicalCheck struggled to replace departed staff adequately.  Such decisions were made at Government level.<\/p><p>I turn to the chapter on CervicalCheck within the HSE governance system.  Dr. Scally states that screening was downgraded, having been absorbed into the HSE, and staff felt they had little influence within the HSE as a whole.<\/p><p>In 2017, there was an appreciation at the top level of the HSE that not all was well.  There were several findings and then a number of recommendations.  The report made a series of eight recommendations.  I do not have time to read them out but they are outlined on page 33 of Scally's report.  Surprise surprise, nobody knows what happened to those recommendations but they certainly do not seem to have been implemented. <\/p> <p> The board was dissolved, which meant the removal of an external, independent input into the running of the Health Service Executive at the highest level.  The Scally report concluded what we really all knew, at great cost in deaths, suffering and the mental and physical health of the women.  It confirmed the failure of CervicalCheck to tell women.  We knew it afterwards.  The crisis centred on the failure of CervicalCheck to tell women about their own medical information and disclose to them the results of a retrospective audit of their screening history carried out after they had been diagnosed with cervical cancer.  A paternalistic milieu, a \"We know best\" attitude and economic decisions made by Government after Government led to this.<\/p> <p> When giving an apology, it is extremely important to put the apology in context.  It is important to listen as well.  We have only a short time.  We on this side of the D&aacute;il have repeatedly been dismissed for being left and radical.  I have been quoting Dr. Scally and the staff that worked for CervicalCheck throughout.  I have listened to the women.  When the Taoiseach gives an apology, I ask him to please put it in context and tell us what he will change.  He should tell us how many of the 50 recommendations have been implemented.  Following publication of the MacCraith report, will the Taoiseach tell us when the outsourcing is going to stop?  That is the kernel of this debacle, along with the milieu and the culture.  When will that stop? <\/p> <p> On the role of the State Claims Agency, I note Ms Ruth Morrissey has been mentioned.  Some clarity on that would be very helpful.  Finally, I wish to raise a serious issue that shows the system is not functioning in an open and accountable way.  None of this would have surfaced without the bravery of the women concerned, particularly Ms Vicky Phelan, who refused to sign a non-disclosure document.  All of us would understand if she had done so, given the pressure she was under.  She did not succumb to that pressure and neither did the other women.  These are just some of the key issues in this debacle.  With the Taoiseach's apology, let us hear context, practical recommendations and steps towards taking this vital service back.  Let us look back to when women's health was theoretically important, in 1997.  It is now 2019.  Let us make women's health important.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200023#U00300","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571758800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>A formal State apology is a solemn occasion.  It is very important and very welcome.  It is essential that this apology is made and I thank the Taoiseach for it.  It is important not only to the group of 221, but to all women who have been affected by the cervical screening scandal; those who have had their anxiety and concerns raised and those who have waited months for delayed results.  This is of course a controversy which has particularly affected women, but it has also affected their partners and families, particularly the families of those who have died as a result of cervical cancer.<\/p>  <p>  However, several issues have been raised in this controversy.  It is very important to state that CervicalCheck has been a successful screening programme.  It has saved lives.  There has been a 7% year-on-year reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer and 50,000 precancerous changes have been identified since the programme was introduced in 2008.  In fact, it was introduced in the mid-west in 2001.  That may be cold comfort to those who have suffered because of the deficiencies of cervical screening but it is very important to recognise that this screening programme has essentially been successful, albeit not in all cases.  Dr. Gabriel Scally made 50 recommendations in his first report.  He identified flaws in the system.  Every screening system needs to be constantly reviewed.  The flaws he identified included a need for more oversight of the scheme, particularly expert international oversight, as well as experienced expertise in public health, colposcopy and communications.  Every scheme can be improved, and unfortunately it took legal action to bring the deficiencies in this scheme to the fore.  There have been failures in management, organisation and communication.  If Dr. Scally's recommendations are carried out, they will all be addressed.  Of particular importance was the placement of patient advocates on various committees in order that the patient's voice could be heard.  That is extremely important.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we welcome this.  Unfortunately, we need to welcome those who have suffered from cervical screening to the Gallery today.  We should recognise their persistence in pursuing this issue.  We as politicians have let them down but we have also striven to repair the damage of this scandal.  It is important that we continue to improve this screening programme.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to say that this is not a diagnostic test but a screening test.  There are flaws in all screening tests and all tests will fail to pick some people up.  That does not mean the failure to pick them up is in any way negligent.  It is just an inherent problem with the scheme.  However there are some issues which need to be addressed.  One of those is open disclosure.  The withholding of information from any patient is wrong.  We understand that.  We are still waiting for the patient safety Bill to be brought before this House.  It is extremely important that open disclosure is a part of the culture of our health service.  It is the fundamental issue which underlies this scandal.  The fact that an audit was introduced was extremely important.  It was the correct action to take.  Unfortunately, the closure of that audit loop was the failure of this cervical screening programme.  <\/p>  <p>  Dr. Gabriel Scally states it was \"deeply contradictory and unsatisfactory\" that the HSE had a policy of open disclosure but that policy was not implemented in this case.  It is very important that when controversies like this arise, recourse to court should be the recourse of last resort.  It should not be the recourse of first resort.  Unfortunately, that is the case where people feel they can only go to the courts to get satisfaction.  Open disclosure will satisfy many people in regard to wrongs they feel have been perpetrated against them by the health service.  <\/p>  <p>  There is another issue around absolute confidence.  Cervical cytology is not a binary \"Yes\" or \"No\" question.  It involves a matter of judgment about which it is difficult to be absolute.  Screening cannot be absolute.  In that context, a programme has built-in safeguards which will minimise missed cases but it cannot eliminate them completely.  This is true of every screening programme.  A missed case does not necessarily mean negligence was involved.  It is extremely important that we move to a much more accurate test, that is, the HPV screening test.  That will allow us to repatriate our screening to Ireland, where it should be.  I am aware of no country in the world that outsources screening as we do.  It is extremely important that HPV screening is introduced as rapidly as possible to allow us to look after our own screening.  We will have much more control over the governance of such a scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  I am glad the Taoiseach mentioned the pressures that front-line staff in CervicalCheck were under.  They were under severe pressure and are still under severe pressure in dealing with this fallout.<\/p><p>They have had to deal with the real and legitimate anxieties of women and been under extreme pressure to do so.  It has affected their health.  People have taken early retirement and left their jobs because they came under so much pressure over screening.  The backlog in producing reports on smear tests arose from a political decision, whether right or wrong, to offer an out-of-cycle smear test as reassurance.  It provided no reassurance and only increased women's anxieties.  It should be highlighted that political decisions taken without recourse to thoughtful medical advice can have far-reaching consequences.  It led to the anxiety over cervical cancer screening that has built up during the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200024#V00200","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571759400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I welcome all those in the Visitors Gallery who have been affected by this sad debacle.  I thank the Taoiseach for apologising on behalf of the Government for the failures of the State and the health system which let down so many women, with their husbands, partners, children, parents, grandparents and siblings.  I especially thank two women, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na who has departed and Vicky Phelan who did so much to highlight the terrible wrong done to so many women.  I hope this very public apology will in some way ensure something like this will never be allowed to happen again.  When people get sick, they should receive the very best available care from the health service, but it is clear that this did not happen for many.  That must change from now on.  What happened to so many women and their families is very sad.  It need not and should not have happened.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the rest of the Government.  They are the people on whom we depend to ensure the health service provides the required care for people when they get sick.  When people are sick and vulnerable, the health service needs to kick into action and take care of them.  It is clear that many aspects of the health service are letting people down and they have been let down.  Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na who lived in Ballyferriter was let down, as were Vicky Phelan and so many others whose names I cannot remember.  In many other aspects of the health service people are being let down.  As Deputies, legislators and public representatives, with the Government, we need to ensure things like this will never happen again because when people are sick, that is the time they need care and are depending on us.  I appeal to the Government to ensure nothing like this will ever be allowed to happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200025#W00200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1571759400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Like others, I welcome today's apology and the acknowledgement of the hurt and, in some cases, devastation suffered by women and their families as a result of the CervicalCheck crisis.  This is not a happy day; it is a solemn and sad day for those in the Visitors Gallery.  I know that recognition for the wrongs done and an apology for them are important landmarks for those so directly affected.  However, it cannot be the be-all and end-all.  An apology must name what went wrong.  For an apology to be true, it must give an assurance that it will not happen again.<\/p><p>We have previously heard in this Chamber very encouraging words issued to women and their families, not least when the Taoiseach replied to me during Leaders' Questions to say none of the women would need to enter a courtroom to get justice.  It was an error to give that assurance because the State was not the sole party involved.  We need to reflect on these things when they happen in order that those errors will not be repeated in other circumstances.  The court cases took place within months of those promises being made and people wondered what was happening.<\/p><p>Members of the 221+ group constantly contacted me to say it was like pulling teeth in trying to get answers and a satisfactory outcome.  They had been promised that an <i>ex gratia<\/i>payment and package with some healthcare benefits would be forthcoming by Christmas 2018, yet it was May 2019 before they even received forms to complete.  They were very upset and hurt about being presented with forms to complete.  There was no doubt about who they were and that they had been impacted on.  It is an issue of trust.  No indications were given as to how long it would take or how much women could expect to receive.  It was not a question of looking at a big payout.  They were concerned about spending money they did not have on diagnostics.  That was the key issue.<\/p><p>In September 2018 a woman was contacted about a test audit.  She was told that the process would take six months to complete.  In July 2019, ten months after she had started the process, she was informed that she could expect to receive a communication one month in advance of the results, but she heard no more until last month, 12 months after she had commenced the process, when she rang to request her results.  As of last week, she had still heard nothing.  She phoned again last Friday only to be told that somebody would contact her on Monday but nobody did.  When she contacted them again today, she was told that it would be another four to six weeks.  In all, it will have taken 15 months - 15 months of worry.<\/p><p>An apology is really important.  I want not to diminish but acknowledge it.  However, unless it changes how the women are still being treated, there is a question mark over it.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to Dr. Scally who gave priority to the victims.  He wanted to give them a loud voice and get to the truth.  We all acknowledge that he has done very good work.  He has spoken about the obstacles he encountered, especially in gaining access to senior officials in the Department of Health and the HSE.  That was subsequently rectified, but it should not have happened.  He outlined how much of their time had been used in attending and preparing for various Oireachtas committee meetings.  We all need to reflect on how we conducted ourselves in dealing with this debacle.  We need to ask if we impeded or helped.  This acknowledgement must consider these things.<\/p><p>There would be no apology today without Vicky Phelan.  Members of the 221+ group, many of whom are in the Visitors Gallery, would have been suffering in silence and would not know each other had it not been for Vicky Phelan who had the courage to bring this issue into the public domain.  While she was a very ill woman, she had the courage to say she would not sign a non-disclosure agreement, understanding what that meant.  Others then realised they were not suffering alone and the bigger scandal was brought into full view.<\/p><p>I particularly remember Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na who went to primary school with my children.  I remember her as a child.  She left this world worrying whether her children would remember her.  I hope they will hear today's apology for her.<\/p><p>For those who were so badly affected by this, the very least they should be sure about is that when they are giving their <i>imprimatur<\/i>, it means what it should mean, that is, it is as safe as it possibly can be.  Some have encouraged other women to have screening tests because they are incredibly important.  That has to be the legacy of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200025#W00300","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571760000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I want to close today's statements by sincerely thanking the women and family members who are here with us in the Gallery, those who are watching proceedings nearby and those who are watching from afar.  I have met many of you over the past year and a half and come to know some of you very well.  Others I may know less well but I hold their personal stories and experiences with me each and every day.  These experiences they have shared with us have been incredibly impactful and there is no doubt but that they have led us to this moment where the Taoiseach has apologised on behalf of our State.  I acknowledge that today is an important day but a very difficult day.  I acknowledge that such an apology cannot undo all that has happened, certainly not, but something that really stayed with me from the Scally report was his finding that many women and families wanted someone who was involved to say sorry and to mean it.  I hope all those affected, whether they are here in the Oireachtas or watching from home, can finish this day in no doubt that the State apology offered to them is genuine.  I hope it brings some healing, which I know is rightly so important to them and the 221+ representative group.  It is one thing to stand here and apologise for others, it is easy for me to apologise for others.  I want to personally apologise to the women affected as well.  I apologise for the times that I gave commitments that were heartfelt and genuine and were harder to follow through on.  I apologise for the times we have had to come into this House and give partial information because that was all we had available and for the hurt that caused.  I personally apologise.  The words of Deputy Catherine Murphy are honest and raw and challenging, in that we need to learn lessons from this as well.  I certainly commit to doing that.<\/p>  <p>  It is said we do not heal in isolation but in community.  These women have provided a community of support to one another through all of this and in this moment, today in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, their country, their State, joins with them.  We have come to learn a lot about the reality of cervical cancer and the devastation it wreaks on women and their families.  We came to know women and men who became household names, though that was never their desire.  They gave up their privacy and let us into intimate details of their lives in order that their experiences would become ours; women who have survived but whose bodies, psyche, self-image and future will never be the same again.  When I think back on those late April days of last year, when all that we have been discussing this afternoon was still unfolding, I remember making a decision to contact Vicky Phelan, who is here with us today, directly.  That would be the first chat of many we would go on to have but it was indeed the most important conversation I have had in all of this.  Vicky's words that day were typical of her determination and generosity of spirit when she said to me, \"Simon, I just want some good to come out of this.\"  Those words not only stayed with me but guided me from then on.  There are many things we wish had not happened throughout this crisis but there is one outcome we can never regret.  We now have a national goal of effectively eradicating this horrific cancer.  We can move towards a future where as few women as possible experience the awful reality of a cervical cancer diagnosis.  <\/p>  <p>  We know how to do this.  We can achieve this through an effective HPV vaccination programme combined with a well-organised screening programme.  This year, as others have said, we extended the HPV vaccination programme to boys as well as girls.  I think of Laura Brennan this afternoon as well.  This is a significant step towards protecting the future health of our children from the most serious consequences of HPV infection.  Our efforts to increase vaccination uptake rates will continue to intensify.  We will keep pushing back against the misinformation because this is a vaccine that saves lives and we will build on the improvements we have seen in recent years.  Work is progressing well on the introduction of HPV primary screening during the first quarter of next year.  I join others who say we must collaboratively and collectively to make this happen.  This is the culmination of a lot of hard work and will make Ireland one of the first countries to introduce this method of testing.  We are investing in the Coombe to develop our own national cervical screening laboratory so we never again will be so reliant on other people's laboratories and, in line with Dr. Scally's recommendation, we have established our first ever national screening committee.  We are not just saying sorry.  We are implementing every single one of Dr. Scally's recommendations.  All of us are involved.  There is no disunity on that.  We have re-established the women's health task force.  We have put patient advocates on the HSE board and we have told Dr. Scally not to just do his report and go away but to hold our feet to the fire and make sure we deliver this and he is doing a superb job in that regard. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge the intense work of many people across the health service who are working hard to make this a reality.  I too want to emphasise, as I know our patient advocates do, the substantial contribution of the CervicalCheck staff and the work they have done to contribute to women's health over the ten years of the programme.  We must do everything we can to ensure that we have a cervical screening programme that women can trust.  I acknowledge the active contribution that so many are making, particularly Stephen Teap and Lorraine Walsh, to the work under way in my Department and the HSE in that regard.  Today is a difficult day but it is also a significant one.  It is the day we formally say sorry but it is also the day we say collectively we can, we must and we will do better.  Some good must come from this.  The CervicalCheck crisis has left a very painful mark on very many but we must ensure that it leaves a legacy.  Our legacy to the next generation does not stop at making sure the mistakes made here are not repeated.  Our legacy is a country that protects our people from this awful disease.  I reiterate my apology, my support for the Taoiseach's words and my sincere thanks to the women and families who are here with us today.  I promise them that I will continue to work to achieve the goals that I know we in this House and beyond, across the Oireachtas, share to eradicate this horrific disease and to stand by the women who have been affected. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200026#X00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 (At\u00f3g\u00e1il) - Order of Business (Resumed)","time":1571760000,"counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200026#X00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1571760000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I asked about the commitments made in terms of the &euro;1 million fund to assist couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation, IVF, in 2017.

The purpose of this Bill is to prevent the so-called cuckoo funds from crowding out first-time buyers out of the market in town and cities across the country.  Home ownership levels have already fallen to 67%, which is well below the EU average of 69%, and is from a high of over 80% in 1991.  Our concern is without action, that home ownership rate will fall further behind.  This Bill is designed to level the playing field for first-time buyers and keep the dream of home ownership alive by earmarking a specific amount of units per development for first-time buyers.  The Bill still allows specific build-to-rent in appropriate places but prevents already-built developments from being sold in bulk to one purchaser.  This means developments that boost supply are encouraged but purchases that simply swoop in on existing developments would be banned. <\/p><p>Real estate investment trusts, REITs in the private rented sector, PRS, are a small but rapidly expanding part of the housing sector.  Additional supply is welcome but there have been numerous cases in which already-built developments have been bought entirely by one fund.  This is crowding out first time buyers and risks changing the character of areas of this country. <\/p><p>Home ownership is already under pressure with ownership rates in Ireland at their lowest level in half a century and below the EU average.  My party, Fianna F&aacute;il, supports home ownership and we believe it is an honest and just aspiration for people to have.  We need affordable housing for working people, both on the rental and purchasing side.<\/p><p>When we look at home ownership rates, we see that other countries that are mentioned often such as Germany and Austria have expanded ownership levels while Ireland is going in the other direction. <\/p><p>This Bill aims to protect first-time buyers from undue competition by massive investment funds they cannot hope to match on the open market.  The Bill also ensures that renting is considered as part of overall local  housing strategies.  This will help ensure balanced communities where different tenure types are available rather than concentrating rent-only in particular areas while excluding first-time buyers. <\/p><p>This Bill will allow local authorities to earmark a certain percentage of zoned land, up to 30% at the discretion of the local authority, for first-time buyers.  It will operate on a similar basis to the current Part V provisions, which ensure that 10% of units are set aside for social housing.For example, a development of ten units must have up to three units available for first time buyers to purchase.  Importantly, each local authority must also review its housing strategy to set out its requirements for rental units over the lifetime of its own housing plan.  This will ensure a full picture of the housing market is considered when the council sets out its future plans. <\/p><p>The goal of the Bill is to prevent the bulk-buying of entire developments by investment funds, thereby freezing out first-time buyers.  It contains exemptions to allow build-to-rent developments that would otherwise not be built to go ahead as part of an overall housing strategy agreed by each local authority, while preventing developments already in place being snapped up by investors at the last moment.<\/p><p>This way, investment in new built-to-rent will be allowed at the discretion of the local authority or indeed an Bord Plean&aacute;la but they must be earmarked for rental only as part of an overall housing plan adopted at each local authority level.  We believe that action must be taken at this level.  Last year, 18,000 homes were built according to the Department's own figures.  Nearly 3,000 were purchased by so-called cuckoo funds and the PRS.  On the other side, nearly 3,000 were also purchased by the State.  On the State side, we need to build more public housing and it needs to get involved.  We also need to also protect and encourage those who wish to buy their own homes, particularly first-time buyers.  I and my party believe that this Bill will go a long way towards levelling the playing pitch for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200029#AA00800","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1571761800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200029#AA00900","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1571761800,"counter":231,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200029#AA01000","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571761800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1571761800,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200029#AA01150","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1571761800,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200029#AA01200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1571761800,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200029#AA01300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Latent Defects Redress Bill 2019: First Stage","time":1571761800,"counter":236,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200029#AA01400"},{"type":"speech","time":1571761800,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to establish a Latent Defects Redress Board, the functions of which shall be,<i>inter alia<\/i>, to provide resolution to ordinary owners who purchased homes in good faith, in order that such owners have an opportunity to seek mediation or adjudication in relation to non-compliance with building regulations. <\/blockquote>  <p>As Members of this House know, during the time of the Celtic tiger, hundreds if not thousands of people bought homes only to discover at a later stage that, through no fault of their own, these homes had latent defects.  I am not talking about cosmetic changes but significant fire safety defects or water ingress that cause significant structural damage to the people's homes.  This was in the first instance the responsibility of developers who oversaw projects in which buildings were built poorly and which were then sold on to people with those defects.  There was also a failure of the State to put in place a proper regulatory regime to ensure that builders could not get away with such developments.<\/p><p>When this issue has been raised with both the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Taoiseach, the stock response has been that this is a matter between the purchaser of the home and the developer.  While in the first instance that is true, it is the failure of the State to properly regulate those purchases and those buildings which means the State has some responsibility in this regard.  Indeed, the State has accepted some responsibility with respect to some latent defects, for example, with Priory Hall and some areas regarding mica and pyrite.  The question then for buildings left with significant structural defects is that why was the State willing to step in and assist with those cases of latent defects and not others.<\/p><p>The Bill I am introducing today is giving the Government an opportunity to address this issue.  The Bill is based on a cross-party Oireachtas housing committee report that was published in January 2018 called Safe as Houses.  What that report and what this Bill seek to do is as follows.  In the first instance, it asks the State to set up a one-stop-shop, not to accept liability for these defects but to provide homeowners with a location from which they can get information on the legal framework within which they find themselves.  Crucially, the Bill also seeks to put in place in non-judicial mediation and adjudication scheme.  The idea of this would be to ensure that homeowners are not forced to go to the courts but would have some recourse to mediation and adjudication.  Contrary to what the Taoiseach has often said when asked about this, in the first instance the proposal here is to ensure that the developer is responsible for remediating the buildings they sold and which had been poorly built.<\/p><p>It is simply not the case that either this Bill or the report is asking the State to take on a <i>carte blanche<\/i>liability.  We are asking for information, mediation and adjudication in order that in the first instance, the developer is forced to pay.<\/p><p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, I cannot propose the introduction of a fund to cover the cost of remediation where the builder or developer is still not trading.  What the Bill empowers the Minister to do, however, is commission a report that would allow him to consider options for the provision of such a fund, if it were in his interest.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, who has dealt with this directly, and the Taoiseach should note it is no longer possible for the Government to sit on its hands and ignore the plight of those with latent defects in their homes.  Those affected purchased a home, which was probably the single biggest investment in their lifetime.  For the State simply to say it is a matter for the homeowner and developer is no longer credible.  I am introducing this Bill in a genuine attempt to encourage the Government to put in place a latent-defects redress scheme, as outlined in the report Safe as Houses.  I look forward to the full support of Members of the Opposition who supported the recommendations when they were before the committee.  I ask the Government to study the Bill seriously and work with the rest of us to try to put in place a scheme that supports homeowners and, in the first instance, forces the developers to pay but, where the developers are not pursuable because they are no longer trading, provides some other means of redress.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will be prioritising this for Private Members' time as soon as possible.

The failure to intervene to stop the various breakdowns and the decision not to intensify attempts to have the institutions restored in the past three years have caused immense damage.  I have said time and again that the decision to collapse the Assembly and Executive was unforgivable.  It betrayed the people of Northern Ireland and did not give them a voice at a critical time when there was an incredible threat to the future of the economic and social well-being of Northern Ireland.  That, of course, was Brexit, which has added to the situation immeasurably.  I hope the Taoiseach will join me in calling on people to tone down the rhetoric and examine the potential benefits to Northern Ireland in the context of Brexit and the arrangement being made of having access to the customs territories of both the European Union and the United Kingdom.  In this context, will the Taoiseach detail what economic impact assessment has been carried out on the new arrangements for Northern Ireland and the new harder Brexit for Britain?  Can we assume the Taoiseach has checked the economic projections of the move away from Ms Theresa May's deal?  It needs to be said that the deal arrived at last week is worse than the withdrawal agreement of Ms May in terms of the relationship between the United Kingdom and the Republic.  This is because it implies a harder Brexit in terms of the Tory Party and Mr. Boris Johnson wanting to take Britain out of the customs union and Single Market.  All the independent economic analysis is suggesting this will cause significant medium- to longer-term damage to the Irish economy.  There are many doubts and there is much detail yet to be worked out regarding how the arrangements for Northern Ireland will work out on the ground and in concrete reality.  There was a real sense from Brussels last week that Europe was at the end of its tether.  The European Union was happy to do the deal on the basis that it wanted to move on to other issues and avoid having no deal.  What was arrived at last week is welcome from the point of view of avoiding no deal but there are very serious questions arising over the nature of it in terms of the harder Brexit that is now in store for us as a result of Mr. Johnson's intentions to take Britain out of the customs union.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, two members of the British Government informed the House of Commons that measures for the imposition of direct rule in Northern Ireland had been prepared.  This is again in the context of the proposed deal not being ratified by 31 October but it also appears to relate to the new Stormont restoration deadline, in late January.  Can the Taoiseach indicate what discussions he has had with the British Government in the past two weeks on this matter?  Has he made it clear that this kind of unilateral action on the part of the British represents a clear breach of its commitments to us and Northern Ireland in the overall peace settlement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200030#BB01700","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1571762400,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Regardless of the continuing political machinations in Westminster, Mr. Boris Johnson and the EU leaders have agreed on one fundamental principle, namely, that there can be no veto for unionists.  While there is no such thing as a good Brexit &mdash; we have debated that here on many occasions and have collectively come to the same conclusion &mdash; and while the deal that was agreed last week between Britain and the European Union is not perfect, it does protect the island and its people from all the unimaginable consequences of a hard border.  It respects the Good Friday agreement and recognises the unique needs of the North economically and in terms of protecting peace.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the political institutions in the North, I want to be very clear.

For instance, we have never had a woman as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, as Minister for Finance or as Secretary General in the financial area and clearly we have never had a woman Taoiseach.<\/p> <p> In terms of income and pensions, the Government failed to make any mention, for example, of the supplementary pension scheme, in which I was heavily involved, the purpose of which was to allow women, who are often lower paid and who have broken service in paid work because of rearing families and other family commitments, to get a supplementary pension.  Such a scheme would give those women in particular an opportunity to supplement the State retirement pension, which might be the only income they would have to rely on in retirement.<\/p> <p> In terms of a lord mayor of Dublin, it is clear there is a need for more local democracy in Dublin but that discussion must be a broad one.  If we have a singular lord mayor we need to have a very clear idea of the role and whether the person will have the capacity to deal with housing or to be in some way responsible for the quality of planning in the city, which at the moment leaves much to be desired.  How will we address the greening of the city and in particular the serious development of public transport that will encourage people to leave their cars at home and to use public transport?<\/p> <p> I would like to know the timeline for both referendums and if the Taoiseach will have a discussion with Opposition parties and other interested persons on what should be the subject matter of the referendums.  For instance, has the Taoiseach made up his mind on the position of women in the home?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200031#CC02500","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571763600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I hope I will get extra time as well, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200032#DD00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1571763600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Sometimes it is better not to hear these things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200032#DD00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1571763600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Okay.

In the budget, domestic violence was given &euro;20 million in funding and greyhounds got almost &euro;17 million.  Domestic violence was given parity of esteem with a cruel industry.  Funding for sexual violence increased by 10% but it was halved over the ten years of austerity.  Calls to the rape crisis centres have increased by 25%.<\/p>  <p>  There are only three refuges in the greater Dublin area that are operational right now.  I was told that the refuge in Blanchardstown turns away up to 500 women and their families every single year and that many women have to be discharged into homelessness.  The outreach the centres do, which is critical to give women support and counselling, for example, while attending court, could be expanded into the area of prevention.  They could go into schools and speak in communities if they had the funding.  The refuge in Blanchardstown could do with two apartments, which it has space for right now, but we need a hell of a lot more.  I put it to the Taoiseach that he has not stepped up to the mark in his constituency and he needs to do it.  Will he and the Minister beside him, Deputy Zappone, increase such services?  We have a major homeless epidemic in the greater Blanchardstown area and that is compounded by women who cannot get into refuges and those who are in refuges who cannot get out of them because they have nowhere to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200032#DD00600","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1571763600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I would argue that much confusion is evident in the current status and operation of the new Citizens' Assembly on gender issues.

For example, we had an extremely active and effective all-party committee on the eighth amendment.  It is fair to say it was the ultimate originator of the specific proposal and policy that was put before the people and supported by them that is now on the Statute Book.  Perhaps it is narrower than some of the recommendations that came from the Citizens' Assembly, but both were important parts of the working out of the issue.  Ultimately, the Oireachtas committee had to come to a decision, which it did.  The three Fianna F&aacute;il members on the committee were instrumental in arriving at the particular proposal that emerged.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is aware that the recommendations of previous assemblies failed to progress where the process was simply that the report went to the Government and it took unilateral decisions on how to proceed, or not to proceed, with many of the recommendations and the issues discussed.

We are grateful to Members for supporting my party leader's amendment to the resolution that the assembly would include in its work consideration of existing structural pay inequalities that lead to women being disproportionately represented in low-pay sectors.  That is extremely important.  As we all know, when Fianna F&aacute;il was last in government and it cut the minimum wage, the majority of workers impacted by that were women.  We know they are disproportionately represented in low-paid employment.<\/p>  <p>  The value of the work of the assembly will be in the opportunity to advance transformative change for both women and girls.  That can only happen if the Government commits to implementing the recommendation of the assembly members.  The Taoiseach originally committed to having the assembly up and running by the end of this month.  Could he assure the House that the full assembly will begin its work by the end of this year?<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the assembly on a directly elected mayor for Dublin, Sinn F&eacute;in supports both the proposition for the assembly and the officeholder.  However, we hold the strong view that the establishment of a directly elected mayor should be created in tandem with wider and very much talked about reforms of local government.  Crucial to the value of a directly elected major to the capital city will be the devolving of powers to the officeholder.  Devolved powers must include significant policy areas currently controlled by central government, such as transport and waste management.  The devolving of powers from central government to the mayor must be included in the considerations of the Citizens' Assembly.  Without discussing the devolution of power, the Citizens' Assembly discussion on a directly elected mayor for Dublin would have very little value because it needs to discuss those far-reaching powers that are necessary.

We should not be embarrassed to acknowledge that, whether it is the repeal of the eighth amendment, new laws related to domestic violence, the ratification at long last of the Istanbul Convention, the reform of our divorce laws, gender quotas for election to this D&aacute;il, or subsidised childcare for the first time in the national childcare scheme coming into effect in the next couple of weeks.  That is important for men as well as women, but can be very important for women.  Participation in higher education by women has increased dramatically in recent years, with better parental leave, and with parental benefit coming into effect in a few weeks for the first time.  There will be improved maternity benefits.  An initiative that I have been especially involved in is Better Balance for Better Business, to encourage private sector companies to ensure that more women are on private sector company boards.  We have well above 40% female membership of State boards.  I think more women than men were appointed to State boards for the first time last year.  We are pursuing the national strategy for women and girls.  A women's health task force has been re-established and that in many ways responds to a matter raised by Deputy Connolly earlier.  Even though it is controversial, the advancement of 45 female-only senior academic roles in the higher education sector is a good idea, and it is being pushed forward by the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor.

There are plans for some new ones or at least to increase capacity but I have to double-check that.  We need to change the approach.

It is worth reading the facts and research about the State pension.  The difference in the average State pension paid to a man versus a woman is approximately 2%.  Pensioner poverty in Ireland is higher among men than women.  When it comes to the State pension, there is not significant inequality anymore in what is paid to men and women, or in pensioner poverty.  There is when it comes to occupational pensions, which comes down to the fact that, historically, women have tended to work in lower paid roles and have been in and out of the workforce.  The solution to that is to press ahead with the Minister, Deputy Doherty's, reforms relating to lawful enrolment, making sure that everyone who is at work pays into an occupational pension and that their employer does so too.  That is how we will achieve, over time, the closing of the pension gap.  We are pursuing the pay gap with legislation to require employers to produce information on the gender pay gap in their company or workplace and to explain why there is a difference.  We need to strengthen that legislation to make sure that it is not just a reporting mechanism and that things actually change.

Incredibly, they are aged 77 and 82 years, respectively, so they are hardly a danger or threat to anybody, but the State prosecutor submitted to the judge who was hearing their case that they were a flight risk.

He has been courting many countries in the developing world for support.  The people most likely to suffer from climate change in the developing world will be women and children.  Women are the basic farmers in most developing countries.  Without effective programmes to reduce and ameliorate climate change in the developing world, the lives of women and children, particularly young girls, will worsen.  The wars of the future may well be resource wars, brought about by the impact of climate change.  Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to raise that and to reflect on it?  Ireland's aid budget has increased, which is welcome, but the Government could do an awful lot more, particularly on air pollution, in this State to support the elimination of air pollution on a global basis, and to assist small farmers - the majority of whom are women with dependent children - in developing countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200034#FF00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1571764800,"counter":311,"content":"<p>We all agree the UN summit was an important event for political leaders but it was also an opportunity to debate and secure international agreement for the bold policy responses that will be necessary to tackle climate change.  In his speech to the summit, the Taoiseach said leadership is required to take action and, again, we agree.  Much like the Taoiseach and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, we can agree on some issues.  However, the Taoiseach's big message to the summit was carbon tax increases and some woolly references to a just transition, the transformation of transport, electricity, buildings and food production systems.  Carbon tax is not a big idea and neither has it proven effective.  If a behavioural tax does not change behaviour, it is just a plain old tax.  Worse still, it is a tax that will actively work against a just transition for the workers in micro and small businesses the Government should seek to protect.  Last month was an opportunity to push for the big public policy changes that can, and will, protect current and future generations and to push for solutions that will challenge developed countries' economic models but will protect future generations from having to walk to school knee deep in water day in and day out.  For example, did the Taoiseach and others engage on the provision of free public transport?  He told the gathering that he wants Ireland to be known as a green country because of how we respond to the climate and environmental challenges facing our planet.  If he is serious about that ambition for Ireland, his policy objectives need to radically shift.  We need incentives and solutions to get people out of their cars and onto publicly-funded buses and trains.  Any climate scientist worth his or her salt is pushing for this change in individualised public policy to collective responses.  How prominently did the provision of public transport for citizens feature in the Taoiseach's engagement with leaders during the summit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200034#FF00500","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1571765400,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I am afraid we do not have any time left for the Taoiseach to respond.

This is a requirement under the Children First Act 2015 and in such instances parents are informed.  As the independent statutory regulator, Tusla's early years inspectorate employs a risk-rating system for all early years services.  This system informs inspection scheduling and levels of oversight and scrutiny of a service.  A critical status on Tusla's risk-rating system implies a high and intensive level of scrutiny by Tusla's national review and enforcement panel.  It does not imply that children attending these services are at risk, or that they should be removed from the service.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that having limited information available with regard to a service's current status may be a cause of frustration and concern for parents.  However, I share Tusla's concern about the implications for parents, children and services, including causing undue worry among parents, if Tusla were to inform parents whenever a service is categorised as critical.  The reasons for this categorisation can be varied and do not necessarily imply a child is at risk.  Tusla's national review and enforcement panel meets approximately every two weeks, and services are de-escalated whenever concerns are addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The number of services at critical status changes continuously as the inspection process proceeds and as services react to Tusla's concerns.  For example, of the 37 services described as critical at the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs on 31 July last, 18 had been de-escalated by 1 October and their cases closed.<\/p>  <p>  While parents have a legitimate interest in knowing the findings of inspections, a service's registration status and the outcomes of legal proceedings, there is also a need to give service providers the right to correct potential inaccuracies in inspection reports prior to publication.  Tusla publishes inspection reports as soon as due process has been followed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200035#GG01200","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1571765400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.

The Minister is correct that this can be for a number of reasons but, at the same time, the concern is that parents are still being kept in the dark.  Regardless of the rating - and I concur with her and Tulsa that we do not need to alarm parents - parents have a right to be informed when a service is deemed high or critical risk.  Normally when a cr&egrave;che is deemed high or critical risk, it is because of a regulation relating to fire, overcrowding or ratios.

The inspection itself was carried out in May this year.<\/p>  <p>  I was very disappointed with the issues raised in the report.  To hear the word \"chaotic\" used to describe the management of this important work was of great concern.  While I noted that inspectors found that no child had been harmed, it is clear that significant problems were found, mostly resulting from staff vacancies and a high staff turnover rate.  This has led to some children in foster care and their carers having to deal with many changes in their social worker over the years.  It was interesting to read that where there was a stable social worker, children were very positive about their relationship.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 92% of children in care were in foster care in a family setting at the end of the second quarter of 2019.  This compares well internationally.  A recent international comparison, which was carried out by NUI Galway, collected data published between 2015 and 2017.  For example, in Wales, Scotland, Norway and Australia, an average of 80% of children were in foster care.  The figures were lower again in the USA at 75% and England at 61%.<\/p>  <p>  The area comprising Carlow, Kilkenny and south Tipperary is one of the five Tusla has identified as having significant challenges in providing a consistently good standard of foster care.  Staffing levels in these areas is a major contributing factor to the challenges faced.  I have asked Tusla to review the reasons for the high turnover of staff, and to identify and examine the contributing factors.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has developed a workforce strategy, which was approved by its board last spring.  It aims to address staffing issues within the agency in the long and short term.  The longer term solution is to increase the number of social work graduates and to optimise the mix of skills between social workers and other grades to support them.  My Department is working with colleagues across government and educational bodies to increase numbers of social work graduates.  In the short term, Tusla is pursuing a proposal to provide bursaries to social work students to encourage them to work with Tusla.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200035#GG01700","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1571765400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>The Minister has described it as \"disappointing\".

We all know that the last thing a vulnerable child needs, one who is already facing changes and different things in his or her life, is to build up a relationship with a social worker only for it to be torn apart.  That gives that child the perception that there is nobody there for them and that the State is failing them and, to be honest, the State is failing them in that situation.  There will always be situations where staff have to change but not to the level that we are seeing in this area.  It really is not good enough.

We must ensure that, when the system goes down, it is back on track very quickly in order that people do not miss out on the opportunity to avail of subsidies or whatever benefits to which they are entitled.<\/p><p>Having seen last week how the system works, is the Minister confident that it is user friendly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200036#HH01300","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571766600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I am fully confident that it is user friendly.

Nevertheless, it will probably take some time for people to use it, to understand how to do so, to follow the instructions and so on, as well as for providers to take it up, because it is such a large leap into something new.  I am also very confident there will be the supports required to maintain the system.  One of the reasons for the use of the various types of pilot scheme is in order that when it goes live, we will feel confident that it will work on busy days when there will be an influx.  That is also why I emphasise the pilot scheme we have undertaken.  All of the people who have gone through the pilot scheme have effectively obtained their award; they just need to pass it on to the provider of their choice.

There was a sense that they were not being listened to and that, on the one hand, the Government talked about how it was into climate action, while in the next moment it stated there would have to be a liquefied natural gas facility on the River Shannon to provide for our future security.  Such facilities, however, undermine the security of young people.  I could list example after example, but I return to my main point that on this issue more than others, young people have a perspective and voice that deserve to be heard because it is their future.  They can envisage the reality of what will unfold in their lives if we do not address it.  The Government states it listens, but it does not seem to change it to make different decisions and act.

The report is concerned with the actions of Tusla, the courts and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

It is of the utmost importance that efforts are made to support parents where\u00a0possible and to ensure that a child only enters care where all other solutions have failed.

For the first time, questions are being asked about whether it is fit for purpose in its current form.  An audit carried out by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the very well-respected special rapporteur on child protection, found that communication between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was poor, with limited levels of inter-agency co-operation and co-ordination between them falling far short of international best practice.

Tusla and its supporting bodies have taken many steps to ensure it is fit for purpose, including its own directorate of transformation and policy, which has made many strides in reshaping and refocusing its policies.

The community childcare subvention scheme, CCSP, will remain open to new applicants until Friday, 15 November 2019.

No new applications for these schemes can be made after these dates.<\/p>  <p>  The transition to the national childcare scheme represents a major change management initiative for Pobal as scheme administrator.<\/p><p>Accordingly, while applications for CCSP will be accepted until Friday, 15 November, providers are strongly urged to submit all applications by 1 November, to the greatest extent possible, so that applications can be processed in a timely way and Pobal can concentrate on preparations for the opening of the national childcare scheme.<\/p> <p> Any parent who is in receipt of support under the current legacy schemes can choose to remain on that scheme and can continue to receive the same level of support that they are receiving at present.  These families can also choose to move over to the national childcare scheme at any time from 20 November onwards and, for many, this will mean receiving a higher level of subsidy towards the cost of their childcare.<\/p> <p> This approach reflects my commitment that no one will lose out in the transition to the new scheme.<\/p> <p> Through budget 2020, I have secured the full year costs of the national childcare scheme for 2020, in addition to extra enhancements that will be of particular benefit to lone parents and other working families.  Certain families already had the option to stay on existing schemes until the end of August 2020.  They will now be able to stay on those schemes until they are no longer eligible or they no longer require childcare.<\/p> <p> From September 2020, the maximum hours for the new scheme will increase from 40 hours per week to 45 hours, particularly benefiting parents of school-age children who need before-school and after-school childcare to include time for work and commuting.  Low-income parents who are not working or studying will have their hours increased from 15 to 20 hours.  This will support our objective of promoting employment and reducing poverty.<\/p> <p> The introduction of the national childcare scheme will increase the number of families who can access financial support, with some families now receiving support towards their childcare costs for the first time.<\/p> <p> As mentioned, it will also see many families qualify for a higher level of support, including as a result of the important new enhancements from budget 2020.  For example, the budget measures will see maximum subsidy rates for a child aged under one increase from their current level of &euro;145 per week, to &euro;204 per week from 25 November 2019 when they move on to the national childcare scheme, NCS, and to &euro;229.50 per week from September 2020.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to be able to provide the House with assurances about the financial impact of the national childcare scheme from its inception.

SPARK has pointed out that under current childcare subvention rates the parent could qualify for &euro;145 a week which would drop to a maximum subsidy of &euro;51 per week, which would be a substantial loss.  In the past I believe the Minister has referred to about 10% of parents losing out under the new scheme, but that 10% happens to be the 10% most at risk of poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200039#LL00300","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1571767800,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Deputies' questions and I know the scheme has complexity.

For lone parents accessing the national childcare scheme in a few months there may not be absolutely the same level of supports as there were in the targeted schemes.  However, in budget 2020 I secured funding to increase hours from 40 to 45 and from 15 to 20, and also after-school hours from September of next year.

Tusla has developed an excellent online resource called Empowering Practitioners and Practice Initiative, EPPI, to support social workers.  It provides summary research findings and best practice guidance across a range of subjects.  They include more recent social concerns, including organised child sexual exploitation, the trafficking of children and cyberbullying.  Child protection work is carried out in a highly pressurised environment, often with heavy case loads.  It is crucial for Tusla to make sure staff are supported.

Ireland is a world leader in this regard with over 92% of the 6,017 children in State care at the end of June being in foster care.<b><\/b>This compares favourably from an international perspective.  Indicative figures show that 61% of children in care in England reside in foster care, while the equivalent figures in Norway and Scotland are 89% and 88%, respectively.  It must be noted that these figures relate to different time periods and thus are not directly comparable.  It should also be noted that alternative care may be approached very differently in other jurisdictions, with different policy, practice and legislative contexts in operation.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons foster care is not always an option.  It may not be possible to find an appropriate foster care placement, a child could be at immediate risk or a child might have specific therapeutic needs that are best met in residential care.  In these cases, a child may be placed, in his or her best interests and on the basis of social work assessments, in a residential setting.  Approximately 7% of the 6,017 children in care in Ireland live in residential settings.  In June 2019, this amounted to 400 young people.  Individual residential centres care for small numbers of children, often no more than two or three.<\/p><p>Residential services are provided by Tusla directly and by private and voluntary bodies commissioned by Tusla.  There are 26 voluntary residential children&rsquo;s centres providing care for children in State care.  Tusla uses a mix of its own services and voluntary and private providers to maximise the availability of services that are best suited to meet the needs of individual children and young people.  Tusla uses other providers where no suitable placement is available in its own residential centres.  <\/p><p>Tusla has advised that it is in the process of developing a three-year strategic plan for children&rsquo;s residential services.

In England, there were zero-hour contracts for the staff and thus very low staff retention, which has a negative effect on the relationships between young people and the staff.  I have had engagement on this issue with a number of services in the Dublin and greater Dublin areas and they are very concerned.  The staff in voluntary residential services here are not on zero-contract hours and, therefore, they have all been in those services for a long time and they have built up relationships with young people.  They are concerned that service provision into the future will be a tick-box exercise in terms of whether children are being fed and a service complies with governance and so on.  While the relevant boxes may be ticked off, this is not an indication of the quality of the services.

The idea of this service is that it can prevent people coming as far as the attention of Tusla.  Is the new money that has been allocated specifically for school completion or is it falling under a general budget for educational welfare?  It is important that any money that is going to them is specifically ring-fenced for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200042#OO00300","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1571769600,"counter":406,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised a point that has to do with the employment status for school completion co-ordinators and project workers in the proposal they put forward to be brought in under ETBs.

Tusla has taken a\u00a0proactive approach to the recruitment of social workers in a difficult and challenging recruitment environment.  We covered this a bit with Deputy Broughan.  There is a worldwide shortage of social workers and this was noted by HIQA in its report on 19 June 2018.  Tusla is competing with the HSE and the voluntary and private sectors.  Tusla has advised me\u00a0that recruitment efforts to\u00a031 August 2019 are ahead of target for social work with a total\u00a0 figure of 149 hires.  This\u00a0has resulted in an increase of social workers\u00a0by 64\u00a0whole-time equivalents when attrition is taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  I share the concerns expressed by Deputies regarding the increased use of temporary agency social workers in recent years and I have communicated this to Tusla.  I also appreciate the attention that the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs has given the issue as part of its deliberations on the recruitment and retention of social workers in Tusla.  Notwithstanding this, Tusla must deploy agency workers to ensure it can continue to provide its services to vulnerable children and their families at a time when overall referrals are increasing.  I understand that Tusla is currently reviewing agency use.  I am informed that formal\u00a0discussions will take place with F&oacute;rsa on 29 October 2019\u00a0regarding a proposal to carry out an agency conversion across front-line service.  I welcome this initiative.<\/p>  <p>  I will be raising the issue of agency staff in my performance statement to Tusla, which will issue next month, as a key input to its business plan for 2020.  Tusla currently spends approximately &euro;31 million annually on agency staff.  I am setting it a target of reducing this spend, primarily through the conversion of agency staff to permanent staff.  I also requested that\u00a0Tusla develop a strategic multi-annual workforce plan, which would include reflection of the labour market and the current limited supply of social workers.  I am pleased that Tusla now has a strategic workforce planning model which I understand\u00a0will be rolled out over the coming years.  The implementation of the strategic workforce planning model will represent a very significant change for Tusla and its service delivery teams in 17 geographical areas.  The model will increase and formalise the use of social care workers on child protection teams.  The model should also reflect the realities of the labour market supply\u00a0and ensure that social workers are supported by appropriate complementary grades.  I refer again to Deputy Broughan's questions earlier.  The model will also seek to deliver on a strategic focus for Tusla with a gradual transition to multidisciplinary teams.  The multidisciplinary teams will look to consist of the optimum mix of skills across social work, social care, therapeutic staff, family support, education welfare and administrative support.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla Recruit\u00a0has also informed me that\u00a0it has\u00a0a very special, proactive approach to recruitment\u00a0 with 16 social work-specific campaigns,\u00a0for example a rolling campaign for professionally qualified social workers; the social work graduate programme designed to recruit new graduates; social work team lead; senior social work\u00a0practitioner; and principal social worker.  I welcome the fact that there is a focus on recruitment and retention as part of the roll-out of the strategic workforce implementation plan, assisting staff well-being by assessing workplace stressors and critical incident exposure in the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also taken an initiative to establish the social work education group which provides a forum for Tusla and other stakeholders, including the HSE and the Probation Service,\u00a0to explore and act upon possible actions to influence the future supply of social workers.<\/p><p>The first priority identified by the group is the streamlining of student placements.  My Department has commissioned research to identify alternative approaches to streamlining the process of working with stakeholders.  A final report is due shortly and potential next steps will be considered.  The social work education group also provides a perfect platform for Tusla to bring forward creative ideas for initiatives such as conversion courses to train existing social care workers as social workers.  These are just some of the ideas that are coming forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200042#OO01000","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571770200,"counter":414,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire.<\/p>  <p>  Trust and the relationship with social workers are a significant key aspect of their role for the child and for getting results for them.

The last allocation of CL&Aacute;R funding has been a serious disappointment in County Cork.  I will go through the figures.  Over &euro;3.8 million was allocated nationwide.  In Cork county, &euro;115,000 was allocated.  This represented only 3% of the total.  In north Cork, which I represent, there was no funding at all.  It went to a number of projects in west Cork.  The Department, which had been in communication with the local authorities over recent years, set out that Cork county was entitled to have 15 priority projects under the CL&Aacute;R programme.  The Department informed the local authority that if these were prioritised by it, they would be funded.  Only three of them were funded.  The funding applications made by Cork County Council, which examines each of the communities' priorities, prioritised traffic-calming in Knocknagree, alongside the school, for example.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, would have to agree that the traffic-calming measures around schools have a positive effect.  The local authority also prioritised projects in Kanturk, Lyre and Millstreet.  The representatives on the ground were making great play about what they had done for those communities but none of the funding came through.<\/p>  <p>  CL&Aacute;R funding is a vital component of projects.  The locals put in so much money, and CL&Aacute;R and the local authorities provide other moneys.  The CL&Aacute;R programme is vital in funding projects in rural communities, such as Knocknagree, Kanturk, Lyre and Millstreet.  CL&Aacute;R funding has been of great benefit.  Why was Cork county getting only 3% of the funding?  As I stated, it received only &euro;115,000 out of &euro;3.8 million, which was the allocation nationwide.  Why were the projects prioritised by the local authority in Cork not funded?<\/p>  <p>  Cork county is at a great disadvantage in that its landmass is greater than six counties put together.  Any of the six counties that would make up the landmass of County Cork would have far more projects funded.  Cork county needs to be examined according to its three divisions, namely, the northern, southern and western divisions.  There should be a number of projects funded per division under the CL&Aacute;R programme.  Has the Department, in its wisdom, taken the populations into account?  The northern division, which is predominantly the area I represent, has over 90,000 people.  Some 150,000 live in the southern division.  Smaller counties have similar populations.  Cork County Council has three local community development companies, LCDCs.  Funding should be allocated per LCDC.<\/p>  <p>  Let me return to the fundamental point.  Projects were prioritised by our local authority and it was led to believe they would be funded under the CL&Aacute;R programme.  Why were they not funded under the CL&Aacute;R announcement made earlier in the year, which was worth &euro;3.8 million nationwide?  I will leave those questions with the Minister of State and come back to him with more points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200044#QQ00600","speaker":"1283"},{"type":"speech","time":1571770800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  The CL&Aacute;R programme provides funding for small infrastructural projects in rural areas that have suffered from significant population decline, based on CSO data.  The programme was closed for new applications in 2010.  However, the Minister, Deputy Ring, relaunched CL&Aacute;R in the second half of 2016 because he recognised the programme can make a great difference to people living in the relevant areas.<\/p>  <p>  Since CL&Aacute;R was relaunched in 2016, almost &euro;33 million has been allocated to over 1,400 projects under different CL&Aacute;R measures.  The 2019 CL&Aacute;R programme invited applications under three separate measures: support for schools and community safety; play areas; and community well-being support.  <\/p>  <p>   There was great interest in the CL&Aacute;R programme this year, with almost 500 applications received.  The funding sought in those applications far exceeded the available budget.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to fund all the projects for which applications were submitted.  Nonetheless, &euro;6 million has been allocated for 179 projects under the 2019 CL&Aacute;R programme.  This includes funding for eight projects in County Cork, to the value of almost &euro;300,000.  <\/p>  <p>  A total of &euro;1.89 million has been allocated to 74 projects in Cork since 2016 under CL&Aacute;R.  The funding approved for any particular local authority under measures 1 and 2 of the 2019 programme, which are for schools and play areas, reflected the extent of the designated CL&Aacute;R areas in each county.  It is not based on the overall geographical footprint or the population of the county.  From a Galway perspective, I can understand some of the Deputy's frustration.  In other words, counties that have a larger percentage of their geographic area in CL&Aacute;R received more funding than counties that had a small percentage in CL&Aacute;R.  For example, Leitrim is a relatively small county but all of it is designated as a CL&Aacute;R area.  The approach taken is only fair, given the specific targeted nature of the programme.

The local authority worked very hard on these projects.  It worked with the communities and a lot of time and effort was put in to make sure the projects would be right.  Some projects were burnt in the 2018 application round.  Did the Department give a commitment that if there were 15 projects submitted by the county council, they would be funded?  Is further funding to be made available under the CL&Aacute;R programme in 2019?  Does the Minister of State accept that Cork county should be treated differently because of its landmass?  The Minister of State referred to the size of his county, County Galway.  Much of the landmass of County Cork is in the CL&Aacute;R region.  I am referring in particular to the Duhallow region, where not one of the four projects in respect of which an application was made received funding in the last round.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200044#QQ00800","speaker":"1283"},{"type":"speech","time":1571770800,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution.

Key policy decisions are not being brought for discussion and agreement to the national oversight committee or the standing sub-committee, as was supposed to happen, and are instead being largely made within the confines of the Department of Health and the HSE.  This centralised decision-making has the knock-on effect of the drugs and alcohol task forces not being enabled or supported to carry out the role assigned to them in implementing the strategy at local and regional levels.  The fact of the matter is that communities are being excluded from a role in key decision-making, breaking a key commitment given by the Government in the new strategy.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the work and commitment of CityWide, the community sector voice in this field across the greater Dublin region, and tell the Minister of State the actions that CityWide believes, based on its experience, need to be taken.  First, the Department of the Taoiseach needs to take responsibility for oversight of the new strategy.  Second, the Taoiseach should convene a national forum of all national drugs strategy stakeholders to set out clearly what is expected of them in their roles in implementing the strategy in line with the principles therein.  Third, a community development plan should be put in place at the core of the national drugs strategy.  My read of this situation is that the bottom line is that the drug and alcohol task forces must be allowed to do as the national drugs strategy promised, that is, co-ordinate an inter-agency approach to the implementation of the strategy in the context of the needs of their respective regions and areas.<\/p><p>The second part of my Topical Issue matter moves from the wider experience of Dublin and the rest of the country to my constituency.  I recently received correspondence from the Cavan Drug and Alcohol Service, which provides a service to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency.  I will read from the first paragraph to give a sense of the seriousness of the matter.  It comes from a letter to the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, for whom the Minister of State is standing in today, issued on 11 October.  It reads:<\/p><blockquote>After almost two decades of delivering community based support services across Cavan and Monaghan CDA Trust CLG (AKA Cavan Drug Awareness) is now making plans to wind down operations and dissolve the company by the end of 2020.  Our organisation has received no increase in funding for several years in spite of rising rent, insurance and other costs.  We will be unable to retain staff due to being unable to pay increments in line with cost of living increases or invest in new training opportunities for them.  At present CDA Trust CLG is the only dedicated addiction support service for two counties [Cavan and Monaghan] part from local methadone prescribing GPs and [a] valued colleague in the HSE.<\/blockquote><p>The service is treating in the order of 50 individuals every week.  This service is hugely important in a constituency such as Cavan-Monaghan.

I will take the debate on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.<\/p>  <p>  Government policy on drug and alcohol addiction services is set out in the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - A health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025.  The strategy commits to expanding the availability and geographical spread of relevant quality drug and alcohol services and to improving the range of services available.<\/p>  <p>  Drug and alcohol task forces play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of the drug problem in local communities.  They also ensure that a co-ordinated approach is taken across all sectors to address substance misuse based on the identified needs and priorities in their areas.  The Department of Health provides in the region of &euro;28 million per annum to supporting task forces through various channels of funding, including the HSE.  In 2019, the Department, through the HSE, provided &euro;927,813 to the North Eastern Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Force.  From this allocation, the task force provided &euro;212,000 to CDA Trust.  CDA Trust provides a range of valuable services to individual families and the wider community affected by drug and alcohol use and misuse in Cavan and Monaghan.  CDA Trust also gets funding from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to provide a drug rehabilitation community employment scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, recently received correspondence from CDA Trust indicating its intention to wind down operations by the end of 2020.  It identified two key issues: delays in the transfer of funding from the HSE and communication difficulties between the HSE and the North Eastern Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Force.  The Minister of State asked officials in the Department of Health to seek a report from the HSE and the task force on these issues.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the Department secured additional funding of &euro;1 million to implement key actions in the national drugs strategy.  From this funding, the Department provided the task force with an additional &euro;20,000 to support its work, 50% of which is recurring on annual basis.<\/p><p>This funding can be used to enhance services and meet operating costs.  The Department of Health is also providing an additional &euro;190,000 over a three-year period for the young people's substance use support services in Cavan and Monaghan.  This strategic health initiative will improve access to health services for young people whose lives are affected by problematic alcohol and substance use in the two counties.  The initiative will develop and strengthen collaborative working across the counties to support the delivery of integrated holistic services through a continuum of care model, that is, education and prevention, and treatment and rehabilitation.  This initiative was developed by the task force and the HSE following consultation with local stakeholders.  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, would encourage the CDA Trust to engage with the task force and the HSE to see how it can participate in the new young people's substance use support services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200045#RR01100","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571772000,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Again, in the very short time I have, I think it is important first of all to deal with the bigger picture.  In July 2017, CityWide wrote to the Taoiseach indicating its welcome of the Government's commitment to maintaining and building on the key principles of inter-agency partnership and community participation, but the experience in the intervening two years, as I have already put on the record in my opening contribution; is simply not ticking the box.  It is a very serious matter.  We need to ensure that the structures in place are working to ensure that communities have a real voice in the decision-making process.  Any examination of the facts would demonstrate that that is not the situation that has applied over the past couple of years.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the CDA Trust in Cavan and Monaghan, it is very important to recognise that as we enter the fourth quarter of 2019, the situation is that the quarterly allocation of funding to the CDA Trust has not yet presented, with the result that it has to try to exist on an overdraft arrangement until such time as the fourth quarter moneys are released.  I could go into it in greater depth with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, but I am telling him what the factual position is, and it is intolerable.  It is also intolerable that the trust's returns in relation to quarterly activity and expenditure reports that have been presented to the North Eastern Regional Drugs and Alcohol Task Force, NERDATF, in good time are not compatible with the HSE's own assessment of these matters, with the result that there is duplication in the work to be undertaken in terms of administration and oversight, rather than in front-line provision of real care and supports for those who need it most.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the reply that has been read into the record by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and that whatever hand the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, has had in its construction, it is not reflective of the reality of the current crisis situation that we face in Cavan and Monaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200046#SS00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1571772000,"counter":453,"content":"<p>The Deputy's point is made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200046#SS00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1571772000,"counter":454,"content":"<p>This is not an idle threat by the CDA Trust.

That is understandable.  Members of the Garda are being asked to verify the identification of persons they do not know, and so many decline.

Credit union personnel are terrified to accept the PSC as proof of ID, as they are aware that at least two Departments warn them against accepting this proof of identification where the individual has no other proof.  In essence, we have a cohort of people wanting to use the public services card to obtain and sustain access to financial services on the one hand and, on the other hand we have two Departments refusing to allow financial institutions to facilitate their clients in the fight against criminality and white and blue-collar crime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200046#SS00700","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1571772000,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Sherlock for raising this very important issue.  The PSC was provided for in legislation in 1998, when it was introduced alongside the personal public service, PPS, number to replace the previous Revenue and social insurance number, RSI, and the social services card, SSC.  It acts as an identifier for access to a broad range of public services.<\/p>  <p>  The public services card can only be requested or accepted as proof of identity by a body specified in Schedule 5 to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended, and only where that specified body has a transaction with a person concerned.  In other words, the PSC can only be used to verify a person's identity where that person is availing of a public service and the relevant public body is authorised to, and prepared to, accept the PSC as proof of identity.  The provision of financial or banking services is not a public service.  Banks or other financial institutions or private sector bodies are therefore not specified bodies for the purposes of the PSC.  This means it is not possible for a person to offer his or her PSC as proof of identity to a bank, or any other institution such as a credit union, which is offering banking services, nor is it permitted under social welfare legislation for a bank or a credit union to accept a PSC as proof of identity, even if a person volunteers to present his or her PSC for this purpose.<\/p><p>When the Department is made aware of any requests being made by a non-specified body for a person to produce or provide details of their PSC, officials from the Department contact the organisation concerned and advise it of the legislative provisions in place in respect of this matter.  Specified bodies are in all cases required to process and store data in accordance with the general data protection regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018, as amended.  A provision is included in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill that was published and proceeded through pre-legislative scrutiny in 2017 to allow people to voluntarily present their PSC as proof of identity but only if they choose to do so.  It would, under this provision, remain illegal for a body other than a public body specified in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act to ask for or require production of a PSC.  This provision, if passed, will increase the utility of the PSC for people who hold one without imposing any obligation on them to make it available other than for use of public services.<\/p> <p> The PSC delivers valuable customer service benefits.  For example, more than 600,000 free travel journeys are undertaken every week by holders of the PSC.  More than 600,000 payments are verified each week using the PSC and approximately 400,000 PSC holders use the MyGovID service to access online public services.  Satisfaction levels among users are very high, which one does not often hear about figures in the public domain.  Earlier this year, a customer survey on the PSC was published.  The survey, which looked at customer satisfaction around the processes and procedures involved in applying for a PSC, was undertaken independently on behalf of the Department by specialists in customer experience consultancy.  More than 1,000 PSC holders, of varying age and gender, were interviewed.  The results showed that 96% of PSC holders surveyed were either very satisfied or fairly satisfied with the process.  Almost nine out of ten, 87%, agree that it is very useful that other Government service providers may be able to use the identity information already provided in obtaining the PSC to avoid the need to provide the same information.  Nine out of ten of those surveyed felt that they either had access to the right level of information in respect of the SAFE-PSC process or had access to more than they needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200046#SS00800","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571772600,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

I am seeking to speak for people throughout Irish society who, as may surprise the Acting Chairman, would not have a passport or driver's licence, which are the two other obvious forms of identification.  They are in possession of the public services card.  We are merely asking that the services could be expanded, especially for anti-money laundering purposes, such that where a person is carrying out a financial transaction where proof of identity is required, especially in a credit union with many older people who use it, the public services card would be deemed to be fit for purpose for proof of identification and to adhere to the money laundering legislation.  The Minister of State tells us that there is a high degree of satisfaction with the card and that people are comfortable using it.<\/p>  <p>  It really brings us back to the point of whether the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, which has been sitting there for two years, could be expedited in a way that would ensure that a provision could be made that it could be used for anti-money laundering legislation, so that if somebody opens an account in a credit union, the public services card could be deemed to be a valuable or appropriate form of identification.

Knowing the type of pragmatic Minister she is, I believe she will have no entrenched views until she familiarises herself fully with the workings of ParentStop, which I believe is only available in Donegal.  It provides free and confidential one-to-one telephone and group support to parents who need some help with parenting challenges, whether it is bedtime routine, managing behaviour, parenting skills, putting in place a parenting plan, setting boundaries, school concerns, communication breakdowns, worries about teens' substance misuse, or anything else of immediate concern to a person.  It is there to offer support.  It also helps with the challenges of separation and the strains that that causes for families.  ParentStop can listen while people talk it out, provide information on their specific parenting concerns, and advise on the next steps.  It was established in 2005 as a charitable organisation and registered as such in 2007.  It offers a valuable service to parents and co-parents on matters of separation, legal matters and about children in a state of anxiety due to legal matters in their lives.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that this service is provided.  ParentStop offers niche services that I can safely state can be obtained nowhere else in the country but in Donegal.  Donegal should not be penalised for establishing it and ensuring that it has been extremely successful over the last 14 years.  I raise it tonight because it has been told that the funding will be withdrawn.  Not all of the funding comes from Tusla.<\/p><p>Some of it comes from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health, while some of it comes through the bodies that deal with drugs.  I have also mentioned this to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  We must look at all of it in the round in the context of the services Tusla provides at times when families and individuals are dealing with legal matters, teenagers are struggling and there are challenges in second level schooling.  They are times of great stress, anxiety and difficulty for the individuals concerned.<\/p> <p> The Minister should deal with ParentStop in an atmosphere that is conducive to resolving this issue, not in the atmosphere of a court.  I know that the legal profession in County Donegal is extremely supportive and it does not see this as taking business from it.  If we had more organisations such as ParentStop throughout the country, it would result in massive savings.  Therefore, I cannot understand why the funding was withdrawn.  I quote directly a practising solicitor: \"The courts are unable to deal with the volume of cases in the family law court and at the moment if someone has issued family law proceedings in the Letterkenny district area, (seeking access or maintenance for example), they will have to wait until at least February 2020 to be given a hearing.\"  ParentStop was able to bridge that gap.  In the vast majority of cases a final order was made by a court without any necessity for a hearing date following the party's attendance.  All legal people concur with this.

The HSE is ParentStop's other main funder.  Between 2016 and 2019, annual funding provided by Tusla for ParentStop increased by &euro;31,000 to &euro;68,625.  In 2018 Tusla provided an additional &euro;7,000 for ParentStop to address its recurring annual deficit.  Tusla provided a further exceptional annual increase of &euro;24,000 for ParentStop in 2018 following the withdrawal of funding by the north-west regional drugs and alcohol task force.  In 2019 Tusla provided further once-off funding of &euro;18,640 to assist the organisation to invest time and resources in developing a sustainable funding model.  Tusla has informed me that all funding options available to support ParentStop have been exhausted and that, unfortunately, ParentStop has decided that it cannot continue to operate within the funding allocations available from its core funders.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that Tusla assign its resources to the areas which it perceives to be in greatest need, ensuring the best possible outcomes for children and families.  Funding of services is informed by Tusla's commissioning approach.  Tusla seeks to fund services in the most beneficial, effective, efficient, proportionate and sustainable manner in order to improve the outcomes for vulnerable children and families.  Under Part 8 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla funds a range of organisations which provide services for vulnerable children and families, including those providing parenting supports.  Tusla remains committed to commissioning and developing supports for parents and deeply regrets the decision of ParentStop to cease operations at the end of 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200048#UU00200","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1571773200,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I am extremely disappointed to say the least.  The Minister and her officials have taken an entrenched position and are not even prepared to think about this issue.  We must look from 2005 at the return the State the gained from its investment, whether in Tusla, the health promotion grant available from the Department of Health or the north-west regional drugs and alcohol task force.  I suggest to the Minister that she consider meeting a representative group from ParentStop.  She is the lead Minister who could communicate with the other Departments involved and pull everything together.  She says Tusla is committed to commissioning and developing supports for parents and deeply regrets this decision.  It is not being taken by ParentStop; rather, it is being made for it because the various State agencies have withdrawn funding.  Tusla states it must ensure its resources are assigned where they will have the most benefit and that the funding of services is informed by its commissioning approach.  It also states it seeks to fund services in the most beneficial, effective, efficient, proportionate and sustainable manner.  That statement is an insult to ParentStop which is stating the converse, namely, that it is not able to ensure it can operate in an efficient, proportionate and sustainable manner.  It is totally insulting.  As the Minister is fair, I ask her to make a start and meet as soon as possible, after the break next week, if there is to be one, with about three people from the organisation.  Perhaps she might invite somebody from the Department of Health, Tusla and the other agencies to attend to try to pull all of this together.  I ask her to take the initiative.  She cannot do any more than that tonight.  A sum of &euro;100,000 to &euro;120,000 is needed, not all of which would come from Tusla.  Other agencies could make contributions.

As I indicated, Tusla increased its contributions to ParentStop three times, in addition to the original core funding, to enable it to carry out the excellent work it was doing, as well as to support it in designing a sustainable funding model.  I understand a little about the setting up of a voluntary organisation, providing excellent services and looking for ways to grow them, receiving support from different agencies and Departments and perhaps philanthropic sponsors and putting it all together in a sustainable funding model to continue to support the group, organisation, company limited by guarantee or charity, as the Deputy indicated.  Tusla has tried to offer financial support in time to ParentStop to assist it in looking for a sustainable funding model.  The Deputy asked who was responsible for that model.  He also asked whether it was the Government or the organisation which was responsible.  They are good questions.  I am not saying I would not necessarily meet it, but I know a little about establishing an organisation to meet a need.  ParentStop has done a brilliant job in that regard.  As I understand it, there are other organisations in County Donegal that also offer parenting supports.  Tusla's job is to look at all of the voluntary groups, as well as its own services, and identify that they are meeting the needs of parents and families in County Donegal.<\/p><p>My understanding is that this is an excellent voluntary organisation with an excellent provision of services that has had a challenge in developing a sustainable funding model, with which Tusla has tried to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200048#UU00400","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571773800,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Sorry-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200049#VV00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1571773800,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I cannot allow any more-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200049#VV00300","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1571773800,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Will the Minister agree to meet-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200049#VV00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1571773800,"counter":472,"content":"<p>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows better than anybody that I cannot allow it.

I know some Members of this House have visited Catalonia and their perspectives contribute to our consideration here this evening.  Irish people know Spain, and, indeed, Catalonia, well.  After Britain, Spain is the country to which we travel most.  Furthermore, cities and towns across Spain, including in Catalonia, are home for many Irish people, while, of course, many Spaniards visit and live in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The question of Catalan independence remains a deeply divisive and contentious issue in Catalonia, in the rest of Spain and beyond.  We are all following developments in Spain closely, in particular in Catalonia where tensions have been particularly high in recent days.  On Monday, 14 October, the Spanish Supreme Court announced its verdict on the cases of 12 Catalan pro-independence leaders.  We are all very aware of subsequent reactions across the spectrum of opinion in Catalonia and elsewhere in Spain.  I note the Spanish Government's statement on this matter.  We welcome the Spanish Government's commitment to the defence of the rule of law and respect for the judicial process.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's position remains that we respect the constitutional and territorial integrity of Spain, and that any related arrangements are matters to be determined by their own citizens through their own institutions, in keeping with the rule of law.  With regard to the Spanish Supreme Court's verdict, just as we would expect any other country to respect our courts, we respect the decision taken by the Spanish courts.  Differences of opinion must be contested with full respect for the law and the rights of all citizens.  The rule of law is a cornerstone of all modern democracies and it underpins the functioning of the European Union just as it underpins our own democracy in Ireland.  Citizens and their elected representatives should, of course, be able to disagree with laws and work to change laws but this must be through the appropriate constitutional channels.  However, we cannot ignore the law as it stands or act beyond it.  In the same vein, decisions of courts should be respected.<\/p>  <p>  Members will have seen that, in response to the Spanish Supreme Court's decision, large-scale protests have taken place across Catalonia over several days.  In some cases, violence has been reported, including clashes between protestors and the police.  There is no place in politics for violence.  In Catalonia, and elsewhere in Spain, as in all of our democracies, public representatives and citizens must work to advance their goals with full respect for the law.  The freedom to express contesting views is essential in any democracy, but differences of opinion must be contested with full respect for the rule of law and the rights of all citizens.  This is the foundation that underpins and protects modern democratic societies.<\/p>  <p>  We respect, of course, people's right to gather and to express freely their opinions, as happens may times here in Ireland, but we share the calls for calm, for moderation and for respect for others so as to allow people to go about their daily lives without disruption.  Those who live in Catalonia and the many who are visiting, including from Ireland, should be able to travel freely to and from airports, train stations or by car.<\/p>  <p>  Our ambassador and officials working in the Irish Embassy in Madrid continue to follow these developments and, of course, are in contact with the Spanish Government.  They are also closely monitoring the situation regarding any demonstration taking place and are providing suitable travel advice to Irish citizens who may be in difficulty there.  Tensions are clearly very high in Catalonia at present and the question of independence is deeply divisive there and probably here in the Chamber.  It is important that the voices of all Catalans are heard and represented, including those who do not support independence.  The Government will always support efforts in Spain that are aimed at reconciliation within Catalonia and within all of Spain on this sensitive issue.  The Government continues to support a resolution to the current situation that is based on democracy and the rule of law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200049#VV01200","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1571773800,"counter":480,"content":"<p>All of us in the House are very concerned at recent developments in Catalonia.  The recent decision by Spain's supreme court to sentence nine Catalonian politicians and activists to jail terms of between nine and 13 years and to fine three others has brought violence to the streets of Barcelona.  Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets to protest against these sentences and a general strike took place last Friday.  My party is very concerned about these developments in Spain.  We recognise this is a very sensitive, legal and constitutional issue for the Spanish Government, its people and the Catalonian region.  A new constitution was enacted in Spain in 1978 and 17 autonomous communities were established at that time.  The 1978 constitution clearly states there exists a single nation and that it is indivisible.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the rule of law and the territorial integrity of Spain.  We recognise that Spain is a country in which there is a great degree of economic, social and cultural diversity.  The independence referendum held in October 2017 and deemed illegal by Spain's constitutional court resulted in the gravest crisis in the country's 42 years of democracy.  This is a highly complex and sensitive matter and it is apparent that there are divergent views and divisions about Catalonia and whether it should be an independent nation.  These diverging views can be found in the region itself and more widely in Spain.<\/p>  <p>  While acknowledging the complexities of this situation and the diverging opinions on this issue, Fianna F&aacute;il is of the view that the independence referendum held on 1 October 2017 lacked legal validity, as did the decision of the Catalonian Parliament to declare independence from Spain on Friday, 27 October 2017.  We believe this is an internal matter for Spain and that any actions taken must be in keeping with country's legal and constitutional framework.  At this stage, every effort should be made to encourage dialogue between the Spanish and Catalonian Governments and between the acting Prime Minister, Pedro S&aacute;nchez, and the Catalonian President Quim Torra, to try to resolve the crisis, bring an end to the violence and stabilise relationships.   We need to see a de-escalation of tension in Catalonia and a satisfactory outcome that accords with the Spanish constitution, democratic principles and the rule of law.<\/p>  <p>  The European institutions, where practical and feasible, should use their influence and considerable experience to try to de-escalate the tension in the region.  Stability in the EU nation state of Spain is in all of our interests.  As the Minister of State has said, Ireland has a very close relationship with Spain.  For example, in 2017 there were approximately 2 million visits from Ireland to Spain.  In 2018, 423,000 Spanish visitors came to Ireland.  A total of 35,000 Spanish students visit Ireland every year, which all of us see, particularly during the summer months.<\/p>  <p>  Many of us have visited the beautiful, historic and cultural city of Barcelona.  It was heartbreaking to see the violence on the streets there in the past couple of weeks.  Almost 600 people received medical treatment following the violence on the streets last week and 194 people were arrested.  I hope common sense will prevail, that peace and stability can be brought to the region as soon as possible and that there will be goodwill on all sides to bring this about.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the statement from the Minister of State that our ambassador and officials based in the Irish Embassy in Madrid continue to follow developments and that our embassy is in contact with the Spanish Government.  The embassy is closely monitoring the situation, according to the Minister of State, with regard to the demonstrations.  It is important that we are fully briefed on all of these matters.<\/p><p>This is indeed a very difficult and complex situation and is one which I hope can be resolved.  I note that the protestors at the weekend were calling on Spain to talk.  This will certainly be resolved by dialogue and all of us should contribute to bringing about that dialogue and bringing about peace and stability in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200049#VV01300","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571774400,"counter":482,"content":"<p>In October 2017, I had the great privilege of observing the Catalan independence referendum first hand.  I was one of a large group of parliamentarians from across Europe who travelled to Barcelona and the surrounding districts to witness the vote.  Some of us, myself included, were clearly sympathetic to the cause of Catalan self-determination but others in that delegation were not, yet still believed that the vote was a legitimate democratic exercise.  My view, having been there, was that it was an incredible expression of a peaceful civil society movement intent on giving voice to the millions of Catalans who have a desire to determine their own future.  It was unofficial but to describe a well-organised, peaceful ballot as illegal, let alone seditious, is simply not credible.<\/p>  <p>  My abiding memory of the day of the referendum was meeting an 83 year old by the name of Antonio in the polling station of Barceloneta on the seafront in Barcelona.  When I met him, his arm was in a sling, his head and legs grazed and congealed blood still visible.  Antonio had arrived at his local polling station at 7 a.m., determined to be one of the first to cast his ballot.  Two hours later, the Spanish Civil Guard arrived and, unprovoked, attacked the assembled voters.  Antonio was badly hurt and admitted to hospital.  His arm had been fractured but, undeterred, he returned to the polling station and waited in line.  <\/p>  <p>  When I arrived, the polling station was packed.  People had been waiting for hours while the Spanish authorities repeatedly crashed the online voter registration system.  When I asked Antonio to describe his treatment at the hands of the Spanish police, he said it reminded him of the brutality of the Franco regime through which he lived his younger life.<\/p>  <p>  Antonio was dignified and peaceful.  Above all, he was democracy personified, refusing to be bullied by the truncheon of the Civil Guard.  The treatment of thousands of Catalans that day, much of which I witnessed, cast a dark shadow over Spanish democracy but what was to follow was even worse.  The decision by the Spanish Government and judicial system to jail and prosecute elected politicians and civil society leaders was unprecedented and, let us be under no doubt, these were not legal questions but were politically motivated charges intended to criminalise a peaceful social movement and curry favour with an increasingly reactionary Spanish nationalism.  While those of us who had have direct experience of the Spanish political and judicial system were not surprised the sentences meted out in October are still shocking.<\/p>  <p>  Oriol Junqueras, former vice president of the Catalan Parliament was sentenced to 13 years in prison.  Jordi Turull, former spokesperson for the Catalan Government, was sentenced to 12 years in prison.  Ra&uuml;l Romeva, former foreign minister, was sentenced to 12 years in prison and Dolors Bassa, former minister for labour, was also sentenced to 12 years in prison.  The former speaker of the Catalan Parliament, Carme Forcadell, the counterpart of our Ceann Comhairle, was sentenced to 11 and a half years in prison.  What was her crime?  She was accused of allowing a debate in the Catalan parliament on the holding of the October 1 referendum.  <\/p>  <p>  Other Ministers were sentenced to ten and a half years in prison and two leading pro-independence civil society activists, Jordi S&aring;nchez and Jordi Cuixart, were sentenced to nine years.  What kind of political system jails government ministers and civil society activists for organising a peaceful ballot?  What kind of government sends in armed guards and soldiers to beat peaceful protestors off the streets?  The sentencing of Catalan politicians and civil society activists casts more than a dark shadow over Spanish democracy, it calls into question that democracy itself.  I have a message for the Spanish Government and the Spanish ambassador to Ireland, H.E. Ildefonso Castro: deber&iacute;a darnos verguenza lo que est&aacute;is hacienda en Catalunya y lo que est&aacute;is hacienda a la democracia en Espa&ntilde;a.  Shame on that Government for what it has done.<\/p>  <p>  What recent events in Catalonia and Spain show is that this is not an internal matter for Spain.  This is a fundamental matter of democracy and human rights.  The Spanish Government is in clear breach of the values and treaty law of the European Union and the member states that uphold it.  The only way to resolve this situation is through independent international mediation.  Anyone who claims anything short of that kind of intervention is complicit in the single biggest breach of basic democratic principles in Europe in decades.<\/p>  <p>  I urge the Members who have spoken already not to leave this to the internal politics of the Spanish state and to support the call for dialogue and mediation.  We should support the call for what worked in the conflict in our own country which is conflict resolution because anything short of that will see the situation deteriorate and none of us here wants that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200050#WW00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1571774400,"counter":483,"content":"<p>The situation in Catalonia is complex and divisive.  We, in this country, have a certain understanding of that.  I welcome the opportunity to put on the record the position of the Labour Party on the situation in Catalonia.<\/p>  <p>  First and foremost, when a large proportion of citizens on both sides have strong views on identity or constitutional preference in the same geographical area, that needs to be addressed respectfully while having respect for the different sides of the argument.<\/p>  <p>  We have learned form our own painful history that violence and conflict only make any constitutional situation worse and all the harder to heal wounds and engage all sides in dialogue to find a way forward.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party condemns the violence that has arisen in the Catalonia region and calls on all sides, including the police, to exercise more restraint and increase their efforts to calm the situation through dialogue which is the only way to solve the problem.  Politics is about finding solutions to problems but can only work if those involved engage lawfully.  We do not believe it is acceptable for any democratic politician to lead citizens into unlawful behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  During the constitutional crisis that erupted in 2017 and 2018, more than 1,000 civilians were injured, alongside up to 111 agents of the security forces.  This was a serious crisis that rocked the whole of Spain and it is only a matter of luck that people were not killed in some of the incidents.  We simply do not know how many people have life-changing injuries.  <\/p>  <p>  Whatever we may think about the case, we must respect the role of the independent Spanish court system.  It is just a fact that we must respect the independent role of the courts.  We also recognise that the politicians were found guilty of a range of offences by those courts and, in fact, were subject to very severe sentences.  We believe that anyone who breaks the law should be held to account but I do not think that lengthy jail sentences are a constructive way to deal with pro-independence politicians.  That is a comment on the courts.<\/p>  <p>  The constitutional crisis grew and came to a head under the conservative government of Mariano Rajoy who was Prime Minister until June 2018.  He was inflexible and his rigid approach to the separatist movement undoubtedly inflamed the way in which events developed into a major constitutional crisis.  I am conscious that the Labour Party's sister party, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, is now in government in Madrid under Pedro S&aacute;nchez.  The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party has always had a different approach to regional autonomy and it is important to allow S&aacute;nchez's Government to renew a democratic and measured approach to the crisis that has arisen.  The socialist Spanish Government naturally must accept the ruling of the independent courts in their country but they also have expressed determination to heal the fractures caused by recent events.  <\/p>  <p>  Society in Catalonia was, and remains, deeply divided on the issue of independence.  Successive opinion polls have confirmed that, while full independence is preferred by a large minority, the majority of citizens are opposed to independence but favour regional autonomy within Spain.  In fact, support for independence in opinion polls is lower now, at less than 40%, compared to its peak of 48% support in 2013.  <\/p>  <p>  Self-government of autonomous communities in Spain enjoy the strongest level of regional devolution in the world and that was delivered by socialist governments.<\/p><p>Resolution of the Spanish crisis is now a matter for politics.  Some kind of amnesty process, or a reduction in sentences for pro-independence politicians, can only be negotiated through the political system.  Part of this must require all sides to agree to be fully bound by the rule of law and not to lead their communities into unlawful behaviour.  From the Labour Party's perspective, I urge Deputies to support the efforts of Pedro S&aacute;nchez's Government to take a different approach to the issue of Catalonia, based on engaging all sides in Catalonia in dialogue about a way forward that can command a large majority of the population.  Like in Northern Ireland, compromise on constitutional preferences is difficult for those with strongly held views on one side or the other.  It is the only way, however, to ensure peace and stability.  Our message should be one of solidarity to all the people of Catalonia, along with the genuine hope that respectful dialogue can triumph over division to reach a stable compromise that can command the support of a large majority of the population of Catalonia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200050#WW00300","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571775000,"counter":485,"content":"<p>We need a reality check.  Nine people have been sentenced to between nine and 13 years of prison in a European, supposedly democratic country for the crime of sedition, for organising a democratic vote for people to express their will on the question of the independence of Catalonia.  For anyone to try to dress that up or to suggest there is some independent rule of courts, that everything is fine and so on misses the point.  If that happened in many other parts of the world, everyone would clearly see that it is not a democratic process when political leaders can be tried in court and jailed for lengthy periods for the crime of sedition because of organising a democratic vote.<\/p><p>Contrary to the previous speaker, I believe we should not whitewash the role of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party and S&aacute;nchez.  Their Government is sending thousands of troops to Catalonia, while S&aacute;nchez has co-ordinated a media campaign to condemn those who peacefully protest as violent, even though the troops and police officers he has sent are the ones being violent against those peaceful protesters.  The Spanish establishment may, in future, be haunted by the ideas contained in James Connolly's words of 1914, when he wrote:<\/p><blockquote>If you strike at, imprison, or kill us, out of our prisons or graves we will still evoke a spirit that will thwart you, and perhaps, raise a force that will destroy you!  We defy you!  Do your worst!<\/blockquote><p>The response to such incredible repression by the Spanish state has been the redoubling of the movement, becoming arguably larger than it was in 2017 or 2018.  Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets, there was a very successful general strike on 18 October, while there have been demonstrations towards and into the airport, and on the squares and the streets.  The response to that has been the campaign of terror I have described and mass violence against protestors, blinding at least four and injuring and arresting hundreds.  Anyone who doubts this and believes that everything is peaceful, democratic and fine within the borders of the Spanish state should go online and watch the incredible brutality by the police.  One video shows a bunch of police officers snorting cocaine, and then going out to beat protestors in a very brutal way and arresting members of the media for covering their crimes and brutality.  It is clear that Francoism is alive and well in the Spanish state, raising its ugly head to put down the boot on the Catalan people, just as it did in 2017.  The Spanish legal system and the police are riddled with elements of the old fascist dictatorship of Franco, yet it is the same system the EU leaders claim we must respect.  It reflects the contempt for democracy of those at the top of the European Union in their support for a campaign of terror and revenge.<\/p><p>The international arrest warrant for Puigdemont needs to be rescinded immediately, the convictions of the nine political prisoners must be overturned immediately, the repression must be ended and Catalonia's right to self-determination should be respected.  The general strike on 18 October shows a way forward for the movement.  To paraphrase Connolly, the working class are the incorruptible inheritors of the struggle against national oppression.  The working class and the left leadership, not seeking a path of compromise with Francoism or an independent Catalonia to pursue a neoliberal race to the bottom but rather a drive for an independent socialist republic of Catalonia, is the way forward and can appeal to working class people across national and cultural lines, having an impact on the working class throughout the Spanish state.  An important part of that is supporting the right to self-determination of other national minorities within the Spanish state opposing repression and oppression, not least the Basque people, and standing for a future socialist federation of the Spanish state and the Iberian peninsula.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200051#XX00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1571775000,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Two years after democratically elected Catalan ministers, politicians and civil activists held a peaceful referendum on the question of self-determination for Catalonia, severe penalties were handed down by the Spanish Supreme Court to former Catalan leaders.

Catalonia's question on the self-determination of its 7.5 million people has been quashed by a so-called democratic nation belonging to the European Union.  What has happened throughout the course of Catalonia's self-determination process has raised questions as to the true nature of the European Union, primarily as to how it can allow one of its nation states to hold political prisoners while not explicitly recognising Catalonia's right to self-determination and claiming it is an internal political matter.<\/p>  <p>  As many commentators have pointed out, the European project finds itself threatened by terrorism and an upsurge in xenophobic nationalism, and as a result simply cannot adopt a passive stance on the question of Catalonia.  Catalan citizens are also EU citizens and deserve equal recognition under the EU.  If Europe has any democratic mettle, it must defend and advocate for the rights of Catalan citizens against the Spanish police state.  The European Commission must also open a space for mediation between the Spanish and Catalan Governments to find a negotiated and democratic solution to the conflict once and for all, but we know that it will not do that.  Spain's response to Catalonia's self-determination raises questions over what has been termed the judicialisation of politics, where a nation state excessively outsources its political decision making and public policy to the courts on matters of great political importance, rather than allowing the people through democratically elected representatives to follow the course for themselves.  In the case of Spain, the Supreme Court has been given an all-too bloated role in determining the course of events pursued by Catalonia.  The overreliance on the supreme judiciary to determine the course of events has doubtless led to an overreliance on the use of force to attack the civilian population through the use of the security forces and the threat of imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its efforts to stop the referendum, the Spanish Government has blocked Catalan websites, seized pro-succession material, detained officials involved in the referendum, threatened to arrest 700 mayors, held a crackdown on information, and seized 1.3 million posters, flyers, and pamphlets at the time of the referendum.  Meanwhile, the Spanish Prime Minister stated, \"The state will always guarantee the rights of those who wish to protest their ideas peacefully.\"  What the Spanish Government is doing would be a joke if it were not so serious.  Much attention has been paid to the violence and unrest surrounding the most recent march when, in fact, it had been preceded by an overwhelmingly peaceful march of more than 500,000 people.  Approximately 525,000 people had congregated in the city, many of them having marched there from around Catalonia to display their discontent with Spain's Supreme Court ruling on the penalties to be given to the former Catalan leaders for carrying out the referendum on Catalonia's independence.<\/p>  <p>  Europe continues to ignore the developments.  Most recently the Commission stated it fully respects the Spanish constitutional order, including decisions of the Spanish judiciary, and that it remains an internal matter for Spain.  It probably had a similar stance in respect of the British occupation of the North for years and years.  It supports us now in that regard but that is only because it suits it to give the Brits a kicking.<\/p><p>Perhaps if the Commission wants to give the Spanish a kicking, it will support the Catalan people as well.  Meanwhile Europe fails to realise that by ignoring the situation in Catalonia, it is eroding democracy in a profound way.  This is a dangerous situation if the European Union's self-conception as a supposedly democratic institution is to have any hope of surviving the challenges of the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200051#XX00300","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571775600,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n will now share time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200052#YY00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1571775600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Teachta Mattie McGrath.<\/p>  <p>  Self-determination is a human right.  It is the foundation of democracy.  People have a right to self-determination up to the point where they infringe upon the rights of others.  We in Ireland know how important self-determination is.  We know too well that the lack of self-determination can be a disaster for a country.  We know that when a country's peaceful pathway to achieving self-determination is blocked, it is a recipe for political unrest and chaos.  Tragically, Ireland has been in that situation for hundreds of years. <\/p>  <p>  In 1919, the First D&aacute;il issued a message to the free nations of the world seeking recognition of our independence.  Most of the countries of that time refused this recognition.  Catalonia is Ireland 100 years later.  Today, this D&aacute;il business is entitled Statements on Developments in Spain.  It is the equivalent of holding a debate on the Black and Tans' burning of Balbriggan and Cork and calling it Statements on the United Kingdom.  That shows the Government's mindset and its approach to this issue.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2014, Spain's Constitutional Court ruled that a referendum on Catalonia's independence planned for November was unconstitutional.  A simple democratic expression of the people's wishes was unconstitutional.  More than 80% of the people who took part in that informal vote for separation from Spain voted for independence.  As a result of that expression of self-determination, the Supreme Court of Spain sentenced Catalan leaders to long jail terms for sedition.  In one fell swoop, the Spanish Government criminalised democracy.  <\/p>  <p>  This is a grave injustice not only against individual democratic leaders but also against the people of Catalonia.  It is shocking that this would happen anywhere in 2019.  That it happened in the EU in 2019, on our watch, makes a silent Ireland culpable and complicit.  It is incredible that the Government is not seeking to do the right thing.  Most of the world stood idly by while Britain violently denied Irish democratic aspirations.  Are we going to do the same for Catalonia?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200052#YY00300","speaker":"1443"},{"type":"speech","time":1571775600,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I wish to discuss the situation in Spain and the civil unrest and protests following the decision of the Supreme Court of Spain in the case of some of the people responsible for the Catalan independence process.  As we know, the Spanish court sentenced these people to between nine and 13 years in prison.  It has been said that this was not just a conviction of the members of the Catalan Government, but of the 2.3 million Catalans who made the self-determination referendum on 1 October 2017 possible.  It reflects our own history and it seems we have a very short memory.<\/p>  <p>  I have been following this matter closely.  In April, at the request of then Deputy Clare Daly, I signed a cross-party support measure calling for an end to the detention of Spanish civil leaders, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S&aacute;nchez, and a recognition of fundamental human rights and freedoms in Catalonia.  That statement did not express any opinion on Catalan independence.  It was simply a defence of the basic human rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.  By God, we in Ireland, including the Government, should know how important and sacred that is.<\/p>  <p>  As I understand it, the two civic and cultural leaders have been held on an order for pre-trial detention on charges of sedition since last October.  S&aacute;nchez and Cuixart are the presidents, respectively, of the Catalan National Assembly, ANC, and &Ograve;mnium Cultural.  They were charged in connection with pro-independence protests organised to coincide with the Catalan independence referendum in 2017 and faced a prison sentence of 17 years.  Along with Deputies Mick Wallace and Maureen O'Sullivan, Deputy Daly had met with the legal team representing the men.  These representatives outlined the circumstances of their clients' detention.  It was felt that the detention of these two civic leaders was a disproportionate restriction of their rights to free speech and peaceful assembly. <\/p>  <p>  As for the more immediate situation in Spain, I can only say that as a citizen of a small island nation which struggled for its independence, I am very sympathetic to the Catalan cause.  However, it is disturbing to see the violence that has taken place in recent weeks.  That I cannot support, as violence gets us nowhere.  Hopefully a sense of proportion and respect for the right of people to determine their own destiny will be seen in Spain.  It is a wonderful country with a rich heritage and a fantastic people.  That is something we all want to see protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200052#YY00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1571775600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions this evening.  As I said in my opening remarks, the question of Catalan independence remains a deeply divisive and contentious issue, not just in Catalonia but in all of Spain.  It is very clear from the contributions that what is happening in Spain and Catalonia matters to each and every one of us in this Chamber and beyond, for reasons I have already outlined.  Spain is a close ally, partner and friend of ours in the European Union.  Many of our people call Spain their home for much of the year and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  As many speakers outlined, as a country we have seen what conflict can do and how important it is to find a resolution to that conflict.  However, while tensions are running high, we cannot forget that Spain is an established democracy that is committed to the rule of law.  It is only through the democratic process with full respect for the law that differences of opinion should be contested.  We should not lose sight of the fact that the case presented to the Supreme Court of Spain was presented on a legal and constitutional issue.  We know how complex constitutions can be.  Let us not simplify a very complex issue.  Furthermore, just as we would expect other countries to respect our legal system, we must respect the independence and integrity of the Spanish courts.<\/p><p>The Government remains of the view that it is for all Catalans and all Spaniards to arrive at a shared view of the steps to be taken within their laws and democratic institutions to support a process of reconciliation.  Internal divisions, contesting aspirations and robust debates are all to be expected within a democracy.  As I said, however, these must be resolved in keeping with the rule of law.  They cannot be resolved through violence.  We have all seen the images of protests in recent days, including scenes of confrontations.  Most of those who have been demonstrating have been doing so peacefully.  Reports of incidents of violence are of huge concern, and I share the dismay felt by my colleagues and many people in Ireland and elsewhere at the scenes of violent disturbances in Catalonia.  I am concerned by the impact this has on people's lives and the political uncertainty to which it has given rise.  I reiterate, however, that there is no place for violence in politics.  We must always find a solution through peaceful means.<\/p><p>In Catalonia and elsewhere in Spain, as in our democracy, public representatives and citizens must always work together to advance goals democratically.  Establishing the validity and legitimacy of political efforts through the institutions requires the broadest possible consensus within the law.  That is why I remain very clearly of the view that it is for all parties in Spain to arrive at a shared view of what steps within Spain's laws and democratic institutions might best support a process of resolution.  Radical violent actions cannot be acceptable.  Any difference of opinion must be contested peacefully with full respect for the law and the rights of all citizens.<\/p><p>Finally, the balance between the freedom to demonstrate and the need for law and order must be protected so that people can go about their normal lives without fear.  Citizens also deserve clarity that the rule of law extends to and protects them.  That is why we continue to support a resolution of the current situation in Spain that is based on democracy and the rule of law.  We will continue to remain engaged with the ambassador and our colleagues in the Irish embassy in Spain.  We will continue to update colleagues on any further developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200052#YY00500","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1571775600,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Aire St&aacute;it agus do na Teachta&iacute;.

<\/blockquote>acknowledges that:<blockquote>&mdash; the 2017 Indecon report entitled &lsquo;Independent Review of the Amendments to the One-Parent Family Payment since January 2012&rsquo;, concluded that changes to this payment led to an increase in the percentage of lone parents who could not afford basic items such as a warm waterproof coat, two pairs of strong shoes, or turning on the heating at home;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

research has also concluded that in countries where maintenance is paid, it plays a role in reducing poverty; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; research also shows that where maintenance payments are seen as a private family matter alone, without guaranteed maintenance support systems in place, the number of lone parents receiving child maintenance is low; <\/blockquote>regrets that:<blockquote>&mdash; Ireland has failed to meet its targets to date on reducing child poverty; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; citizens can be imprisoned for not paying their television licence, yet parents who neglect their responsibility for maintaining their dependent child(ren) do so without repercussions;

engage and include all stakeholders in this funded project from point of design and establishing terms of reference, to implementation; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; establish, based on that research, a statutory child maintenance service with sufficient enforcement powers and links to Revenue.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>I will be sharing time with my colleagues.<\/p><p>Three weeks ago, I met domestic abuse survivor and campaigner, Jessica Bowes, a lone parent to three children.  Jessica, like many lone parents, took her former partner to court to pursue maintenance payments, having been directed to do so by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  One week later, Jessica was violently assaulted by her former partner.  The assault was nearly fatal.  That was the price she paid for taking her former partner to court to seek maintenance.  That was her experience of seeking maintenance.<\/p><p>For Jessica and many other lone parents, I am delighted to bring this motion before the House this evening.  I hope we will have a healthy debate leading to consensus on the need for a child maintenance service.  I move this motion with the support of both lead lone-parent organisations, One Family and SPARK, which have consistently highlighted major difficulties with the current process which requires lone parents to take their former partner to court in order to seek maintenance payments, something no parent should ever have to do.  I commend both organisations on the excellent work they do every day for lone parent mothers and fathers, and their children.  I am delighted that some of them are in the Gallery this evening.<\/p><p>There are many reasons for the urgent establishment of a child maintenance service.  The main reason is that courtrooms are no place for child maintenance payments to be determined.  That is the bottom line.  More important, the current process involving the Courts Service does not work.  I will set out the current process to the House.  A lone parent who applies for the one-parent family payment must prove that he or she has sought maintenance from the other parent in order to receive and retain this social welfare support.  In essence, in order to receive a payment specifically for lone parents, lone parents are not entitled to this payment unless they can show that they have sought maintenance.  This leaves lone parents with no option other than to take their former partner to court to seek that maintenance.<\/p><p>A court summons for maintenance cannot be issued by the court unless the lone parent can provide an address for the other parent, which is not always known.  There are no statutory guidelines on how the rate of payment for maintenance should be set and instead it is left to the discretion of the judge of the day.  Naturally, different judges make different determinations.  If a maintenance order is put in place by the courts and the non-custodial parent does not comply, the lone parent is back to square one and left to issue enforcement proceedings.<\/p><p>If the non-custodial parent fails to appear at court proceedings, a bench warrant is issued.  This typically sits on a desk in a Garda station gathering dust, adding further delay.  At the end of it all, the lone parent is no better off.In many cases, lone parents are worse off because once a maintenance order is granted, it is taken as household means, reducing other social welfare supports regardless of whether the maintenance is paid.<\/p><p>In every country in the world where statutory maintenance arrangements are in place, child maintenance plays a role in reducing poverty, something the Government has failed to do.  The rate of consistent poverty among lone-parent families is five times higher than in families headed by two parents.  Some 39.9% of lone-parent families live at risk of poverty.  By its own admission, the Government will not come anywhere close to reaching its target of lifting 95,000 children out of poverty by 2020.  Establishing a child maintenance service would help to lift children out of poverty.  More than that, a statutory child maintenance service would protect women who have to seek maintenance.  It would support them and provide them with advice and assistance.  It would put children first at long last.<\/p><p>I commend the motion to the House and I hope that we can work together to make it happen because lone-parent families deserve nothing less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200053#ZZ00200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1571776200,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I welcome the people in the Gallery and I know many others are watching this debate at home.  I thank the many women - they were mainly women - who contacted me to encourage us to push for this and to let me know that it means an enormous amount to them and that they want to see action.<\/p>  <p>  For some time, Sinn F&eacute;in, in particular my colleague Deputy Brady, has been pushing the need for the State to establish a child maintenance agency.  The current process requires lone parents to take their former partners to court to seek child maintenance payments.  I know of countless lone parents, most often mothers, who have attended my clinics to get advice about how to get child maintenance payments from partners who have refused to contribute.  When I tell them that their only recourse is through the courts I can see the fear in the faces.<\/p>  <p>  It is not lost on them or me and, I am sure, it will not be lost on the Minister of State, that earlier today an apology was issued to women over how they were treated by the State.  In the statements that followed, numerous contributors mentioned that women were dragged through the courts and how adversarial that process is.  Collectively, we have agreed that the courts are not always the most appropriate place to go.  Nobody wants to go through an adversarial process.  Even when people are in the right, that prospect is very daunting.<\/p>  <p>  In budget 2020, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, announced funding to establish a judge-led group to determine, based on best international practice, maintenance guidelines and regulations which can hopefully be put on a statutory footing and which will achieve better outcomes for families.  Guidelines are not good enough, not even guidelines that will, hopefully, be placed on a statutory footing.  That does not give much hope, even though the word \"hopefully\" is used.<\/p>  <p>  The motion calls on the Government to research best practice to find the best statutory child maintenance service model that we can establish here in consultation with key stakeholders.  We need sensible workable proposals.  Sinn F&eacute;in published these proposals in January 2018 and published a revised version this month showing Government exactly how a child maintenance service can be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  We bring forward this motion with the full support of both lead lone-parent organisations in the State, One Family and SPARK.  They have been very clear that they do not want guidelines; they want a statutory child maintenance service.

As Deputy O'Reilly said, when I explained to her that she would have to the courts or get in contact with her partner again, a look of absolute terror fell over her face.  Unfortunately, I have seen that occur many times.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Deputy Brady on tabling the motion.  The current system for lone parents seeking child maintenance is totally unacceptable.<\/p><p>Forcing lone parents to ask former partners for child maintenance before they can receive social welfare supports puts many people in a terrible situation.  It often places them in danger if they have left violent partners.  The same occurs when a person is forced to bring a former partner to court to try to get child maintenance.  The court process results in an immediate escalation of the situation and often causes hostility between the two partners.  Going to court is a very stressful experience and the cost alone can be a barrier to many.  Waiting for support to go to court can take ages too.  In addition, the reality of facing a former partner in court is something many individuals do not wish to do for many personal and private reasons.  This blocks many parents from seeking child maintenance.  I have heard people say they would prefer not to go to court and I have met these people and forgo child maintenance even though they are desperately in need of it just to ensure they do not have to face their former partner in court.  This is a terrible situation and it has been raised on several occasions in the Dail.  We brought people to the audiovisual room three years ago when we were first elected in order that we might discuss it.  The matter needs to be addressed as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> Should a lone parent eventually get over all the hurdles put in front of him or her, a judge then has no guidelines on how the rate of child maintenance should be set.  This affords no certainty to a lone parent and results in varying types of orders for child maintenance.  This system is not fit for purpose and needs to be changed urgently. Our motion sets out solutions to do just that.<\/p> <p> The Department has a liable relatives unit.  This is used to contact the absent parent not to collect maintenance but to get him or her to contribute towards the cost of the one-parent family payment.  In simple terms, it results in the recoupment of money for the State but not for the lone parent or their children.  However, the Department cannot even manage to do that effectively.  From the beginning of 2018 up to August of this year, this unit examined 18,078 cases.  In 2,174 of these, a liable relative started making contributions.  However, in the majority of cases, 15,904 to be exact, nothing happened.  Nothing was done, despite the Department insisting that it has enforcement powers.  This is a ridiculous situation.  According to data received via reply to a parliamentary question, the Department has submitted just 19 cases to the Chief State Solicitor's office since 2016 for the purposes of obtaining orders directing that the liable relative comply with the determination.  This is truly pathetic.  The Government is not dealing with this issue.<\/p> <p> I am not sure which is worse, that the Department does not see fit to assist and support lone parents in seeking maintenance for their children or that it choose to pursue the non-custodial parent, not to benefit the children involved, but simply to cover its own costs.  This system needs to be done away with, and replaced with a proper, robust system that ensures the needs of children are to the fore.  Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward such a solution.  I hope the Government gives proper consideration to our proposals.  I told the woman I spoke to yesterday that I would raise this matter in the D&aacute;il today.  There are others like her.

We warned then, as did the Minister of State and campaigning groups, that the measure would impoverish lone parent families.  However, our efforts were to no avail.  The Minister was not for turning and the cuts are still in place.  The Minister of State is facilitating and allowing them to remain in place by supporting a Government that simply does not care.<\/p>  <p>  We are debating a measure that should have been brought in instead of those cuts.  Campaigning groups, in particular One Family and SPARK-Ireland - and I welcome those who are in the Gallery &ndash; called for this measure at the time but they were ignored.  Instead, the Government attacked lone parents.  Sinn F&eacute;in is calling on all Deputies to support the motion it has tabled.  The motion is part of our campaign to see the establishment of child maintenance services.  Lone parents in this State need this service to be put on a statutory footing.  Guidelines are not enough.  This was one of the Minister of State&rsquo;s policies when he was in opposition.<\/p>  <p>  For far too long, lone parents have been left to seek child maintenance payments from an ex-partner with no support or guidance from the State.  This issue has been ignored for too long by successive Governments, which have been happy to leave it to parents to battle it out in courts.  The court system is a direct barrier to abused parents and their children accessing child maintenance.  I know that and the Minister of State and officials in the Department know it, which is why we need change.  The Courts Service received almost 9,000 applications for maintenance orders during 2018.  More than a quarter of these cases remained unresolved by the end of the court term.  Delays are an inherent part of the proceedings.  In cases of coercive control, domestic violence and abuse, child maintenance court cases can heighten hostilities.  The outcome, unfortunately, for many women in particular is fear, intimidation and sometimes outright physical attack.  It is time to end this out-of-date system and to use child maintenance as one means of lifting children and lone parents out of poverty.  A legally enforceable child maintenance service would be a life-changing change in the way lone parents are treated by this State.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State to do in government what he said he would do when he was in opposition, namely, support the women who need support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200054#AAA00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1571776800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I always do.

I am disappointed that the Government has indicated its opposition to tonight's motion, as it is a clear opportunity for a step change in the Government's outlook on providing for the most vulnerable in society.  Much like the motion on home care that Sinn F&eacute;in brought to this Chamber in June, the value of providing adequate supports early on can lead to savings in the future if they are available to all those in need of them.  People provided for at home incur less cost to the State and are more likely to remain out of hospital beds longer.  More importantly, these patients and their families experience a much better quality of life.<\/p>  <p>  The motion sets out how statutory provision for the payment of a considered and stable amount to lone parents can lead to far better outcomes for children and their parents.  Children who are properly supported are far less likely to be in need of State intervention in the future.  They are less likely to present with illnesses associated with poor nutrition or inadequate living conditions.  Lone parent families were hit particularly hard in the austerity years of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour.  While many sectors of society suffered during that period, some groups have not seen any measurable recovery at all.  It is no surprise that lone parents remain among the groups yet to see any benefit from our supposed recovery.  According to the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, which examines the adequacy of social welfare supports and reports annually, lone parents are one of three groups in deep income inadequacy right now.  Latest figures from the survey on income and living conditions show that one-parent families are now five times as likely to live in consistent poverty than two-parent households.  The same report also shows that lone parents have the lowest disposable income.  Lone parents have the highest levels of deprivation and are most at risk of poverty of all households with children in the State.<\/p>  <p>  We know that Government policy has worked to make life more difficult for lone parent families.  A 2017 Indecon report concluded that the changes made by Fine Gael and Labour to the one parent family payment eligibility, reducing the cut-off age to seven years, led to increased deprivation.  The reality of experiencing deprivation means not being able to turn the heating on, not being able to afford a warm coat or to provide a strong pair of shoes for children.<\/p><p>Research shows that, when paid, child maintenance plays a role in reducing poverty.  It also shows that in the neighbouring island there was a 30% reduction in the poverty gap as a result of child maintenance payments.  A child maintenance service will reduce poverty and, therefore, make growing up in Ireland a better, happier experience for so many children than it is today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200054#AAA00600","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571777400,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to respond to this Private Members' motion on issue of child maintenance.  The issues regarding maintenance are generally a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality, who has responsibility for the family law Acts, which govern maintenance requirements.  Existing family law Acts place a legal obligation on parents to maintain their children.  In cases where the family unit has broken down, these obligations continue to apply.  Relevant maintenance payments can be arranged either directly between the parties or with the assistance of supports from the Department of Justice and Equality, such as the family mediation service and the Legal Aid Board or, ultimately, through the courts.  The enforcement of the obligation on parents to maintain their children is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  The social welfare Acts provide that where certain welfare payments are in place, specifically one-parent family payment, OFP, an assessment may be made against a liable relative requiring him or her to make a contribution towards the cost of the one-parent family payment.  In every case where one-parent family payment is awarded, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection seeks to trace the other parent or liable relative to ascertain whether he or she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of the payment.  All liable relatives who are assessed for the maintenance liability are issued with a maintenance contribution assessment setting out the amount assessed.  The amount assessed can be reviewed where new information comes to light regarding the financial or household circumstances of the liable relative.  The liable relative can either commence or increase the current payment to a one-parent family payment recipient or can make the contribution directly to the Department.  Decisions on the amount assessed can be appealed to the social welfare appeals office.  The liable relative provisions cease once the youngest child reaches seven years of age and the one-parent family payment claim ceases.  However, the legal obligation under the family law Acts to maintain children does not cease.<\/p>  <p>  Lone parents have consistently been one of the most vulnerable groups in Ireland, a point made earlier, which I accept.  Even during the period of high economic growth and employment, the rate of consistent poverty for lone parents remained very high in comparison with two-parent families.  The 2013 survey of income and living conditions, SILC, data show that the consistent poverty rate for lone parent households was 20.7% compared with 3.9% for two-parent households.  The current policy approach for supporting lone parents through the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional scheme is to provide tapered income supports as children get older while at the same time increasing the employment and educational supports that the Department offers.<\/p>  <p>  A recent analysis by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, of differing household types shows that the employment rate of lone parents is increasing steadily as the economy grows, but it also shows that the gap between coupled and lone mothers' employment rates remains relatively large.  The employment rate of female lone parents increased from 48.5% in quarter 2 of 2012 to 60% in quarter 2 of 2018.  This is a positive development but there is evidence that the rate of in-work poverty among lone parent households is high in comparison with coupled families.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operates three schemes to support lone parents, namely, the one-parent family payment scheme, the jobseeker's transitional scheme, and the jobseeker's allowance.  The appropriate scheme that a lone parent can avail of is generally determined by the age of the youngest child claimed for, subject to eligibility requirements.  One-parent family payment is available where the youngest child is aged under seven, while jobseeker's transitional payment may be claimed where the youngest child is aged between seven and 13 years of age, inclusive.  Once the youngest child reaches 14, standard jobseeker's allowance applies.<\/p>  <p>  This progression from one-parent family payment to jobseeker's transitional payment to jobseeker's allowance was a fundamental element of the reforms of the one-parent family payment scheme undertaken since 2011, as until then income support for lone parents was passive in nature and involved limited engagement by the Stale with lone parents.  One-parent family payment was originally available until the youngest child was 18.  The non-conditional nature of the one-parent family payment coupled with its very long duration had over time engendered long-term social welfare dependency and associated poverty among many lone parents and their children.  Research has shown that being at work reduces the at-risk of poverty rate for lone parents by more than half.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the one-parent family payment scheme reforms is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into and increase employment by providing them with enhanced access to a wide range of education, training and employment supports that make up the Department's Intreo services.  In 2004, at the height of the economic boom, lone parents were over four-and-a-half times more at risk of poverty than the rest of the population.  In 2017, the latest available SILC data show a significant improvement, although lone parents are still almost two-and-a-half times more at risk of poverty than the rest of the population.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to take this opportunity to set out the range of measures put in place by the Government to support children and their and families, including lone parents, in budget 2020.  There are not cuts in social welfare payments.  These supports include payment of a 100% Christmas bonus in December 2019 to recipients of long-term social welfare payments, including one-parent family payment; extension of the hot school meals scheme from September 2020 to 35,000 additional schoolchildren; a &euro;3 increase for qualified child dependants aged 12 and over in all weekly payments; a &euro;2 increase for qualified child dependants up the age of 12 in all weekly payments; an increase in the working family payment threshold by &euro;10 per week for families with one, two or three children, benefiting 55,000 families at a cost of &euro;19 million from January 2020; and increases in the earnings disregard for working lone parents in receipt of the one-parent family payment or jobseeker's transitional payment by &euro;15 to &euro;165 per week from January 2020, benefiting 16,900 families.<\/p>  <p>  There are a wide range of supports for children and families, including lone parent families, across other Departments and beyond the social welfare system.  Extra funding of &euro;54 million has been allocated to child care services for the introduction of the national childcare scheme to meet the continuing cost of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme, to fund the access and inclusion model, and to support the introduction of a sectoral employment order setting the statutory minimum pay and conditions in the childcare sector.  The maximum hours under the national childcare scheme for preschool children will increase from 40 to 45 hours per week for working parents and from 15 to 20 hours per week for low-income parents not working or studying.  The maximum hours for school-aged childcare for low-income parents who return to work will increase from 17 to 22 hours per week with effect from September 2020.  Additional funding of &euro;29 million is allocated to Tusla to continue its work to reduce the number of children awaiting the allocation of a social worker and to address costs pressures in residential and foster care.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also plans to extend free GP care to children under the age of eight and to provide free dental care for children under six with effect from September 2020.  Stakeholders have highlighted that child maintenance poses serious personal and administrative blocks within the social protection and legal systems.<\/p><p>Delays in legal proceedings due to cycles of agreement, default and pursuits clog up the Courts Service and cause unnecessary delays and hardships for the parents and their children.  I accept that argument.  Requirements for seeking maintenance and liable relative provisions may also cause issues between the parents over and above the difficulties and hardships they already face.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection shares some of the concerns, as do I, expressed by stakeholder groups about how the maintenance system currently operates and she believes that it is timely to review these arrangements to see what can be learned from international best practice.  The Minister has already held meetings with some of the stakeholder groups and will continue to engage with them on this matter in the future.<\/p> <p> As part of budget 2020, &euro;150,000 has been allocated to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to examine international best practice in respect of maintenance payments by liable relatives and how Ireland can achieve better outcomes in a proactive manner for families.  The Minister is currently making arrangements to establish a judge-led group to progress that work as a priority.  The Government is taking on board the concerns of the stakeholder groups regarding child maintenance and the wider issues for lone parents.  The motion before the House does not give sufficient recognition to the substantial work already done to support lone parents and the significant commitments set out as part of budget 2020, nor does it recognise that the Minister is already consulting with stakeholder groups and has secured funding to undertake research in this area as part of a judge-led group.<\/p> <p> No one party has a monopoly on caring about remedying the challenges regarding maintenance and my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, has already moved to find effective solutions.  On that basis we will not be opposing the motion, we will be abstaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200055#BBB00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571778000,"counter":506,"content":"<p>The Government will be sitting on its hands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200056#CCC00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1571778000,"counter":507,"content":"<p>That is not supporting it.

The Minister of State recognised in his speech that poverty among this cohort is endemic.  All the statistics point to that.  Research done by St. Vincent de Paul and the figures in the survey on income and living conditions in Ireland, SILC, illustrate that a lone-parent family is five times more likely to be living in consistent poverty than a family headed by two parents.  The levels of deprivation for lone parents are now running at over 45%.  Almost one in two lone parents cannot afford the basic necessities for the very minimum standard of living.  That is a disgraceful statistic.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons this has turned out to be the case.  On the so-called reforms of 2012 to which the Minister of State referred, introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Burton, we warned the Minister at the time and subsequent Ministers that they would have a devastating effect on the income of lone parents and this has proved to be the case.  This effect manifests itself right to this very day.  I refer to a number of reports, such as the 2016 report by Millar and Crosse, which was extremely critical of the impact of those so-called reforms.  The Indecon report of 2017 was a damning indictment.  The St. Vincent de Paul study published last March showed that the level of in-work poverty among lone parents had doubled since the introduction of the so-called reforms of 2012.  The response of the Minister and subsequent Ministers has been to try to alleviate the impact of those changes by adding little provisions here and there, adding extra pieces of a patchwork onto what is already a gigantic patchwork, thereby making the social welfare system even more complicated.  This is their approach rather than simply reversing what was done in 2012 because it was so clearly wrong.  The result of all this is that the whole system of social welfare law concerning lone parents is now riddled with anomalies.  <\/p>  <p>  Another reason for the increase in poverty and the pitiable status of lone parents lies in the fact that a relatively small percentage of Irish lone parents, compared with those in other countries, actually get maintenance.  The reason for that, as has already been outlined, is that it is a condition that someone who is married or in civil partnership will not get lone parents allowance until he or she seeks maintenance from the other party.  If people are living in a non-marital, non-civil partnership relationship, they can get lone parent's allowance but in order to hold on to it they have to apply for maintenance subsequently.  The only way a single parent can apply for maintenance in this country is through the courts system.  In most of these cases when the relationship has broken up, it is usually the woman who is living in abject poverty.  She has to face the adversarial system of the courts.  The vast majority of lone parents I deal with do not have the resources to employ private solicitors so they have to depend on the free legal aid system, which is not completely free.  The Minister herself has acknowledged on a number of occasions that this places an enormous emotional and financial burden on people who are already suffering enough and already have enough on their plate.  That is the simple reality.<\/p>  <p>  There should never be a system in which lone parent's allowance depends on chasing a partner for maintenance through the Irish courts system.  I know single mothers who have been in and out of the District Court ten, 12 or 15 times because some of those people against whom orders are made are very adept at avoiding payment.  There is this constant carousel of people in and out of court, all at the expense of the legal aid system.  From that point of view, something along the lines of what is proposed here would be self-financing.  In fact, the State would finish up better off, judging by the impact and the burden on the civil legal aid system of the present arrangements.  I have also come across cases where a woman has had to flee the family home because of violence.  The last thing that individual wants to do is bring herself to the attention of her violent partner and give him her address by lodging a summons for maintenance.  It is insupportable.  There is also a daft provision in the social welfare legislation that if the court orders maintenance for a person, whether he or she gets it or not, it is counted as part of his or her means.  That is insupportable.  <\/p>  <p>  I would not agree with many of the things that have been done in Northern Ireland but one thing they have done right is establishing a statutory agency to which lone parents can present themselves and the agency will seek the maintenance on their behalf.  That relieves the emotional and financial burden on the lone parent enormously.  It has been proved to be very effective.  In any jurisdiction where there is a similar arrangement, we will find that the level of maintenance paid rises dramatically.  Surely that should be our aim to combat poverty among one of the poorest groups in society.  There is also a very interesting report done by the Gingerbread group in the United Kingdom.  It was a very extensive study which found that if people are involved in paying maintenance for their child, however that comes about, whether by direct court case or through an agency, they tend to take a greater interest in the upbringing of the child and that is to the child's benefit.  <\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State is not opposing the motion and he has mentioned various figures for research and so on.  However, this is very urgently needed.  If the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, was to establish such an agency here it would be a very significant legacy of her period as Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  She would want to get on with it because we have been speaking about this for the last four or five years and time is running out rapidly for the Minister and the Minister of State.<\/p><p>I call on the Minister of State when responding to be clearer rather than making vague assertions about thousands of euro being allocated to research here and there and saying we are talking to somebody else.  How far are we from establishing something like this?  I take from the fact the Government is not opposing this motion that it is in favour of creating such an agency.  Let us have a little more concrete information as to when it will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200056#CCC00500","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571778600,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brady for bringing forward this motion, which is calling on the Government to establish a statutory child maintenance service with enough powers and to link it to Revenue.  The current mechanisms available to parents to seek maintenance orders, and their subsequent enforcement, rest with those who are seeking the payment, namely, the single parent in many cases, which places a considerable burden on them.<\/p>  <p>  There is a legal responsibility on parents, whether married or unmarried, to maintain dependent children.  As we all know this is not always the case.  A recent study by One Family found that while 42% of primary carers are raising children without a financial contribution from the other parent, no support at all from the other parent makes life extremely difficult for the primary carer.  According to census 2016, 25% of all families with children are Ione parent families, so one in every four families in Ireland is a single parent family who may be separated, widowed or divorced.  That is the reality of the Ireland we live in.<\/p>  <p>   There are more than 350,000 children living in lone parent families, where 86.4% of the parents are female and 13.6% male.  As we can see from the statistics, the mother is generally the carer of the family.  Some 58%, or three fifths, of parents are resorting to a court order to agree on child maintenance.  Establishing a statutory child maintenance agency would ease the financial and emotional burden on lone parents; improve outcomes for Ione parents and their children; and provide financial stability and go some way towards reducing the appalling poverty rates experienced by Ione parent families.<\/p>  <p>  Some couples with children break up and it can be amicable.  Maintenance can be sorted voluntarily and this can work well when both parties are reasonable and fair.  However, it is difficult to assess informally the correct amount of maintenance that should be paid and when it should increase, whether at different times of financial strains during the year, whether it be Christmas or back to school time.<\/p>  <p>  If the parents cannot agree on maintenance, either party can apply to the courts for a maintenance order.  As my colleague said, however, this can prove very difficult, because some women, mothers, are afraid of allowing their partner to know what their address is.  When a parent refuses to pay it becomes very messy.<\/p>  <p>  I recently spoke to a mother of two who receives maintenance and she explained how her ex-partner is very difficult to deal with, questions every euro spent on the children and a row  results whenever there is an extra request, maybe for swimming lessons in school, sports gear and school trips, at Christmas time, etc.  It can be very traumatic for the lone parent, 86% of whom, as we know, are women.<\/p>  <p>  A report published by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in March 2019, entitled Working, Parenting and Struggling, found that lone parents as a group are at risk of poverty in Ireland.  Lone parents represent the largest group seeking assistance from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  It is this society's members' experience that one-parent families have been hit hardest by the recession and the austerity measures that followed and have been unable to take advantage of the recent economic improvements.<\/p>  <p>  Almost 60% of lone parents reported that they could not access childcare services due to cost which is the second highest rate in the EU15 countries, just after Spain.  Employment rates are three times higher among Ione parents with third level education but one in five lone parents reported that he or she could not access formal education for financial reasons.<\/p>  <p>  One in every five of lone parents was in consistent poverty in 2017.  Two in every five Ione-parent households were at risk of poverty in 2017.  These are shocking statistics but I am not surprised.  During the last Government Fine Gael and the Labour Party targeted Ione parents and their children by introducing punitive reforms to the one-parent family payment.  These reforms had a detrimental effect on Ione parent households.  Even though changes has since been made, significant issues remain and the effects of their punitive changes to the one-parent family payment are still being felt.  <\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the establishment of a statutory child maintenance agency which could create a more transparent and simplified process for lone parents seeking maintenance; help provide more financial stability for Ione-parent households and reduce the high rates of poverty, deprivation and social exclusion experienced by lone parents and their children.  That is why I am delighted to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200057#DDD00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1571778600,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this motion.

I thank Deputy O'Dea for sharing his time with me.<\/p>  <p>  I would have liked to heard the Minister of State's response had it not been scripted by the Department.  His clinic can be no different from mine.  Surely single parents come into him on a regular basis telling him how difficult it is, how a maintenance order has not gone through, how a standing order was missed the previous Friday or where someone cannot get their partner into court, where there is a backlog, and that they need to go through the clerical system and to fill out the standing order form once again.<\/p>  <p>  I worked in a bank for 25 years.  People came in on a weekly basis to check to see if the standing order had gone in, and they were the lucky ones who had a maintenance agreement in place.  They waited for it and then had to wait another six weeks for it to catch up.  It was a vicious circle for these women who I met in my professional career as a banker.  Since I have become a politician, I meet them regularly.  They are totally and utterly frustrated at how they are tied up in the system.<\/p>  <p>  I will correct the Minister of State on a number of points, which I do not like doing, and I will refer to his contribution as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson for children and youth affairs.  Of course, there are a wide range of support for children and families, including lone-parent families, across Government and beyond social welfare.  Some &euro;54 million was allocated to childcare.  The Minister of State talked about the access and inclusion models, AIMs, and the sectoral employment order.  We have only 5,000 registered members in childcare.  We are a long way from having what is required to have that sectoral employment order.  Believe it or not, many of those women working in childcare are on the basic minimum wage.  We are struggling very hard to keep them in employment.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State talked about the new affordable childcare scheme.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was in the House earlier and myself and the Deputy Funchion asked how lone parents would fare under the new affordable childcare scheme.  The new affordable childcare scheme has changed for this cohort of women.  Currently, they can have 40 hours of childcare.  When the new arrangement comes in, they will be brought back to 15 hours.  This is what those women who want to return to employment or into education face.  The change in the budget was from 15 to 20 hours.  That is the extension that has been granted.<\/p>  <p>  It will really hit the lone parent in respect of after-school sector.  Until now, it was &euro;15 per week but now it will be &euro;45.  However, the cost for most after-schools is between &euro;120 and &euro;150.  These lone parents feel they will be forced out of that sector completely and will be trapped in a social welfare existence because of all the wonderful things the Minister of State said in respect of supports for the lone parent.  These are the facts as to what the affordable childcare model is about and the sectoral employment order for the childcare worker.<\/p>  <p>  The One Family study earlier this year found that 58% of parents are forced to go to court to secure child maintenance.  The same study also found that in 91% of cases a child's need was required to determine the amount paid.  It is important to remember the child is at the centre of this motion.  Regardless of the family structure in place, it is unfair to children to be robbed of their childhood due to conflict between parents.  Such a service would help provide families with stability.  These families are often the most vulnerable, as all speakers said.<\/p>  <p>  Last year One Family noted that children living in one-parent families are living in the most socially and financially deprived homes in Ireland.<\/p><p>Lone parents have the highest rate of consistent poverty, the lowest disposable income and the highest rate of deprivation.  The 2017 UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women found that Ireland should consider establishing a statutory authority and prescribing amounts for child maintenance in order to reduce the burden on women of having to litigate to seek child maintenance orders.<\/p> <p> Our court system is already overburdened, yet we force parents through what can be costly exercises to ensure they can get by and are not forced into poverty and homelessness.  Without any statutory footing, it is at the court's discretion what shape the payments take.  This leaves parents in a very precarious position.  This is all avoidable.  Having an agency on a statutory footing would prevent additional strain on courts in addition to ensuring lone parents receive payments they deserve.<\/p> <p> Following the introduction of the compliance-related child maintenance payment in the UK, there was a 30% reduction in the poverty gap.  We could have similar results here if our Government were serious about establishing a child maintenance service.  Cuts introduced by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in budget 2012 saw lone parents hit.  This was when the parties reformed the one-parent family payment.  This has fed into an already dire situation for lone parents and it is creating more instability.<\/p> <p> If the Government supported this proposal rather than abstaining, it would show real intent to support lone parents.  While the Minister of State gave a rehash of the budget speech, which is welcome, what we really want to see is the establishment of the agency and serious intent from the other side of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200057#DDD00300","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571779200,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I welcome to the Visitors Gallery the representative of One Family and SPARK-Ireland and commend them on their excellent work with their communities.

One such recommendation was to <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">consider establishing a statutory maintenance authority and prescribing amounts for child maintenance to reduce the burden on women of having to litigate to seek child maintenance orders.<\/font>The Joint Committee on Social Protection produced a report on the position of parents in Ireland in 2017.  Chapter 4, which covers maintenance, states:<\/p><blockquote>- (4.2) Ireland has no state agency with responsibility for child maintenance payments<br \/><br \/>- (4.3) Parents are forced to seek payments through an adversarial and costly court system.<br \/><br \/>- (4.4) Maintenance, when obtained, is deducted at a rate of 100% from rent supplement and 50% from other social welfare payments<br \/><br \/>- (4.5) Lone parents in receipt of OFP are required to seek maintenance from the second parent<br \/><br \/>- (4.6) In Ireland, 35% of lone parents are in receipt of child maintenance payments<br \/><br \/>- (4.7) In other jurisdictions such as Sweden, New Zealand and Canada, the state is involved in facilitating the transfer of maintenance to parents<br \/><br \/>- (4.8) In Sweden, if the parent fails to or cannot pay maintenance, the state provides the payment and recoups the money from the liable parent subject to their ability to pay<\/blockquote><p>The report recommends:<\/p><blockquote>- (7.18) No lone parent should ever have their Social Protection payment threatened or reduced due to non-receipt of maintenance from a third party e.g. a former spouse.  The obligation to pursue the liable adult should be removed from the lone parent.<br \/><br \/>- (7.19) A state body, similar to that in other countries, should be put in place to appropriately seek and pursue maintenance payments.<\/blockquote><p>The Minister recommended the development of the child maintenance agency on 15 February 2018.  It is now a year and a half later.  I am supporting this motion because there is a need for urgency.  I understand from SPARK-Ireland that the budgetary funding for research has been allocated.  The motion calls on the Government to fund research and establish, based on the research and including the stakeholders, a statutory child maintenance service with sufficient enforcement powers and links to the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200058#EEE00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1571779200,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I always wonder why the Government continues to target lone parents as if they had wronged State in some way.  Why are there no support services or State agencies to intervene when child maintenance is not paid, even when it is one of the strongest determinants of child poverty and even when child poverty persists despite is the so-called economic upturn?  The only conclusion I can come to is that the State has not come to terms with its shame in respect of lone parents, shame that lingers from the time of the Magdalen laundries, from when divorce was illegal and from when children outside marriage were shunned.  We should now address our sense of shame about nearly 250,000 people in this country once and for all.  Not only would lone parents be worthy of this but so too would the children in their families.  Responding to the calls in the motion would be a good starting point.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to refer a One Family survey carried out this summer.  It found that more than half of parents must pursue child maintenance payments through an adversaries court system while 42% of primary carers are raising children without a financial contribution from the other parent.  A resulting 58% of parents end up resorting to a court order to agree to child maintenance.  The Department puts them under pressure and threatens to reduce their payments, which is an absolute disgrace.  What struck me most about the survey&rsquo;s findings was that a child&rsquo;s needs do not determine the amount paid in 91% of cases included in the study.  That is an incredible figure considering that child poverty remains persistent, with over 230,000 children at risk of poverty today.  Many of those come from lone parent families.  According to a report of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, entitled Working, Parenting and Struggling, the rate of in-work poverty among lone parents more than doubled between 2012 and 2017.  In fact, in 2012, one in 11 working lone parents was living below the poverty line.  By 2017, this increased to one in five.  That working lone parents are living below the poverty line is a sad indictment of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  Let us not forget how targeted lone parents were when the Labour Party was in government and introduced the so-called reforms to the one-parent family payment.  These were subject to much criticism, particularly as they were introduced during a period of recession and high unemployment.  What has occurred has been in the absence of good-quality, affordable childcare and without recognising the additional practical and financial challenges of parenting alone, not to mention the fact that lone parents are obliged to seek maintenance from a non-custodial parent as a condition of receiving the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's conditional payment.  The effects of the cuts during the recession will now affect an entire generation of children.  It is a shameful history we must face up to.  Addressing the high rate of non-payment of child maintenance would be a good start, as would proceeding from a children&rsquo;s rights perspective and establishing an agency to adjudicate on child maintenance cases, especially adjudicating on the child's behalf.<\/p>  <p>  We also need what One Family has called for, namely, a future-proofed, independent, child-maintenance service reflecting the fact that families and work patterns are changing rapidly.  According to One Family, the independent agency would integrate all the requirements of families and children accessing family law courts and social services.<\/p>  <p>  The statutory child maintenance agency needs to form part of a wider comprehensive court welfare service that could determine the appropriate levels to be paid in a child-centred way.  We need to move away from an adversarial court system towards one that would still ensure children and families actually receive the maintenance.  I agree profoundly with One Family that child maintenance should be seen as an independent, ring-fenced form of security directly for children.<\/p><p>Just as with the Government's approach to child benefit, child maintenance should not be taxed or means tested, as is the case in the UK.<\/p> <p> Having the State adjudicate on child maintenance payments is not about so-called interference with the private domain of families.  Rather, it is about protecting and advocating for a child's right to an income that supports and protects him or her while offering equal opportunities in his or her life ahead.  It is time to act to end this child poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200058#EEE00300","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571779800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Teachta&iacute; Michael Collins and Danny Healy-Rae.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200059#FFF00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1571779800,"counter":518,"content":"<p>The Deputies have a total of eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200059#FFF00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1571779800,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on this important motion and I salute Deputy Brady for moving it.

Anything that moves the struggle for maintenance out of the courts system and into a more relaxed and constructive mediation environment is a good idea and should have been done long ago.  The motion reads: &quot;fund research into examining best international practice when it comes to determining, collecting, transferring and pursuing child maintenance payments&quot;.

It is not a joke for the people who are suffering because they are not getting payments.  Every Deputy will have dealt with cases where people, usually but not always mothers, have struggled to get their agreed maintenance payments.  This can lead to lasting adverse effects and drive young children into poverty.  If a parent is due maintenance and is in receipt of a social welfare payment, he or she will be assessed as having a certain level of income even if the maintenance is not received.  This means that a single parent loses out on the double.  That situation should be rectified.<\/p><p>We need to research what is best practice.  We need alternatives.

For far too long, the Government has been content to let parents battle it out through the courts to enforce child maintenance payments.  The Courts Service received almost 9,000 applications for maintenance in 2018.  With no State agency in place to support one-parent families, the Government is forcing lone parents who are already in financial hardship to fork out even more money in order to pursue child maintenance.  This is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Of the more than 200,000 one-parent families living in the State, 39.9% are at risk of poverty.  Some 40% of primary carers are raising children without any financial contribution from another parent.  Almost 60% of parents are having to resort to court orders to agree child maintenance payments.  A national survey found that a child's needs do not determine the amount paid in 91% of cases.  Surely a child's needs should be considered in all cases.  Once maintenance payments are made, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection can cut people's social welfare payments according to how much maintenance they are awarded through the courts.  This is outrageous.  Lone parents must endure the financial and mental burden of going through the court system only for the Department to then turn around and cut their social welfare payments.  This is very much in line with robbing Peter to pay Paul.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the budget has provided funding for research on this topic, but I want to see progress by the Government to show that it is not just another box-ticking exercise.  The Government can do this by committing to the establishment of a State agency.  According to SPARK-Ireland, international research has shown that removing child maintenance cases from the courts has resulted in greater child-parent relationships with the non-custodial parents.  SPARK-Ireland has called on the Government to examine the Swedish model closely.  Under that model, child maintenance payments are taken directly from the non-custodial parent's source of income.  This would avoid a situation where the lone parent has to take the non-custodial parent to court to get the payments only for them to stop again after a few weeks, with the lone parent then needing to return to court.  This causes a merry-go-round of suffering and stress for parents and children, and it cannot continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200059#FFF00500","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1571779800,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important matter.  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in, and specifically Deputy Brady, for moving this motion.<\/p>  <p>  As we all know, what starts out as a loving relationship between a young couple can often turn sour even before the birth of a baby.  A young person can find himself or herself in a predicament very quickly, with a happy-go-lucky life turned into something onerous and tough as he or she tries to raise a child on his or her own.  We need to do whatever we can for lone parents, who do Trojan work raising their children and are so protective.  We know that, in the early years especially, the mother cannot go out to work because she has to mind the baby.  She needs every support.  That is what the motion is concerned with, namely, ensuring that lone parents get the support to which they are entitled.<\/p>  <p>  Children are valuable.  They are our future and we need to protect them.  They are defenceless and cannot fend for themselves.  In the cases in question, they are depending on a single parent.  In many instances, there are not other family members to help.  The grandparents are not around, for example, because they are too far away.  A lone parent should not have thrown on him or her the requirement to prove legally the question of whether the other parent has the ability to pay.  Proving that costs time and money, but lone parents do not have time when they are trying to mind their little babies and small children.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection should ensure that these lone parents are properly seen after.  The one-parent family payment was cut a few years ago and has not been restored since.  Many lone parents are struggling.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, not to oppose the motion.

It was ironic that he stated: \"No one party has a monopoly on caring\".  No one said that anyone had a monopoly on caring, but everyone should be part of the monopoly on doing the right thing.  This motion is about doing the right thing and assisting people.  It does not matter what colour, class, creed or religion people are.  When they are in dire straits, with poverty being one of the main factors, we must do the right thing.  It is not about who wins the battle on the floor tonight.

I do not know what colour they want.  Is it black, white, blue or red?<\/p> <p> I wish to focus on the importance of the motion and how effective it could be in helping everybody.  Given my background in the mental health area, many lone parent families come to my office week in and week out.  There is a perception outside the House that lone parents are all female, but there are as many males coming in with two or three young children and they are absolutely broken.  Their jobs are being affected because they cannot afford childcare.  They do not know how the system works.  Nothing seems to be right.  Many speakers referred to the Courts Service.  That is another thing that is going to break down the family unit.  Children can tap into what is happening.  They know when their mother is hurting or their father is frustrated.  They wonder why they are in their nanny's all the time.  It is a minuscule move to do the right thing and I cannot understand why Fine Gael is not supporting it because it is about doing the right thing to assist people.<\/p> <p> Another tsunami is coming down the road.  Given the current crisis and the fact that people are living in hotels and other such places, children who have been born into such environments are now two or three years of age.  They cannot eat properly because parents do not have the ability to cook in their accommodation.  Those children are not on solids.  They are on soft foods all their lives.  One, two or three years on, they are not developing properly.  We want to do the right thing to improve people's quality of life.  Taking as much stress as we can out of people's lives will improve the situation.  The benefit is that the future generations, although they are currently being damaged, will at least have a chance of having some quality of life.<\/p> <p> Reference was made to the courts.  I am very worried about the system because it is broken.  A judge can make an order for maintenance in the court but that does not mean an individual will make the payments.  Maintenance can be taken as means, which impairs people.  The Government is taking money off people twofold if maintenance is not being paid and a lone parent does not get the full social welfare entitlement.  That breaks down society.  I appeal to Fine Gael tonight to think about that.  It is not about scoring political points.  It is about doing the right thing.  That is what we came into this House to do.  We have spoken many times in this House about the most vulnerable people.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, can correct me if I am wrong but the motion is a practical solution to improve people's lives, and if the Members cannot support a measure to help the quality of people's lives when they are struggling, they should not be in the Chamber because they are not representing the people they should be representing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200059#FFF00700","speaker":"1279","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571780400,"counter":524,"content":"<p>The system for determining and paying child maintenance needs urgent reform.

There will be an increase in the working family payment threshold by &euro;10 per week for families with one, two or three children, benefiting 55,000 families, at a cost of &euro;19 million from January 2020.  There will be increases in the earnings disregard for working lone parents receiving the one-parent family payment or jobseeker's transition payment by &euro;15 to &euro;165 per week from January 2020, which will benefit almost 17,000 families.<\/p>  <p>  Following the success of the roll-out of free GP care to children under six, from September it will expand to children under eight and to the provision of free dental care to children under six.

We know that because the majority of lone parents are not receiving maintenance for their children.  Instead, lone parents are left to struggle and to live in poverty.  The Minister has a tendency to dismiss the issue of child maintenance as a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality, yet it is the policies of her Department, not the Department of Justice and Equality, that have condemned many lone parent families to poverty.

What about the cost of a lone parent raising children alone?<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, also spoke about the liable relatives unit, but I note he did not share the figures outlined by my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, because these figures are embarrassing.  The liable relatives unit is wholly dysfunctional.  It does not work.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, spoke about the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty's actions on the issue of child maintenance as if she has been tackling the issue for years.  Until September 2019, not once did the Minister agree to examine the process currently in place in order to seek child maintenance.  I spent more than two years asking her about it over and over again in this Chamber.  Let us not pretend the Minister has been working hard to tackle this issue.  She spent those two years trying to pawn the issue off on the Department of Justice and Equality.  It has to be said the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, has done nothing to date to tackle the issues faced by lone parents with maintenance.  That is a fact.<\/p> <p> It is really disappointing that the Government has chosen to abstain on this critical motion.  The Minister says money has been set aside in the budget and that is welcome, but we do not need guidelines.  Lone parent families need a statutory child maintenance service that has been shown will cost a very small amount of money to establish, about &euro;7 million.  That cost would be so important to the many families out there that are driven into poverty because of the failure of this Government and of successive Governments to put in place a maintenance service that would help to ensure those children are lifted out of poverty, using child maintenance as a means to do so.  I ask and urge the Government again not to abstain on this, but to support it and work together collectively, because no one has a monopoly on this issue and no one wants to turn it into a political football.  We can all work together on this, but abstaining sends out the wrong message to lone parent families that desperately need this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200061#HHH00400","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571781600,"counter":531,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571781600,"counter":532,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.32 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 23 October 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
