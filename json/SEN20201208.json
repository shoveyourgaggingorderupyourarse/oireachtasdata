Hopefully, that heralds the beginning of the end of this enormous crisis that has bedevilled societies right across the globe and impacted on the lives of so many.  We have seen many lives lost and many lives affected through the loss of loved ones and the economic upheaval that the crisis has created right across the globe.  Hopefully, the end is now in sight.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Timmy Dooley:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> That brings me to my next point.  As we move from, it is hoped, the beginning of the end of this crisis, we in this part of Europe are just facing into the beginning of a very significant negative situation for the island of Ireland, namely, Brexit.  To some extent the debate on and the concerns about Brexit have been pushed to the back of the minds of many because of the virus.  However, judging from any of the studies that have been published recently and are updated regularly, it is clear, regardless of the arrangement or agreement that is reached in the coming days, if one is reached, that there will be a very significant negative impact on the economy of this State and on the lives of many.  It is well recognised that our food sector exports so much from the island of Ireland to the United Kingdom and that this will have a very negative impact on the lives of rural dwellers and people who are involved in processing and the primary area of food production.<\/p><p>However, it is not just that.  Reports out today would indicate that those who live in cities and towns and who consume food containing perhaps some ingredients originating in Ireland but processed ultimately in the UK will be affected.  The tariffs associated with a no-deal Brexit will have a significant negative impact on the livelihoods of people who are food consumers.  We need to address this quickly not only from a legislative point of view but also as part of a wider debate in the coming days.  I think many people had grown tired of Brexit and the desire to understand what is going on.  They just got sick of it and have not really got to a point at which they understand the implications of what is facing them, regardless, as I said, of whether there is no deal or a good deal.  There is no such thing as a good deal, sadly, in this instance.<\/p><p>That brings me to my third and final point, which concerns a report published today by the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland on the growth in our housing stock and the achievements in that regard.  Notwithstanding the stoppages in the construction sector during the early months of the year due to the lockdown in the economy, approximately 18,000 or 19,000 homes will be completed this year.  The required number, however, is probably close to twice that, or approximately 35,000 homes.  Projections for next year would suggest that we will complete about the same number of residential units.  That will not be enough, because the projections for the next three to five years are such that house completions will need to be at approximately 35,000.  As we head towards the end of the year, as we move out of one crisis and face the next, we have to be careful we do not allow these really important issues to blind us to the really important domestic issues.  Housing and health and the lack of continued effort over successive Governments to deal with them have led us to a point at which the housing crisis is still there.  It may not make the headlines every week and may not be talked about in this House every week but it is still there.  While I accept and recognise that Departments are working very constructively to address these issues, from our point of view, as part of the overall Legislature, we cannot take our foot off the pedal in reminding the various organs of State how important it is to continue the efforts in this regard and to try to reach that critical target of 35,000 units per year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#B00300","speaker":"1655","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I note we have three minutes each.

I served for many years on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and travelled around the country a lot in my role on the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and other bodies representing local government.  I acknowledge the work of Cork County Council under its current mayor, Councillor Mary Linehan Foley, and her work.  They launched an enormous campaign last week to focus on diversity and inclusion in local government.  There is a real need to address these issues.

Why do women and other people on the margins of particular groups feel they are unable to participate meaningfully and actively in local government?  There are many reasons.  It is not family friendly for starters.  There is no maternity leave.  There has been a debate about maternity leave for national politicians.  I have spoken to women who have maternity issues or who seek maternity leave in local authorities who have been told if they want to be paid or certainly credited for their attendance, they need to produce sick notes, which is unacceptable.<\/p><p>We need diversity and inclusion in local government.  I acknowledge the work of the previous Minister of State, Deputy Phelan.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is doing something in terms of supports and practical measures to bring women into politics - and to bring all sorts of people into politics.  It is important to encourage, support and facilitate people in our communities.  Most of us came into politics through community endeavour and involvement.  We were politicised by some experience in our community or by some experience we encountered in our personal life.  That is what stirs up something in us and encourages us to bring our personal experience to the political field and do something about it.<\/p><p>As the Leader knows, we are influencers.  Everyone has the capacity to influence people.  How can we put our heads together in the Houses of the Oireachtas to support local government?  We need to address the issue of access.  We need to encourage all sorts of diversity into local government.  Meetings need to be held at times that are suitable for people.  We need to address pay and conditions and the Moorhead recommendation, which I will not touch on today because there is an expectation of some news coming later in the day.  We should set aside time for a major discussion on how we can get our neighbours and friends in our communities into government at local, national and European levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#C00200","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I note the great news coming from Northern Ireland and Coventry in Britain about the first Covid vaccines.

We are deeply uneasy over the manner in which the Government is conducting its business today with the guillotining of the Bill.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise an issue relating to the banks.  Thousands of mortgage holders are facing into a very uncertain future.  Thousands of people have lost their jobs for good and are now unable to pay their mortgages.  They feature among the 6.1% of mortgage holders who are in arrears.  Thousands more do not know if they will have their jobs in the new year leaving them struggling to pay their mortgages and having to go to their banks.  People in the sectors that closed first and will be the last to reopen face particular mortgage difficulties.<\/p> <p>In the early days of the pandemic the Central Bank moved swiftly to introduce guidelines for a payment break for mortgages, which was very welcome.  However, in September the European Banking Authority issued guidelines that the payment break was no longer needed.  The Irish banks have shielded under this recommendation.  The European Banking Authority is now considering payment breaks again, but the Irish banks are refusing to engage with this.<\/p> <p>We need a debate in this House with the Minister for Finance about how we deal with mortgage difficulties.

There is real concern about the sale of these Irish loans to an American vulture fund.  These loans account for approximately 20% of all SME lending in this country and more than 14% of mortgages.  The impact of the sale of this loan book on businesses and mortgage holders could potentially be enormous.  We need to have a debate in this House about the wider banking landscaping and the competitiveness of the market for banks.  It is not just about borrowers; it is also about the workers.  AIB is about to cut more than 1,300 jobs.  There are very serious issues in the banking sector.<\/p><p>Last Tuesday, I raised the issue of the contract cleaning joint labour committee.  The employment regulation order was due to be signed on 1 December but, a week later, we have heard nothing from the Department.

As far as I am concerned, the difficulties of the British authorities seem to be that the higher up the establishment it goes, the more sensitive they are to it.  So they should be.  The higher up this involvement goes, the more important it is that people know.

Even last weekend we saw that more than 300 people were detained during peaceful protests by those looking for democracy and human rights.  I know the Irish Government has been taking a very strong stance on this, but I ask the Leader if we could redouble our efforts to ensure that democracy and human rights prevail in Belarus.  Members will be aware that the leader of the democratic fight, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has very strong Irish connections.

I believe we need to take strong action against Belarus.<\/p> <p>I also wish to request a debate on access to higher education.  Yesterday, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, published the latest in a series of reports that tell us what we know.  The HEA noted that numbers going on to higher education are at their highest ever, which is very welcome.  The additional places provided by the Government are important, but at the same time, large sectors of society are not getting the opportunities in higher and further education.  While the student cohort in the institutes of technology and the technological universities is much more reflective of the population more generally, we still have a problem with some universities, in particular on courses such as medicine and law, which are not more broadly reflective of society.

I expect many parents and teenagers are concerned about it and they probably do not know where to go after the ruling in the UK against the Tavistock Clinic on gender identity.  A landmark judgment was made in a court in the UK against a children's identity clinic, the Tavistock Clinic, for prescribing puberty blockers to a child under the age of 16.  She is now 23 years of age and is detransitioning back to a female.  The court ruled that it was doubtful that those under the age of 16 could understand the long-term, consequential effects of the treatment, and it was unlikely that they could give informed consent.<\/p> <p>In February, Irish doctors raised concerns about gender identity services at Crumlin hospital in Dublin.

The first concerns homeowners who are facing increasing and mounting bills from their management companies for retrospective work being done on their homes and apartments.  For example, in one building in Newbridge, over 30 homeowners have to pay for fire upgrade and compartment wall safety.  The initial bill is running at around &euro;3,500 per homeowner, and now they have been told that they will face another bill of almost of &euro;4,000 in January or February.  The management company wants the money to be paid up front before the work begins and no instalment options are being offered.  So far, the cost of the work being done to this building is in the region of &euro;120,000.  These apartments were built in 2005, and homeowners are struggling to come up with the money for the necessary upgrades.  My colleague, Senator Moynihan, raised this issue at a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage last week, but I would appreciate the chance to discuss the issue with the Minister if he will come to the House.<\/p> <p>The second issue I wish to highlight was highlighted by RT&Eacute; over the weekend.  I have received a large number of representations and contacts on it since then.  It concerns allowing live music bands to perform at weddings now that we are back under level 3 restrictions.  I have been contacted by the Wedding Band Association, which was formed in 2014 and represents many of Ireland's wedding bands.  The guidelines which state that live music and dancing are not permitted have caused major concern for its members, and of course has completely devastated couples who are due to get married in the coming weeks.  Members of the Wedding Band Association have completed Covid officer training courses, and many have been performing at weddings since last July.  We are all aware of the amount of planning that goes into that special big day for so many couples.  Many of them are unsure if they can have live music at their weddings for the months ahead.  Wedding guest lists have been limited to 25, and that has been accepted by couples the length and breadth of the country, but not having live music is a major concern and disappointment for those planning their big day, because it is, after all, such an integral part of any wedding.

One particular issue has raised its head, and I hope the Leader might be able to help.  I have written to the Minister but I understand that she is very busy right now.  As the House will be aware, our retail workers returned to work in large numbers this day last week.  A number of workers volunteered to get the stores ready from the previous Friday.  These workers who volunteered to get us back up to speed in retail now find that they will not qualify for the Christmas bonus under the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  This is even though they have the 17 weeks requisite PUP.  They have found that because they volunteered to come back to work on that Friday, technically one has to have received that payment between Friday 27 November to Thursday 3 December and these workers will now miss out on that payment.  Everyone will agree this is grossly unfair.  Mandate trade union has been in touch with me to highlight this.  It would not take much to fix it.  Surely if we are serious about supporting retail workers, and not just saying that we support them, then we should be able to fix this.  I call on the Government to urgently address the matter because, clearly, the payment will be made very shortly.  I am hoping for Government action in that regard.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, in the new year we will be facing a number of other liquidations and closures.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One of the problems with those liquidations and closures will be the amount of time workers will have to wait to get any funds back.

That is the situation in which Colin and Eithne Bell found themselves when their son, Kevin, died tragically while living abroad in 2013.  The family was heartbroken and shocked, as Members will imagine, and they turned to their local community.  That community raised funds that helped to bring Kevin back to his grieving parents.  From the surplus of funds, Colin and Eithne Bell set up the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust.  Despite being heartbroken by the loss of their own son, seven years later the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust has helped to bring home 1,000 Irish people who lost their lives while living abroad.  As many Members will know, the trust can take over the arrangements and costs of bringing a loved one home.  As a nation, I feel we owe Colin and Eithne Bell and everyone involved in the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust a huge debt of gratitude and thanks for their fantastic work.  Now, when somebody gets that dreaded phone call about a loved one passing away while abroad and contacts the Department of Foreign Affairs, that Department will put him or her in direct contact with the trust.

In many cases they are already doing what the Minister called for in last week's clarification.  As I alluded to last week, there must be a level playing field - if Members will pardon the pun - for these organisations, whether their members kick a football or participate in dance, gymnastics, acting or boxing.

It reminds me that this week last year I had the fortune of having the life-changing experience of seeing a newborn being delivered.<\/p> <p>We are still in a situation, however, where partners, husbands, wives and parents, whomever the one guardian might be that someone would need while going through labour, cannot be present all the time.

As anyone who has gone through the experience knows, it is not just one hour of delivering the baby that is involved, it is everything that goes with it.  I refer to going into the hospital, being there and being present as a comfort for the partner who is in hospital.  In my experience, the labour went on for two days.

As we talk about reopening Ireland, what can be done in this area has not been examined.  It seems every hospital has different rules, depending on where a woman is having a child.

We all know about her through \"Coco's law\" and the petition into which her mum Jackie put her life and soul after Nicole sadly passed away by suicide.  That petition and the work Jackie put in was hugely important in addressing this area.  We have heard recently that this law will now not be known as \"Coco's law\".  That is wrong and the Minister should revisit that decision.  I have some experience in this area because I have been working closely with Robbie and Kathy Maguire in Newbridge regarding a similar situation in which their daughter Maxine, whom I had taught in junior infants, died tragically.  We had been working on \"Maxine's law\", which would relate to a completely different set of circumstances and legislation.  I know how passionate parents can be to make sure a change is brought about in their daughter's or son's name to ensure other families do not suffer the same as them.

It it baffling that because the HPSC and the HSE say wind-blown musical instruments should not be used, the pipe organ, which is wind-blown by a machine and not the human mouth, is not allowed to be used.  There seem to be contradictions around issues pertaining to church music.  It makes no sense whatsoever that we are not allowing choirs to perform and sing on Christmas Day.

It is crucial that we continue to see leadership from the EU perspective and also the British perspective so that we can get to the end of this week with a positive outcome.  One colleague said this morning that people may be sick and tired of talking about it.

She has received a request not only to come and talk to us about the arts sector but also to talk to us about the universal income pilot scheme that she has proposed.  That invitation is outstanding.<\/p><p>Two different colleagues mentioned two different sets of parents this morning.  It never ceases to amaze me that parents who have suffered huge adversity in their lives, particularly the loss of their children, go on to provide enormous help and succour to people who find themselves in the same situation.  It is an absolute credit to them.  It is definitely something that needs to be respected and celebrated, on behalf of the State, by the service that they provide in place of the State.  \"Coco's law\" is what we will call the legislation as it is its proper name.  The reason it is so prevalent is not just because Deputy Howlin has championed it for so long, for which he deserves credit, but Jackie Fox never stopped talking about her daughter Coco from the day she suffered the unspeakable tragedy of losing her daughter.  The very least that we can do is respect the will and wishes not just of her as a mammy but, indeed, of the tens of thousands of other people who support her in having this Bill called Coco's law when we enact the legislation, please God next week.  I know it is unorthodox, is not the done thing and officials do not like us changing from the standard practice that we have always employed but we should start.  I contacted the relevant Minister from a personal perspective over the weekend, having spoken to Deputy Howlin last week.  I will contact her but it would be more powerful if we all contacted her individually.  I do not say just on this one occasion because there will probably be other occasions.  It is time that we started to respect the enormous contributions of people who have lost so massively in their lives yet provide succour, help and, in this case, legislation to protect all of our children.  I ask all Senators to contact the Minister's office, if they do not mind. <\/p><p>Senator Gallagher is not here but I wish to refer to the wonderful organisation that was established by that couple.  A tribute to their legacy would be for us to fix the gap in the legislation to allow people get their death certificates when they die abroad with the ease that they can get any other certification.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for acknowledging the huge contribution made by the couple, which we should do more often.<\/p><p>I say to Senator Gavan that I cannot believe that someone who volunteered on a Friday, and not get any money for volunteering, and gave a dig-out to his or her employer so a company could open last week would suffer and not get a bonus next week.  I will write to the Minister today.  To my mind, and I was around when the provision was established, one would have had to have been paid for the work in order to be able to sign off.  If one went in and volunteered, no more than if one volunteered anywhere, it is not paid work.  They were still in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and they should not have closed their claim until the day they actually went back to work, which would have been one of the days last week.  I do not know if the Senator has the name of a specific person that he could give me that I could use as an example but I will certainly make contact with the Minister's office today because that is bang out of order and is not right. <\/p><p>Senator Joe O'Reilly asked for a debate on mental health services.  There is one scheduled for early January.  Before we have that debate I will seek views on the proposal made by Deputy Neale Richmond and Counsellor Kenneth Egan to ring-fence the assets derived from drug crime in this country, as to whether that can be specifically used to provide rehabilitation services and funding to be ring-fenced for people who have been unfortunate enough to suffer with addictions.<\/p><p>Senator Wall asked for a debate on home ownership.  We will try to do that as early as we can after Christmas.  I am baffled that the banks in this country would ignore what is as obvious as the nose on everybody's face.  There are people who are going to be in severe distress already today but definitely next year when their jobs really do not re-open.  We can see that as clearly as we saw it in 2011 and 2012.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There was a real delay back in those days for us to get our act together as legislators.  I absolutely do not think we should allow history to repeat itself.  These people will not have an income and, therefore, will not be able to pay their normal outlays.  That is something which bank lenders need to be cognisant of because we certainly cannot revisit the situation we had ten years ago.  I will ask not only for that debate to be facilitated, but also for a response on the matter if I can get one beforehand.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of local government.  As Senators, we all come from activist backgrounds, whether we went through the local government system, came straight into the Seanad or the D&aacute;il or took various routes back and forth.  I genuinely believe all Senators know what it is like to care about something in society and our communities.  That is why we became activists in the first place.  Councillors do Trojan work.  The fact that only some 200 of them are ladies and the fact that so many other parts of Ireland lack representation on councils show that we have an awfully long way to go.  Senator Keogan and I come from a background on Meath County Council, which probably had one of the highest representations of women of all councils.  I do not think it did things differently from any other council.  It is worth considering this issue to see whether there is something we are missing.  We definitely need to take positive and affirmative action not just to increase the representation of women on local authorities, but also that of every other section of society that is not represented because if we do not all sit around the table together, then we do not make inclusive laws.  That is very much where we should start.<\/p><p>I will finish by addressing a matter that has not been raised today.  We have had several conversations in this Chamber in recent months regarding the inequality that exists not just in Irish society but in the wider world with regard to women versus men.  I know that some people may get tired of us as we seem to be bleating on about it.  I think the really disappointing treatment of lady footballers this weekend by a massively funded, State-sponsored organisation goes to show that we need to keep bleating on about it week in, week out.  What were more disappointing and compounded the issue were the explanations that were somehow trotted out yesterday as to why and whose fault it was that the women were disrespected so badly at the weekend.  I think we need to take positive action and say that it is not acceptable for a State-sponsored body or any other organisation, particularly one that has been given millions of euro, to act in that way.  At the same time, the organisation gives us such great gr&aacute;, as we recognised only a couple of weeks ago when we spoke about the tonic our footballers were giving us.  These women need to be able to give us the same lift and tonic.  I believe they were shown significant disrespect at the weekend and we need to ensure that never happens again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#N00200","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>On a point of information, I ask the Leader to identify the organisation to which is she referring that showed disrespect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#P00200","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I am actually talking about both the GAA and the Ladies Gaelic Football Association.

To give an example, the Guinness Storehouse is the biggest tourist attraction in the country.  I referred to it last week and I did some research over the weekend.  It would be difficult to spend &euro;75 in the Guinness Storehouse as people might buy a trinket, T-shirt, glass or cap. To give the example of the Shannon heritage sites, including the Cliffs of Moher, Kylemore Abbey and Bunratty, to name but three.  A tourist would find it difficult to spend &euro;75 in a visitor attraction shop at those sites.  As the Cathaoirleach will know well since Kenmare is a tourist town and is close to Killarney and Blarney, there are hierarchies in terms of product.  A tourist shop selling Waterford Crystal, Aran sweaters or high-end scarves would have no problem making a &euro;75 sale unlike visitor attraction outlets selling T-shirts and key rings.  We are now introducing, without any review or commitment, a new tier of tourism product.  We are saying to the tourist attraction shops in Kylemore Abbey, Bunratty, the Cliffs of Moher and the Guinness Storehouse, to name but a few attractions, that they are different from other places.  That is not right.<\/p> <p>In addition, it is not right to foist this measure on the retail sector, given that, as I said in the previous debate, 2021 will probably not see a major influx of tourists holidaying here.  Given that the amendment was passed, why not delay until March the introduction of the &euro;75 imposition?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That would give the Department three months to engage with and talk to Revenue, the Department of Finance, the retailers, the companies that work to put in place till system updates and digital solutions, and the refund agents.  If I am wrong, I would like the Minister to tell me.  By my reckoning, as someone who took pass maths in the leaving certificate, today, 8 December, is 23 days from 31 December.  That gives the Department 23 days to engage with all these groups.  I do not see it happening.  I therefore ask the Minister of State to consider 1 March as an option.<br\/><br\/>The other point I wish to make in the context of the Bill is that the retail export scheme has expanded to over 65 countries around the world.  Many of the organisations involved in the management and operation of this excellent scheme work hand in glove with retailers to provide a seamless experience for the customer and the tourist.  The &euro;75 threshold is causing consternation.  To put this into context, I will give the Minister of State three examples of where businesses will suffer.  No review has been issued by the Government.  There has been no cost-benefit analysis.  Has there been any engagement?  If there has been, we have not heard of it.  Is the Minister of State aware that the average visitor from the United Kingdom, for example, spends 11% of his or her budget on shopping and will therefore not represent a threat to the retail export scheme?  Secondly, UK visitors to our country contribute &euro;1 billion to our economy and, therefore, 95% of that VAT will always stay in Ireland.  I welcome the change in the benefit of the UK tourist but I go back to the point I made the other day.<br\/><br\/>I ask the Minister of State to consider the representative bodies and what they said in the tourism committee about the challenges our hospitality sector faces.  Senator Gavan this morning made a comment about people coming into work.  The Leader quite rightly said that people who come in and volunteer should not have to face that threat.  Our plateau in respect of the number of tourists arriving from the UK has been reached.  Their numbers are declining following Brexit and the exchange rate volatility.  The retail export scheme will encourage UK visitors to visit more and spend more in all sectors and therefore contribute to our economy if the scheme is available.<br\/><br\/>I do not have an issue with a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>philosophy but I think many in the House will agree with me that we need to keep jobs and promote sustainable jobs in rural Ireland and our regional towns.  I have referred to a number of the visitor centres there.  What F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been doing has been about ensuring regional distribution through, for example, the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  That is done in a number of scales, not only through seasonal distribution but also through promoting the visitor experience and the physical experience of tax-free shopping in our country.  No other country is doing what we are doing on tax-free shopping.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I accept it was in the Bill last year in the event of there being no deal.  That Bill was never implemented or enacted.  What consultation has taken place with the refund agents who have articulated a concern about the UK visitors' usage of the scheme?  Why is there now a sudden need to introduce this provision?  Despite our tourism figures in 2020 having understandably plummeted, in 2021 with the likelihood of Covid still being here notwithstanding hopefully the availability of a successful vaccine - all of us in this House should encourage people to take the vaccine - we are now saying that with travel virtually ceased, 50% of other tourists and current Irish retailers are being penalised.<\/p><p>Nobody wants the threshold to be abused.  I have no vested interest other than being from Cork and seeing the importance of the cruise liners to the Port of Cork, Blarney Castle and Blarney Woollen Mills.  We are selling ourselves short when we have a unique tourist experience.  Senator Casey spoke about the corporation tax last week.  This is our calling card in respect of our visitor experience.  This is a short-sighted decision.  It would be logical to continue to allow tourists from different countries to be able to spend money when we emerge into a new normal whatever that may be.<\/p><p>I hope we will come back here again to have that review.  I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your indulgence and latitude.

The Cathaoirleach will correct me if I am wrong.  When we were at this stage last week, our amendment was accepted by everybody in the House.  Today we find that the Government has tabled an amendment to remove last week's amendment tabled by the Labour Party.  We tabled that amendment for many of the reasons espoused by Senator Buttimer this morning.  I want to concentrate on a few of them again.  This provision is basically a new tourist tax.

We need to ensure that a review of this measure is carried out.  It will affect a great many businesses.  Last week, I put on record a number of conversations I have had about the potential for this tourist tax to affect up to 500 jobs at a time when the youth employment rate is over 40%.  Again, I will state that many young people start their working careers in these businesses.  For all the reasons Government and Opposition Senators spoke about last week and which have been mentioned again this morning, the introduction of this tourist tax is totally unacceptable.  We will oppose the amendment and call for a vote.

I echo the words of Senator Wall.  As he rightly said, we in the Labour Party entirely support the Government's efforts to ensure a deal is reached with regard to Brexit.  We know what a critical time we are at this week.  We understand and acknowledge that.  We are certainly not opposing the Bill but, as Senator Wall has said, our amendment on Committee Stage last week, amendment No. 4, was not opposed by any Government Senator.  It was passed.  I know things can happen and that it may have passed inadvertently.  We saw that happen with Government amendments on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017.  We understand why the Government has proposed this amendment today but we have to oppose it.  The reasons we tabled amendment No. 4, which would insert a new section 68 allowing for a review after 12 months, were set out eloquently by Senator Wall on Committee Stage last week.  The amendment was supported by many, as he has said.  We will oppose the Government amendment which seeks to take out that review.  We understood that a commitment was given in the D&aacute;il that there would be such a review.<\/p> <p>For all of those reasons, we cannot support the Government amendment, although we will not oppose the Bill, despite our discomfort with the guillotine which Senator Sherlock expressed on the Order of Business earlier.  As leader of the Labour Party group, I have put our position on the record.  Our amendment was reasonable and it deserved and got Government support last week.  We are disappointed to see the Government seeking to delete it this week.

I will not prolong the discussion any longer than is necessary.  I agree with a lot of what Senators Bacik and Wall have said on the Government amendment.  As the Minister of State will know, the overarching themes and issues involved were debated on Committee Stage.  We had our own amendment which, unfortunately, did not make the cut in the end but the Labour Party amendment represented a reasonable position to adopt and it is worthy of consideration.  I do not know why the Government is so opposed to revisiting some of these issues.  This is but one proposal in which we, as Opposition groups, are asking the Government for a punctuation point at which we can stop and take a breather in what I appreciate is an ever-changing and dynamic situation.  We are not saying that such a review will ultimately result in a change.  That will depend on political, societal and economic dynamics.  The amendment simply sought a point at which to stop, reflect and review the measure.  The cause for such a review was very eloquently outlined by Senator Buttimer.  Much like Senator Bacik, our group will oppose the Government amendment because it is not good practice not to review issues that are of such importance for communities across this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#U00300","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad as an deis teacht isteach anseo agus an leas&uacute; seo a phl&eacute;.

I also accept the genuine feelings people have about the tax rebate scheme.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile asked pertinent questions about why there is such a rush and why we are opposing the amendment the Seanad made last week.  Senators are right.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Thomas Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2203\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have given a political commitment that we will carry out the review that is envisaged by the amendment.  The commitment has been given and the review will happen.  As I understand, it must happen under Seanad Standing Orders anyway, but we have given the commitment in writing.  The situation is that the Bill itself is urgently required ahead of the end of the transition period on 31 December.  As Senators know, the reasons for the Bill are to protect consumers, facilitate the sound functioning of key businesses, and continue the common travel area and North-South co-operation.  However, it is not just that.  If we were to accept the amendment, we would then have to look for D&aacute;il time to get the approval of the D&aacute;il.  That presents a real difficulty.  The pressure on the Bill is not just due to the time pressure of 31 December, it is also the genuine pressure on officials who are now observing what is going on at the Brexit talks and the discussions of the joint committee on the Northern Ireland protocol.  It is the same officials who are looking at all these issues.  I left a meeting with Michel Barnier this morning to be here.  That is my duty.  That is not said by way of complaint.  There are genuine time pressures.<\/p><p>What we are doing is asking the Seanad to support the Bill.  I will speak on the substance of the amendment.  We are looking for the understanding, help and support of Senators to accept the amendment on the basis that it lets us close this book for the time being on this legislation.  When the Taoiseach goes to Brussels on Thursday, it allows us to be able to say to our colleagues that we have done everything and that the book is closed.  If the European Commission starts to discuss its own contingency measures at this late stage, as there has been pressure on it to do, we can say that we in this country have done what we need to do.<\/p><p>I repeat the commitment of the Minister for Finance that the Department and the Revenue Commissioners will report on the operation of the VAT retail scheme in the course of 2021.  That commitment was made genuinely.  The only reason the Bill was proposed in the Seanad at this time is simply to do with D&aacute;il pressure and to get the legislation passed.  That is not to dismiss the concerns that have been raised or to say that we are not going to do this or that it was a bad idea.  I accept this probably should have been done in the D&aacute;il originally, but it was not.  That is fine.  I have discussed that in the D&aacute;il with the former leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Brendan Howlin, as well.  It did not happen.<\/p><p>We genuinely want to do this.  We appreciate the co-operation shown by members of all parties on Brexit.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, was in Brussels yesterday.  I expect the Taoiseach and I are going to Brussels tomorrow.  There are general issues of availability and the officials are in a similar position as well.  That is the only reason the Bill is before the Seanad, and the Government is asking the House to let this Bill pass and to accept the political commitment that we have made that we will carry out a review in the course of 2021.  It is quite clear as well from a Government point of view that some of the strongest voices were Senators Buttimer and Casey, who are on our own side.  The Minister for Finance has a delicate job to do.<\/p><p>I am not directly involved personally in this particular issue.  It is the Department of Finance that is involved.  The purpose of this Bill is that every Department takes its own sectoral issues.  I understand there was strong engagement by the sectors over a long period on this issue with the Department.  The Revenue Commissioners will make information available on this.  The report will be carried out.  As I understand it, a report must be made under the legislation.  That is our case here today.  We are under severe time pressure and we want to have this done and to continue the other work that is going on with the co-operation of everybody.  It is a matter for the Seanad itself and not a matter for me how it conducts its business and what votes are called.  That is our case, and I hope Senators accepts the Government's bona fides, as we accept their bona fides on all of these issues, in particular the one in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#U00400","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1607423400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 30; N\u00edl, 12.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Robbie Gallagher and Se\u00e1n Kyne; N\u00edl, Senators Ivana Bacik and Mark Wall.<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#Y00100","aye":["1629","1630","1633","1636","1637","1638","1640","1641","1644","1646","1647","1648","1651","1652","1653","1654","1655","1656","1658","1665","1666","1667","1670","1671","1689","1692","1693","1694","1682","1687"],"nay":["1631","1632","1634","1635","1662","1663","1664","1672","1688","1683","1684","1686"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>As it is now 12.30 p.m., I am required to put the following question in accordance with the order of the Seanad of this day: \"That Fourth Stage is hereby completed, that the Bill, as amended, is hereby received for final consideration, and that the Bill is hereby passed.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#Z00100","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607423400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607423400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 12.31 p.m. and resumed at 1.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Nithe i dtosach su\u00edonna - Commencement Matters","time":1607423400,"counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#AA00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Horticulture Sector","time":1607423400,"counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#AA00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>The matter I raise today relates to the importance of the horticultural peat industry to the Irish economy and the threat arising from unprecedented legal and planning problems facing the industry.  As we know, peat is used in horticulture, particularly as a growing medium by both amateur and professional gardeners, professional growers and the mushroom, forestry and soft fruit industry.  At one point my family was in the mushroom farming business so I certainly have experience of the importance of peat and the impact that is currently being felt with respect to other countries both within and soon to be outside Europe.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State knows the Irish horticultural industry makes a very significant contribution to the Irish economy, with a farm gate value of &euro;437 million in 2018, an employment value of &euro;497 million and exports of &euro;239 million.  An estimated 6,600 people work within the industry and there are another 11,000 jobs in ancillary employment.  It is very important.<\/p> <p>We are not talking about a huge amount of peatland, as it is under 5% of the Irish peatlands under production, equating to 0.4% of the total Irish peatlands.  The current legal position is that horticultural peat harvesting requires planning permission and a licence from the Environmental Protection Agency.  This process can take between four and six years and it is unnecessarily burdensome and disproportionate.  We could have a situation where many businesses could close when the horticultural industry runs out of peat, which will happen in July next year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This would be a very regrettable and would have major detrimental employment and economic effects on the industry that I mentioned.  Without an indigenous supply of horticultural peat, many of our growers would have to look abroad, particularly to Lithuania or to Holland.  The costs would be four times what the costs are here.  Apart from that, we need only reflect on the higher environmental cost as peat production would be shifted from one part of the EU to another, resulting in Irish growers adding thousands of kilometres of a carbon footprint to what is happening at the moment.  It is unacceptable and hypocritical to ban the use of peat in Ireland for horticultural products and then import it from another EU member state or a third country.  What could happen, and as happened in the mushroom industry many years ago, is that those growing mushrooms, plants, strawberries and other produce here would be at a competitive disadvantage.  They could lose much of the domestic market because of cheaper imports.  On behalf of all of those currently employed in the sector, I ask the Minister of State to revisit this issue with his colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and ensure some compromise can be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#AA00300","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>This is a sector with which I am very familiar.  I worked as a landscape gardener for many years prior to and while still in politics.  I am very much familiar with the issue and very much in support of the amenity horticulture side of it and in terms of nursery stocks.<\/p> <p>In January 2019, the European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Peat Extraction) Regulations 2019 and the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) Regulations 2019 came into effect.  These regulations came into force after a decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la upheld by the High Court that large-scale peat extraction is not exempt development and requires planning permission, as the Senator said.  On 20 September 2019, the High Court ruled that proceedings brought challenging the regulations should be allowed on certain grounds.  This decision means that peat cannot be extracted from areas larger than 30 ha from Irish bogs unless the developer has planning permission to do so.<\/p> <p>Peat is traditionally a very important component of the national horticultural and amenity plant sector.  However, while this is still the case, the industry continues to develop and progress.  While currently there are no suitable or viable alternatives to using peat for mushroom casing, the horticulture sector is researching alternatives for peat such as biochar, spent mushroom stabilisation and other forms.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is supporting the research process by funding two research projects commissioned by Ireland's mushroom producer organisation, CMP.<\/p> <p>My Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage published a consultation document, entitled A review of the use of peat in the horticultural industry, to fulfil action 5 under the national peatland strategy.  The consultation invited written submissions from stakeholders to be submitted by the 20 January 2020.<\/p> <p>On 7 September 2020, I published a report on the review of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  The review report was prepared by an inter-agency working group following on from submissions from stakeholders.  After the publication of this report, I set up a working group to consider impacts on the sector.  It is proposed that this working group will represent Departments, including Agriculture, Food and the Marine, State agencies, environmental non-governmental organisations and industry stakeholders.  The working group will address the key issues raised in the report, including future use of peat by the horticulture sector.  The position of chair for the independent working group that will be formed has been advertised and the closing date for receipt of the applications was 23 November.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The reason I have asked him to come before the House is the urgent need to change the building regulations to make it mandatory to include what are called Changing Places toilet facilities rather than the current standard accessible toilets in public buildings.  In Ireland there are estimated to be only 15 Changing Places toilet facilities.  There are over 1,500 in England, I am told, and recently the UK introduced legislation which will make Changing Places toilet facilities mandatory in new public buildings from 2021.  Across the Border, there are 40 in Northern Ireland, and the Northern Ireland Assembly has given a commitment to amend its regulations.  An online campaign by Changing Places is ongoing, with more than 7,000 signatories asking the Irish Government to change the building regulations to ensure that Changing Places toilet facilities are mandatory in all new public buildings.<\/p> <p>This is simply a quality of life issue for families whose loved ones need changing or assistance with very basic human needs.  I am aware of a number of families who simply cannot use the current facilities on offer in this country.  Their children, their loved ones, have grown into young adults and adults, and the small baby tables currently in these facilities are simply not good enough.  These families are left having to change their children in the back of their cars or on the cold floors of what changing rooms they can find.  These families cannot plan day-to-day family events that most of us take for granted, such as going out on family trips to the shops, the cinema or other attractions that families visit together and enjoy so much.  It is not possible for them to plan such family events because they know their loved ones will need changing and the care that comes with their medical condition and there are no facilities on the way or near the attractions and locations that they as a family can use.  It is simply not good enough that we lack these facilities in our country.  We are so far behind other countries that we have an awful lot of catching up to do.<\/p> <p>I am aware that the Minister of State and the Department are actively looking at setting up a working group to progress this matter.  I hope the Minister of State can update us today on the Department's commitment on this important matter and the progress that has been made with the working group.<\/p> <p>I am also aware that a number of local authorities are building or have very recently built such Changing Places toilet facilities.  My colleague, Councillor George Lawlor, was involved in this with the access officer of Wexford County Council.  That local authority built a fully accessible Changing Places facility, with consultation from Changing Places, in a new park in Wexford for less than &euro;50,000.  This, I am sure the Minister will agree, is a great step forward and I hope it will be replicated in other areas and when parks and playgrounds are being planned in future.<\/p> <p>This issue directly affects the quality of life of so many families.  It prevents them from planning the days out that many of us still hold dear.  We treasure the family memories made on such occasions.  Changing in the back seat of a car should belong to a bygone era and changing on the cold floor of a small changing room should be a distant memory.  It is time we gave these young children and adults back their dignity and met their needs, desires and wishes in all public buildings.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply and assure him of my support and the support of the families who most need these changes and who have contacted me.  We all look forward to a positive reply on what is a very important matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#CC00300","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Wall for raising this important issue.

More than 40 families living in the Carpenterstown area of Dublin 15, including some with older siblings already at St Patrick's National School in Diswellstown, found out last week that their children will not be starting in the school in September 2021.  Many of the disappointed families live very close by and obviously have not been offered a place because it is oversubscribed.  I have two children aged six and eight.  If I were told that my younger child could not go to school with their older sibling, I would be devastated.<\/p> <p>This is as a result of the new admissions policy the archdiocese imposed on the school where the date of birth must be taken into consideration for children with siblings already in the school and children living in the parish.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Emer Currie:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This has resulted in the school only being in a position to offer places to children born on or before 18 November 2016, which is really early.  This leaves a number of children who have siblings already in the school and who will be nearly five in September 2021 without a place in the school.  In fact, they do not have a place in any primary school because their parents believed they would be prioritised as the family is already part of the school community.  In addition, these children are not eligible for a third year of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, so they are in a very difficult position.  Does the Department have a plan as to where these children will go in September 2021?  The school's sister school, St. Mochta's National School in Clonsilla, is also oversubscribed.  <\/p><p>Two new estates were built in the area in recent years.  Out of a total of 120 available spaces, 50 were taken by children from these new estates.  Was this development monitored by the Department, perhaps through child benefit or ECCE grants paid?  There will be more development in this area.  The school was built as a three-stream school but, in the last three years, it has taken four despite a chronic lack of space.  This time last year, the Department and the school came to an agreement that the school would allow for four streams on the condition that the Department would purchase the neighbouring field and expand the school.  There has been no progress on this to date.  In fact, the people who own the field have said that, since there has not been any progress, the licence the school has to use it for play space might be revoked.  The purchase of the field is now extremely urgent.  It would be great to get an update in that regard.<\/p><p>Capacity is not the only issue facing the school.  It has also experienced serious pyrite issues since opening.  Fixing this issue is an ongoing process which is resulting in hefty costs for both the Department and the school itself in terms of the time and effort involved and the constant health and safety checks.  The school also tells me that an average of two children in every class have complex needs.  The pupil-teacher ratio is 28:1 but the school is taking in more pupils as a result of the capacity issues in the area, for which it does not have the resources.  <\/p><p>Despite the pyrite issue, the health and safety works, the expansion issues, the admissions challenges and space restrictions, it is a wonderful school to which people want their kids to go.  It is a fantastic school in the community.  Can we please get an update on the field?  It is urgent.  The Department had committed to the expansion of the school.  Is that even enough now to deal with the number of kids who need school places?  I also highlight the school's need for support within the new special education model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#DD00800","speaker":"1648","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  I will outline to the Seanad the current position in respect of pyrite remediation at St. Patrick's National School in Diswellstown, Dublin 15, and the purchase of the adjacent field to accommodate remediation works and expansion of the school.<\/p> <p>St. Patrick's National School in Diswellstown was constructed under a design-and-build contract with the Department of Education as the direct employer.  As the Senator will know, the school was completed in 2006.  In March 2010 the Department engaged a firm of structural engineers with specialist expertise to report on the presence of pyrite in the building.  The engineers' report confirmed the presence of pyrite and recommended total removal of the hardcore infill from all areas of the building and surrounding external areas to achieve a permanent remediation.<\/p> <p>The Department sought legal advice as to how to proceed with the remedial works and how to take a legal case, if required.  Following advice from the Chief State Solicitor's office, a number of steps have been undertaken.  In January 2012 the Department requested that the Chief State Solicitor's office initiate legal proceedings against the main contractor and the infill sub-contractor supplier immediately.  Plenary summonses issued against both in March 2013.  In early 2014 the Department engaged a design team to scope the extent of the works necessary to remove the pyrite at St. Patrick's.  Planning permission was also obtained for the temporary accommodation that would be required for the school to decant on a phased basis while remedial works were being undertaken.  In early 2014 the Department commenced the process of tendering for contractors to carry out the remediation works on the school.  However, one of the companies that expressed an interest in carrying out the work was the original contractor on the project.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Following consultation with the Chief State Solicitor's office, it became clear that it would not be feasible to invite tenders from a contractor, against which the Department was also pursuing a legal action.  As a result, the project did not proceed to tender at that time.  Also in 2014, progression of the Department's legal case became dependent upon another legal case involving the infill subcontractor.  In early 2015, the Supreme Court referred matters relating to this other case to the European Court of Justice.  This effectively suspended the legal action against the two contractors involved on St. Patrick's National School.  The matter was resolved in 2019 with a referral back to the Supreme Court and the Chief State Solicitor's office advised that the Department's legal case could proceed.  A meeting between officials from the office and the Department took place in July 2019.  The Chief State Solicitor's office recommended going to mediation with the contractor in an attempt to reach an agreed settlement.  This resulted in an exchange of legal correspondence between the parties.  A meeting was held between the Department officials and the Chief State Solicitor's office on 17 November 2020, where it was agreed that the mediation process should proceed.  The Chief State Solicitor's office advises that mediation can be speedy and flexible but requires co-operation from all parties.  If this is proving difficult to achieve, the Department will instruct the Chief State Solicitor's office to set the case down for trial and will again consider progressing the remediation works in parallel with the legal proceedings.<\/p><p>In regard to the proposed purchase of the field adjacent to the site, officials in the Department are working closely with officials from Fingal County Council under the memorandum of understanding on the acquisition of the adjacent field to accommodate remediation works and the expansion of St. Patrick's National School in Diswellstown.  I can confirm that discussions are ongoing with the landowner with a view to acquiring this site.  Due to commercial sensitivities relating to site acquisitions generally, I am not in a position to provide further details at this time.<\/p><p>I confirm to the Senator that the Department is working closely with the Chief State Solicitor's office with a view to getting the legal situation sorted out in order to get the pyrite problem at the school rectified as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#EE00200","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the update but it was not the one I was hoping for.

The recent cold snap has reminded us all how important it is to have a home that is warm.  Light and heat are basic human needs.  For too many people, the sight of a bill from their electricity or gas provider strikes them with fear and others simply go without light and heat as they are burdened with energy poverty.<\/p> <p>I am currently conducting a survey about people's experience of energy poverty and the preliminary results are heartbreaking.  People are in terrible positions where they are being forced to choose between heating their homes and feeding their children.  The health implications are dire, and the mental strain is significant.  A recently produced ESRI report showed the harmful effects of energy poverty, especially on children's respiratory health.<\/p> <p>We know that Covid-19 has exacerbated energy poverty because more people have been forced to stay at home and to use electricity and heat, but for some groups the situation is even worse.  Travellers living in mobile homes or trailers are nine times more likely to go without heat than the general population and they spend five or six times more of their income on energy than the rest of the population.  Renters tend to live in poorly insulated homes, as do people with disabilities.  Those homes are more likely to be rated E, F or G on the BER system.<\/p> <p>The warmer homes scheme is welcome for many, but it is not up to the task of addressing energy poverty for many of the groups.  It only benefits a subgroup of people who experience energy poverty.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A total of 75% of the scheme's beneficiaries are elderly homeowners, but there are many others experiencing energy poverty who are left out.  What about the working family that is struggling to make ends meet and earns just too much to qualify for the warmer homes scheme but too little to avail of the grants?  I ask the Minister of State to review the eligibility requirements for the warmer homes scheme.<\/p><p>According to the ESRI, there are three drivers to energy poverty.  One is low household incomes, making it harder for people to pay their bills.  I welcome the fact that the State weighs in with the fuel allowance and social welfare payments.  The second driver is inefficient homes, and while the State is doing something to tackle that, I would like it to extend the eligibility criteria.  However, nothing seems to happening with the third major driver of energy poverty, namely, high energy prices.  Why is the Minister not calling for the State to intervene and regulate the high cost of energy?  Just this year there was a 130% hike in the public service obligation, PSO, levy charged on electricity bills, and this hike comes on the back of reductions in the cost of wholesale electricity.  Like we have been promised, it is becoming cheaper to generate electricity from indigenous, renewable resources such as wind instead of fossil fuels like coal and gas, but despite the lower costs of purchasing the electricity, the consumer bills are still going up.  Why are the savings from the transition not being passed on to the consumer?  As a member of the Green Party, I know that it is something that the Minister of State would want to address.<\/p><p>We hear constantly that the PSO levy is set by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, but I believe that that is passing the buck.  The Minister of State should be exploring how the CRU calculates the PSO, how it ensures that the transition benefits everybody, and that the PSO does not burden those who are in energy poverty.  In previous parliamentary questions, the Minister of State had recommended to households to reduce their consumption of energy or switch suppliers, but this is easier said than done, especially for someone with a poor credit rating.  There are tools at the Minister of State's disposal and the State could strengthen its regulatory role.  I implore the Minister of State to explore the options in reducing the cost of energy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#FF00400","speaker":"1635","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boylan for raising this important issue, and it is something that I feel strongly about myself, particularly when it comes to low-income families, and the Senator mentioned the Traveller community.  She is correct that these groups are much more exposed to high energy costs than wider society, and I accept her point.  I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is busy this afternoon participating in a meeting of the EU transport Council.<\/p> <p>The Government is fully committed to combating energy poverty and protecting the most vulnerable in society.  The Government provides extensive supports for household energy costs.  There are specific schemes aimed at those at risk of energy poverty, including the household benefits package and the fuel allowance.  Government policy has supported the introduction of competition to energy markets to drive down prices.  Consumers can now make significant savings by switching energy suppliers, somewhat mitigating the impact of price rises, but I do take on board Senator Boylan's point in respect of the capacity of consumers to do that.<\/p> <p>However, upgrading the efficiency of someone's home is the best long-term solution to helping a low-income household to manage their energy bills.  It tackles the root cause of the problem as opposed to treating the symptoms.  Free energy efficiency upgrades have been a pillar of Government action on alleviating energy poverty for the past 20 years.  To date, more than 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the better energy warmer homes scheme.  This scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  It delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  This leaves the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level.<\/p> <p>There has been substantial progress in reducing energy poverty since 2016.  The Government's strategy to combat energy poverty was published that year, setting out a number of actions to alleviate the burden of energy poverty on the most vulnerable in society.  The focus of this strategy was on high-impact actions which aimed to make a real difference to the lives of those in energy poverty.<\/p> <p>Over the lifetime of the strategy, the Government has taken a number of steps to alleviate energy poverty.  Free upgrades were carried out in over 23,000 lower income homes under the main SEAI energy poverty schemes.  The warmer homes scheme has started providing deeper measures, increasing the investment in each home and increasing the benefits to the homeowners.  A consultation on energy efficiency in the rented sector has also been completed with recommendations to follow in 2021.  The allocations for retrofit of social housing have also increased significantly, with an allocation of &euro;65 million for 2021.  Funding for the SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased dramatically over the period, from &euro;15 million in 2015 to more than &euro;109 million in budget 2021.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This progress is evident from the work undertaken by the ESRI on the level and extent of energy poverty in Ireland over time.  This work found that the proportion of households in or at risk of energy poverty has reduced from 28% to 17.4% over the lifetime of the strategy.  I consider that to be good progress, but there is still a long way to go.<\/p><p>The programme for Government and the climate action plan set highly ambitious targets for the number and depth of retrofits to be completed by 2030.  We need to retrofit 500,000 homes and install 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes over the next ten years.  It is crucial that we support low-income households to participate in this transition.  For this reason, the programme for Government commits &euro;5 billion to part fund a socially progressive national retrofit programme targeting all homes but with a particular focus on the midlands region and on social and low-income tenancies.  In practice this funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades, making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run.<\/p><p>In addition, the climate action plan made a commitment to review energy poverty schemes to ensure they target those most in need.

There are delays in getting the theory test.  I logged on this morning to see if I could get a theory test in Gorey before Christmas.  It was quite difficult to get anything in the immediate vicinity but a lot of my concern is around the driver test itself.  I am aware that the Road Safety Authority, RSA, has set a target that if a person applies for a driver test he or she will get that within ten weeks, but at the moment those waiting to have the driver test are waiting for up to 30 weeks.  If one logs on at the moment for a driver test, one could be waiting until July.  A person would be quicker, and more likely, to get the Covid vaccine than a driver test.  This impacts on all age groups but it especially impacts on younger people.  The Minister of State will appreciate that it particularly impacts those who live in rural areas or where public transport is not an alternative.<\/p> <p>There is a knock-on impact for this problem.  Provisional drivers must rely on a parent or guardian to be able to drive with them.  I spoke to a mother who lives just outside Gorey who every morning has to drive her daughter 45 minutes to work and then drive her back 45 minutes in the evening, while the mother is also trying to work.  There are lots of other examples, as I am sure the Minister of State is aware.

The person, however, cannot get a full licence because she or he cannot get a test.  With the challenge of youth unemployment we must prioritise this issue coming out of this crisis.  We have got to ensure that those who require a driving licence can get it.<\/p> <p>I am aware that the Government has been talking about this and the RSA has talked about additional staff to be able to meet this demand but we need to know when they are going to be in place.

In the previous Commencement debate we discussed energy poverty.  The phenomenon of transport poverty has a real impact on young people's ability to access training and the labour market.  I absolutely appreciate that.  I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, who is unavailable as she is launching the 2020 Road Safety Authority Christmas and new year road safety campaign.<\/p> <p>The driving test service is a statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Department of Transport has been in constant contact with the RSA regarding all of its services, the impact of Covid-19 thereon and how they can be best maintained under the current circumstances.  As the Senator is aware, driving tests were first temporarily suspended due to Covid-19 in March 2020.  The service resumed on a gradual basis in mid-July.  This was only possible because of detailed work done by the RSA in conjunction with expert medical advice to examine each aspect of the testing process and ensure that resumed tests would be safe for the public.  Since resuming operations, there has inevitably been an increased level of demand due to the consequent backlog.  Unfortunately service capacity has been considerably reduced due to social distancing and other public health and hygiene requirements.  This means that customers experience longer waiting times than was the case before the service was suspended.  Around 51% of those awaiting a test have been waiting for less than three months.  Waiting times can vary from centre to centre, with others waiting for as long as 30 weeks, as the Senator pointed out. <\/p> <p>In addition, level 5 restrictions, which took effect for the six weeks from 22 October to 1 December 2020, meant that driving tests were only available to those involved in essential services, including essential retail work.  While the Minister of State regrets any inconvenience caused, public safety must remain paramount.  The Road Safety Authority is currently examining ways to increase the number of tests while staying within health constraints, and is working in close consultation with the Department of Transport on this matter.  Measures to this end include increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and eventually eliminate the backlog.  The Department of Transport has recently approved the retention by the RSA of 18 temporary driving testers whose contracts were due to expire in October and November.  The RSA has also rehired a further 18 temporary testers whose contracts expired in May.  This will help increase testing capacity. <\/p> <p>However, it must be stressed that many of the factors impacting on the delivery of the service stem from the effect of restrictions on the throughput of centres themselves rather than the availability of staff.  The RSA is also considering a number of other measures, including examining whether the number of tests a driving tester can perform each day can be increased within the current health constraints.  Each testing slot now takes a much longer time to complete due to the additional hygiene and sanitary procedures that are now absolutely necessary.  As a result, the number of tests a tester can safely conduct per day was reduced from eight to five when the service reopened.  Following experience of managing the tests under Covid-19 restrictions, this number was increased to six in mid-September.  It may rise to seven depending on health assurances, but not until January 2021 at the earliest. <\/p> <p>The Department of Transport has been in discussions with the RSA on how to return to the normal target of a maximum waiting time of about ten weeks.  It is clear that it will not be possible to reach this point quickly because of the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic.  The RSA has presented a plan to the Department of Transport which would see a return to a ten-week waiting time by early  2022.  While this is not as soon as anyone would like, it is important to recognise that there are no quick fixes.  The continuing build-up of applications as the pandemic goes on means it will take time to achieve a normal waiting time.  It is also important to remember that this target could be impacted if a further lockdown proves to be necessary in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#JJ00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

The Government's strategy for recovery aims to target high rates of youth unemployment.  It will be very difficult for a lot of young people to take up work if they do not have access to their own transport.

Senator Byrne can be assured that the Department of Transport is aware of the challenges facing the RSA as it works hard to manage further the backlog in the driver testing service.  While the service was limited during level 5 restrictions, the RSA is examining ways of increasing the number of tests, within the health constraints, with the aim of resuming wider testing after level 5.  It is working in close consultation with the Department on this matter.  This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help to reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog.<\/p><p>I reiterate that the Department of Transport has already given approval for the RSA to retain 18 driver testers on temporary contracts which were due to expire in October.  The RSA has already rehired a further 18 temporary testers whose contracts expired in May.  This will help to increase testing capacity.  The RSA is now prioritising driver testing for essential workers and has set up a dedicated form on its website, .  This form will allow customers to assess whether they qualify for an urgent test appointment, and, if so, to submit an application.  If an application is accepted, the applicant will be placed on a short notice list.  <\/p><p>It has been clear from the start that the priority must be public safety.  We want to provide services, and we know people are seeking those services, including the driver test, but only limited possibilities will be available while preserving public health.  The priority of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, is to see that the RSA is able to deliver its services to the public as much as possible, while doing so safely.  We are all in the grip of this pandemic.  People are frustrated, but I ask that we try to work our way through this situation.

It is not only cars, however; we also have heavy goods vehicles, mainly articulated trucks, going through the town.  That has an impact on the economic and social fabric of the town.

The review will be used to set out an updated NDP for the period out to 2030.  Work is under way within the Department of Transport to contribute to this review.  Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP was developed to underpin the successful implementation of the national planning framework, NPF.  This provides the strategic and financial framework for the national roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027.  The review of the NDP will be aligned with the NPF and Project Ireland 2040.  The focus of TII's activities is, accordingly, being directed towards the development of the major national road improvement schemes that are included in the NDP, along with the maintenance of the existing national road network.<\/p><p>All projects, including those listed in the NDP or any revision of the NDP, require statutory approval and compliance with the public spending code.  In that context, TII provides the Department of Transport with regular updates on its delivery of the national roads programme.  Within the timeframe given in the lead-up to this debate, the following information is the most up-to-date information available to me on TII's delivery of this project.<\/p><p>Currently, the N71 relief road around Bandon ties back into the existing road network via a very steep downhill gradient.  Traffic also needs to negotiate a number of roundabouts and priority junctions within the built-up area of Bandon.  There is quite heavy traffic in the area on the N71, with an annual average daily traffic of between 9,000 and 14,000 vehicles, as has been noted by the Senator, and a heavy goods vehicle, HGV, percentage of up to 5%.  The proposed relief road extension would involve bridging over the R603 to remove the existing steep gradient and construction of approximately 2.5 km of new single carriageway tying back into the existing N71, just to the west of the town.<\/p><p>A feasibility study was completed by Cork County Council and TIl is currently reviewing this.  The project appraisal plan was approved by my Department early this year and TII allocated &euro;100,000 to Cork County Council to progress this pre-appraisal work during 2020.  This work on early planning and design will continue in 2021 with a preferred route for the bypass extension to be identified.  The timeframe for the delivery of any major or minor works projects that require statutory approval, whether for an environmental impact assessment report or a compulsory purchase order, or both, is between eight and 13 years.<\/p><p>In the context of the national roads programme capital budget provided by the Department of Transport to TIl, significant funding has been provided towards the improvement of the N71 in Cork since 1994, with funding of approximately &euro;2 million provided in 2020 for various improvements on the N71 route.  Previous investment includes major improvement schemes such as the Skibbereen and Bandon bypasses; pavement and minor scheme works; safety schemes; and planning and design for further upcoming schemes.  This is a good opportunity to highlight that all projects, including those listed in the NDP or any revision of the NDP, require statutory approval and compliance with the public spending code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#KK00500","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response to this very important issue for the people of west Cork.

It is pretty horrific that anyone would be frightened, particularly within an intimate relationship and within the confines of their own home.  However, I am glad that the issue of domestic violence is now out in the open, that it can be discussed openly, that it is high up on all of our political agendas and that we have cross-party agreement on it.  It has been broken as a taboo subject.  The stereotyping of victims and perpetrators has been broken insofar as domestic violence is across all sectors of society.  There is no particular profile that signals someone is either a perpetrator or a victim.  From that point of view, that is all good and perhaps will create a context and encourage victims to come forward.  I would encourage that.<\/p><p>The report, Tracking the Shadow Pandemic - The Story from March to August 2020, published by Safe Ireland, has some stark figures.  I will boringly read some of them into the record of the House because we need to pause and take them on board.  In a six-month period we had 3,450 women and 589 children contact the domestic violence services for the very first time.  On average, we had 1,970 women and 411 children receive support every month.  Nearly 34,000 helpline calls were answered, which is an average of 184 calls per day.  On average, 191 women and 288 children were living in domestic violence accommodation each month.  Quite frighteningly, 1,351 requests for refuge could not be met due to a lack of space.  The consequences of that lack of space was quite frightening and horrific for them.<\/p><p>The services have worked tirelessly and ceaselessly to find accommodation within the community.  The numbers looking for support increased again month on month.  July and August were the busiest months, which is surprising because even though circumstances were a little bit more relieved for all of our living and moving around, the figures still increased.  The services have been extraordinary throughout the pandemic in that they adapted to the lockdown overnight.  The statistics on that are that 33,624 phone support sessions were held, which is extraordinary.  There were 575 video support sessions, 8,300 in-person support sessions, 2,000 helpline emails, 3,500 texts and more than 1,000 online chat messages.  That focuses on women and children.  However, I am always very mindful of men who are in domestic violence situations.  Over the course of the numbers of years I have worked and been around this area, I have been very mindful of the particular vulnerabilities and difficulties of men in domestic violence situations.  I am mindful also that we do not have the figures for the second lockdown and how difficult that must have been.<\/p><p>As we approach Christmas every year, we run campaigns asking people to contact services and pointing out there are supports in place for people experiencing domestic violence because while on the one hand we are talking about families getting together for Christmas and everything that goes with that, at the same time we are also mindful of the violence that accompanies Christmas and the horror that is in some homes.<\/p><p>I worked as a counselling psychologist for a number of years before coming the Bar and counselled both victims and perpetrators.  I had one incident in a counselling room in a reflective counselling session where, appropriately within the context, I needed to challenge a particular matter and he instantly lost it.  I got the tiniest insight into how frightening it must be.  In that moment I was locked into a counselling room but that was not my husband, partner, the father of my children or the home I was obliged to live in.  I can only imagine and shudder to think of what it must be like for people coming up to Christmas.<\/p><p>It is in that context that I want to raise with the Minister an organisation called Saoirse.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Its acting CEO is my party colleague and a great champion of women's rights, Ellen O'Malley Dunlop.

Saoirse runs a 24-hour helpline and its refuge is staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  It has day caller services, does court accompaniment and has therapeutic rooms.  It provides the most amazing service.  I commend it as a service whose work I am particularly familiar with.  I commend it on the hard work it has done.<\/p><p>The Minister lobbied for and secured the increased funding.  We just need clarification for all the services under Safe Ireland.

I welcome the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and thank him for coming before the House.  This is a really important issue.  All the issues we talk about in this House are important, but the issue of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and abuse is so insidious and corrosive.  When I stop to think about the individuals affected, the victims, I think they must be in the loneliest place in the world.  They can be in a busy shop or out and about, but how they must feel and how they must get through every day.  It is therefore really important that this House discusses the issue at length.<\/p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney talked about the recent report published by Safe Ireland.  It compiled statistics from the first six months of the Covid-19 lockdown.  The report highlights the enormous increase in the incidence of domestic violence, with more than 4,000 women and children referred.  They were not repeat referrals; they were new referrals over that period.  There were 34,000 calls to helplines in the same period.  That is almost 200 calls every single day.  I think Senator Seery Kearney mentioned the fact that there were more than 1,300 requests for accommodation, but how many were not responded to?<\/p> <p>The DPP has said there has been an 87% increase in the number of files relating to domestic violence referred to her office.  In my constituency, Dublin Central, the chief superintendent for DMR North reported at our most recent joint policing committee a 100% increase in the number of reports of domestic violence.  Women's Aid has been running a campaign to reach out to women who are vulnerable, who are victims and who are alone.  It is really depressing.  Women's Aid has issued statistics that indicate that one in five young women in Ireland has suffered intimate relationship abuse, one in six young women in Ireland has suffered coercive control, and 51% of young women affected experienced that abuse when they were less than 18 years of age.  These are young women whose fundamental sense of themselves and their self-confidence is being attacked.  One in two of these young women who have been abused experienced the abuse online.  That is on their phones, which are in their pockets and with them all the time.

It is how they contact the rest of their network.  It is how they are contacted for work and how they conduct their daily life.  However, abusers are using it to insidiously control and destroy other people's lives.<\/p><p>We had the big media story about the 140,000 intimate images released online.  I cannot imagine what the poor victims went through and what it did to their sense of self.  That is a real invasion and abuse.  It is great that the Minister is here to talk about it.  The Government has an important role to play and it is taking some actions.  All the NGOs and those who give of their time voluntarily are to be applauded and supported.  While I know the Government has allocated more than &euro;6 million in the budget to tackle domestic abuse and support victims, Safe Ireland still has questions over what funding it will be able to access.  Arising from this debate, I would like it to have clarity on the funding it will get.  I understand the funding will come from both the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.<\/p><p>It is important that other commitments in the programme for Government, including a commitment to a third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, are delivered quickly.  We need to plan for the refuge space.  There have been 1,300 requests for accommodation but seven requests every day could not be met.  That means seven distressed individuals were left in a really threatening situation.  I welcome that the Government has a plan for additional refuge space.  I would like to know the timeframe for delivering that.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister in his reply to speak about the commitment for paid leave and social protection for victims of domestic abuse.  We need to update the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  If necessary to help advance it, it could be initiated in the Seanad.  I welcome the Government's commitment to criminalise image-based sexual abuse and I hope the legislation will be introduced quickly.  I would like to see the Government implement the recommendations of the O'Malley report.<\/p><p>While I know it is not directly in the Minister's remit, I ask him in his capacity as a member of Government to take this up with the Minister for Health.  The Rotunda Hospital in Parnell Square is known as the world's oldest and largest maternity hospital.  It also has a sexual trauma unit.  It is desperately overcrowded and its built facilities need upgrading.  It has an outstanding request and needs about &euro;2.5 million next year to upgrade the facilities on the west side of the campus.  I would appreciate if the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth could speak to the Minister for Health on the issue.

We have had a number of statements on the issue.  I will try not to repeat what my colleagues have said and focus on an area that has not been addressed adequately for a number of years, which is the issue of housing and accommodation for victims of domestic violence.  Refuge spaces are wholly inadequate, but a few small changes in local authority systems could make an enormous difference.  A woman who owns a house along with her husband or partner and is a victim of domestic violence is considered to be adequately housed because she has a share in that house.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Getting access to a local authority housing list is very difficult in that situation.  Another issue is that people may not want to live in the same administrative area as their abuser and partner.  It is very difficult to switch between local authority lists.  Somebody in Dublin might want to move back to his or her family in Sligo.  Switching between those lists is very difficult.  If one has been on a local authority housing list for seven, ten or 12 years, one will lose one's place if one switches lists.  The issues keeping people in those situations are financial and emotional.  That sense of safety and home is also involved.  One might feel that one is safer if one has a roof over one's head, even if one is not.  That has been brought into focus by this issue.<\/p><p>I also ask the Minister to address the issue of going after damages.  One of my childhood friends was a victim of very serious domestic violence at the hands of a man with whom she had previously been in a relationship.  I am speaking about her here as she has been very vocal publicly about the matter.  She came home one Christmas and he was waiting for her.  He had jumped in a taxi.  He broke her face in two places.  She thought she was not going to survive the assault.  This woman's name is Jessica Bowes.  One of the things she has done with her barrister is to bring this man through the courts to try to get damages.  Despite the fact that he owns two houses, she does not have access to that money.  She has three children, two of which she had with that man, but the courts system has failed her on both a criminal and civil level.<\/p><p>Will the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, give consideration to a domestic violence housing strategy?  Senator Fitzpatrick and I were on Dublin City Council when Councillor Noeleen Reilly brought together a working group on that issue.  I had initially tried to do so in 2009 but we hit too many barriers in our attempts to co-ordinate local authorities across the country.  This is a real long-term need for people who are fleeing such situations.  We ask that people be in immediate crisis rather than addressing their long-term needs, including housing needs, thereby keeping them in homes that are not safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#TT00200","speaker":"1672","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and for his personal commitment to addressing these issues.  I agree very strongly with Senator Moynihan that there are quite a number of issues in respect of housing which have not been fully teased out during debates on this matter.  These issues do not affect only those on council housing lists.  Situations often arise in which the relationship between a couple that has a mortgage breaks down, possibly as a result of abuse, which may be physical but may also be emotional.  The difficulty is that when the parties separate and one goes to the local authority to seek a place on the housing list, he or she is considered to have income coming from the sale of the house.  The circumstances involved can be very difficult.  While, in many ways, local authorities can try to be as sympathetic as possible, part of the difficulty is that such people are caught by the rules in respect of income limits and so on.  I echo many of the concerns Senator Moynihan raised in respect of the housing issue.<\/p> <p>The legislation with regard to online harassment is moving forward.  Cyberbullying is often tied to some of the challenges we are discussing today.  I strongly support continued efforts to implement Coco's law.

It is horrific that something so intimate could be shared widely.  I was struck by the story of R&oacute;is&iacute;n Nic Lochlainn, a student at the National University of Ireland, Galway.  She spoke with Joe Duffy on \"Liveline\", as the Minister might recall, about her experience of being filmed in an intimate situation when she was 17 and the trauma the sharing of this video caused her.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As Senator Fitzpatrick said, I think of the impact something like that has at any age, but in particular that age.  As legislators, we often speak in a very abstract way.  We talk about the numbers and those impacted, but let us try to imagine ourselves at that age and the impact that it has, in particular now that there is so much pressure to be liked by one's peers, especially on social media.  To be honest, we can all imagine how frightening it would be if social media were around when we did things in our teens and 20s.  We must look at it that way, and to allow children and young people to be children and young people safely.  That must be at the heart of what we do.<\/p><p>I wish to raise one final issue which has not been referred to, that is, the question of parental alienation.  Relationships can break down, but it becomes a problem when children are weaponised.  I refer to the psychological manipulation of a child by one or other parent.  This can sometimes take very subtle forms.  I appreciate that there are enormous legal difficulties proving it.  There is an impact on the child and there is also an impact on the relationship of the mother or father with the child.  We need to look at some way to have regard in both the civil and criminal legislation to situations whereby concerted efforts are made to alienate children by one parent against the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#UU00200","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators for their contributions today.

Given the difference in gender representation between the Upper and Lower Houses, it is appropriate to mention that with 40% women in this House it is a topic that is very important to us.

As Senators are aware, there was a similar debate in the D&aacute;il a couple of weeks ago at which I spoke.  It is great to see the need to extend the time for this debate because of the degree of interest among Senators.  No matter what our political differences may be, I think we all agree that domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a scourge that must be eliminated from society, and that those who have been the victims of this sort of violence deserve our compassion and support.<\/p> <p>We had several very powerful contributions from Senators today, reflecting their own engagement with constituents and friends on the issue.  I thank them for sharing those stories.  It is important to note that the programme for Government called out the fact that we have an epidemic of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in this country.  It did not shy away from the reality that has been shied away from for too long.  Since taking on this role, I met with many stakeholders and front-line services.  I have expressed my own commitment to what we can do in that regard.  It has been instructive for me to meet with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and Women's Aid.  I have not met with Saoirse yet, but I know the work it does and I am happy to meet with it.  Reference was made to men who are victims of violence.  Early in the new year I will meet with Men's Aid as well.  I am in regular contact with Safe Ireland as a lead organisation and I have a strong relationship with it.<\/p> <p>Last Friday, I had the opportunity to launch the 2019 report for Sonas.  It is another significant NGO in this area, which runs the refuge at the other end of Blanchardstown village where I live.  I had a very important conversation with the staff there.  We focused on the issues raised by Senator Moynihan about accommodation and housing.  I also had an opportunity to sit down with a client for about half and hour and she took me through her journey of the mainly coercive control at home to her decision to leave, to engagement with the emergency services, the front-line services and the courts.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was instructive to be taken slowly through her entire experience with just two of us in the room, and to get an insight into the very real barriers that exist for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence trying to leave their particular circumstances.  <\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, Tusla falls within the remit of my Department, and it has a statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic violence.  As part of its work, Tusla supports some 60 organisations nationwide and operates a range of services.  In 2020, my Department provided &euro;25.3 million to Tusla for services, and an additional &euro;2 million in Covid contingency funds.  This year I was delighted to be able to announce a significant increase in that, so in 2021, there will be &euro;28 million in core funding available, which constitutes an increase of &euro;2.7 million, and an additional &euro;2 million in Covid contingency funding will also be available.  Therefore, in 2021, &euro;30 million will be provided to support these services, which is an increase of &euro;4.7 million on the original 2020 figure, and that is significant.  Looking at what was spent on domestic violence back in 2016, which is only four years ago, we will be doubling that spend in 2021, and that is important.  <\/p><p>As regards additional accommodation, two new refuges have been opened this year, one in south Dublin and one in Galway, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provided the capital funding to support the opening of these refuges, with the day-to-day services being provided by Tusla.  Tusla funds a range of specialist counselling services across the country, the 16 rape crisis centres nationwide, and it has expanded its range of services and now provides outreach services for domestic violence victims who may not have a service local to them.  Tusla also supports services for children who have also been affected by domestic, sexual and gender-based violence through the provision of childcare supports in refuges across the country and the expansion of therapeutic support programmes.  I think particular reference should be made to the Barnahus, Onehouse Galway pilot project which has a child-centred approach, and provides health, medical, therapeutic and policing services for children and young people in cases of suspected sexual abuse.  It is a model of good practice that we are supporting.  This pilot programme is in operation in Galway at the moment but we are looking to expand the services to Cork and Dublin.  The experience learned from the pilot will be used to inform future planning and service design, and a national agency steering group will be established as a priority to move the project forward.<\/p><p>Domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a multifaceted problem and many arms of the State are required to work together effectively to address it.  Therefore, it is not just an issue for my Department and Tusla; rather, it is a cross-Government and cross-State issue.  That is why one of the key points we included in the programme for Government was the need for an audit of how responsibility for policy and services is actually aligned, because as a number of people have mentioned, including Senator Moynihan, there are gaps and there are many bodies trying to complete bits and pieces of the puzzle of work.  This is particularly true in respect of housing, which is something that we have discussed with Sonas.  There is the issue that while my Department funds the day-to-day running of refuges, the capital comes from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and from local authorities, which requires the local authorities to be \"up for it\", so to speak, and for the Department of housing to be aligned.  There are many players in this area, and without implying that there are bad intentions at play, the multiplicity of players causes difficulties and delays.  We are trying to tackle this issue through the audit, so we can determine who does what, and who actually should be doing what.  That audit is currently out for tender, and we hope that we are in a position to bring forward the results of the audit and implement them early next year.  I am working closely with the Minister for Justice on the project.  Likewise, Tusla, which is within my Department, is looking at the review of accommodation at the moment, and that is particularly important, because we are all aware of the lack of accommodation across the country.  We must highlight that issue, not on an anecdotal basis, but on the basis of detailed study and a needs analysis being completed countrywide.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The result of that Tusla accommodation review will be available in April next year.  I will be acting on that, as will other Departments.<\/p><p>All Departments and agencies will play a role in Supporting a Victim's Journey.  This is a plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases, which arose from the O'Malley report published earlier this year.  This plan is led by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Department of Justice, but it includes commitments from across Government agencies and Departments.  One of the commitments that arose is for my Department and Tusla to work with the Department of Justice and the Department of Health to complete a mapping exercise, which is linked into the nature of the spread and the level of services that may be encompassed by the implementation plan.  Stakeholders within the sector will be consulted.  This process should get under way shortly.  I look forward to seeing the outcome of this work across Government.  We know that Government is stronger when we are working together to address this particular issue.<\/p><p>As alluded to earlier, this evening in the D&aacute;il we will debate a Private Members' Bill from Sinn F&eacute;in on leave entitlement for victims of domestic violence.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss this as it is in line with the commitment contained within the programme for Government.  I look forward to being able to make announcements on behalf of the Government.  We discussed at Cabinet today the steps towards the provision of paid leave for domestic violence survivors.  That will be an important step.<\/p><p>I am aware of the publicity in recent weeks regarding reported increases in the incidence of domestic violence during the pandemic.  This is coming through all sources including the Garda, the Courts Service, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the front-line services in the NGO community.<\/p><p>We have discussed here the issues that are part of a continuum of violence where the lives of others are devalued and belittled by their abuser.  Whether this is done by emotional, physical or sexual abuse, and whether it is done in person or online, none of it is acceptable.  It is important that we continue to learn about the range of offences that take can place and, crucially, their impact.  I have engaged with Tusla, the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services, and with representative bodies since I have started in this office, and I will continue to do so.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to doing all it can to tackle the problem of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It affects all of society.  We know of the consequences it can have for survivors.  We know it is not acceptable anymore.  The programme for Government sets out clear actions that are now being taken.  Again, it is a matter for all of us working together to end the scourge of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#VV00300","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I will focus on the main initiatives included in the Bill.<\/p><p>Climate change is another issue which might be seen as a future threat, but it is one which we must address now.  In line with the programme for Government commitment, carbon tax is being increased in the budget by &euro;7.50 from &euro;26 to &euro;33.50 per tonne of CO2 emissions.  This increase applied to auto fuels from budget night and will apply to all other fuels from 1 May 2021.  The additional revenue raised will be used to fund public expenditure measures to meet the goals set out in the programme for Government.  The Bill also makes provision for the transition of our carbon dioxide-based vehicle registration and motor tax regimes to the new, more robust worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure emissions test from January of next year.  As a result, our vehicle registration tax, VRT, regime will be based on emissions performance levels which are much closer to performance levels in the real world than is currently the case.  Further measures include the extension of the nitrous oxide, NOx, emissions regime and the accelerated scheme of capital allowances for energy-efficient equipment.<\/p><p>Covid-19 is a present and future threat and challenge and I am confident that we will see our way past it.  Last week, we saw the lifting of some of the restrictions regarding Covid, notably with the reopening of non-essential retail and services, hospitality and places of worship.  Later in the month, we will see a further easing, including easing of some travel restrictions which will allow us to enjoy a Christmas closer to what we would normally have, but still short of what we would like.<\/p><p>The Government has taken action to ensure that the worst impacts of Covid are mitigated and that the economy is in a position to recover from the periods of restricted trade and forced closures as quickly and easily as possible.  It is fair to say that the smooth reopening of non-essential retail and services was greatly facilitated by the supports the Government put in place, including the restart, restart plus and restart top-up grants, the Covid restrictions support scheme and the other supports in the form of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  These are all parts of the broader range of supports put in place both at national and sectoral levels to help us through the pandemic.<\/p><p>The Government recognises that economic health and public health are intertwined and that the better our public health, the stronger our economic health will be.  Therefore the Government's action has rightly been substantial and extensive.  For example, as at 3 December, 41,200 employers were registered with Revenue for the EWSS.  A total of &euro;1,022 million has been paid out to 39,000 employers covering 420,800 employees.  As of 4 December, 351,400 of those whose income from employment has been affected due to Covid-19 were being facilitated through the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.<\/p><p>It is important to recognise that the EWSS is a bridge between regular employment and the PUP so the effectiveness of Government supports, including the EWSS, should not only be considered by reference to the level of uptake of EWSS by employers but also by reference to the numbers of people who continue to rely solely on the PUP.  Some 75,100 employees in the EWSS in October have made PUP claims in November.<\/p><p>I would like to specifically refer to the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  The CRSS provides support for businesses that are forced to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level because of Covid restrictions that either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers of the business from accessing the premises in which the business is carried on.  The scheme generally operates when level 3 restrictions or higher are in place and ceases when restrictions are lifted.<\/p><p>As of this morning, 14,000 businesses have registered 16,000 premises for the CRSS with Revenue.  A further 2,800 registrations are currently at applicant registration stage.  Claims for CRSS payments of &euro;92.7 million for 16,600 premises have been made to date and &euro;91.4 million of this has already been processed for payment.  Section 11 of the Finance Bill provides for the CRSS and has been significantly improved during its passage through the D&aacute;il.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Sean Fleming:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Qualifying businesses can apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a cash payment in respect of an advance credit for trading expenses for the period of the restrictions.  This payment will be equal to 10% of those businesses' average weekly turnover in 2019, up to &euro;20,000, and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000, for each week that those businesses are affected by Covid restrictions.  To qualify under the scheme, a business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the business in the period for which the restrictions are in operation, and for which a claim is made, will be no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019, or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business, multiplied by the number of weeks in the period for which a claim is made.  As restrictions are eased and a business is no longer required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing its premises, it will then no longer qualify for CRSS.<\/p><p>One of the amendments to the Bill, as initiated, provides for an additional restart week, which will be payable to businesses on reopening.  This recognises that businesses may take some time to reopen once the restrictions are lifted.  Businesses may also incur additional costs in the form of physical adaptation of premises to ensure social distancing, getting in fresh stock or supplies and the provision of personal protective equipment, PPE, as they reopen.  Another change was the inclusion of an appeal mechanism for businesses refused the CRSS.  The scheme will operate from 13 October 2020 to 31 March 2021, and there is provision for the Minister for Finance to vary aspects of the scheme by ministerial order.  Registration for affected businesses has been open since 1 November, and claims have been accepted by Revenue since 17 November.  Payments issue within two to three days of valid claims being processed.<\/p><p>The Government also recently announced the provision of an additional seasonal payment of up to double the level of CRSS support, subject to a statutory maximum of &euro;5,000 per week.  This will be payable to businesses which cannot reopen through December due to extended restrictions, such as pubs that do not serve food.  This additional payment will be paid for the weeks beginning 21 December 2020, 28 December 2020 and 4 January 2021.  This is in recognition of the additional financial impact on those businesses of being closed at Christmas, which for many would have been a particularly busy trading period.<\/p><p>As I said, the Finance Bill provides the legislative basis for the budget.  Tax measures announced on budget day included an expansion of the tax warehousing provisions to include the balance of 2019 income tax and 2020 preliminary tax obligations for self-assessed taxpayers whose income has been adversely affected by Covid restrictions, as well as the excess temporary wage subsidy scheme payments received by an employer which are due to be repaid to Revenue.  There were no broad changes to income tax in the budget, but the Bill makes provision for specific announcements, such as equalising the earned income credit, with the PAYE credit by raising it by &euro;150 to &euro;1,650, and increasing the dependant relative tax credit from &euro;70 to &euro;245.  This will ensure that the salary of a full-time worker on the top rate will remain outside the universal social charge, USC.  <\/p><p>It is important to draw attention to something not in the budget or the Finance Bill, that is, there is no change to the rate of corporation tax.  The Minister reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the 12.5% rate of corporation tax and our continued commitment to a corporate tax regime that supports economic activity and that is transparent, sustainable and legitimate.<\/p><p>A range of other vital measures are included in the Bill to support businesses across the economy.  These are targeted at the agricultural, tourism, film, housing and start-up sectors.  The Bill also provides for the announced temporary reduction of the VAT rate for the hospitality and tourism sectors from 13.5% to 9%, with effect from 1 November.  This rate applies to catering and restaurant services, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres, museums, historic houses, open farms, amusement parks, certain printed matter and hairdressing.  Many of these businesses will be reopening with the easing of restrictions and will see the benefit of the VAT rate reduction.  Noteworthy also is the introduction during the passage of the Bill of accelerated capital allowances for farm safety equipment, with particular emphasis on supporting those who have suffered life-changing injuries as a result of incidents on farms.  This underlines the priority afforded to the issue of farm safety in the Government's programme.<\/p><p>We are going through extremely difficult and challenging times, but we are equipped to get through them because of the strong position we were in when we entered these difficult times.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Sean Fleming:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We face further challenges ahead, but I am confident we will overcome them.  The Finance Bill always contains difficult choices between what people would like and what it is prudent to do, and we must remember that borrowings must eventually be repaid.  It is right that we take advantage of our ability to borrow at low rates, but we must do so judiciously.  We are beginning to see the start of the end of this traumatic time and our way to the resumption of normality next year.  This will be in no small part due to the actions of the Government, including those in this Finance Bill.  I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#JJJ00300","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House, and I promise I will not mention the VAT refund scheme today.  I will leave him alone on that issue.  The economy is going through a turbulent time, with the two most dramatic impacts which none of us probably ever believed we would be dealing with, namely, Brexit and Covid-19.  These impacts have disproportionate effects on different elements of the economy.  Equally, some sectors of the economy are doing exceptionally well during this time, and that must be acknowledged also.  This budget, however, is framed against the backdrop of Covid-19 and its impact.  I must acknowledge the support, and the certainty of that support, which has been given by the Government to businesses to try to sustain them and allow them to stay open.  Direct support was provided through the CRSS, the EWSS, the restart grants, the commercial rates waiver scheme, access to cheap money, the PUP, etc.  I will come back to some of these aspects and address them later.  There has also been significant support provided through indirect funding from other State agencies.<\/p> <p>When Covid-19 arrived, people in business had all sorts of plans which were affected, especially in my sector, in the short term.  We all hoped it might be another seasonal thing which would hit us for two or three months and then we could get out of it.  That has not been the case, however.  It has now almost become a long-term crisis, and my greatest concern now lies in the long-term impact this situation is having on the financial viability of businesses, specifically smaller businesses.  I have some issues regarding the future.  Most of these businesses are probably operating weekly losses.  Those businesses had probably calculated these weekly losses based on a period of something like eight weeks, but that has now extended to 30 or 35 weeks and they are not 100% sure where this is going to end.<\/p> <p>Without the EWSS and the CRSS, businesses would be closed now.  I do not deny that.  I must also acknowledge the efficiency with which the payments are being received by businesses.  I do not have exact figures, and it would be nice to get an analysis of them, regarding the warehousing of our taxes, specifically concerning how much is being used by businesses and how often.  I ask that because businesses operating weekly losses are relying on that mechanism more and more to lodge their debt and allow them to keep going from week to week.  The problem, however, is that that debt still exists.  Once September arrives next year, there will be a call on that debt and there will then be a charge of 3% on that debt any time after its non-payment.  Are we, then, just transferring the viability of businesses from today to next September, possibly, because of these weekly cumulative losses that businesses are sustaining?  <\/p> <p>I have some reservations, therefore, concerning where businesses will find themselves in September 2021.  As a business person, I appreciate the supports which have been provided.  I spoke previously about how vitally important the CRSS was, but I have a level of frustration in that regard as well.  It was not quite portrayed as something which would be the salvation of businesses, but certainly as a huge support.  However, the CRSS continues to get more complex and complicated.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pat Casey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It depends of the level of turnover being less than 30%.  I have issues with cliff-edge support schemes, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, where an employer going over 70% turnover loses it completely and going over 30% results in the loss of CRSS completely.  There is no harmonisation or transition period to gradually adjust.  If I am in business now, I need to keep under 30% or under 70% so that I get the payments and can keep the business afloat.  I do not know what happens after that.<\/p><p>Employers qualify for CRSS under level 3.  Government tweaks allow hotels to bring guests into the restaurant.  A small business might have been getting a subsidy of &euro;1,000, &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 and all of a sudden that is lost because just one element of its business has been reopened under level 3 which was not open under the previous level 3 but yet it is based on restricted capacity.  All restaurants are operating at 50% or less of their capacity.  Even though access to the premises is not being restricted, the business is being restricted in the level of turnover compared with normal times.  We should consider tweaking CRSS to address this issue.  I am more concerned about the collective losses businesses are sustaining that we have not seen yet.  Many businesses are parking their debt until a future date.<\/p><p>The accelerated capital allowance for farm safety equipment is very welcome.<\/p><p>I understand where the Government is coming from.  Equally the Government needs to understand the frustration for struggling businesses.  Opening, closing, hiring staff, letting staff go and trying to find staff again especially at Christmas time are all having a direct impact on businesses which are trying to sustain themselves.  I look forward to Committee Stage where we can go over all this again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#MMM00200","speaker":"1640","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  The debate on the Finance Bill is a very important annual process.  Last Christmas we had balanced books, near full employment and obviously success on Brexit.  This Christmas the landscape unfortunately is quite different.  We are running a deficit.  We have unemployment officially of 7% but if all those on the pandemic unemployment payment are included, it could be up to 20%.  We are also in a make-or-break week on Brexit.  Whether there is a deal or no deal, Brexit will have an impact on our fundamentals for a number of years.  If there is no deal, it could have an impact for a long period of time.  We are in a weaker position now <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>a year ago because of the Covid challenge that all economies, including ours, are facing.<\/p><p>The State agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, have been preparing for Brexit and are supporting businesses by encouraging them to diversify markets, and avail of online trading vouchers and schemes.  The July stimulus scheme and the budget increases for those organisations have been very positive.  The investment in our ports to ensure we have alternatives to the land bridge through Britain is also very important.  There could be an impact on getting raw materials and exporting goods from Ireland.  Thankfully due to Government stewardship over many years, lenders have the confidence to lend to Ireland to get us over the challenges of Covid.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One can imagine where we would be if we had defaulted and not repaid our debts.<\/p><p>I welcome the commitment in the Finance Bill to retain the section 481 reliefs.  The film sector is very important.  Our technical ability, our language and the scenery here make Ireland an attractive place in which to make films.  These tax incentives are an added bonus.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the commitment to increase carbon tax as a method to change behaviour.  This is a commitment the majority of political parties made before the general election and have made for a number of years.  However, I have often asked the Minister for Transport about alternatives to cars in certain parts of Ireland if we keep increasing carbon tax.  There are alternatives in Dublin.  There are plans in Galway and other cities for greenways and commuting.  However, will more rural areas really have a bus that passes by people's door in Cleggan, Claddaghduff, Tully or Tullycross every 15 or 20 minutes?  Without such a service, how can we reduce the reliance on cars in rural areas?  I am particularly concerned about the issue and as we continue to increase carbon tax, it is a challenge we need to face.<\/p><p>I welcome the reiteration of the commitment to the 12.5% rate of corporation tax the Minister mentioned in his budget speech in the D&aacute;il.  It is disappointing that some commentaries refer to Ireland as not being transparent on our corporation tax.  Foreign direct investment, FDI, corporations are very important to employment, PRSI and rates for local authorities.  As people paying tax like to know that all companies are also paying, we can understand why this issue is continually raised.  The contribution of FDI to the tax take is important in any year and more so in 2020 because of the impact of Covid on other sectors of the economy.<\/p><p>I welcome the range of supports provided to businesses, the pandemic unemployment payment, the employment wage subsidy scheme and the CRSS.  Certain businesses have expressed concerns over the CRSS, including supply chain businesses.  For example, wholesalers supplying the pub trade have been unable to sell because pubs were closed for a period.  They are not included in the CRSS because they are not regarded as a bricks and mortar-type businesses and do not have a front door through which customers come in.  However, they are supplying to businesses that have that front door.  That aspect of the CRSS needs to be reviewed.<\/p><p>While again not being bricks and mortar, betting pitches are permanent positions individually purchased at racecourses.  They are bought and sold similar to real estate, but bookmakers have received no supports over the past year.  A relatively small number of people are involved.  They have no package of reliefs and are not eligible for the CRSS.  The on-course betting sector has been decimated this year.<\/p><p>On section 17, I join Senator Casey in welcoming the farm safety and disability adaptation equipment scheme.  Farms are dangerous places owing to equipment, livestock and farmers being outdoors in all weathers with the hazards of slips and falls, etc.  Unfortunately, fatalities are all too common.  I commend the Minister of State with responsibility for farm safety, Deputy Heydon, on his involvement in championing this scheme.  It provides capital allowances for equipment to prevent accidents and also helps get people back to work after accidents.  Obviously, the severity of accidents varies, but people ending up in a wheelchair may still want and need to carry on their farming businesses.  I welcome the scheme that has been put in place and commend all who were involved in it.<\/p><p>Section 36 deals with the primary medical certificate for the disabled drivers and passengers scheme, an issue that was taken to the Supreme Court in the summer.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is one of the issues that affect people who, all of a sudden, found they were not able to proceed because the scheme was in limbo.  This change will allow the maintenance of a <i>status quo<\/i>in the scheme for a period.  That is to be welcomed because all Members, as politicians, have come across cases of people who have applied for a medical certificate on their own behalf or that of a child with a disability.  It is certainly welcome that that has been looked after, albeit in the short term while there is a review.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the provisions of section 39 relating to the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector.  Some people may point out that 9% of zero is zero, but it is a reduction in the rate in the course of what has been a tremendously difficult year for many businesses in the hospitality sector across the country.  Small businesses rely on seasonal trade from tourism, good weather and people going to some of the most rural parts of the country to spend a few euro.  Those businesses are vital to local economies, as well as to rural and urban Ireland.  It is to be hoped that this measure will have a positive impact in terms of keeping the doors open and the lights on for 2021, when we hope the vaccine will be available and we can get back to business again.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.

I am standing in for my colleague, Senator Sherlock, who cannot be here.  I promise that I will not mention the VAT rebate scheme, although the Labour Party was disappointed that the Government amended the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020 earlier today.<\/p> <p>Of course, the Finance Bill is an annual occurrence but, as previous speakers stated, its edition this year is set in a very different context as we face the unprecedented twin challenges of Covid and Brexit.  I am conscious, as are all Senators, of the knife-edge status of the Brexit talks today.  The Bill is very wide-ranging, but it must be read in the context of those challenges, given the serious upheaval of the past ten months.  I wish to touch on three specific elements of particular concern to the Labour Party, namely, the taxation of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, housing policy and low pay more generally.<\/p> <p>First, I wish to acknowledge on behalf of my party that the early decisions made at the start of the pandemic by the then Government to provide income support to workers on a massive scale and to provide the sort of supports that have been spoken about and debated in this House over the past ten months were clearly instrumental in staving off even worse job losses and in keeping firms and businesses afloat.  The House has heard very eloquent discussion already this afternoon on the importance of those supports to business.  I think all Members should acknowledge the tremendous efforts made by people across Ireland to keep transmission levels down and to keep our society going.  There have been unprecedented levels of support for social cohesion and community solidarity which have been so important, much more important than any criminal justice measures could be, in keeping Covid rates down and public health to the forefront.  If there is any positive political message from the past ten months, it is that we have seen immense value being placed on public services such as health, education, welfare, as well as the value of social solidarity in itself.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>In that context, the decision to create the PUP is very welcome, but I wish to turn to the concern of the Labour Party regarding the belated attempt to retroactively apply income tax to the PUP as provided for in section 3 of the Bill.  I know we will be able to debate this issue in greater depth on Committee Stage on Friday and I understand that the Minister of State contests the assertion that the provisions of section 3 are not retrospective, but it is difficult to interpret section 3 as having any other meaning.  The Bill states that section 3 \"shall be deemed to have come into operation on and from 13 March 2020\".  I have before me a letter sent by Ms Eilis Barry, chief executive of Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and dated 4 December.  The letter highlights her concern that there is a direct contradiction between the Bill and the provisions of the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 which set out that PUP is payable as supplementary welfare allowance, an allowance specifically set out as being exempt from income tax.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->FLAC has raised concerns regarding this apparently retrospective application and has asked to meet the Minister to discuss these matters further.  I raise this issue with the Minister of State to ask that the Government not pursue a retrospective application of income tax on a welfare payment as such a move would be likely to provoke additional anxiety for the many, many people who are already struggling due to the extent of closures and, indeed, the accumulated stress of ten months spent in and out of lockdown.  I was very moved by the description of the stress on business owners of being in and out of lockdown, the imposition of restrictions, the uncertainty around when restrictions would be lifted and the extent to which businesses could open.  I am conscious that even those businesses that have been able to open are operating at reduced capacity and, therefore, will have immense difficulty in making ends meet.  The last thing people need now is an additional hit to their finances.<\/p><p>The Labour Party has concerns about the distributional impact of this retrospective taxing of state supports and the capacity of workers, particularly low-paid workers and young workers, to repay.  We should not forget that 84% of people in the arts, entertainment, events and recreation sectors who were in receipt of the PUP in May remain in receipt of it right now.  It is clear that these sectors, along with the hospitality sector, were significantly hit and remain deeply impacted.  I and my Labour Party colleagues have met many of those who were working or running businesses in those sectors and remain very stressed and anxious about their prospects.  I am conscious that there are anomalies.  For example, theatres and live drama are still not open even though cinemas are open.  There are many whose livelihoods have been badly hit as a result.  In the accommodation and food service sectors, 78.8% of those who were in receipt of the PUP in May remain in receipt of it right now.  Those under the age of 25 are the most likely to be in receipt of the PUP.  These are people who, through no fault of their own, have been without steady work for so much of this year.  This measure seems to set a strange new precedent and the Labour Party is very concerned about it, particularly in light of the number of people affected disproportionately in the sectors I mentioned.<\/p><p>In summary, given the fact that in spring and summer people had no reliable information on the tax status of the PUP, and given the stated intention of the payment, which the Labour Party acknowledges was to keep people afloat through difficult times which have not yet ended for many workers, we think it would be grossly unfair to take a decision to retrospectively apply income tax to the payment.  I look forward to the response of the Minister of State on that issue.<\/p><p>The second major concern the Labour Party has with the Bill relates to the area of housing policy.  There is strong evidence that the housing market remains dysfunctional.  There have been concerning reports in the media today that it will take years to meet the level of demand for housing.  Subsidies to property developers simply do not work to address the outstanding need for housing.  They categorically do not increase the supply of affordable housing.  However, the Government seems determined to push forward with subsidies to property developers in the Bill.  The Labour Party has serious concerns in particular about the extension of the so-called help-to-buy scheme which may have the unwelcome, unforeseen and perhaps unintended effect of pushing up prices for everyone.  We know that for many years Ireland had one of the highest home-ownership rates in western Europe, but the context is very important in that regard.   We now see a housing market where the prospect of home ownership, particularly for younger people and younger generations, has never seemed more remote.  That is thanks to many years of Government policies aimed at or with the consequence of stimulating demand but which ignored the fundamental problem of supply.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that this is not just a problem of this Government's making.  It is the cumulative effect of years of various housing policies of successive Governments.  The help-to-buy scheme is particularly egregious in this regard.  An independent assessment by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, found that the scheme was poorly targeted and likely to further fuel the growth in house prices.  Research shows that 56% of claims under the scheme were for homes worth more than &euro;300,000 and that 40% of all claims to date have had a loan-to-value ratio of less than 85%.  In other words, one could surmise that the help-to-buy scheme subsidises those who already have their deposit saved, while it is, perhaps, not doing enough to help those who are looking for genuinely affordable homes.  This is a recurring theme as we survey current Government policy, with its economic focus is on propping up demand and supporting spending.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For all that Ministers talk about learning the lessons of a decade ago and of the recession, one might question that assessment given this Bill once again puts funding into solving a problem that does not exist, namely, lack of demand while ignoring the fundamental weakness in our housing market caused and exacerbated by a lack of adequate supply of affordable housing.<br\/><br\/>The final point of concern is the issue of low pay in this country.  The Labour Party strongly believes it was a mistake only to increase the national minimum wage by 10 cent this year and it is a matter of profound regret to us that the Low Pay Commission seems on the point of collapse.  Establishing the commission was a high point of our time in government where we sought to take minimum wage policy out of the realm of day to day political pressure.  What we did not envisage was that the commission would be used to divert from justified wage increases.  We believe the failure to agree a fair increase to the minimum wage at this time is especially worrying considering the broad problem of low pay in our economy due to particular features in our economy, pre-tax income inequalities are among the highest in the OECD, and it is left to our taxation and welfare system, as we all know, to do the heavy lifting in ensuring decent standards of living for a huge number of workers. <i><\/i>OECD data tell us nearly a quarter of Irish workers are getting by on low pay, a figure second only to the massively unequal United States<i>. <\/i>We have an opportunity to close that gap through minimum wage policy.  A 10 cent increase absolutely flies in the face of that, particularly in a pandemic when we had the opportunity to show workers our appreciation for how they have gone above and beyond, particularly workers in front-facing sectors, in food services, retailing and so on.  We believe it was a missed opportunity and that the minimum wage should have been increased further.  It does not seem unreasonable to us to ask that subsidies to the private sector of the very justified supports that were given to those in business through the pandemic would have carried with them basic conditions as to how employees in those sectors are treated, especially in sectors like hospitality where we know that low pay, precarious contracts and low trade union density are endemic problems.  It is not good enough in our view to tell low paid workers that they should be grateful to have their jobs.  As a country we must do better than that.  We think money should be better spent with a much more equitable distribution between workers and employers.<br\/><br\/>We acknowledge the immense work that has gone into supporting businesses and workers through this pandemic but we have serious concerns with three aspects of the Finance Bill, in particular, namely, a lack of sufficient action on low pay, a lack of sufficient action on housing and our concerns about the taxation of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  We have grave doubts that this Finance Bill will deliver for those who most need our support at this difficult time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#PPP00200","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>It is nice to see the Minister of State who is welcome to the House.  The budget came at a time of great challenge for our country, economy and people.  Budget 2021 was primarily a response to that challenge.  Since this pandemic began Sinn F&eacute;in has committed to constructively engage with the previous and current Governments in the best interests of our people while holding the Government to account, as is the job of any Opposition.  Sinn F&eacute;in argued for greater levels of wage subsidy for low income workers in order to protect incomes and enhance the take up of the scheme and argued that administrative changes could be made by Revenue to ensure that women returning from maternity leave would be eligible for the scheme.  These changes came to pass and were welcome.<\/p> <p>In terms of income supports, the employment wage subsidy scheme, in its original iteration, reduced wage supports by up to 50% and excluded a cohort of the lowest paid workers.  It was clear form its announcement in July that it would be insufficient to protect jobs and support businesses when the threat of the virus remained in our communities.  Sinn F&eacute;in was relentless, as the Minister of State will know, in calling for the scheme to be amended with higher levels of wage support for workers and their employers in order to avoid a jobs crisis as public health restrictions inevitably increased.  The same was true regarding the pandemic unemployment payments with the Government having cut the level of payments in previous months for thousands of workers who had lost their jobs as a result of public health restrictions.  <\/p> <p>On 19 October, as the Government announced its decision to move to level 5, these cuts to the pandemic unemployment payment and wage subsidy schemes were reversed, reintroducing a top rate of &euro;350 per week.  This was common sense, a recognition that the previous cuts were ill-judged while the treat of the virus and further restrictions remained.  It was also a vindication of Sinn F&eacute;in with the Government implementing policy decisions that we had been calling for in the previous weeks and months.  We welcomed those policy decisions made by Government.  They were necessary.  <\/p> <p>While many of the workers faced the pandemic unemployment payment, we hear that the banks, one of which the State owns and another which it partly owns, are now refusing a further mortgage moratorium.  I take this opportunity to ask the Minister of State to urgently intervene on this topic.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Banks across Europe, as the Minister of State will know, will be allowed to offer payment breaks on mortgage and personal business loans again after the European Banking Authority revised its stance on the issue.  The Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, however, said last month that Irish banks did not intend to avail of the relaxed rules.  The Minister has the power.  We own one of the banks and we have a stake in another to make that change.  I commend a number of Senator Casey&rsquo;s points in terms of business supports.  In the same way, mortgage holders need those supports.  The simplest way would be to ensure they get a further break from mortgages.  As the Minister of State will acknowledge, many families are still suffering.  <\/p><p>This issue of taxing the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, is bizarre.  While the PUP was put on a statutory footing on 5 August for the five months from its introduction in March, it was not subject to tax as an urgent needs payment.  Section 3 of the Finance Bill 2020 seeks to retrospectively tax a payment which was exempt from tax by law.  Regardless of the amount of tax this would incur, this is an unprecedented move that the Government has failed to justify.  I am unconvinced by any argument the Government has put forward to retrospectively tax a payment that was, by law, exempt from tax for a period of five months.  If the Minister wants to start a retrospective tax system, I can suggest many more areas in which to start rather than taxing the pay of ordinary workers.<\/p><p>I acknowledge there are measures to be welcomed in this Bill, some which are long over due.  Section 9 increases the earned income credit to &euro;1,650, equalising the tax credit for self-employed with that of PAYE workers.  This is a welcome change and long over due, with this commitment having been made more than four years ago by the previous Fine Gael Government.  Section 4 provides for an exemption from income tax for payments made by the HSE to those in receipt of the mobility allowance.  This is a positive move which Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes.  Similarly, the increase in the dependent relative tax credit, provided by section 5, is a welcome development.<\/p><p>The carbon tax provisions in this Bill will, however, have a negative impact on workers and families, with a disproportionate impact on low income, lone parents and rural households.  Sections 26 to 28, inclusive, provide for locked-in increases in the carbon tax every year until 2030.  These provisions will result in a 39% hike in carbon tax next year alone, followed by further increases year on year.  Without affordable alternatives, a carbon tax will not reduce emissions.  At present, alternatives, be they electric vehicles or home retrofitting, are least accessible to low income households.  If households are not able to afford these alternatives, they will simply spend more heating their homes, cooking their food or running their car.  That is the reality.  We have had a carbon tax for more than a decade and our emissions have gone up, not down.  It is a burden because the alternatives to fossil fuels are not realistic for the majority people in terms of affordability.  The fuel allowance is often quoted.  It is a means tested payment.  The accessible income limit for a couple where the qualified adult is aged under 66 is just &euro;513.70.  What this means in reality is that many low paid workers, and as Senator Bacik pointed out one in four workers in this economy is a low paid worker, have no means of affording these carbon tax increases and they have no supports available under this budget.  Thousands of households that do not qualify for the fuel allowance are struggling to get by at this great time of financial insecurity.  The increase in carbon tax is permanent.  The Bill seeks to lock-in year on year increases in the carbon tax until 2030, increases that the Department of Finance has itself classified as regressive.  There is no such provision in the Social Welfare Bill to lock-in year on year increases in social welfare payments until 2030.  The fact remains that now in the midst of an unemployment crisis that has disproportionately impacted low income households, this was the wrong time to increase carbon tax.  It was right time to put a pause on the increase.  Sinn F&eacute;in will express these concerns on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>I move on to motor and VRT tax changes.  These measures are compounded by sections 33 and 34, which provide for changes to motor tax and reliefs given to certain electric vehicles.  These changes, as the Minister of State will know, will disproportionately benefit wealthy drivers while penalising those unable to afford an upgrade to low emission or electric vehicles.  A just transition must be based on prioritising access to alternatives for those most vulnerable to an increase in these taxes.  <\/p><p>The State is in a good position at present to support incomes, jobs, businesses and our economy.  The cost of borrowing remains low.  The European Central Bank, ECB, policy remains in place and certain tax receipts remain robust, but a spectre hangs over the future course of our public finances.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A spectre hangs over the future course of our public finances.  Overperforming corporation tax receipts have aided the ability of the State to fund its response, but they cannot be relied on forever.  While our deficit has increased substantially, it is manageable and was necessary.  However, questions remain over the intentions of this Government to reduce it.  The programme for Government explicitly ruled progressive taxation measures and committed to deficit reduction.  The Government must at some stage set out how it plans to square that circle.  I can commit that Sinn F&eacute;in will oppose any attempt to reduce the deficit through funding freezes for our public services, cuts to social protection or aggressive tax hikes.  Sinn F&eacute;in will demand a just recovery.<\/p><p>I wish to highlight something that happened at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment last week.  Both IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, urgently called for a specialised short-time work scheme for companies that will be affected by Brexit.  It was striking to see IBEC and ICTU on the same page but it was disappointing to hear that they both acknowledged they had not had a positive response from a number of Departments.  This is something that is urgent.  We all know that Brexit is going to be hard, and it is a question of how hard, yet we have not seen a response to this urgent call.  I would like to use this occasion to call on the Minister of State to make an intervention now to ensure that a German-style short-time work scheme is in place for the beginning of the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#RRR00200","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I welcome the Finance Bill and wish the Minister well with it.<\/p> <p>I highlighted an issue concerning redundancies to the Minister of State, Deputy English, at a previous debate in the Seanad.  There is a problem for small family-run businesses that are sole traders or self-employed and that employ people.  The Redundancy Payments Act 2003 introduced the provision that two weeks per year must be paid in redundancy.  It is right that a person who is made redundant gets two weeks per year.  However, the sole trader or family-run business, who is self-employed and who employs people, must find two weeks per year to pay the redundancy whether he or she is downsizing or the business ceases.  In the next number of months or whatever, a lot of those family-run small trader businesses will close, never to open again, but they will still have to pay redundancy.  While at some stage they can claim an inability to pay and the State will take up the two weeks per year, in the case of the self-employed small or sole trader, the State comes looking for the money, and at the end of the day a charge is put on the private property - the house - of the sole trader.<\/p> <p>I am bringing in a Private Members' Bill to exclude the family home in this case as it is only right it should be protected, and we have seen where it is protected in many cases.  In this case, a small businessperson, a sole trader, who is self-employed and employing people can end up with a charge on his or her house, and when that person dies, the house goes to the State.  It is something the Government should consider very seriously, and I hope it will take on board the Bill that I will propose.<\/p> <p>My next issue concerns people who own two or three houses or apartments and want to make a business out of renting property.  The Government has continually said that it does not want such activity as it drives up the price of property for first-time buyers and whoever else wants to buy a house.  Many a family has made a living out of renting property but more and more of them are going out of business because of the taxation policy.  They are being taxed to the hilt.  I do not know what a person would want to be to buy property to rent but he or she would want to have cash and not to borrow.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those people are getting out of that business and the money that they are getting for their businesses is going into funds that buy houses but have no tax to pay, which is an inequity.  While the person who buys one, two or three apartments, houses or whatever is being driven out of the market the funds are going back in to buy blocks of houses and hide behind real estate investment trusts or REITs and so forth but pay no tax.  While the Minister for Finance has said that he does not want to use a taxation policy to interfere with the housing market, in effect he is because the REITs are buying houses and paying no tax.  He should reduce the tax for the person who has a few properties and place some kind of tax on REITs and vulture funds that are now in the property game. <\/p><p>Banking has changed completely.  Nobody is building houses now bar a few because it is not profitable to do so and it is hard to get funds.  Bank managers used to take a chance on builders or whatever but that day is gone because there are no bank managers to talk to and the small builder who builds one or two houses finds it very difficult to get funds to do any development.  This matter must be looked at because many a family has been reared by small builders and they owed a debt of gratitude to bank managers all around the country.  Those bank managers are gone and small builders are going with them resulting in the ever-increasing cost of housing and everybody being pushed out of the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#TTT00200","speaker":"1636","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  This is the first time for me to address him about finance in this very important debate.<\/p> <p>I wish to focus on the significant farm safety measures in the Bill.  Amendment No. 65, passed in the D&aacute;il, was a very important statement by this Government.  It showed that farm safety needs to be considered as a policy priority.   There is really significant stuff regarding farm safety in this budget but it needs to be highlighted to the farming community.  The ability for farmers now to get capital allowances for adaptation grants after an accident is very positive and an important step forward.<\/p> <p>The high level of farm accidents, which occur on a daily basis, is a blight on our community and society.  We are literally less than 5% of the workforce but we have 40% of the accidents, which is a significant figure that we must address.  This provision is a great start, which we need to welcome, but there is more to be done.  I never saw the logic in having a VAT rate of 21% on farm safety gear like a power take-off or PTO shaft.  A really significant effort has been made in this budget to incentivise farmers to ensure their equipment is up to the proper standard, which is the kind of approach we need.  We do not need the stick all the time; a carrot is very important.  This is why the measures in this Bill are so important for the agricultural community.  It sends the message that we are listening, that we care and we need to put something in place to limit the number of farm accidents.  I welcome the measures and acknowledge that they are a step in the right direction.  I spoke about farm fatalities the first time that the Seanad sat.  Over the past six or eight months I saw the burial of two of my neighbours due to farm fatalities, one person was killed by a bull and another in an accident involving a farm tractor.  Farm safety is one of the key agricultural issues.  If we want to attract more people to work in the industry then we must make it safer, particularly as it is an industry where one must work a lot on one's own.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I welcome these really important measures in Part 1 of Schedule 35.

As others have said, agriculture as a whole is important.  This has always been the case and I am sure that in the next number of years this Government will prioritise agriculture.  I come from a farming background and there is always a view within farming that any time the country has hit a crisis, it is always the agricultural industry that has got it through.  The past ten years have been no different, with the agrifood industry getting the country back flourishing.<\/p> <p>I welcome what colleagues have said about farm safety and I compliment the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, since taking that role in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  He has really hit the ground running and the work he is doing promoting farm safety is very important.  There are a number of organisations around the country, particularly Embrace FARM, which have done phenomenal work highlighting the dangers of working on a farm.  I know from my early years working on a tillage farm every summer the dangers that come with the work because of big machinery like tractors and combine harvesters.  We know the daily dangers that come with the work and we can never highlight those enough.  The Government's work, and certainly that of the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, in highlighting farm safety, is very important.<\/p> <p>It is noteworthy that, during the passage of the Bill, there was the introduction of an accelerated capital gains allowance for farm safety equipment, with a particular emphasis on supporting those who have suffered life-changing injuries as a result of incidents on farms.  This underlines the priority afforded to the farm safety issue in this Government's programme.<\/p> <p>Section 17 refers to the schedule detailing equipment type, including hydraulic linkage arms mounted tractor jacking systems, and these are to be included in the new section 285D of the principal Act.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, was in the House last week to speak about that.  We need to work closely with colleagues to see how we can access that fund very quickly at the start of the new year.  It is shocking to think there will be such a high level of tariffs on agrifood going outside Ireland to the UK, which is one of our largest markets.<\/p> <p>There are some other elements of the budget I want to commend, including supports for businesses and people in precarious jobs, as well as people who have lost their jobs in the hospitality sector.

I did not realise there was a time limit of five minutes, so I ask for the Acting Chairman's indulgence for a few minutes.  <\/p><p>In the area of foreign and direct investment, FDI, I want to mention the presence of Apple in Cork.  The company is celebrating 40 years in Cork this year, and it has grown from having just six employees in 1980, to employing over 6,000 workers of over 90 nationalities in 2020 in its European headquarters in Cork city.

In today's papers, I noticed that the Taiwanese foreign minister has asked for free countries across the world to show solidarity with them, which is so sad, because I visited the country recently and I saw a free democracy working perfectly.  The minister said that there was an imminent threat of invasion from the Chinese mainland to suppress the last remaining piece of Chinese territory on which there is a functioning democracy.  I hope that the Irish Government begins to find some courage and begins to consider, not what butter exports to China may do for our economy, but what principle requires us to do, and that is to support small countries, which are functioning democracies, in the face of tyrannical neighbours.<\/p> <p>This is Second Stage of the Finance Bill 2020, and I wish to make one point about the principle behind it.  I know that the principles of the Finance Bill are hardly to be found easily because the Bill is usually a great agglomeration of specific measures with specific intent.  This is the first major Finance Bill of this Government, and a large amount of its content, for example, taxation and postponement measures, is remedial in respect of the problems that the economy is currently facing.  <\/p> <p>When one flies to London, in times when it is easy to do so, somewhere over Liverpool one gets the impression that the plane is beginning its descent into Heathrow Airport.  Similarly, in politics, the Government is getting fairly close to that point already.  Quite soon, the Government will be seeing the descent path rather than the ascent path, in respect of its lifespan.  When the people of Ireland come to vote at the next general election, which could be three or four years away, but it will be upon us fairly soon, the most critical question which will face both the parties in government and the Government as a whole, will be the judgment of the people as to what they have done in respect of housing and the housing crisis in Ireland.  It will be one of the most critical questions that determines where the votes of people under the ages of 40 and 30 go in the next election.  It is probably going to be the critical factor that determines whether the present opinion polls are borne out, or other scenarios come to pass.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The reason that I feel impelled to say this on Second Stage of the Finance Bill 2020, is because the entire Government - and not just the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - must take seriously the issue of home building and homeownership, and the whole question of the capacity of young Irish people to ever become the owners of their own homes, and not to be the tenants of foreign multinational real estate investment trusts, REITs, and the like.  The Government must take this issue seriously and it must be seen to be doing so.  <\/p><p>In today's newspapers there was another report on the fact that even if major steps are taken now, it may be two or three years before they have an effect.  The voters of Ireland are not stupid, and if they see something happening which shows the prospect of a radical change, they may change their attitudes and their voting intentions.  I would add that our society is becoming one in which the younger generation is being comparatively impoverished to the benefit of the generation to which I belong.  Assets are devolving upwards in terms of age, and ownership and capital are going upwards in terms of age and outwards from Ireland to REITs, multinationals and vulture funds.  If we want to change Ireland and to keep what is best about it in one respect, we must ensure that every Irish youngish family can aspire to owning its own home.<\/p><p>I wish to finish on this point.  Although now is not the time to start a mini housing boom, now is the time for the Government, through the taxation system, to reassert the values that have characterised Ireland for at least half a century, which include, in particular, that everyone can and should aspire to the ownership of their own home, and to have a real stake in the capital wealth of their country.  I want to say, in that context, that unless this Government faces up to that issue - and facing up to that involves facing down the conservatism of the Custom House, and I will repeat that: facing down the conservatism and ineptitude of the Custom House - it is in danger of losing, not simply control over the political future of the country, but a large measure of democracy itself, to populists who will exploit the weakness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#XXX00200","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.

What I am particularly pleased about is the policy change in respect of how we provide social housing units from the point of view of involving our local authorities across the country.  I do not understand why they were not involved in more recent times.  The local authorities were the bedrock when we were building houses in this country.

When I was growing up there were regional technical colleges, RTCs, across the country.  The work they did enabled Ireland to evolve from what it was in the 1970s and the 1980s to what it is today.  Most of them evolved to become institutes of technology.  We, too, have to evolve.  Many great industries have come to this country as a result of the work of the institutes of technology and our universities.  I am delighted that we are moving with the times and continuing the trend of attracting a smart economy because of our smart workforce.  I am delighted that we are moving forward in the vein of the technological universities.<\/p><p>I am delighted also that there was a small breakthrough this afternoon in regard to the Northern Ireland protocol and Brexit.  Brexit will bring difficulties to our shores.  We have done a great deal to minimise the impact of it.  With Brexit will also come opportunities and we will need to make the most of them.  <\/p><p>The budget also makes provision for the development of greenways and walkways, which is a commitment in the programme for Government.  It is an exciting venture to develop these greenways and not just the small ones, but the larger ones cross-county and also cross-Border.  There are great opportunities to do that.  The shared island unit provides great opportunities to move this island forward as one nation and one people on a shared basis.

These matters underpin the measures in the Finance Bill.  <\/p> <p>I will try to respond to the points made in succession.  All Senators accepted that this is a difficult economic time.

That is being softened.  I accept the point made.  I will come back to Senators on the warehousing of taxes.<\/p><p>The issue of carbon tax and the alternative to cars in rural areas was raised.  This is an ongoing issue.  The issue raised was that some businesses are not eligible for the CRSS even though they are suppliers to a particular company.  There is a difficulty in that some businesses do not have a premises that is directly affected.  <\/p><p>Senator Bacik referred to housing.  I will come back to that.  She also mentioned low pay and the minimum wage increase of 10 cent per hour.  The latter applies primarily in the private sector in Ireland.  It may also apply in particular parts of the public sector.  The increase was not solely dictated by the Government.  It is important to make that point.  <\/p><p>There was much discussion on the PUP scheme.  As I have said previously, payments under the scheme were taxable from day one.  I recall several discussions during the course of the summer involving several members of the Government and Opposition about the tax bill that might arise next year.  During the summer, Revenue announced that people will have until 2022 to commence payments and can pay over four years.  All of this debate was in the context that everybody understood the PUP was taxable.  Why else did we have that debate for months?  It was never an emergency payment.  It was inserted into a particular section of the Act to facilitate quick payment.  <\/p><p>There is a Schedule in the social welfare legislation that deals with social welfare payments that are exempt from tax.  Only payments listed in that Schedule are exempt.  The PUP is not listed in that Schedule.  The PUP payment is not specifically listed in the social welfare legislation as exempt from tax and, therefore, it was taxable from day one.  I know it suits a narrative to say that the Government is trying to tax the payment retrospectively but the truth is that on the basis of the social welfare and taxation measures it was taxable from day one.  I know people will continue to make that point.  It is not true but that will not stop people repeating it.  <\/p><p>On carbon tax and low-income households, the budget provides three measures, the first of which is an increase of &euro;3.50 per week in the fuel allowance.  This payment is means tested, which proves it is for low-income families and not well-off people.  The qualifying child dependant allowance has been increased as well for low-income families in receipt of social welfare benefits.  The living alone allowance has increased by &euro;5 per week.  These three measures were introduced to mitigate the increased cost that might arise for low-income families or households because of the carbon tax.  They are not geared to the well-off.  They are not across the payments.  Rather, they are targeted at people on low incomes.  It is important to make that point as well.<\/p><p>On housing, many Senators spoke about the importance of home ownership.  Other Senators railed against it.  It is notable that some Senators are objecting to the help-to-buy scheme.  During my lifetime, and that of my parents, we have always had a mortgage interest subsidy scheme.  It was a fundamental tenet of every Government in Ireland for generations that tax relief would be provided to help people buy their own homes.  That scheme was abolished and we now have the help-to-buy scheme, which is the same scheme in principle but with different details.  The scheme is helping Irish people to buy their own home.  I have heard from two parties today that they are opposed to this scheme.  They made the point that it is money for developers and is resulting in increased house prices.  The debate on this boils down to whether one is in favour of the people of Ireland having the aspiration to own their own homes, which the help-to-buy scheme facilitates.  If one is against the help-to-buy scheme, one is not in favour of people having that aspiration and would rather see them in a dependency culture, renting from the State, an approved housing body or a private landlord.  One is either for home ownership or one is against it.  I am hearing a clear division in this House.  I make no apology for supporting home ownership or the State assisting people to buy their own homes.  I would spend any amount of money if it helped people to do that rather than pay rent for the rest of their lives.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Sean Fleming:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a fundamental difference in attitude, and I know what side of the debate I am on.  I am on the side of the Irish people who want to own their own homes.  Others may choose to be on the other side, and that is their right too.<\/p><p>The issue of farm safety was mentioned by Senators.  I appreciate that.  There are definitely very specific measures.  It does highlight the number of farmers who have accidents, many of whom are older people at home.  They may be married men or grandparents whose sons or daughters have gone out to work, and these men are trying to keep the family farm going when they are long past doing that level of work.  This is unsafe when many of them are on their own.  It is a big issue.  Teagasc and others have a major role to play in improving farm safety.  There is a disproportionate number of work accidents in a farm setting.  This is because of the isolated nature of some of the people who work on their own.  In some cases they are often elderly.  I am aware that children also get caught up in this but it is really the older people who get caught up rather than able bodied people of a younger age.<\/p><p>I would say thank God for the multinational, financial services and pharma sectors in Ireland this year.  They kept receipts from income tax and corporation taxes up.  It gave us the money to pay the Covid restriction support scheme, CRSS, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and everything that went with it.  Of course, some people have an ideological issue with that as well.  We were lucky to have those sectors.  They are the sectors that kept employment up this year and people working in multinational sectors are, by and large, well paid where the wage or salary in those companies are twice the average industrial wage in Ireland.  They are all on the top tax rate and have continued to work.  Without them, on this occasion, we would not have had a fraction of the taxes that we have had to help to pay for some of the other issues.<\/p><p>I will pass on the matter of Taiwan and will leave that for somebody else.<\/p><p>These are some of the points I wanted to make.  Some deal with specifics that have been raised here today such as the carbon tax and the taxation of the PUP.  I knew from day one that the PUP was always going to be taxable income.  Perhaps some people did not realise this.  When one thinks about it, while the PUP is technically taxable it is not really taxable in reality because if a person was to earn the PUP of &euro;350 for 52 weeks of the year, then he or she is not in the tax net.  The sum of &euro;350 per week for one year brings nobody into the tax net.  In reality, the PUP is not taxable.  What is taxable, however, is when people are in receipt of the PUP for a portion of a year and also have &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000, for example, through their own income for the rest of the year.  Of course that is going to be taxable and of course it should be.  If one has lived for the year on PUP then no income tax would be payable because one has not reached the taxation threshold.  That PUP is taxable is a myth and a way of spinning something.  People who receive the PUP are taxed when their other income brings them into the tax net over the PUP level.  It is taken into consideration for calculation of income, but no PUP payment on its own is taxable.  Nobody in Ireland will pay tax who has been on PUP for the full year and has no other income.  They are not in the tax net.  Some people have said that the PUP is taxable but in fact tax is not paid on the PUP in practical terms.  It was always included in the reckoning of income if the person has other income to tax.  If there is no other income then the PUP will not ever put a person into the tax net in Ireland.  I just wanted to state this on the record.<\/p><p>I presume my time is almost up.  I believe we will be in the Seanad on Friday morning to discuss Committee Stage.  We might have time to get into further detail on some of the matters.  The Senators can see the position I am taking.  I am supporting the measures.  I am happy with this Finance Bill.  Of course it could have been better.  We would love to have been expansive with it but given the times we find ourselves in, with the Covid pandemic and Brexit, we had to take a precautionary approach to our budget this year.  We have done as much as we can, given the year that is in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607423400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Vot&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#BBBB00300","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>In accordance with the order of the Seanad today the division is postponed until after the Order of Business on Wednesday, 9 December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#BBBB00400","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020: Motion for Earlier Signature","time":1607423400,"counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#BBBB00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat pursuant to subsection 2&deg; of section 2 of Article 25 of the Constitution, Seanad &Eacute;ireann concurs with the Government in a request to the President to sign the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020 on a date which is earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill shall have been presented to him. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#BBBB00600","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607423400,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#BBBB00800","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speech","time":1607423400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Tomorrow morning at 10.30 a.m in the D&aacute;il Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020120800002#BBBB00900","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607423400,"counter":195,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 5.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 9 December 2020.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
