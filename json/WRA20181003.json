The first increase due from 1 January 2018 has been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel and a second increase is due to be applied from 1 October 2018. In fact, enlisted members of the Permanent Defence Force will see the increase in today's wage packet.  Further increases in pay are scheduled for 2019 and 2020.<\/p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the pay of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  New entrants to the Defence Forces will also benefit from the measures which were recently announced in relation to amendments to the pay scales for new entrant public servants recruited since January 2011.<\/p>  <p>  Measures such as the implementation of the Working Time Directive for members of the Permanent Defence Force and a review of contracts for enlisted personnel are under active consideration.

Units are maintained in order that personnel can deploy, not for Units to remain fully manned in barracks. The Defence Forces have always drawn personnel from Units for overseas service and other deployments, and personnel also engage in training on an ongoing basis. Such commitments can result in Permanent Defence Force personnel normally garrisoned in a Barracks not being present at a particular moment in time, but present on other occasions.<\/p>  <p>  The Permanent Defence Force has a higher level of turnover than other areas of the Public Service and this is a feature of military organisations.

An additional deployment of approximately 106 Defence Forces personnel to the UNIFIL mission for the 12 month period November 2018 to November 2019 has recently been approved.  Other missions in which the Defence Forces are deployed are Mali (EUTM Mali), Bosnia and Herzegovina(EUFOR),  Kosovo (KFOR), Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO) and Western Sahara (MINURSO). Ireland also contributes observers and staff to various UN and OSCE posts. With regard to any future deployments overseas, Ireland receives requests from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>  <p>  I had previously indicated to the Deputy that drugs, including Lariam (mefloquine) are purchased  by the Defence Forces under the four year framework agreement between the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the HSE.

The Defence Forces have advised that they currently source Lariam through wholesalers that are authorised to supply exempt products. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware that there are three anti-malarial drugs, namely Lariam (Mefloquine), Malarone and Doxycycline which continue to be used by the Defence Forces. All of these anti-malaria drugs have contraindications and side effects. I have indicated on many occasions that the use of anti-malaria drugs is a medical matter that should be decided by qualified medical professionals. In the Defence Forces these are decisions for highly qualified Medical Officers, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces. Significant precautions are taken by the Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications. <\/p>  <p>  I had previously indicated that a Working Group was re-convened to review developments arising in relation to malaria chemoprophylaxis and the use of Lariam, particularly in the context of the current potential litigation.

The Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority role. <\/p>  <p>  At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency and that the command structure within the Defence Forces is compatible with the requirements in this area. <\/p>  <p>  Major Emergency Plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these Plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces retain a wide range of specialist skills which can be deployed in such circumstances, including for a natural disaster or terrorist incidents. The Operations Directorate in Defence Forces Headquarters manages the necessary cross-service coordination in responding to both emergency and security issues. These arrangements have proved effective in all emergencies encountered to date.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to security threats, primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  <\/p>  <p>  There is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including ATCP deployments and a wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies. Regular coordination and liaison meetings also take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Naval Service, all vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that, in addition to their fishery protection role, they also undertake general surveillance, security, pollution monitoring, and Search and Rescue in support to the Irish Coast Guard, amongst other duties while on patrol. These activities assist in detecting and preventing emergency situations throughout Ireland&rsquo;s maritime jurisdiction. <\/p>  <p>  The role of the Air Corps includes the provision of an emergency inter-hospital Air Ambulance service in support of the HSE. It is also supporting the HSE in an emergency aeromedical support service operating primarily in the West of Ireland. The Air Corps also has a maritime surveillance function undertaken by its maritime patrol aircraft and both it and the Naval Service provide support to the Irish Coast Guard in maritime Search and Rescue operations.<\/p>  <p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment are available for deployment in response to any security and other emergencies that may arise. Within the Defence Forces, both the Ordnance Corps and the Army Ranger Wing specialise in providing an immediate response to emergency incidents that might require their highly specialised capabilities. The role of the Defence Forces in these situations is dependent on the nature of the incident and the type of assistance requested. <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Defence Forces keep their operational plans and response capabilities for dealing with a wide range of threats under constant review.

In particular the report provides credible findings that human rights violations amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed by members of the Burmese Military (Tatmadaw) and other security forces in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States. <\/p>  <p>  The IIFFM&rsquo;s report also finds that there is sufficient evidence of crimes committed in Rakhine State being so grave that they warrant a competent court to determine the liability for the crime of genocide of those in the Tatmadaw chain of command. <\/p>  <p>  The work of the IIFFM in investigating allegations, recording victim testimony and gathering other evidence so that it can be preserved for further criminal proceedings, is crucial to ensuring full accountability. <\/p>  <p>  I have taken note of the recommendations and Ireland is actively engaging with our international partners in responding to its findings. <\/p>  <p>  One of the key issues we have focused on so far is the issue of accountability. At the recent 39th Session of the Human Rights Council, Ireland actively supported the creation of a resolution on Myanmar, proposed jointly by the EU and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which mandates a new impartial independent mechanism to collect, consolidate, preserve and analyse evidence of the most serious violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011. This is an important step in facilitating fair and independent criminal proceedings for these crimes.<\/p>  <p>  The IIFFM report also makes a number of other recommendations. In particular, the report recommends the introduction of targeted sanctions against members of the Tatmadaw and Border Guard Police who have been accused of violations of international law. Ireland has actively engaged in the formation of the EU&rsquo;s position in the most recent EU Foreign Affairs Council&rsquo;s Conclusions on Myanmar, which were adopted on 26 February 2018. These Conclusions, which in some ways anticipated the outcome of the IIFFM, provide for the imposition of targeted measures against certain persons from the Myanmar Armed Forces and Border Guard Police responsible for serious human rights violations, and for the expansion of the existing arms embargo. A number of members of the Tatmadaw and Border Guards have been listed under these sanctions since the Conclusions were adopted in February. Ireland is actively engaging in further discussions in this regard in light of the findings of the IIFFM.<\/p>  <p>  Another of the key recommendations of the IIFFM relates to the question of repatriation. Ireland strongly supports the IIFFM&rsquo;s insistence that provisions be made for a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable means of return of the Rohingya to Rakhine State and for the introduction of measures that will enable them to sustain a reasonable livelihood. The question of citizenship is central in this regard and I call on the authorities of Myanmar comprehensively address this issue. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, it is clear that the long-standing drivers of conflict in Myanmar need to be addressed. The IIFFM recognises that the implementation of the findings of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State (The Annan Commission) provides a roadmap for sustainable and community-led peacebuilding in Rakhine State, and for the development of extremely impoverished regions there. Ireland has strongly and repeatedly supported the implementation of the report of the Advisory Commission&rsquo;s findings and will continue to do so. <\/p>  <p>  On the question of the referral of Myanmar to the International Criminal Court, Ireland is not currently a member of the UN Security Council, and is therefore not in a position to formally offer support on the question of referral.<\/p>  <p>  However, having considered the evidence of the IIFFM, Ireland would support the referral by the Security Council of the situation in Myanmar to the ICC. The Security Council is the only competent body that can take this step. <\/p>  <p>  Given the political and legal difficulties that surround such a referral, our focus in ensuring accountability and investigation of the allegations is necessarily elsewhere. As already outlined, we are working closely with international partners in other fora including the UN Human Rights Council and the EU to ensure that measures are put in place to allow the investigation of  human rights violations and that those who have perpetrated these crimes are held to account.<\/p>  <p>Officials in my Department will continue to monitor the situation and to work with our international partners to urge progress within Myanmar on these difficult issues and to pursue a resolution to this crisis that brings peace, reconciliation and prosperity for everybody in Myanmar.  In the meantime, Ireland will continue to support the provision of humanitarian aid to those in need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300072#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dublin-Monaghan Bombings","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300072#WRE01500"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[40277\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300072#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the outcome of the most recent discussions he had with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British foreign Secretary regarding the need for the British Government to respond positively and without further delay to the unanimous requests of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to provide access to papers and files pertaining to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>Dealing with long-outstanding issues relating to the legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland are of the utmost importance to the Government.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level that they should apply to particular categories of individuals, nor am I in a position to direct them to provide cover to such individuals. <\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer mortgage protection cover and what terms to apply.  These factors can include age, health, family medical history, occupation and lifestyle.  In addition, these may be determined or linked to the length of time with which such a policy may last.  In the case of mortgage protection policy, such policies tend to be over a much longer term, for example, 25 years or over the lifetime of the mortgage repayment schedule.  Furthermore, my understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and that they will price in accordance with their own past claims experience. <\/p>  <p>  I am unable to comment on specific cases, like the one provided.  However you should note that my officials contacted Insurance Ireland recently with regard to a similar case and they advised that applicants for any type of life assurance will be asked on the application form detailed health questions and that insurers may request one or more of the following in addition: a report from the applicant&rsquo;s GP; an independent medical examination; or other medical tests.  On the basis of the information provided, the application is considered individually and the decision on whether to offer cover and on what terms depends on the facts of that particular case. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300072#WRE03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Costs","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300072#WRE03900"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[40330\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300072#WRE04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of efforts to reduce the cost of car insurance; the number of recommendations and associated actions that have been completed to date (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>The Deputy should note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.

The intention is to embed an equality perspective throughout the budgetary process with a whole of year budgetary focus; equality budgeting is not to be seen as something separate from the budget process. For this first cycle of equality budgeting, a number of diverse policy areas were selected with associated objectives and indicators published in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018 in December last.

Restoring capitation funding as resources permit is one of the actions included in the Action Plan for Education and I remain committed to achieving this. However, I must be prudent in the context of ongoing budgetary pressures and prioritise where it is not possible to do everything that I would like to do in the education sector in any one year. <\/p>  <p>  In the last two budgets, I made provision for 6,000 extra teachers and 3,000 extra SNAs and over 3,000 new middle management posts.

Through budget 2017 and Budget 2018, we are now investing &euro;1 billion more in education. <\/p>  <p>  Improvements have been made for the restoration of grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff. The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016, &euro;5 in 2017 and &euro;5 in 2018, in order to enable primary schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for procurement of insurance and payment of same rests with Boards of Management in respect of schools operated by them. If a particular school has a query in relation to the cost of insurance it should raise this directly with its insurance provider. Boards of Management should take a proactive approach when it comes to sourcing insurance in order to ensure best value is obtained and to ensure compliance with public procurement procedures.

There are over 122,000 people employed across 649 firms in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin, with 45% of all new foreign direct investment (FDI) jobs created last year based in regional locations.<\/p>  <p>  Employment numbers for 2018 will not be available until my Department's Annual Employment Survey is carried out in November 2018. Site visits are collated by the IDA on a county-by-county basis only and are released every quarter. Information on the number of site visits on particular dates to specific locations is therefore unavailable. Last year, IDA client companies conducted three site visits to County Meath, two site visits to County Cavan, one site visit to County Monaghan. The trend for site visits this year are positive with four site visits to County Meath, one visit to County Cavan and one site visit to County Monaghan as of the second quarter of 2018. Site visit activity, however, does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is working hard to promote Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath to potential investors. The Agency has a dedicated regional manager for the North East\/North West Region and has an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre. As part of its strategy to encourage investment to the area, it is focusing on sectors including agri-food, manufacturing, tourism and internationally traded services. County Meath is being actively marketed by the IDA as a location for second sites for multinationals in the Dublin region, with a focus on building clusters in existing sectors like high-value manufacturing and international services.<\/p>  <p>  The IDA also regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. IDA Ireland also owns sites in all three counties that are being actively marketed to its clients.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that FDI only forms one part of investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin. My Department and all its agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs, work together constantly and collaboratively to ensure that jobs and investment are spread as fairly as possible across this country. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Enterprise Ireland (EI) supported companies employed 5,451 people in Cavan and 5,366 people Monaghan in 2017.  This is an increase of approximately 4% in both counties compared to 2016. Total employment in EI supported companies in County Meath now stands at 7,302, an increase of over 4% compared to the previous year. In May of this year, EI facilitated a meeting of Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and EI engineering companies from Meath and Cavan with a view to creating an engineering cluster in the region. <\/p>  <p>  Companies supported by the Cavan LEO employed a total of 1,252 people in 2017, representing a net increase of 100 jobs over the previous year. The Monaghan LEO employed 1,052 people in 2017, representing a net increase of 142 jobs over the previous year. The Meath LEO employed 1,112 people in 2017, which is a net increase of 162 jobs over the previous year.  These numbers clearly reflect the growing domestic industries which are so important to these counties. <\/p>  <p>  We recognise that there is room for improvement in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath and we are working hard, across Government, to further unlock the economic potential of these counties. The Enterprise Agencies under my remit will continue to engage with their clients, and with one another, to create jobs and source new investment for these regions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300074#WRG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300074#WRG03900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Action Plan for Online Safety","counter":306,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300074#WRG03800"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[40166\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300074#WRG03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps he will take under the Action Plan for Online Safety to remove harmful material relating to bogus cures for autism and in order to prevent further material of this nature from being posted online.","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":308,"content":"<p>The Action Plan on Online Safety, launched by An Taoiseach on 11 July last, recognises that online safety is not the responsibility of any one Department, but that many Departments have a role to play.

This position remains unchanged.<\/p>  <p>  Medical card provision is based on financial assessment. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis. Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.

In this regard, the UK commitment, in the Joint EU-UK Report of last December, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, was extremely important. <\/p>  <p>  Ensuring that the UK gives effect to this commitment is now a significant focus of the Irish Government, and we have the full support of our EU partners and of the European Commission Task Force in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Government has introduced a range of measures to deal with the short-term impacts of Brexit. In terms of dealing with Competitiveness issues, my Department introduced a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes in the 2017 Budget. In Budget 2018 I, along with my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Business and Innovation, introduced a new &euro;300m &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; to provide affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future - at least 40% of which will be available to food businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  Under Market Diversification, my Department is supporting Bord Bia in its investment in market insight (through its &lsquo;Thinking House&rsquo;) and in market prioritisation initiatives which are aimed at identifying and developing potential diversification opportunities. Indeed, I have increased funding to Bord Bia by &euro;14.5m since the UK referendum. <\/p>  <p>  As regards Product Diversification, I am supporting Teagasc in the development of a new National Food Innovation Hub in Fermoy (&euro;8.8 million funding announced by An Taoiseach and myself last October). <\/p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government remains very focused on supporting farmers and the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead, whether they are based in the border region or in any other part of the country. The Government will be firm in arguing that any agreement reached between the EU and the UK must take account of the very serious challenges presented by Brexit for the sector, particularly given the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the importance of our economic relationship with the UK. And, of course, ultimately Ireland's objective in the negotiations is to have a trading relationship with the UK which is as close as possible to the current arrangements.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300078#WRL05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Payments","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300078#WRL05300"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[40276\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300078#WRL05400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payments will issue to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1272","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":562,"content":"<p>The person named submitted a 2018 Basic Payment\/Areas of Natural Constraint Schemes application on the 19<sup>th<\/sup>February 2018.

Projects applying for any fund created by SIFI must also meet the following standard SIFI core criteria: <\/p><p>- the project must address a critical social issue;<\/p><p>- the solution proposed by the applicant must be innovative in an Irish context; <\/p><p>- the applicant&rsquo;s solution must have potential and a desire to scale or replicate in Ireland (it may also have potential internationally, but this is not a requirement);<\/p><p>- the project must provide evidence that it is up and running, or has been tested at least in a minimal way; <\/p><p>- the project must be based on the island of Ireland and make its main impact in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p><p>In addition, some further criteria are tailored to specific funds operated by SIFI. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300079#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Policy","counter":591,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300079#WRM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":592,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[40254\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300079#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if he will address the diminution of services such as banking and post office services in rural Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":593,"content":"<p>In my role as Minister for Rural and Community Development I am absolutely clear on the importance of ensuring that rural communities can access the services they need so that they remain vibrant places in which to live and work.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Finance has responsibility for banking and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has policy responsibility for the postal sector. <\/p>  <p>  However, I am acutely aware of the value placed by rural communities on services such as those provided by banks and post offices. Ensuring access to services for rural communities is an issue that cuts across almost all Government Departments. It also relates to services provided by the private sector. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will no doubt appreciate that the provision of services by banks, including the location of branches, is a commercial decision for the boards and management of those institutions. <\/p>  <p>  That said, I expect that any bank closing branches will do everything that it can to mitigate the impacts of the branch closures on local communities, including use of technology and the use of alternative means of service delivery.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to postal services, I am providing &euro;80,000 to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in order to support the establishment of 10 &lsquo;Digital Assist&rsquo; Post Offices. This initiative, which was launched this week, will see these post offices act as pilots for the provision of new services. By creating a network of connected post offices I hope to help make the post office central to the community and local business and help sustain the viability of the post office network into the future.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is supporting the many vibrant towns and villages across rural Ireland through a range of schemes and supports. The evidence of impact can be seen in growing opportunities for employment and improved quality of life across rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 laid out the Government&rsquo;s plans for the country&rsquo;s long-term development, and a key commitment within it regarding rural Ireland is the provision of &euro;1 billion for the new Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, which is an unprecedented commitment by Government to strengthen our rural economies and, in turn, support stronger local communities.<\/p>  <p>  Initially, &euro;315 million has been allocated for the period 2019-2022 and the first call for applications to the Fund closed last Thursday.<\/p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of other funding programmes that support local communities throughout Ireland. Of particular importance for those towns and villages most disadvantaged in terms of access to services are:<\/p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme, which is a targeted investment programme for rural areas that aims to provide funding for small infrastructural projects and other initiatives in areas that have experienced significant levels of population decline.<\/p>  <p>  The Community Enhancement Programme, which was launched by my Department in May 2018 and provides small capital grants to community groups across the country. I was delighted to announce a further &euro;8million in funding for this programme last Friday, bringing the total for 2018 to &euro;12.5million.<\/p>  <p>  The Town and Village Renewal Scheme supports the revitalisation of rural towns and villages, with particular focus on projects which have a clear positive economic impact on local communities. Since its launch in 2016, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme has invested &euro;31.6 million in more than 450 projects across the country. <\/p>  <p>  The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) 2018-2022, with funding of &euro;38m in 2018, provides capacity at local level to respond to the particular needs in each area. It helps those seeking employment or starting their own business. <\/p>  <p>  LEADER funding, administered by Local Action Groups, delivers the &euro;250 million programme funding in accordance with the specific objectives and needs identified by the LAGs themselves as part of the development of Local Development Strategies. Therefore the supports are tailored to the specific needs of each individual area. <\/p>  <p>  Libraries will also work with local partners to reach disadvantaged, marginalised and new communities, increasing these communities&rsquo; awareness of services available and firmly establishing the library as a resource for all. Some &euro;150m is expected to be invested by local authorities in library services in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of directly facilitating access to services in rural Ireland, the Department of Transport has provided a funding allocation of &euro;14.9 million for local link services in 2018. Such funding facilitated 1.9 million passenger journeys last year &ndash; providing a vital service for rural communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300079#WRM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300079#WRM02700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code","counter":594,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300079#WRM02600"},{"type":"question","counter":595,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[40129\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018100300079#WRM02700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will address matters raised by an organisation (details supplied) relating to budget 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":596,"content":"<p>The Budget 2018 measures that took effect from 29 March this year, specifically the increases to the income disregard, the primary rate and the increase for a qualified child, assisted a lone parent in receipt of the one-parent family payment or jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, working 15 hours a week on the National Minimum Wage, to be better off by almost &euro;1,000 per year.<\/p>  <p>  The income disregard on the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST) scheme has increased from &euro;60 to &euro;130 across Budgets 2016 to 2018.

Firstly, in terms of affordable housing for purchase, relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 have been commenced, which place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing. This Scheme, aimed at households, including any qualifying military personnel, earning low to moderate annual gross incomes of maximum &euro;50,000 for a single applicant and maximum &euro;75,000 for joint applicants, will be delivered by local authorities developing their sites in key locations. The Scheme will be complementary to other Government Schemes which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, I am determined that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live  as well as work. Cost rental is an important component of progressive housing systems around Europe. Two cost rental projects have previously been announced for Emmet Road, Inchicore, and at Enniskerry Road, Dundrum. Learning from these pilot projects, I expect cost rental projects to be rolled out across other suitable sites.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I am providing additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  This overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will provide funding for those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing. The fund is initially open to the areas worst affected by housing undersupply and affordability. On 29 June, I invited applications under the SSF from 11 local authorities, including Galway City.
