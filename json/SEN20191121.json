I pay tribute to her for the commitment, work and vision she has shown in her role.  I thank her for being here this morning.  As Members will know, there has been a significant increase in certain types of drug use in many parts of the city.  I sit on the joint policing committees for both Cork county and Cork city.  We have heard presentations on this issue.  I commend the collaborative approach being taken by the HSE and the local drugs task force and praise Mr. David Lane, Cuan Mhuire and the Tabor Group for the work they are doing.<\/p> <p>The significance increase in the use of cocaine and other drugs is, as the Minister of State knows, a source of worry.  As somebody who was the Seanad spokesperson on issues relating to communities and drugs from 2007 to 2011, I believe the halfway house model which the Tabor Group uses at Tabor Fellowship House in Cork city has been very successful.  There is now a need to increase the number of detox beds available in Cork city.  It is about wraparound community supports being made available to people.  I refer to access to care, access to counselling, and the whole area of rehabilitation and reintegration into the community and into families.  It is through enhancing supports that we can offer people a second chance.  Equally, it is important to make facilities available with regard to people's later employability and ability to reach back into their families and communities.  <\/p> <p>Through the work of Cuan Mhuire and the Tabor Group, we can see that there is now a need for more detox beds within the system.  I support everything the Minister of State has done and is doing and thank her for it.  The Southern Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Force has been very powerful in Cork.  It has been a very strong advocate and voice but has also challenged all of us.  There can be a dual approach and a collaboration to address both mental health and addiction.  These sometimes go hand in hand.  That is not always the case but it very often is.  I ask that we look at increasing the number of detox beds and amount of community support within the system in Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112100002#A00400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1574332200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Buttimer for raising the issue of drug and alcohol detox treatment in Cork and for allowing me the opportunity to update the Seanad on our position.  Government policy on drug and alcohol addiction services is set out in the national drugs strategy document, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025.  My focus, and that of Government, is now on implementing the strategy and its 50 actions.<\/p> <p>The strategy emphasises a public health response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland based on providing person-centred services that promote rehabilitation and recovery.  A person-centred approach means giving people a say in their own treatment and supporting them to play a role in their own recovery.  Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery reflects a change in attitudes to substance misuse not only among politicians but among people in communities.  It promotes a more compassionate and humane approach to people who use drugs, with addiction treated first and foremost as a public health issue.  This approach is underpinned by the key values of the national drugs strategy, which are compassion, respect, equality and inclusion.  The strategy commits to expanding the availability and geographical spread of relevant quality drug and alcohol services and to improving the range of services available, based on identified need.<\/p> <p>In June of this year, I was delighted to have the opportunity to visit Cork city and Cuan Mhuire's new step-down facility at Teach Mhuire, which provides an important service to men exiting rehabilitation, offering aftercare support and safe accommodation.  I want to acknowledge Sr. Consilio and Cuan Mhuire for the work they do in providing residential detoxification and treatment for persons suffering from addiction right across the country.  I was therefore very pleased that the HSE provided funding for this important service in Cork city.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2186\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2186&amp;amp;pid=CatherineByrne&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I was, therefore, pleased that the HSE provided funding for this important service in Cork city.<\/p><p>With regard to services in Cork city and county, the HSE has advised that there are eight medically supervised detox beds provided through Cuan Mhuire in Farnanes, County Cork.  In cases where the demand exceeds the availability of residential medically supervised detox services in the Cork-Kerry area, the CHO has access to 30 medically supervised detox beds for adults in Cuan Mhuire, Bruree, Limerick, ten medically supervised detox beds for adults in Merchants Quay Ireland, St. Francis Farm, County Carlow, and four medically supervised detox beds for adolescents in Aislinn Adolescent Services, Ballyragget, County Kilkenny.  Should a detox bed not be available in any of these facilities, addiction services in Cork and Kerry also provide medically supervised detox for service users in a community setting.<\/p><p>Typically, this would include detox from alcohol, opiates and benzodiazepines.  This is provided in association with appropriate counselling supports through community services.  The HSE has advised that funding was allocated for the development of a proposal for an eight-bed stabilisation unit for Cork in 2019.  This comprises an inpatient stabilisation unit for people when complex needs prevent community stabilisation.  In addition to the above, several general practitioners, GPs, provide their service users with detox medications, both with addiction service support and on an independent basis.<\/p><p>The acute hospital sector also provides detox for service users who are acutely ill in an inpatient setting, and mental health services and the acute hospital sector have recognised pathways to refer to addiction services through the crisis nurse and liaison psychiatry service.  The HSE has further advised that a recruitment process is currently at an advanced stage for a drug liaison midwife and assistant director of nursing.  In addition, an addiction counsellor post has been recently filled and recruitment is under way for a needle exchange worker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112100002#A00500","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574332200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the significant investment and I thank the Minister of State for her personal intervention on the issue of Cuan Mhuire.

The more facilities we can provide in communities, run through the HSE and community services, the better chance people have of being caught at an early stage in their addiction, which helps them in the long run.  I was pleased to announce additional funding of &euro;1 million in budget 2020 to support the implementation of the national drugs strategy.  Two initiatives submitted by Cork Kerry Community Healthcare in conjunction with Cork city and the southern regional drugs task force were approved for this funding.  These initiatives reflect the priority agreed between the community health organisation and the task force to target resources at groups most in need.  Each initiative will receive a total of &euro;190,000 over three years.<\/p> <p>One initiative is targeted to provide special youth support to a significant vulnerable cohort of young people in Kerry.  Another initiative will fund a case management clinical supervisor to enhance services across drug and alcohol homelessness and prison services in the Cork Kerry Community Healthcare region.  I am confident that these initiatives will improve access to drugs services for people with complex needs and assist them in their journey to recovery.<\/p> <p>The Department has been starved of funding for a long time and I am conscious of the fact that we are only starting to fund projects and community facilities again.  I wish to work in partnership with the HSE and community groups.  My responsibility, as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, is to ensure that the funding is used well and, most of all, that there is governance and accountability, be it in the HSE or in community groups.  That is my job.  I intend to ensure that when funding is made available to groups we will follow up through reviews of how the money has been spent.  It is not my money, but the people's money.  It comes into the State's coffers.  We must ensure that when money goes to communities and to the HSE it is specifically monitored through governance and accountability.  That is what I am trying to do, particularly in the task force area.  There has been some upset in the task forces about that, but that is my job.

It had to knock down half of it and one of the avenues adjacent to it and rebuild the houses.  At that stage, cracking and a number of issues were found due to subsidence in the houses.  The local authority applied to the State for funding.  The money was provided and the houses were rebuilt.  Those houses are fine, but the houses that were not knocked down at the time are beginning to show subsidence.  The estate appears to have been built on quarry land.<\/p> <p>The residents got an engineer to examine the structure of the houses.  They believe an amount of work must be done.  They might have to be piled at the bottom.  The most interesting thing is that the ground rent for the houses is still owned by the local authority, although a number of them have been purchased.

The only information the Department has on the matter is derived from the details that the Senator kindly provided.  I understand from this information that the houses concerned were built in the 1960s and that they are former local authority properties that are now in private ownership.  This is a matter for Limerick City and County Council in the first instance.  The people affected by these issues should raise them directly with the council, which is best placed to examine possible solutions.  At least some of the homes may have been the subject of tenant purchase, possibly several decades ago.  Again, if these properties were purchased from the council, it illustrates the need to follow up with the council in the first instance.<\/p> <p>From the Department's contact with the council, I understand that the council has had no recent contact from homeowners on these issues.

I emphasise that this is a matter for the council and the Department would simply not be aware of such issues.

I also thank Senator O'Mahony for his support.  The points they raise are relevant particularly to the recent debate in the Dublin area.<\/p> <p>On 8 February this year, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government announced details of the measures being funded through his Department under the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme 2019-2021.  In parallel with the announcement local authorities were invited to submit bids for funding schemes or projects in their functional areas, with the deadline for receipt of proposals set as 14 March 2019.<\/p> <p>The new multi-annual programme includes measure 4 - new group water schemes.  This measure supports social and economic development in rural towns and villages and their hinterlands by providing new group water schemes where public water supply schemes or individual or private wells are not the most viable options.<\/p> <p>Mayo County Council made a number of bids under measure 4, including for a proposal for a Letterbrick group water scheme.  The estimated cost of the proposed 24-house scheme was &euro;469,000, or &euro;19,542 per house.  An expert panel was put in place to support the Department in its bids evaluation process.  In addition to providing an expert perspective, the panel brought independence, openness and transparency to the bids evaluation process, which was done on a national prioritised basis.  The panel's membership included departmental, stakeholder and independent representations.  The panel made recommendations to the Minister on the suitability of schemes and projects for funding based on objective criteria, which were set out in the framework document issued to local authorities when requesting proposals.  In particular, the framework sets out that grants of up to 85% of cost are available for new group water schemes subject to a maximum grant of &euro;7,650 per house.  This means that the effective financially viable cost limit per house for a scheme is &euro;9,000.  A supplemental grant can be considered in exceptional cases, subject to the recommendation of the panel and departmental approval.<\/p> <p>The panel, in considering the bid for the proposed Letterbrick scheme, concluded that at &euro;19,542 per house it was not financially viable when viewed against the criteria in the framework.  In the circumstances the panel did not recommend a supplementary grant.  The panel recommends that the local authority engages with the promoters to consider alternative lower cost solutions for example, private wells for which, subject to terms and conditions, a separate grant is available.  The private wells grant under the rural water programme can be accessed through the local authority, to assist with the necessary improvement of an individual water supply to a household.<\/p> <p>In approving the new multi-annual rural water programme, the Minister also approved an improved and increased private wells grants scheme to replace the existing scheme.  It is expected that the procedures for applying under this new scheme will be completed shortly when the necessary regulations dealing with the financial assistance arrangements and related administrative matters are put in place.  This will enable circular letters, terms and conditions, guidance and the application forms to issue to local authorities shortly thereafter.

I give the Senator a commitment that I will go back to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Department and raise these issues, as well as the points raised by Senator Paddy Burke about the urgent need to give funding to these families and the panel issue as well, which is something in which I am very interested having heard the debate today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112100002#D00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Refurbishment","time":1574332200,"counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112100002#D00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1574332200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House this morning and I thank him for taking the time to be here.  St. Aidan's comprehensive school, Cootehill, is a stand-alone, post-primary school built in 1996.  That school has had no refurbishment to the fabric of the building since that date, apart from some works that were done on foot of a health and safety audit, when some works were done as a result, including the upgrading of the heating system, the addressing of some lighting issues and roof repairs.<\/p> <p>St. Aidan's is a progressive school.  There are currently 506 students attending with a teaching staff of over 40 and ancillary staff of ten.  Student numbers have increased and, thankfully, are increasing, with an extra class in first year this year and a further additional first year class projected for next year.  It is worth noting that it is the only post-primary school located in the town of Cootehill.  <\/p> <p>An application was made to the Department of Education and Skills in 1998, updated in 2014, and again in 2019.  Unfortunately, nothing has been forthcoming to date.  The application includes a gym and a socialisation area for students to have a place to sit, eat and relax during breaks.  Currently, students are sitting on the floor to eat their lunch, which is totally unacceptable.  The application includes an upgrade of practical rooms, including two woodwork rooms, one art room and one engineering room to meet current health and safety standards.  It also includes an upgrade of the inefficient heating system and an upgrade to the facade of the building to deal with serious leaks, moulds, brickwork deterioration and lack of insulation.  Fire doors are required in all classrooms and offices need to meet current fire and health and safety regulations.  <\/p> <p>Contact has continued through the years with the Department's building unit and architects have been engaged to draw up a detailed plan and costings in line with the Department's regulations.  Due to their frustration at the lack of movement on this issue, parents have formed an action group to lobby for the delivery of this project and have sought the services of the building unit of Cavan and Monaghan education and training board, ETB.  The board is providing much-needed support and advice on the application.<\/p> <p>Practical rooms are in serious need of upgrade to meet the Department's own technical health and safety guidelines.  As I said earlier, students deserve a place to sit, eat and socialise.  A fit-for-purpose socialisation area is required because, as I said, children currently have to sit on the floor to eat their lunches.<\/p> <p>At a time when Departments are rightly concerned with health and safety, being active, mental health and well-being and at a time that the Department is introducing physical education, PE, as a leaving certificate subject, St. Aidan's has no gymnasium.  The school has a strong sporting tradition with many staff coaching teams after school.  However, if it rains, teams cannot play.  With increased numbers seeking to use the school hall for PE at the same time, some of the group are forced to go to a classroom to study as there is no space for them.<\/p> <p>St. Aidan's is a school that has embraced well-being, creating awareness of the need for a healthy lifestyle and encouraging active participation by all, especially girls, yet their PE classes frequently have to take place behind desks in a classroom.  As an inclusive school, St. Aidan's opens up its facilities, such as they are, to the local community and many groups, including the Holy Family school, with which I am sure the Minister of State is familiar from his visit to the area, use the facilities on a weekly basis.  Local football teams and organisations frequently have to use the school facilities in the evenings.  Proper gym facilities are needed to develop even stronger links with the clubs and local groups in the community.  The town of Cootehill has no indoor facility and this would be a significant contribution to the resources that are available to the people of Cootehill, which is located in a disadvantaged area.<\/p> <p>The school does not close its facilities at 4 p.m.  It opens its doors 24-7 to the entire community and the community at large would benefit if the funding was allocated so that they can upgrade their building to a decent standard.  It is clearly a progressive and fast-moving school with many more students hoping to enrol.  Very little investment, if any, has been given to the school since it was built back in the early 1990s.  I had the pleasure of visiting the school last week and I was hugely impressed by the principal, Mary Ann Smith, the staff and the students.  The staff are totally dedicated to their students and their working conditions are an insult to them as professionals and, indeed, to the students who have to put up with them.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could bring back the message to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, that serious consideration should be given to providing much-needed funding for this school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112100002#D00400","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1574332200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue as it gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the plans of the Department of Education and Skills for upgrading school buildings including St. Aidan's comprehensive school, Cootehill, County Cavan.  St Aidan's is a co-educational comprehensive school under Catholic patronage.  There are currently 493 pupils enrolled in the school.  I know, from what the Senator has said, that it is an inclusive and progressive school that deserves our support.<\/p> <p>The Department's planning and building unit received an application from St Aidan's seeking funding for a new PE hall, socialisation space and extension to woodwork construction room and this application is being considered.  The immediate priority of the Department is providing 20,000 new and replacement school places each year to ensure that every child has a school place.  As the Senator is aware, the Department will be investing &euro;8.4 billion in school buildings over the lifetime of Project Ireland 2040.  This investment will see a 70% increase in the school building budget which will be targeted at delivering on the twin objectives of catering for the continued increase in demographics and a greater focus on refurbishment and upgrade of existing school stock. <\/p> <p>The Government remains committed to delivering on existing projects on the school building programme.  Project Ireland 2040 provides the investment necessary to implement the commitments in the Action Plan for Education to reform and modernise the school curriculum by committing to a PE hall build and modernisation programme, starting in the second half of the Project Ireland 2040 period, that ensures that students in all post-primary schools have access to state-of-the-art facilities to support PE provision, particularly in the context of the roll-out of PE as a leaving certificate subject. <\/p> <p>During 2018 and 2019, the capital budget is facilitating extensions and new schools being delivered as part of the roll-out of Project Ireland 2040, which involved overall construction activity during 2018 and 2019 of approximately 130 large-scale projects ranging in value from &euro;1 million to projects in excess of &euro;20 million.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Finian McGrath:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There was also in excess of 280 projects with a project value of less than &euro;1 million at construction during this period.  All of these projects are expected to deliver more than 40,000 permanent, additional and replacement school places and replace about 600 prefabs.  This will make significant progress in terms of providing modern, energy efficient school facilities and the replacement of temporary accommodation.<br\/><br\/>In addition, in April 2018 the Department of Education and Skills announced that 42 new schools would be established between 2019 and 2022 in areas of population growth.  The focus in 2019 is on start-up interim accommodation for the 19 schools opening in September 2019.<br\/><br\/>I can also confirm to the Senator that the Department is in receipt of an application from the school for the summer works scheme 2020 onwards for category 9, fabric defects.  Commensurate with the level of funding available for the summer works scheme 2020 onwards, all applications will be assessed on a top-down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria outlined in the governing circular letter for the scheme.

I certainly have no objection to the Order of Business and it is quite in order.  I request that the Leader arrange an early debate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, on transport matters.  Would it be possible to have a questions and answers session rather than statements, which are not all that helpful if everybody makes a contribution but there is no real response?  Will the Leader consider doing this at his earliest convenience and before Christmas, if possible?<\/p> <p>I take the opportunity to raise the issue of overcrowding on the Heuston Station to Westport train route.  Senator John O'Mahony might agree with me on this.  It is a good quality service and very punctual, although it was a few minutes late today.  I was not on it but I heard it was a few minutes late.  Generally it is an excellent and timely service, with clean carriages and free Wi-Fi.  The accommodation is inadequate, however, as there are not enough carriages on the train.  I have seen people standing from Heuston to Westport, which is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>There is a good arrangement with prebooking but this can also cause friction on trains.  When people prebook seats, there should be a certain number of seats retained for people who travel without reservations as well because some people may not have access to a computer or have the ability to book a seat.  These are small points I will make in the engagement with the Minister.  Senator O'Mahony might also agree with me in requesting a later service from Dublin, perhaps at 8.15 p.m. during the week.  Many people commute from the likes of Athlone and Portarlington, for example.<\/p> <p>I also request the upgrading of stations along the route.  I initiated a pilot scheme with the Roscommon town team chaired by Mr. Larry Brennan and my colleague and daughter, Councillor Orla Leyden, to provide designed displays of what is in Roscommon.  It is a pilot and the same could happen in Ballyhaunis, Westport or elsewhere.  The displays would be well-designed and in Irish and English, of course, saying what is in the town.  Roscommon town has a Norman castle and is the burial place of the last high king of Connacht, etc.  Next year is the 160th anniversary of Roscommon station opening and it would be a special time to upgrade the facilities.  A railway station is a gateway to a town and a way to sell it.  One can sell a town through roads but there is a very captive audience going through all these towns.  It is a positive suggestion and there has been tremendous co-operation from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann staff at the highest level with this initiative.  It has been funded by a scheme under the town team.<\/p> <p>There is also much overcrowding on the Luas.  I was the victim of a pickpocket on 21 October, losing my wallet and all my credit cards.  I got great help from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but, unfortunately, the closed-circuit television cameras were not working on the Luas on that day.  If they had been working, I would have available to scrutinise the footage to see if I could identify the culprit.  It was so crowded on that day, we were like sardines.  I compliment the extension of the Luas but we must look at this again.  It is a victim of its own success.  It is a tremendous service and it has made Dublin a city that people can get around very quickly.  I wish it well.  I thank the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who acted in a professional and speedy way to deal with the matter.  The garda&iacute; were from Store Street and elsewhere.  When they went to the company that runs the Luas, the CCTV was not working.

As we well know, this has worsened over the years with the loss of experience aviators, technicians, and air traffic controllers.  The squadron that has kept the emergency air ambulance running since 2012 is down to two crews when it is supposed to have ten.  Nevertheless, in 2015, the White Paper on Defence stated the emergency air ambulance service should be made permanent and sustainable, and a project group was to be set up by the Department but this has never happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112100002#G00800","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1574332200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt the Senator but we had a debate on this the other day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112100002#G00900","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1574332200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I called for a debate but the Minister of State did not engage by providing answers.

If it can be addressed when the child is four or, more likely, five years of age in the school system, their patterns of school attendance will be greatly increased.  If poor attendance has been embedded in the child's school experience until the age of six, before their legal requirement to be in school, that pattern of poor attendance will continue.  I ask that the Minister would make herself available to come into the House to discuss the passage of this Bill, which she and the Government support.  It is important that we see that legislation passed.<\/p> <p>Second, I want to put on the record of the House how disappointed I am with rhetoric coming from various by-election campaign candidates.

The principal aim of the Bill is to improve registration and fitness to practise processes in the health professional regulatory bodies and to amend their Acts in accordance with the modernised professional qualifications directive.<\/p> <p>While the Bill was widely supported by the parties in the D&aacute;il, Deputies raised concerns on Committee and Report Stages about the mandatory publication of all sanctions and the additional cost and publicity associated with High Court confirmation of minor sanctions.  On Report Stage, a commitment was given to review this and I am pleased to advise that significant progress has been made.  Officials from my Department have been liaising with the unions, the professional representative bodies and the health regulators.  While these discussions have not yet concluded, proposals are at an advanced stage and I intend to introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  As Senators will appreciate, I must balance the necessity to achieve public protection and enhanced transparency in professional regulation with the legitimate concerns of registrants who receive a minor sanction.  I am confident that this balance can be achieved and I look forward to discussing the finalised amendments in more detail with Senators on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>This is largely a technical Bill containing seven Parts and 179 sections.  The Bill amends the five health professional regulatory Acts, which are the Dentists Act 1985, the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, the Pharmacy Act 2007, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011.  Many of the Bill's provisions are intended to be common across the five regulatory Acts.  The Bill also makes some minor amendments to the Health Act 1953, the Health Act 2004, the Health Identifiers Act 2014 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.<\/p> <p>The Bill contains a number of measures intended to improve and streamline the fitness to practise procedures employed by the five regulators.  With the increased mobility of health professionals, the importance of maintaining patient safety, while supporting professional mobility, is ever important.  Additional grounds of complaint are being introduced.  These additional grounds will mean that a complaint can be made against a person who has a restriction or prohibition on the provision of one or more than one kind of health or social care service in Ireland or in another jurisdiction.  This will mean, for example, that a complaint can be made against a person who has had a restriction or prohibition on his practice as a doctor, but who may be practising in the State as a dentist by virtue of his separate qualifications and registration in that field.<\/p> <p>Amendments are also being made to the fitness to practise provisions of the five Acts to provide that regulatory bodies can use disciplinary information from other countries in fitness to practise cases in Ireland.  Currently, the modernised professional qualifications directive provides important mechanisms for alerting health regulators across Europe when a sanction has been applied.  However, under the directive there is no obligation on third countries to share information on restrictions or prohibitions on the practice of health professionals in their jurisdictions.  It is important that the regulators are aware of such restrictions or prohibitions on the practice of any registrant or applicant for registration, including those from third countries.  This will be especially important in respect of the UK post Brexit.  The Bill, therefore, provides that all regulated health professionals will be required to make declarations at registration and annually thereafter regarding any restrictions or prohibitions on their practice in this State or another state, as well as any relevant proceedings that are pending or in process.  It is important to note that the health regulators have been actively engaging with their UK counterparts to ensure that robust mechanisms will be in place for the exchange of information post Brexit, and the Bill includes provisions to ensure compliance with data protection legislation.<\/p> <p>The five Acts also provide that information on sanctions is notified to the Minister, the HSE and the employer, where known.  The Bill is removing the requirement for the Minister to receive such notifications, as the Acts specify no function or legal powers associated with receipt.  Notification to the HSE and employer will remain.  Currently, information on sanctions imposed by each of the five regulators is published if the regulator is satisfied that publication is in the public interest.  The Bill sought to change this and, when initiated, it provided that all sanctions imposed in the State would be published.  Concerns were subsequently raised by the health professions' representative bodies about vulnerable registrants and on Committee Stage an amendment was introduced to provide for publication unless the court determines otherwise.  The provisions on the publication of sanctions continued to be a matter of debate during the Bill's passage through the D&aacute;il and, as I indicated earlier, it is intended to address these in detail on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>The Bill includes a number of amendments intended to increase the effectiveness of the fitness to practise processes.  Currently, under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011, complaints are directed to the preliminary proceedings committee for investigation, and progress on investigations is dependent to an extent on the scheduling of committee meetings.  To expedite investigations, the Bill provides that complaints will be made to the chief executive officer, CEO, and will be investigated prior to being referred to the preliminary proceedings committee for decision.  This will shorten the time to process complaints and will mean the preliminary proceedings committee's time can be used more efficiently in making decisions on complaints.  This will be of benefit to the regulator, the complainant, the registrant, witnesses and, ultimately, the public.<\/p> <p>Another important provision is the separation of qualification recognition from registration in those Acts where it is not currently provided, namely, the Dentists Act 1985 and the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  These Acts currently provide that a professional whose qualification has been recognised must be registered.  Separating qualification recognition from registration will allow these regulators to introduce language and fit-and-proper person checks prior to registration and will enable the regulators to take the appropriate action where these checks are not satisfactory.  Additional changes provided by the Bill include an amendment to the Health Act 1953 to remove specific requirements regarding the composition of interview boards for medical consultant posts.  These requirements are an unnecessary burden and do not lend themselves to efficient recruitment processes.<\/p> <p>A number of amendments were made to the Bill during its passage through the D&aacute;il.  These include changing CORU's fitness to practise process from three stages to two stages to bring it into line with that of the other health regulators.  This additional step generates a significant cost and delay and places an administrative burden on the regulator.  Its removal will significantly improve the fitness to practise sanction process for CORU registrants.<\/p> <p>A Committee Stage amendment was also sought to create an eligibility for registration on the specialist division of the Medical Council's register by a small cohort of medical practitioners who were correctly appointed to consultant posts prior to 2008.  These medical practitioners, for various reasons, did not avail of a grandfathering provision provided for them to register in the specialist division when the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 was enacted.  The amendment provides that a consultant must have been correctly appointed to his or her post under the terms in operation by the HSE in 2008 and must satisfy competency requirements for registration by the Medical Council.  This amendment benefited from close examination on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and I am pleased to advise Senators that suggestions proposed by the Opposition spokespersons were taken on board and agreed on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>Following publication of the Bill, concerns were notified to my Department about some possible unintended consequences relating to the composition of committees of the Nursing and Midwifery Board associated with the Bill's drafting.  These were addressed by amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  The Bill was also amended to give the Minister the power under the Health Act 2004 to designate the HSE as the competent authority under the professional qualifications directive to compare the equivalence of non-Irish qualifications to the qualifications the HSE sets.  This applies for certain health professions which are not regulated on a statutory basis, but which are regulated for the purposes of the directive.  The professions which currently come within the scope of the directive are those of audiologist and environmental health officer.<\/p> <p>These are the Bill's key provisions and the changes since its initiation in the D&aacute;il.  I look forward to discussing the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112100002#P00100","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1574332200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill.  It seeks to offer patients reassurance by allowing public access to all sanctions handed down to medical practitioners.  This is to ensure the public has access to information about disciplinary sanctions that have been imposed on doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists and other regulated health professionals.  The Bill will also give health professionals the right to appeal minor sanctions.  The measures to speed up processes to recruit consultants are also welcome, but the main barrier to tackling the 479 consultant vacancies is the discriminatory pay practices against post-2012 recruits.<\/p> <p>The Bill amends the five health professional regulatory Acts, particularly with regard to fitness to practise and registration.  At the most basic level, the Bill will ensure clinicians will inform patients of previous professional issues, which is to be welcomed.  It will ensure that doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists and other health professionals will, by law, have to supply details of sanctions imposed on them.  It also means that any allegation of wrongdoing in another country can be used as evidence in fitness to practise proceedings in Ireland.  Crucially, patients will have more access to information on the people treating them as all the details will be made public.  Patients will also be able to look up the history of their treating clinician, which is very welcome.<\/p> <p>There has always been an imbalance of power in Ireland, and elsewhere, between doctors and patients.  Sick patients are vulnerable and worried.  They attend medical professionals whom they hope have all the information and knowledge.  It is a completely unequal relationship.  In some cases, the doctors involved have been struck off in other jurisdictions and should never have been practising in this country.  In other cases, the doctors involved had numerous complaints made against them over many years.  This tiny number of people were going about their business destroying people's lives.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These people found out afterwards that there had been complaints against these doctors for decades but nobody ever knew and they had no way of finding out.

Thankfully, this is only about a tiny number of people but a tiny number of people can cause extraordinary pain.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, I am glad the Bill provides for clinicians to appeal against minor sanctions and this aspect can be further improved.  My understanding is that they must go to the High Court, which is a pretty high bar for anyone and will include God knows what legal expense along the way.  Is it possible to find a way for such appeals to happen with a lower bar than the High Court, although still with the highest level of scrutiny?  I believe the High Court is too burdensome.  Let us do that but let us also find a way to ensure the money and scarce resources that should be spent on healthcare is not flittered away on the legal profession.  It is critical that scarce resources are spent where they should be spent, which is on the patients, as I am sure the Minister of State will agree. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112100002#P00200","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574332200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>The Bill relates to the transposition of an EU directive on the recognition of professional qualifications, which was agreed under the Irish Presidency of the European Union in 2013.  It is important that we transpose these directives, especially with the looming prospect of Brexit, as referenced by the Minister of State, and that we provide the mechanism for the recognition of professional qualifications.  Within the context of the recruitment and retention crisis in our health services, this will be all the more important given the system and staff are under stress and there are staff shortages.  Therefore, we are looking to employ many more people from within the country and outside it, and we need to make sure they are who they say they are.<\/p> <p>When working in my profession, I had experience of some difficult situations where unions and staff were involved.  It can be quite traumatic within a smaller setting if somebody is believed not to be professionally qualified but has slipped through the net.  I am probably talking about one person in tens of thousands but it has happened.  Hopefully, we will get the correct professionals to do the right job in a very professional manner.<\/p> <p>I recognise our colleagues in the Lower House have done a lot of work on this Bill and I welcome the joint effort.  The strengthening of registration and regulation of health professionals gives the roles, and the people who do them with such integrity and service, the respect they deserve.  I am happy to support this Bill, although I have a few points to raise and I would appreciate a response from the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>During the Bill's progression through the D&aacute;il, there was major debate around the publication of minor sanctions.  I know many representative bodies are not happy with the automatic publication of minor sanctions and, obviously, this is a big change as it does not happen currently.  The worry is not so much about the increased transparency but there is a balance to be struck between public interest and protection of a worker's privacy.  I represented people at fitness to practice hearings from a trade union perspective.  It was little old me and the nurse against a boardroom-full of An Bord Altranais people with a barrister and a lawyer for each individual on the board.  Facing that, there was little old me and I did not know too much about the law, although I was willing to fight for somebody in order to ensure due process.  I do not make a comment on whether I believed that person has done right or wrong and that is up to the fitness to practice hearing.  However, it does seem overwhelming.  If we allow these minor sanctions to be publicised, we know what trial by media is like, including social media and the ordinary media such as the newspapers.  Even if the person is found not to have infringed on professional practice and there is no case to answer, there is always the reputational damage within the medical circle, which is small and cosy enough for a lot of that stuff to go around.<\/p> <p>There needs to be room for more discretion where publication might not be in anybody's interest and we need to define what those areas would be.  Has the Minister of State considered this point since the debate in the Lower House?  I may table amendments at a later stage and we can perhaps work together on that.<\/p> <p>I take the opportunity to reference the plight of professional pharmaceutical assistants, who face an uncertain future due to changes to be brought forward by the implementation of new rules restricting the amount of time they can cover for a temporarily absent pharmacist to one hour per day.  The livelihood of 248 women, mostly in their 50s, with an average of 35 years' experience, are at risk because of these proposed new rules.  The best way to address the concerns of the professionals is for them to be registered by the relevant body and to have oversight and regulation by that body, which means any issues can be overcome.  The relevant bodies have maintained they could not properly regulate for assistants because of the 2007 Act as it stands, so the inclusion of amendments to the Bill could rectify the assistants' position under the Act.<\/p> <p>Under section 29 of the Bill, which amends section 38 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act, the title of \"physical therapist\" is effectively left unprotected until December 2021.  I note the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists has been in contact with the Minister of State's office on this matter and has expressed its frustration and concern at the title being exposed for such a length of time.  There are very few people, it would seem, who have yet to register with that Physiotherapists Registration Board.  Could those people be reached out to directly and instructed to register with the board as soon as possible so the title can be protected in a much shorter time than slightly more than one year?  All those entitled to register thereby would be re-registered.  A small bit of outreach work in this regard would ensure all those who need to register with the board as physical therapists could do so within a short time.  Will the Minister of State consider this?  Such outreach work could be co-ordinated by the necessary organisations and the Department.<\/p> <p>In the D&aacute;il, Deputy O'Reilly tabled an amendment on Report Stage which would ensure that, as part of preliminary proceedings or the fitness to practice committees, there would be a member of the profession on which the adjudication is being made.  For example, there would be a nurse where the adjudication was on a nurse and a midwife where the adjudication was on a midwife.  I have just related my story of what seemed to be the little people going in to an execution, with an overbearing jury of highly trained, well paid legal individuals advising each individual member of the board.  It seems unbalanced and lopsided, and if a person felt they had a small friend on one side, or not even a friend but somebody who understands the mechanisms of what nursing is on a day-to-day basis and the context of alleged misdemeanours or unprofessional acts, it would be more balanced and fairer.  The Minister gave assurances this would be dealt with.  I wish to reiterate the point and ask if he has worked on this issue since the debate in the Lower House.<\/p> <p>Overall, the Bill is to be welcomed.  I am happy to see this work progress and I look forward to working with the Minister of State to get the Bill through Committee Stage and the remaining Stages over the coming weeks.  The priority is safety and safe practice by all healthcare staff, which is paramount for those seeking treatment in our health services.  While I cannot emphasise that enough, we also need due process and fair practice when dealing with the situations and issues that may arise. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019112100002#Q00200","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1574332200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for attending and for this important legislation.

This is very important legislation which is about ensuring there will be standards.  It is about public safety and access to information.  It is also about people being able to have confidence in the health system.  If we look at the bodies about which we are talking such as the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, the Dental Council and the Medical Council, we can see that they are important.  If we are  honest, many of us are contacted by health professionals who have issues with registration and other matters and the Medical Council.  It is about publicising information.  If a doctor has a conviction in a different country, I do not see anything wrong with making that information known as people have a right to information.  Senator Devine has said we must take into account the need for privacy in the case of a minor misdemeanour or event.  We must be careful because we cannot whitewash everybody, but it is about ensuring information will be provided as we are all for transparency.  It is also about ensuring people will have confidence.  Giving regulatory bodies such as the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland and the Medical Council a role in that regard is important.  Equally, we should look again at the role and remit of the competency committee.  I welcome the commitments given by the Minister, but there is a need for more regulation in dealing with certain issues.  I will speak next week about cosmetic surgery.

We have had these debates on Committee Stage in the Lower House.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher spoke about the appeals process.  My concern is that it would introduce another layer on the journey and lengthen it because, ultimately, in having an in-between layer of appeal matters would end up being challenged and going to the High Court and the Supreme Court, if necessary.  I am concerned about lengthening the period of time involved in the vindication of somebody's good name.  It would be an additional layer of cost.  The difficulty is if the substantive issues involve points of law, they must be appealed to the court.  I am willing to engage further with the Senator and his party in both Houses between on the point, but I wish to flag my concerns in that regard.  <\/p> <p>I am familiar with the three issues raised by Senator Devine involving pharmacists and psychotherapists and the publication of information.

The interpretation of \"physical therapist\" is causing more concern than is necessary, but through dialogue with the Minister, officials, the Senator and the representative bodies, we can allay the fears expressed.
