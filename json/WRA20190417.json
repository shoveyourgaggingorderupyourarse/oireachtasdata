As a result, Ireland continues to be one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. I would like to stress that while the headline GDP figure can be exaggerated in an Irish context, other indicators such as consumer spending, modified domestic demand, along with taxation receipts confirm the robust growth in our economy.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Our economic health is most clearly evident in the labour market with more people working in Ireland than ever before (2.28 million) and the unemployment rate is now significantly below that of other Euro Area countries. The outlook for the economy remains positive over the coming years, with modified domestic demand, a more meaningful measure of underlying economic activity in Ireland, is\u00a0set to expand by 4.0 per cent this year and 3.3 per cent next year.<\/p>  <p>  The strength of our economy, in part, reflects the important steps we have taken to improve our competitiveness. Since 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 22 per cent. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The restoration of competitiveness has been hard-won through improvements in productivity, along with wage and price moderation. However we cannot become complacent. As the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) highlighted in its recent report, there remains a number of bottlenecks at a sectorial level which impact on Ireland's cost competitiveness.\u00a0  <\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. For 2018 as a whole, Ireland&rsquo;s inflation averaged just 0.7 per cent, this compares to an average inflation rate of 1.9 per cent for the EU as a whole. The comparatively low level of inflation in Ireland should help to maintain our competitiveness and protect real wage growth. <\/p>  <p>  On wage developments, while average hourly earnings grew at 3 per cent in 2018, a noticeable increase on the growth rate of 1.7 per cent recorded in 2017, this came on the back of a near decade of low or negative growth in earnings. The rise in household incomes is a welcome development, however it needs to be monitored closely to avoid a significant acceleration in wages, which may undermine Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness\u00a0relative to other European countries. <\/p>  <p>  Despite the positive outlook for our economy, the risks over the coming years are numerous and primarily external in nature. The best way we can mitigate against these risks is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies. Through the National Development Plan in particular, we are investing significantly to address the bottlenecks to growth which emerged during the recovery, such as the need for housing and public infrastructure investment. This should ensure that our economy remains competitive and avoid the build-up of bottlenecks that could limit our growth potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700059#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700059#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[17765\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700059#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he plans to bring forward legislation on the regulation of personal contract plans as recommended by the review of regulation on personal contract plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>As I have indicated previously to the Deputy, it is important to keep the market for the provision of financial services under review to ensure that the level of consumer protection continues to be robust.\u00a0 In this context, last summer I asked Mr. Michael Tutty to conduct a review of the PCP market and regulatory structure and his report was subsequently published by my Department in November.\u00a0 That report found that there was currently no evidence of significant consumer detriment arising from PCPs but nevertheless it set out a number of conclusions and recommendations to help avoid possible problems arising in the future.\u00a0 Among these it suggested that legal advice should be obtained on, inter alia, the precise legal status of PCPs and on the scope and means of ensuring that relevant provisions of the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code, should apply to the providers of PCP agreements to consumers.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently consulting the Office of the Attorney General on these queries and it is expected that a response will shortly be received.\u00a0 When it is to hand and in the light of the content of the advice, my Department will then further engage with the Central Bank, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on the further steps as may be required or desirable, such as the need for additional legislation, in order to advance the Tutty Report recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700059#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Union Lending","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700059#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[17724\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700059#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he is taking and the progress being made in establishing a mechanism that would allow and facilitate funds from an organisation (details supplied) to be invested in social housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>This is a question that has been asked, and answered, many times.

The paper is based on CSO data up to 2017, the latest year available. <\/p>  <p>  While there is\u00a0a perception that institutional investors are purchasing large amounts of housing stock, the data show that their activity has been limited in the context of the overall housing market.\u00a0 In 2017 &mdash; the latest year for which we have data &ndash; firms in this category were net purchasers of just 1 per cent of residential sales, or just over 500 units. Furthermore, from 2010 to 2017, net purchases by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), real estate funds and private equity firms were less than 0.01 per cent of available units, or just 380 units.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the tax treatment of such entities, the\u00a0function of the REIT\u00a0framework for example, is not to provide an overall tax exemption. It is to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle. REITs are required to distribute 85% of their property profits each year for taxation at the level of the shareholder and Dividend Withholding Tax is collected on the distributions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) regime was introduced in Finance Act 2016 as a result of concerns raised in both the media and the D&aacute;il regarding the activities of certain non-resident investors in the Irish property market.

This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research. Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.<\/p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (\"CFRAM\") Programme. The CFRAM Programme focussed on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (\"AFAs\") including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in Flood Risk Management Plans. The Plans set out the flood relief schemes that have already been constructed and those that are currently underway. The Plans also provide the outline of 118 proposed schemes that can protect a further 11,500 properties and the evidence to prioritise their delivery to where its benefit is greatest. OPW have informed us that they and Local Authorities will work closely together on the all of the projects to ensure that they are all implemented in the lifetime of the Programme.<\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to believe that its existing policy and investment in relation to flooding which is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems is the best way forward. This commitment is underpinned by a significant capital works investment programme by the OPW and Local Authorities, and complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The nature of this arrangement is such that it has led to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas. For instance, the most recent Insurance Ireland survey in March 2019 of approximately 87% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of the completed defence schemes, 95% of policies in areas benefitting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while 74% of policies in areas benefitting from demountable defences include flood cover. It should be noted that my Department is continuing to actively examine what can be done to increase the level of cover in areas with demountable defences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700059#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Exemptions","counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700059#WRB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[17646\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700059#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the precedent set by his predecessor (details supplied) in which his predecessor intervened in a decision by the Revenue Commissioners to impose VAT on herbal teas in 2014 which resulted in the abandonment of the proposed VAT imposition; if he has given consideration to intervening in the proposed imposition of 23% VAT on food supplements planned to commence on 1 March 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[17647\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700059#WRB02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to intervene to defer the planned imposition of 23% VAT on food supplements until a review of the impact of same on small businesses and employees has taken place, in view of the impending effect of Brexit in addition to the VAT hike; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":31,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 63 together.<\/p>  <p>  The background to the issue is that VAT legislation does not apply the zero rate of VAT to food supplements but shortly after the introduction of VAT Revenue applied a concessionary zero rating to certain vitamin, mineral and fish oil food supplement products. As the market developed this treatment resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products. \u00a0However, it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. <\/p>  <p>  After undertaking a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable and issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019.

This will allow time for the enactment of any legislative changes in the context of Budget 2020. The Deputy referred to the example of the change in the VAT treatment of herbal teas.

The Commission of Investigation is under the remit of the Department of Taoiseach and the former Minister for Finance and Department of Finance Officials are the subject of one of the terms of reference. Therefore, it is not appropriate for me to comment extensively. The Commission's terms of reference and interim report are available on the Merrion Street website. Neither call for a suspension of NAMA's activities.\u00a0The Commission's final report is scheduled to be published by the end June 2019.<\/p>  <p>It is important to note that in no way has the integrity of NAMA or the NAMA Board or the integrity of its decisions been brought into question in relation to the disposal of Project Eagle. I therefore have no intention of directing NAMA to halt its activities. To do so would irreparably damage NAMA's positive contribution to our recovery and damage our reputation as a credible, open and transparent market. By extension, any such interference would be detrimental to the interests of Irish taxpayers.<\/p>  <p>  The decision of the Oireachtas in 2009 to allow NAMA to carry out its functions in an independent manner has been vindicated by its strong performance since inception. In October 2017 it eliminated the Irish taxpayers' contingent liability of &euro;30 billion which arose from the senior debt issued in order to acquire bank loan portfolios.\u00a0 NAMA also expects to redeem its subordinated debt by March 2020 and to produce a surplus &ndash; currently estimated at &euro;3.5 billion &ndash; by the time it completes its work subject to continued positive market performance.<\/p>  <p>  Halting NAMA&rsquo;s activities would put these achievements at risk. It would entail the State taking direct control of NAMA and bring NAMA onto the State&rsquo;s balance sheet.

In this regard, there has been some sectors of our economy such as play centres where because of these aforementioned factors, insurance cover has either become unavailable or prohibitively expensive. <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, in order to create a more competitive environment, the Government is focussing on implementing the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) including those of the second Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) Report which concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in England and Wales (4.4 times) and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The current position with the Judicial Council Bill is that the Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that he hopes\u00a0to have this Bill enacted by the summer.\u00a0 In this regard, it recently completed Committee Stage in the Seanad.\u00a0 Alongside this, the Law Reform Commission has included the subject of capping damages in personal injuries litigation in its draft 5th Programme of Law Reform and this work will begin shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700060#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700060#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[17793\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700060#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the use of fixed assets receivers by vulture funds and State-owned banks to force the sale of buy-to-let properties in arrears; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, there\u00a0is an extensive array of\u00a0regulatory protections for borrowers who are in arrears under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank, such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012 and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA).

The result of this is that in certain parts of the economy such as play centres, insurers are withdrawing altogether as they argue they are incurring losses in these areas <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products.\u00a0 However it was recognised that the State could play a role in improving the environment within which insurers operate, thus explaining why the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was established in July 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The CIWG has produced two reports and a series of quarterly progress updates on the various recommendations made by CIWG and endorsed by Government.\u00a0 The difficulties facing the consumer, voluntary and small business sector from the high cost of insurance premiums are acknowledged in these reports. <\/p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the CIWG was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) which was asked to examine amongst other things award levels in this country compared with elsewhere. \u00a0The PIC reported in September 2018 and concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in England and Wales (4.4 times) and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council.\u00a0 The PIC recommended that this body would become responsible for preparing the guidelines on personal injury award levels, and would replace the Book of Quantum. <\/p>  <p>  The current position with the Judicial Council Bill is that the Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that he intends having it enacted by the summer.\u00a0 In this regard, it recently completed Committee Stage in the Seanad.\u00a0 Alongside this, the Law Reform Commission has included the subject of capping damages in personal injuries litigation in its draft 5th Programme of Law Reform and this work will begin shortly.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the investigation of insurance fraud by the Garda&iacute;, Minister of State D'Arcy has\u00a0been in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner.

Other considerations include the potential for deadweight costs, the potential cost of the tax revenue foregone to the Exchequer and the scope for abuse. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention. I must be mindful of the many demands on the Exchequer and the need to maintain a broad base of taxation.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, in Finance Act 2018, and with effect from 1 January 2019, I provided for the full restoration of the amount of interest that may be deducted by landlords in respect of loans used to purchase, improve or repair their residential property, as a means to support the rental sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700060#WRC05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":97,"content":"<p>Question No. 79 answered with Question No. 66.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry Tax Reliefs","counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700060#WRC05500"},{"type":"question","counter":99,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[17825\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700060#WRC05600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if film producers who apply for and receive section 481 tax relief are responsible to ensure that the requirement to provide quality employment and training is met and have legal responsibility for employees and trainees on film productions funded by section 481 and that those legal responsibilities carry over from production to production in cases in which the same producer is involved; his views on whether the resulting number of jobs being created in the film industry is a small fraction of the number previously claimed by industry representatives in testimony and submissions to the Houses of the Oireachtas in view of the annual tax expenditure of &euro;70 to &euro;80 million on section 481; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":100,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[16759\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700060#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the penalties which will be imposed on film producers in receipt of section 481 tax relief that are found to have breached the legal rights of workers; if these will include withdrawal of the tax relief and other public funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":101,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 89 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a number of amendments were made to Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 as part of Finance Act 2018. I would like to advise the Deputy that I signed the regulations and commencement order that give effect to the 2018 changes on the 27th of March.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most significant changes I made relates to the potential for inflated claims.

This undertaking is required to be signed and furnished with every section 481 application.<\/p>  <p>  If a producer does not comply with the employment and skills development requirements set out by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, including compliance with the undertaking, they are not eligible for the corporation tax credit.\u00a0 Any amount already claimed will be recoverable, with interest.\u00a0 As the claim for tax relief is made by the producer on a self assessment basis, in each case consideration would have to be given to Revenue&rsquo;s Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and other Compliance Interventions to determine whether or not penalties and publication may arise.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to numbers employed within the Industry, the Revenue Commissioners, from section 481 applications in 2016, estimate the number of employees directly engaged in Section 481 productions to be 2,158 (full time equivalents).\u00a0 My Department in carrying out the Section 481\u00a0cost benefit analysis in 2018 estimated that there were a further 902 indirect employments giving a total of 3,060 full time equivalents associated with Section 481 projects in that year.\u00a0 It must be emphasised that these figures relate specifically to projects in receipt of the section 481 tax credit, whereas some other figures quoted refer to the wider audio-visual and radio sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700060#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Registration","counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700060#WRC05900"},{"type":"question","counter":103,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[17649\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700060#WRC06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason for the difference in the VAT registration threshold for the sale of services versus the sale of goods; if the anomaly will be reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":104,"content":"<p>VAT is governed by the EU VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006\/112\/EC), with which Irish VAT law must comply.

The all-island economy is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the joint ESRI and Department of Finance research, a range of alternative scenarios were considered given the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. The study finds that, compared to a no Brexit baseline, the level of GDP in Ireland ten years after Brexit would be around 2.6 per cent lower in a Deal scenario and 5.0 per cent lower in a Disorderly No-Deal scenario respectively. This assessment shows that all Brexit scenarios will imply a slower pace of growth with negative consequences throughout the economy.<\/p>  <p>  This slower growth will have a negative impact on the labour market.

In that regard, a key recommendation of the CIWG was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) which was asked to examine amongst other things award levels in this country compared with elsewhere. \u00a0The PIC reported in September 2018 and concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in England and Wales (4.4 times) and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council.\u00a0 The PIC recommended that this body would become responsible for preparing the guidelines on personal injury award levels, and would replace the Book of Quantum. <\/p>  <p>  The current position with the Judicial Council Bill is that the Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that he hopes to have\u00a0the legislation enacted by the summer.\u00a0 In this regard, it recently completed Committee Stage in the Seanad.\u00a0 Alongside this, the Law Reform Commission has included the subject of capping damages in personal injuries litigation in its draft 5th Programme of Law Reform and this work will begin shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I expect that insurers&rsquo; pricing of premiums in general will take account of the measures which have been, and are being, implemented as a result of the CIWG recommendations more broadly and I believe that insurers themselves recognise this.\u00a0 In this regard, I would recall that Justice Nicholas Kearns, the Chairperson of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC), noted in the foreword of its second report that insurance industry representatives on the PIC repeatedly stated that, as award levels and associated costs account for the bulk of the cost of insurance, if claims costs come down and are maintained at a consistent and predictable level, then premiums will also reduce accordingly.\u00a0 A further public statement by insurers to this effect would assist in efforts to continue the necessary reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700061#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Data","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700061#WRD04700"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[18039\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700061#WRD04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to which his Department can forecast economic prospects over the next five years in view of the variety of potential challenges globally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":160,"content":"<p>The Irish economy continues to grow at a robust pace, with annual GDP growth of 6.7 per cent in 2018. However, over the last number of months uncertainty in the external environment has increased substantially.\u00a0 The pace of growth has slowed in Ireland's key export markets, with a loss of momentum particularly evident in both the euro area and the UK. Accordingly the Department of Finance has revised down its forecast, relative to Budget 2019, for GDP by a quarter of a percentage point this year and next.<\/p>  <p>  As published in the Stability Programme Update for 2019, my Department is forecasting GDP growth of 3.9 per cent this year and 3.3 per cent next year. Over the medium term, GDP is expected to at around 2 1\/2 per cent, with positive contributions from both net exports and domestic demand.<\/p>  <p>  As regards Brexit, the Department&rsquo;s projections assume that a transition period will be agreed that extends or replicates existing frameworks until end-2020, i.e. the UK is assumed to remain in the single market and customs union during this period.\u00a0 From 2021 onwards, the baseline forecasts assume that the EU and UK conclude a trade agreement. This form of agreement results in any lower level of GDP over the 2021-2023 period relative to a hypothetical no-Brexit baseline scenario.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the relatively positive outlook for our economy, the risks over the coming years are numerous and primarily external in nature. First and foremost is the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. Secondly, given Ireland&rsquo;s position as a small open economy with a high degree of integration in global value chains, any further disruption to trade or a slowdown in global growth would have a disproportionate impact on the Irish economy. Over the medium term, the principal risks relate to potential overheating as the economy approaches full-employment.<\/p>  <p>  The best way we can mitigate against these risks is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700061#WRD04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":161,"content":"<p>Question No. 102 answered with Question No. 94.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700061#WRD05200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Monuments","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700061#WRD05100"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[17904\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700061#WRD05200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans for a site (details supplied); when it will be operational; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>Bunadober Mill (also known as Moran's Mill) is a National Monument in State care since 1996 and responsibility for its maintenance and protection falls to the Office of Public Works.The Mill is a surviving example of vernacular rural industrial heritage which contains a particularly notable horizontal mill wheel and other historically-important mill machinery.<\/p><p>The strategic aim is to conserve and protect the mill complex in its current form and to allow for the future presentation of the site to the visiting public.To this end, the\u00a0OPW has been undertaking a careful conservation project at the site to address a number of issues sequentially:<\/p><p>- To ensure that the fabric of the\u00a0building\u00a0is secure and structurally sound;<\/p><p>- To carry out a wildlife assessment (Bat Survey);<\/p><p>- To record all surviving elements of the Mill structure and its loose and fixed contents (both in traditional record and laser survey), to carry out an inventory of\u00a0them and to\u00a0take\u00a0these elements into\u00a0safe storage if possible;<\/p><p>- To carry out essential works to the horizontal wheel to rectify the effects of a significant earlier structural collapse, to assess the condition of various working elements and to\u00a0repair them;<\/p><p>- To develop a\u00a0strategy for managed public access and presentation of the Mill Complex;<\/p><p>- To rehabilitate the Mill pond<\/p><p>Following the completion of the first major phase of work in the period leading up to 2014\/15, the buildings and contents are now secure.In 2015, OPW\u00a0commissioned an external conservation expert to complete an agreed Conservation and Management Plan for the site which will inform the next steps to be taken towards the ultimate presentation of the site to visitors.Remaining elements of this work will be addressed on a progressive basis as and when resources permit.\u00a0 It is not possible at this time to say exactly when the site will be open to the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700061#WRD05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Station Closures","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700061#WRD05400"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[17945\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041700061#WRD05500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of the buildings in which Garda stations were formally located in counties Cavan and Monaghan which have been sold; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that two former Garda Station buildings in County Cavan have been sold. \u00a0These are Finea and Tullyvin.<\/p><p>No former Garda stations in County Monaghan have been sold.<\/p><p>The former Garda station at Shantonagh, Co.

The resulting Audit Directive (2014\/56\/EU) and Regulation ((EU)(537\/2014)) updated existing EU law. The package contained new legislative requirements including in relation to the independence regime between the audited entity and audit firm and auditor reporting. <\/p>  <p>  The Audit Directive and Regulation were given effect in S.I. 312 of 2016 and elevated to primary legislation in the Companies (Statutory Audits) Act 2018.

The EU Regulation also introduced new obligations specifically addressed to the auditors of public interest entities\u00a0i.e. credit institutions, insurance undertakings and listed entities. The main requirements on auditors and public interest entities in respect of independence are:<\/p>  <p>  - The prohibition of the provision of certain non-audit services to the audited entity and the provision of other non-audit services subject to certain conditions.<\/p>  <p>  - A cap on fees from non-audit services of 70% of audit fees, based on the average of the three preceding years audit fees.<\/p>  <p>  - A requirement to change auditor at least every ten years and to change the key audit partner every five years.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to auditor communication, the content of all audit reports now includes requirements to describe the scope of the statutory audit and to provide a statement on any material uncertainty that cast significant doubt about the entity&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern.

The number of patients attending Emergency Departments continues to increase year on year, with approximately 1.3 million attendances in 2018, up 3.5% on 2017, hospitals are increasingly operating at or above capacity. <\/p>  <p>  This is a very busy period for our health services, with many sites reporting significant numbers of patient attendances. In the first 2 months of 2019, the number of patients attending our hospital Emergency Departments increased by 7% and the number of Emergency Department admissions increased by 5% compared to the same period last year. <\/p>  <p>  Despite this significant increase in demand, our health services have managed better than in previous years and based on provisional data, the numbers of patients on trolleys were 15% lower between December and February this winter than the previous winter. <\/p>  <p>  The establishment of Hospital Groups has enabled a better configuration of hospital services with benefits relating to safety, quality, access, cost and sustainable medical staffing. The structure ensures that Hospitals working together in a Group will be able to support each other, providing a stronger role for smaller hospitals in delivering less complex care, and ensuring that those who require emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in larger hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The Smaller Hospitals Framework focuses in particular on the future role of smaller hospitals and outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within these smaller hospitals.  The Department of Health is committed to securing and further developing the role of our smaller hospitals, including Model 3 hospitals such as Cavan Hospital, with the expansion of services delivered in these hospitals, especially in services such as day surgery; ambulatory care; medical services and diagnostics.<\/p>  <p>  Future investment in Cavan General Hospital will be considered within the overall acute hospital infrastructure programme, the prioritised needs of the hospital groups and within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.<\/p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 provides &euro;10.9 billion for Health capital developments across the country, including both national programmes and individual projects, across acute, primary and social care.

It is important, however, that private sector and business in general take a lead themselves in considering climate impacts in their long term strategic planning and investment decisions, and assess climate risks to their own assets and activities.   Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Adaptation Framework (NAF) represents our national policy response to the challenges posed by the impacts of climate change. The Framework sets out the context to ensure Local Authorities, regions and sectors can assess the key risks and vulnerabilities of climate change, implement climate resilience actions, and ensure climate adaptation considerations are mainstreamed into local, regional and national policy making. The National Adaptation Framework (NAF) identifies the need for Government to engage with the private sector in shaping and developing their adaptation strategies and plans and also identifies the need for further research into the impacts of climate change on enterprise.<\/p>  <p>  The National Adaptation Framework (NAF) recognises that the availability of accurate, consistent and authoritative data, information and analysis specific to Ireland is crucial to how effective we are in developing climate resilience. Information platforms such as Climate Ireland, which was developed under the EPA Research Programme, can help to provide business with more accurate information on the projected impacts of climate change and encourage them to take action to lower their exposure to the impacts of climate change.

In designing the National Childcare Scheme, extensive research and consultations have been carried out to ensure that this goal is achieved and that the Scheme can help as many families as possible.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. The Scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports. This 'poverty-proofs' the Scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the highest subsidy rates under the Scheme.\u00a0 It will also make work pay for parents trying to get back into employment or training as they will now be able to avail of help with their childcare costs.\u00a0 Many working\u00a0families will, for the first time, be entitled to subsidies which will reduce their childcare costs significantly.\u00a0 Others will see an increase in their level of subsidy.\u00a0 For example, a family with a child aged two in full-time care (40 hours) and currently\u00a0benefitting\u00a0from the maximum subsidy of &euro;145 per week under CCS Band A, would see their subsidy increase to &euro;174 per week, an additional subsidisation of &euro;1,500 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  Arrangements are in place to ensure that\u00a0no one loses out\u00a0in the initial transition to the new Scheme. So, whilst there may have been fears that, in\u00a0a small number of cases, where a family currently receiving the maximum amount of financial support for full-time childcare under an existing programme may receive less under the new Scheme, particularly if their child is, in reality, receiving after-school care only rather than full-time childcare, they will not lose out.\u00a0 The family can continue to access their current targeted supports (i.e. effectively remain on their current payment) until the end of August 2020, 16 months from now.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have also directed my officials to undertake research and analysis to examine any adjustments to the National Childcare Scheme which might be required to address unusual or anomalous cases, where this is the right thing to do to protect and benefit lower income parents.\u00a0 In this regard, I would highlight that the new National Childcare Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.\u00a0 As such, any adjustments deemed necessary by Government can be carried out in a quick and responsive manner.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is designed so that families who need the most support can receive it. Maximum subsidy rates are payable in all cases where a family meets the lowest income threshold, tapering down smoothly as income increases.<\/p>  <p>  An Income Assessed subsidy is available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy will vary depending on family income, the child&rsquo;s age and their educational stage. It can be used towards the cost of a registered childcare place for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week where parents are working, studying or training, or in circumstances where a parent is unavailable to care for a child.

A breakdown of the data\u00a0by the categories sought is not available before 2014.\u00a0\u00a0As has been clarified separately for the Deputy, P&amp;amp;A costs are not comparable to the payments arising under Social Housing PPP contracts.<\/p><p>The total P&amp;amp;A spend for 2018 is set out in Table 2.

The data below is based\u00a0on local authority claims for operational P&amp;amp;A agreements recorded on the Department&rsquo;s SHCEP financial management system. Any variations in data between operational figures and total output across build,\u00a0acquisition and leasing\u00a0delivery streams is due to the time lag in the submission of claims to the Department in respect of new units after delivery.<\/p><p><b>Table 1: Average Annual P&amp;amp;A Cost and Total Operational Units under P&amp;amp;A 2014 - 2018<\/b><table><tr><th><\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2016<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>P&amp;amp;A Type<\/td><td>Total   Units<\/td><td>Average   Annual Cost<\/td><td>Total   Units<\/td><td>Average   Annual Cost<\/td><td>Total   Units<\/td><td>Average   Annual Cost<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CALF (incl.
