Under the regional spatial and economic strategy, in the hierarchy of the regional planning guidelines, it is proposed that Naas be downgraded from a tier 1 growth town to simply a growth town.<\/p> <p>As a result of its status as a tier 1 growth town, Naas was able to access funding in recent years, with &euro;283 million of Government investment in the town.  That included the Osberstown treatment plant, increasing the capacity of the Ballymore Eustace water treatment plant, a &euro;110 million investment in the Sallins bypass, the Osberstown interchange and the widening of the N7 to three lanes.  It also included investment in schools.  Mercy Convent primary school in Naas is currently being rebuilt and other schools have been proposed, including Naas community college.  There was investment in Naas hospital and a business park in Osberstown.  The State has invested heavily in all these things.<\/p> <p>Tier 1 growth town designation means that housing development should be based primarily on employment growth, accessible by sustainable transport modes and quality of life rather than unsustainable commuting patterns.  People may have thought that Naas was a commuter town but that is not the case.  Some 11,000 people work in Naas while 7,500 leave Naas to work elsewhere.  People travel from Dublin to work in Naas.  The companies in Naas are not multinationals but indigenous companies, of which Kerry Foods is the largest.  The Queally Group and Dawn Farm foods are located there and each employs 700 to 800 people.  The county council offices are also located there.  It has Naas hospital and the HSE has established a regional base there.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Anthony Lawlor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2283\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2283&amp;amp;pid=AnthonyLawlor&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Naas should be considered a tier 1 growth town rather than a growth town, which is what it has been downgraded to in the current proposal in the regional, spatial and economic strategy.  There is planning permission for more than 2,500 houses to be built.  If those houses are built, it will mean Naas will have reached the population targets set out in the strategy.  Naas is an economic zone outside of Dublin.  It is the only one being proposed.  There is no regional growth centre between Dublin and Cork or Dublin and Limerick.  That is a major corridor between the three main cities.  Naas needs to be upgraded to a regional growth centre, not unlike Dundalk, Drogheda or Athlone, because it is a growth centre for employment and should not be seen as a commuter town.  In the 1970s, the Myles Wright report stated it should be designated an economic zone.  There are 11,500 people working in Naas town.  It needs to be upgraded to a regional centre.  I hope the Minister of State will comment on maintaining Naas as a tier 1 growth town and upgrading it to a regional growth town.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#B00500","speaker":"1438","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to discuss the matter and bring some clarity to it.  I welcome the opportunity to provide clarity and address any misunderstanding that may have arisen.  We had some discussion of Project Ireland 2040 and the regional plans in the D&aacute;il.  We need to have more discussion in this House, in committee and the D&aacute;il to tease out what we are trying to achieve with the roll-out of Project Ireland 2040 and the regional and county plans.  There is a little confusion.  People have talked about there being limited ambition.<\/p> <p>The designation to which the Senator refers, that of tier 1 large growth town, forms part of the regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which, in addition to the four Dublin local authority areas, includes the three mid-eastern counties of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  Those guidelines are being superseded by a new draft regional strategy and this may have resulted in some confusion.  The designation, tier 1 large growth town, which was used in previous publications has been discontinued.  In the new draft regional strategy such areas are now designated as a key town to simplify matters.  They are not being downgraded.  I want to allay the Senator's fears about that.<\/p> <p>I understand he is concerned about the future of Naas and is committed to it, as is the Department.  We see Naas as an essential town.  It is a key town in Kildare and the region.  Naas has been identified as a key town in the draft regional strategy for the eastern and midland regional assembly area.  The draft regional strategy describes in detail the function and purpose of a key town and reflects the Senator's ambition for further job creation along with housing development and that the two be matched with the infrastructure needed.  In the past, housing has been developed in counties such as Meath and Kildare but there have not been enough jobs.  Naas has done well and has secured many indigenous jobs.  Kerry Group was a major factor in that.  We want to create and win more jobs.  We do not want 7,500 or 8,000 people having to commute from Naas.  The focus in the regional strategy is to match the two to make sure housing secures jobs and jobs secure housing and that we link them together.  In the past we have had one or the other which is not good planning.  There must also be all the other infrastructural services to go with it.<\/p> <p>The national planning framework, NPF, published earlier this year together with the national development plan, NDP, as part of Project Ireland 2040 is intended to provide a strategic context for future planning, development and investment over the next two decades.  In addition, the NPF represents the long-term strategy for Departments, State agencies, State-owned enterprises, regional and local authorities and others to support communities to achieve their potential for economic, social and infrastructural development through a shared set of strategic objectives and key principles.  The goal is to achieve that potential in a logically planned way.  As a strategic document, the NPF is being given further and more detailed expression at regional level through preparation by the regional assemblies of statutory, regional, spatial and economic strategies for the three regional assembly areas.<\/p> <p>I understand the Senator is raising this matter in response to the publication of the draft regional, spatial and economic strategy for the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, EMRA, for which a ten-week consultation period commenced just last Monday.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The east and midlands regional spatial and economic strategy is the first of three draft strategies to be published by the regional assemblies during the coming weeks.  They will replace the previous regional planning guidelines, all seven of which are by now outdated.  The consultation period on the draft regional strategy will run until 23 January, and it is open to any interested party, including Senator Lawlor and others who are interested, to make a formal submission in writing to the regional assembly on the content of the draft regional strategy.  We would welcome the Senator's involvement through discussion here or through formal submissions to outline clearly his concerns and fears if we get it wrong and his ambition for the town and what he wants to achieve for Naas and Kildare in general.  We want our plans to be ambitious.  We want to be very clear that the NPF will not limit the ambition of any town but to help grow it in a planned and co-ordinated way and successfully link the process of having well-planned housing in an area that has all of the services to go with it.<\/p><p>The finalisation of these regional strategies in the first half of 2019 will, in turn, prompt reviews and updates of individual county and city development plans to ensure strategic co-ordination and consistency between national, regional and local levels.  The Senator has raised this issue in other conversations and I believe that much clarity has been brought to the process over recent weeks at regional level, in terms of future ambition and zoned lands.  People will have had their concerns and fears allayed and I assume the Senator's councillor colleagues understand what we are trying to achieve through the regional plans.  I hope this brings some clarity on what a key town is.  We are just replacing the terminology used in the past.<\/p><p>Growth centres such as Sligo and Athlone are a little different.  They are to drive the regions around them because we are trying to disperse the population into other regions that have experienced population decline.  Sligo and Athlone have been picked as regional centres to try to drive activity not just in the towns but in the regions around them, whereas Naas is a key town for Kildare and the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#C00200","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We are well over the time limit but I will give the Senator ten seconds.

They are on a waiting list.  This trend is set to continue in 2020, 2021 and after that given the current figures for students in the primary schools in the town.  It is a very serious situation.  Ultimately, the school needs a new school building because the current building is not fit to cope with the numbers at present and certainly not into the future.  For example, there is no library in the school, no physical education, PE, hall and the science and woodwork rooms are undersized.  I ask the Minister to work with the board of management and the principal to move forward with the plans for the new school.<\/p><p>However, to deal with the impending crisis in the town of Rush the school has made an application to the Minister for four extra prefab classrooms so the 102 children on the waiting list can be offered places for 2019.  I ask the Minister to prioritise the application so the school can have certainty.  There is great distress in the town.  People want their children educated in their community and town.  The neighbouring towns of Lusk and Skerries are also facing crises relating to oversubscription so it is not possible for the children to travel to those nearby towns.  St. Joseph's has an excellent reputation in the town.  It has a 100% rate of progression to third level or apprenticeships.  It is a DEIS school and it has strong links with the Trinity Access programme.  There is a very good community spirit around the school and it has links to various clubs and groups in the community.  I ask the Minister to examine that application urgently to allow these children and their families to take part in the school community, to be educated in their own community and to give the school some certainty.  He should then move on to considering a new school building for St. Joseph's in Rush.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#D00700","speaker":"1376","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as ucht an cheist seo a ard&uacute;.

I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to clarify the current position relating to my Department's plans to meet the demand for school places in the Fingal area and in St. Joseph's secondary school, Rush.  My predecessor, Deputy Bruton, announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the four years from 2019 to 2022.  This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department on the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.  The four-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.<\/p> <p>This announcement included three new post-primary schools to be established in the Fingal area as follows: a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school to serve the Donaghmede-Howth D13 school planning area to be established in 2019; a new 800 pupil post-primary school to serve the Blanchardstown west D15 and Blanchardstown village D15 school planning areas as a regional solution to be established in 2020; and a new 800 pupil post-primary school to serve the Donaghmede-Howth D13 school planning area to be established in 2021.  In addition to the new schools announced, my Department&rsquo;s capital investment programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for existing schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified.  The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review and, in particular, would have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p> <p>With regard to St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school, my Department received an application for additional accommodation from the school.  I am pleased to advise the Senator that it recently issued approval, in principle, to the board of management for the rental of two science laboratories, one technical graphics-design communication graphics room and one general classroom, as an interim measure, pending delivery of the permanent school building.  The Senator will also be aware that a major building project to provide a new replacement school building for St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school, Rush, is included in my Department's six-year construction programme.

When the four new units are added in, there will be 21 prefabs.  The school is urgently needed.  I ask that this be made a priority.  A lot of housing is being built in Fingal.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to Donaghmede and Blanchardstown.  They are not anywhere near Rush; they are significant distances away.

As part of the ongoing conversation regarding where people are going to live and go to school and how they will travel to school, I take the Senator's point.  Fingal is a big geographical area and there are more than 8,000 places in post-primary schools there alone, which gives one a glimpse of the population dynamic that exists.<\/p> <p>I also accept what the Senator stated in the context of ensuring that this matter is kept on the radar.  A number of her colleagues have also raised this issue with me.  In my short time in this new post I have seen that the pressure on high-population areas to ensure that they have quality educational centres is very important to the politicians who represent those areas.  However, I want to work in tandem with the different frameworks that we have including the capital plan for the period 2016 to 2021.  Obviously, we also have the ten-year capital plan.  The latter provides more than &euro;8.4 billion for education, which is double the money provided in the previous ten years.  All of that funding will be needed.  Pressure is coming on the sector.

It was the third such application.  At this stage, the level of frustration, anger and disappointment among the school-going community in Ballinteer is the highest I have ever seen.  The fact that there seem to have been no pre-planning meetings between the Department and the county council is extremely disappointing and worrying.  We assumed that when this most recent application was submitted, this would, after such a delay, finally be it and that we would see the permanent school opening on the identified site off Wyckham Way.

I thank him for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to update the House on the current position regarding the provision of a permanent school building for Ballinteer Educate Together national school, which is a co-educational school under the patronage of Educate Together.<\/p> <p>The brief for the project we are discussing is the provision of a new 16-classroom school and a two-classroom special needs unit, together with all ancillary accommodation, on the St. Tiernan's Community School site at Parkvale, Balally, Dublin 16.  This project, which is included in the six-year capital programme of the Department of Education and Skills to proceed to tender and construction in 2018, was assigned to the Department's rapid design and build delivery programme in March 2018.  Architectural planning commenced immediately.  An application for planning permission was lodged with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in September 2018 following a pre-planning meeting with the council.<\/p> <p>A notification of decision to refuse permission was received by the Department's consultants on 2 November 2018.  A copy of this notification was received by officials in the Department yesterday afternoon.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council outlined two reasons for its decision to refuse planning.  First, the proposed exit-only link onto Wyckham Way, which is a heavily trafficked distributor road, would endanger public safety by reason of traffic hazard or obstruction of road users and the proposed development would therefore be contrary to the proper planning and development of the area.  Second, the proposal to utilise the existing access to St. Tiernan's Community School through Parkvale to serve an additional 16-classroom school is not acceptable on the grounds of the impact on the residential amenity of existing Parkvale residents.  The proposed development would be seriously injurious to the residential amenity of Parkvale and would therefore be contrary to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.<\/p> <p>The remarks I have made in reply to the Senator are obviously in the public arena.  They arise from the decision that has been made by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  Officials from the Department of Education and Skills will now review this decision.  I appreciate the disappointment of those who have been campaigning on this issue for eight years.  I assure the Senator that having reviewed this disappointing decision, the Department will consult its advisers and technical team to decide how best to make progress with this project.  The possibility of an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be considered in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#G00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response and for his interest in Ballinteer Educate Together national school.  I cannot over-emphasise that this was the third application to be made in respect of this project.  This has been going on for eight years.  There are children who will go through their entire primary school cycle without ever seeing the inside of the proposed permanent building.  There are teachers who are preparing to retire who will not get to teach in the proposed permanent building.<\/p> <p>The two issues that were flagged in the local authority's recent planning decision are not new.  The issue of access to Parkvale has been going on for the entire 40-year history of the neighbouring secondary school.  There was a lengthy public campaign against allowing access to Parkvale.  Similarly, the issue of access to Wyckham Avenue is not a new one.<\/p> <p>I appreciate the Minister's commitment to reviewing the local authority's response and to considering the possibility of an appeal.  While I welcome that, something more is required.  I ask the Minister to organise a meeting at the highest possible level between the CEO of the local authority and the school principal to see whether we can get this over the line.

There are other issues relating to the department of which all present are aware, such as the ageing demographic in the area, staff requirements, etc., which must be addressed by the Department of Health.

Deputy Brendan Ryan tabled parliamentary questions on the matter on my behalf.  The responses state that it is a matter for the HSE.

The Department, the HSE, the RCSI hospital group and Beaumont Hospital are very supportive of these projects.

In preparation of the capital plan for 2018 the HSE confirmed that funding of &euro;100,000 would be made available in 2018 for the design phase of the new Beaumont Hospital emergency department project.  The HSE gave written approval for the funding, which allowed Beaumont Hospital to go ahead with the EU procurement process for the selection and appointment of the design team for the project.  The national development plan, announced earlier this year as part of the Project Ireland 2040 policy initiative, provides &euro;10.9 billion for health capital developments across the State, including both national programmes and individual projects across acute, primary and social care.  The money will come out of that budget.  Health capital projects and programmes currently under way will continue.  I am happy to confirm today that both the emergency department and the cystic fibrosis unit capital projects have been included in the national development plan and the timeframe for the completion of the emergency department project will be informed by the work of the project team.  This work will be undertaken in conjunction with Beaumont Hospital and the HSE.<\/p><p>As the Senator is aware, the hospital site is quite restricted and much work has been carried out by Beaumont Hospital and the HSE around site selection.

These are both positive developments as we all move forward.<\/p><p>The delivery of national development plan projects and programmes, including the projects at Beaumont Hospital, will result in healthcare facilities that allow for implementation of new models of care and for delivery of services in high-quality, modern facilities.  The cystic fibrosis unit project will be underpinned by the model of care for people with cystic fibrosis in Ireland which has been developed by the national clinical programme for cystic fibrosis.  I believe there is a meeting today on this issue in the audiovisual room in Leinster House.  This will set out standards for the physical and human resources to be provided for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients from a national perspective.  Investment in healthcare infrastructure, including these projects, must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.<\/p><p>The HSE will continue to apply the available funding for infrastructure development in the most effective way possible to meet current and future needs, having regard to the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#H00400","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply.

The Minister updated the country on the \"News at One\" and stated it was a technical issue related to a transitional arrangement while the Department moved to a new system.  Ultimately, recipients or potential recipients were the ones who were negatively affected.  People had mortgages to pay and direct debits which were failing.  They had to meet credit union and other loan repayments and their credit ratings were going to be affected.  It was not acceptable.  People make PAYE contributions and may, through no fault of their own, fall ill and require illness benefit.  When they needed it, however, it was unavailable.  It is a disgrace.  I am appalled that people had to go through this at their time of need.  We do not know exactly how many people were affected and whether it was 5,000 or 50,000 but while the Minister made a statement to the D&aacute;il, she should come to the House to explain exactly what happened in relation to this malfunction.  There was meant to be a dedicated phone line but this was not open and people had to wait on hold for hours, notwithstanding the fact that they were sick.  At one stage, Government spokespeople directed people to the supplementary welfare officer, which is completely unfair.  When one is sick, one should hardly have to go to someone to beg for money, especially when it concerns a payment to which one is entitled.<\/p> <p>There has been a recent rise in convictions of people who have been out on bail, some in relation to sexual offences.

This is an issue on which I have worked for decades and one which could not be closer to my heart.  I look forward to continuing this work in the House.  I will never tire of highlighting this crisis and the lack of adequate services available to tackle it.<\/p> <p>There are actions we can take now, however.  For example, the Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care finished two weeks ago with the publication of its final report on mental health services.  It was set up for the purpose of seeking cross-party agreement on a single long-term vision for mental health.  The Taoiseach has undertaken to give consideration to making the committee permanent.  I ask Members and the public to voice their support for this.  A permanent committee will ensure that the budget and services for mental health will not disappear.<\/p> <p>In recent years, the mental health budget, as a proportion of the total health budget, has amounted to approximately 6% per year.  We allocate half the funds to mental health that other countries, such as Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK, do.  We are also far behind in so many other ways.<\/p> <p>For example, the UK's mental health budget received an additional boost recently with approximately &pound;2 billion to be allocated to mental health services between now and 2023.  The UK is miles ahead of us, not just in terms of budget allocation.  It has committed to creating children and young people's crisis teams in every part of the UK through schools and to help pupils with mild and moderate mental health problems.  The UK Prime Minister has appointed the first Minister for suicide prevention as part of a &pound;1.8 million push to reduce the number of people taking their own lives.  We should consider making a similar appointment.  The UK also has investment in community services such as crisis cafes and an expansion of specialised employment support for people with severe mental health illness, along with an announcement of a further &pound;10 million support for veterans with mental health needs.<\/p> <p>Ireland must be more ambitious.  We are closing hospital wards rather than expanding services.  At any given time, we have approximately 50 beds for acutely mentally ill children when more than 2,800 children are on waiting lists needing a timely service.  The latest figures show that, at the end of August, 6,340 children were on a waiting list for primary care psychology.<\/p> <p>Will the Taoiseach confirm the creation of a permanent mental health care committee in order that we can expand its terms of reference and that the specific recommendations made in the recent report can be finalised?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#P00400","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I welcome Senator Freeman back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#P00500","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I, like many in this Chamber and around the world, was shocked by recent announcements coming out of Tanzania.

Too often in the past, appalling acts of violence, discrimination and deep-rooted prejudice have been perpetrated against vulnerable communities in society.  The LGBTI community in Tanzania is crying out for help on this occasion.  Ireland must do everything in its power to act in solidarity and to support the group being targeted.  The Government and Irish Aid need to use whatever influence is at their disposal to deter the disgraceful actions taken by the governor of Dar es Salaam and to implore the Government of Tanzania to respect and protect vulnerable groups, such as the LGBTI community, in Tanzania.  How will Ireland respond to the latest in a swathe of viciously anti-LGBTQI attacks by the Tanzanian Government and how does the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade hope to address this matter?  Could the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House to outline his approach in respect of these appalling violations of human rights and worrying trends?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#P00600","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>It was with dismay I saw that there are 180 Committee Stage amendments to the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018.

It is a moment when we should consider the presidency because we are quite a distance from the next presidential election, and we should reflect on it.  I ask the Leader if we could have a brief debate on the matter to put forward a resolution that we should look at the presidency.  If an incumbent President runs for election, he or she should withdraw from that role and a presidential commission should be brought in, because otherwise a sitting President has an unfair advantage.<\/p> <p>The rules should be looked at.  They were made in a period which I remember very well when there was only ever two candidates, one from Fine Gael and another from Fianna F&aacute;il, and nobody else.  These days there are six to eight candidates which means that the last three or four have no chance whatever of getting any State funding.  That means we are making the presidency the preserve of the rich and I do not think that is what we need in a democracy.  It should be open to everyone.<\/p> <p>The nomination procedures need to be examined.  I raised this during the Convention on the Constitution.  It was by far the most popular resolution of the entire convention despite the Government doing everything it could to frustrate it.  It was passed by 98%.  That is how strongly people felt about the presidency.  However, the Government has sat on its backside and done nothing whatever.  We must also look at funding arrangements which greatly favour the political parties.  This is a republic and everyone should be equal in it.  The political parties should not have any advantage over an individual member of the public.  I am calling for a debate on the presidency and a re-examination of the rules and procedures to make it more democratic.  We have been extremely lucky in the Presidents we have had.  There has been a series of excellent people, but we should ensure that the broadest number of candidates possible are able to run.<\/p> <p>I congratulate those who put their heads above the parapet and ran for the presidency.  They did us all a favour, despite the three parties having supported the incumbent which throws his victory in a certain light.

In that context, it is probably time to call for a debate on commemoration in light of the 100th anniversary of the First World War.  Hopefully, there is a great deal on which we can all agree.  The first is that the 35,000 to 40,000 Irishmen and Irishwomen who died should be remembered.  They have been written out of the history of this State for too long.  I hope we would also be able to agree on the nature of that war, a pointless, futile exercise with needless deaths and a generation butchered and damned, as the song says.  The conflict was a war of empires.  We could at least agree on that.  Indeed, we could perhaps reflect on the role of John Redmond in encouraging so many Irish men to pointless and horrendous deaths.  Where we would disagree, I suspect, is on how to commemorate them.  I would not wear a poppy.  The reason is what the poppy symbolises.  It is on the Royal British Legion website that it is to commemorate the dead of all wars including colonial wars, which the site lists as including Iraq, Afghanistan, the Falklands, Kenya, Cyprus and in our country.  People will say they are wearing the poppy only to commemorate the Irish dead.  That is fine, but it is not what the poppy symbolises.  That is the reality, not an opinion.  People can look up the Royal British Legion website.  The other problem is that the Royal British Legion, unfortunately, has been and continues to be a cheerleader for British wars, both past and present.  That is a fact.<\/p><p>We must find a way to commemorate the poor people who suffered horrendously in that war.  We should be able to do that as an independent Irish nation.  It is important we do so and have a mature debate on it.  I recognise Senator Feighan's genuine attempt to do that.  However, it is flawed for two reasons.  First, it still represents the poppy and, second, the Royal British Legion is attached to it.  I do not wish to commemorate the men in Afghanistan today or the British soldiers in Iraq, and I do not believe the Irish people wish to do so.

They have also refused to allow representatives of NASRA to represent its members, which is a regrettable development.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The next phase in the dispute is a work to rule that will begin tomorrow.  In effect, this means there will be a ban on overtime, which staff members are not obliged to do at any rate.  This could have serious implications for places like County Monaghan and certain other parts of the country.  Although there are 16 rostered staff members in County Monaghan, there are just 11 permanent positions there at present.  The other positions are filled through overtime and are covered by unrostered staff.  This could have serious implications for the health and safety of people in County Monaghan and throughout the entire country.  If it is not possible to fill shifts, this could result in delays.  As we know to our cost, unfortunately, this could have devastating effects on the people of this country.  I would like the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to engage with National Ambulance Service personnel immediately and as a matter of urgency in order that this dispute can be brought to an end as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#V00300","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>A lacklustre presidential election campaign has come to an end.

The Irish political class often seems to talk tough about fundamental human rights in an abstract sense, only to be reluctant to step up to the plate when specific violations arise.  Two particular issues challenge our sincerity on this issue.  As we all know, the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in a very brutal way in the Saudi Embassy in Turkey last month.  Although my colleague, Senator Norris, raised this case a few weeks ago, the overall Irish response to this murder has been extraordinarily muted.  I would hope this has nothing to do with Irish trade with Saudi Arabia.  I know we export &euro;700 million per annum to that country.  I know additional beef exports to Saudi Arabia were agreed last year.  As a farmer's son, I welcome anything that helps agriculture.  I would hope that economic ties are not blinding us to the seriousness of this situation.  IBEC is to commended for its courage in cancelling a conference on Saudi trade recently.  I know the T&aacute;naiste met the Saudi envoy a few weeks ago.  It would be good to get an update on what ongoing contacts there are.  What is the Government saying about this issue?  As we all know, we have had sad experience of journalists being killed for their work in our own country.  I think that creates an additional onus on us to speak out.<\/p> <p>The second extraordinary case is that of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman who was recently released from prison having been charged with blasphemy some years ago in Pakistan, where the crime of blasphemy is seriously a problem.  I first raised the case of Ms Bibi in 2014.  She spent eight years in solitary confinement before being released into virtual house arrest.  She is a prisoner in her own country because of a deal that has been done to appease Islamic groups.  As I said in 2014, Ms Bibi is an ordinary person who dared to speak for her Christian faith.  She has been put through hell as a result.  Ireland should speak loudly on behalf of people persecuted for their faith and their beliefs, regardless of what they are.  It should take a particular interest when such cases involve Christian minorities, firstly because of our own proud Christian heritage but also because Christian minorities are under particular assault around the world today.  They have very few places of safe refuge.  The leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Howlin, has rightly called for Ms Bibi to be offered asylum in Ireland.  I absolutely support that call.  I would welcome a ministerial response on this.  During the recent blasphemy referendum campaign, it was wrongly claimed that Ireland's mild blasphemy laws had given some kind of comfort to countries like Pakistan which abuse blasphemy laws.  If the Government really believes that Ireland has truly been some kind of obstacle, the obligation on this country to express loudly, clearly and in practical terms its support for and solidarity with people like Ms Bibi, as well as others who are suffering as we speak, is all the greater.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#W01200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I commend those from the civic nationalist group who organised an open letter to the Taoiseach.  The previous letter was signed by 200 people but this one was signed by 1,000.  The increase in the number of signatories is not only an indication of the welcome support of a broad range of nationalists in the North but also a sign of the growing concern that their rights are threatened by Brexit.  It is important that the letter outlined the threat to specific rights such as that relating to healthcare.  In the context of North-South medical treatment, a person travelling from the North to the South for medical treatment is currently covered by the EU health card but that will no longer be the case after March of next year.  These issues need to be discussed in a very real way.  There are fears regarding what Brexit will mean in terms of access to housing, the mutual recognition of educational qualifications and access to educational grants and other matters.  The big concern is that in spite of the very positive response of the Government to those who feel threatened, those people feel more threatened today than when they signed the first letter.<\/p> <p>I commend the public responses from the Taoiseach to the letters.  It is very important that these issues are highlighted.  It would be worthwhile for the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, to come to the House to address some of those issues, specifically those regarding health, education and so on.  While I very much welcome that the Taoiseach guaranteed that Irish citizens in the North would not be left behind and that there would be no hard border, we need to see the practical steps he will take to underpin that promise.  I thank those who signed the letter and I thank the media for the way they have discussed it.  This is a very important issue.

Parts 2 and 3 of the Act govern family relationships arising from donor-assisted human reproduction, that is, the use of donor eggs, sperm or embryos to conceive children.  They create a legal structure whereby the commissioning or social parents of children born through donor-assisted human reproduction would be rightly recognised as the parents of those children.  The Act also prohibits the practice of anonymous egg, sperm and embryo donation and creates a legal regime to ensure that children born through such a process will be able to find out the contact details of the donor and try to make contact if they so wish.  The ultimate purpose of the provisions is to vindicate the child's right to identity.  However, Parts 2 and 3 have not yet been commenced.  There has been a delay of almost three and a half years between the passing of the Act and the commencement of those parts.  The commencement of the Act is the responsibility of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  In a press release on 6 July, the Department of Health stated that commencement would take place in the autumn.  I ask the Leader to clarify whether commencement is imminent and, if it is not, whether the Department will indicate the reason for the very lengthy delay.  This is an important issue which relates to the assisted human reproduction that takes place openly in other countries and in private in this country, adoption tracing bills that will be coming before the Houses and, of course, the remains of bodies at mother and baby homes, which is a different but connected issue.  Parts 2 and 3 of the Act have not been commenced some three and a half years after the Act was passed.  Anonymity regarding egg, sperm and embryo donation should be prohibited in Ireland.  This is a very serious matter.  I ask the Leader to provide clarification on the status of the commencement of Parts 2 and 3.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2390\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am aware that the Minister is busy but perhaps he could come to the House and let me know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#X00200","speaker":"1427","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&iacute;or-fh&aacute;ilte roimh gach duine ar ais.  In welcoming everyone back, I join Senators in congratulating an tUachtar&aacute;n Miche&aacute;l D. &Oacute; hUig&iacute;nn on his election.  Fuair s&eacute; v&oacute;ta an-l&aacute;idir.  Gabhaim mo chomhghairdeas leis agus t&aacute; mandate agus &uacute;dar&aacute;s l&aacute;idir aige don dara t&eacute;arma.  In congratulating President Michael D. Higgins, we wish him and his wife, Sabina, well for his second term in office.  We commend him on his election and thank the other candidates for their participation.<\/p> <p>I disagree with Senator Mullen on one point; we did see the good side in many of the candidates.  I disagree with the Senator profoundly in that regard.  To be fair to our colleague, Senator Freeman, she showed great civility in not allowing people to descend into a rat race of an election by her constant positivity in her campaign.  I commend all the candidates on their participation in the election.<\/p> <p>We will have a debate on the election in the fullness of time.  The one thing we should take away from the election - I have said this in the House previously - is that what we say and how we say it matters.  This applies on social media, in the House, on the airwaves and in written form.  I would very much love to have a debate on the Presidency, whether it is on the nominating process, the term of office or whatever.  I do not think that Mary McAleese's term as President was diminished by the fact that she did not have to have an election for her second term.  Having said that, the people spoke in their hundreds of thousands to endorse the candidacy of Michael. D. Higgins.  We wish him well for next Sunday when he will take the oath of office for the second time.<\/p> <p>Our democratic process is well served by those of us who go out and vote.  We have to vote and we should vote.  Regardless of whether it was, as Senator Mullen stated, the paucity of the campaign - and I know he did not use that word - there must be a reason people did not vote.  Perhaps it was because the opinion polls and the political commentariat suggested that it was to be a landslide that people felt they did not need to vote.  However, I am not sure.  As Senator Mullen stated, Michael D. Higgins is our President and we will support him in his endeavours.  We wish the him well.<\/p> <p>Senator Ardagh referred to the illness benefit processing issue, on which many Members had to engage with the Department in recent weeks.  The Department has committed, and has outlined to us, that a normal level of payment will issue to illness benefit customers this week, and that no customer will miss out on payments.  Senator Ardagh alluded to the transition to a new IT system that led to a number of people on illness benefit receiving either some or no payment.  Thankfully, action has now been taken to ensure that payments have returned to normal.  We should apologise to the people who have been affected.  It is unacceptable that people are in arrears in their payment and that they have no money.  Thankfully, that glitch has been ironed out and I welcome this.<\/p> <p>The Senator also referred to the bail laws and electronic monitoring, which is part of the whole issue.  Members are aware that the Garda Commissioner is the person charged with operational matters regarding bail.  On foot of the case that is currently in the public domain, the Garda Commissioner has ordered a review to examine any policing issues in that regard.  The review will seek to establish any lessons that may need to be learned, and if there are any changes needed in procedures or processes with regard to that case.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has also said that if a review concludes the law needs to be changed he will act.  It is also important to let the review take place.  All of us who are living in our communities are concerned about the bail laws and the application of bail.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need more often to see why and how bail is granted.  Last year the laws around bail were strengthened under the Criminal Justice Act 2017 but I will be happy to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality back to the House pending the review to respond to the issues raised. <\/p><p>Senators Ardagh, Hopkins, Devine, Colm Burke and Freeman raised the issue of mental health and trolleys.  I remind Members that in the recent budget &euro;17 billion has been awarded to the Department of Health of which &euro;75 million has been given to the National Treatment Purchase Fund which is tasked with driving down waiting lists, which will assist thousands of our fellow citizens.  I commend Senator Freeman on her work for mental health.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has secured a budget of &euro;55 million for mental health services.  He is also moving to online or telecounselling.  The Cathaoirleach might correct me on this point but I think Senator Freeman's call on the Taoiseach regarding the committee is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As a former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and having seen the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare do extraordinary work, in this and the previous session, I do not see any reason we should not have a committee specific to mental health.  We could consider that but it could be done at a later stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#Y00200","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>We had a very good public consultation on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#Z00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Indeed, the Seanad Public Consultation committee held a debate on mental health services, chaired by the Leas-Chathaoirleach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#Z00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Senator Freeman was the rapporteur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#Z00400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>It was set up by the Taoiseach's nominees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#Z00500","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>No, no.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#Z00600","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I will not get into that debate now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#Z00700","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I had to accept chairing it which I was happy to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#Z00800","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>It was set up by the Taoiseach's nominees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#Z00900","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I allowed it through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#Z01000","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Senator Kelleher raised the issue of the ongoing deprivation of rights of members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, community in Tanzania.

I am happy to contribute to this debate and to answer any questions Senators may have on this important matter.<\/p> <p>Electoral law contains specific provisions designed to make voting as accessible and as inclusive as possible.  While much has been achieved in improving accessibility for voting for people with disabilities much more needs to be done.  Much of the focus in recent years has been on physical access to polling stations and measures to ease difficulties presented by inaccessible polling stations.  It would be useful at this point to outline the various measures that apply.  Provision is made for voting at an alternative polling station if a person with a physical disability is unable to vote at his or her local polling station.  There is a requirement on local authorities when making polling schemes to seek to select polling places where there will be at least one polling station that is accessible to wheelchair users.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a requirement for returning officers to give notice of polling stations that are inaccessible to wheelchair users in order to allow the voters concerned to seek alternative arrangements.  There is also a requirement on returning officers to put in place practical arrangements in polling stations to make it easier for wheelchair users to mark their ballot papers and place them in ballot boxes.  It is also worth mentioning that postal voting is often the preferred option for voters with physical illnesses or disability.  For those in nursing homes, special voting arrangements apply.<\/p><p>Despite these measures, a number of polling stations remain inaccessible to voters with physical disabilities.  While the number of such polling stations has decreased and is relatively small in the context of the total number nationally, the aim must be to make all polling stations accessible.  While we work to achieve that aim, we must recognise also the need to be ready to conduct elections at short notice.  To meet this requirement, returning officers must be able to provide a sufficient number of polling stations at every polling place in their constituencies.  Polling stations will normally be villages or other population centres and the returning officer will be required to locate polling stations as conveniently as possible for the use of the electorate in each polling station.  Where a sufficient number of polling stations cannot, for one reason or another, be provided at the appointed polling station, a returning officer can arrange for polling stations to be provided at any other convenient place.  In selecting locations to serve as polling stations, the traditional approach has been to use schools.  This is understandable given their generally central locations in communities.  It is especially so in rural areas where viable alternatives to local schools may be difficult to find without inconveniencing the generality of voters in an area.<\/p><p>If there are changed circumstances whereby community halls or similar buildings in these areas become more accessible for people with disabilities, they should be considered for use in place of local schools.  That has become the case in my area in Kilkenny in recent elections.  Where suitable alternative venues which are more accessible have become available, polling centres have moved from schools in certain areas.  The Department's guidance document for returning officers advises that they may hire a hall or other premises if they consider that it would be a more suitable arrangement even where a school is available for use locally.  Given the need to provide polling stations to conduct elections and referendums, returning officers sometimes select polling stations which are not normally accessible.  Even in these cases, however, the Department's guidance document advises returning officers to consider how, reasonably and practically, they can make those polling centres more accessible.  For example, suitable ramps may be provided to improve access.  To assist returning officers in this regard, the guidance document appends an accessible voting checklist which has been developed using the National Disability Authority's publication, Building for Everyone; a Universal Design Approach,  the Irish Wheelchair Association's best practice guidance guidelines of 2014, Designing Accessible Environments, and the guidance and practice on accessible voting available from other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>On balance, what is necessary in this matter is to remain vigilant about the possibility of replacing inaccessible buildings with newer accessible ones wherever and whenever they come on-stream and until such time as the problem is fully rectified.  The Department will shortly follow up on an invitation it received from the Irish Wheelchair Association to discuss the accessibility of polling stations.  The identification of problem areas and possible solutions will be the focus of these discussions.  I look forward to hearing Senators' views on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#CC01100","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, I welcome Mr. Robbie Sinnott, who is a disability activist, to the Visitors Gallery.

The Minister of State is doing a good job in the area of local government.  He is respected for his commitment by the general public and elected members at local authority level on all sides.<br\/><br\/>This is an issue on which we are all united.  We had a hard battle to win the vote for people.  Obstacles were placed in people's way over the centuries.  For a long time in this country, one could not vote if one were a Catholic.  For a long time, one could not vote unless one had wealth.  For a long time, one could not vote if one were a woman.  Thankfully, all these obstacles have been lifted.  The single remaining barrier to using one&rsquo;s franchise, however, is disability.  Thankfully, we are in the civilised age when we realise every help must be given to people of disability who wish to cast their vote.  It is an act of great patriotism, especially for people with a disability, to exercise one's franchise.  People with disabilities have enough obstacles in their way.  Many people just do not vote.  I love to see people with a disability coming to the polling booth.  It shows their commitment to their country and is an act of real patriotism.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State has outlined the situation, which we accept.  It is important voters have alternative polling stations if the polling station they would normally attend is not adapted properly for them.  A returning officer has the right to make special arrangements for them.  Should they request it in advance, they can be allowed to vote at a different polling station where they would be accommodated in a better way.  There is also the postal vote.  Following a High Court ruling in 2017, ballot paper templates have been introduced to facilitate people with visual impairments to vote by secret ballot in referendums and presidential elections.  Wherever possible, polling stations are to be situated in buildings which are accessible.  They must always be set at ground floor level.  Temporary ramps can be installed to facilitate access.<br\/><br\/>I have been around polling booths for some time.  I did some duty as an election agent when I was 12 years of age for a certain political party.  I have seen much coming and going.  One of the most embarrassing and degrading things I have seen is the abuse of disabled voters down through the years in the polls, in nursing homes and in hospitals.  No party is guiltless.  It is important that the dignity of a person must be first and foremost and every accommodation must be given that the voter can have the confidence that he or she is voting in private.  Just because one is impaired should not invalidate one's right to a secret ballot.  The secret ballot is the foundation of democracy.  I have seen people being asked to vote in situations where one would be sorry for them.  There was no secrecy about it.  At one stage, many politicians felt if they got up early enough in the morning and collected enough disabled people, then they had votes in the bag as they could control the vote.  Thankfully those days are gone.<br\/><br\/>The largest single change I saw was the right for people in hospitals and nursing homes to cast their votes <i>in situ<\/i>rather than having ill people being physically dragged into polling stations.  It was not right.  Now they can vote in the privacy of the hospital accompanied by an appropriate person or garda to ensure no outside involvement.<br\/><br\/>The introduction of the ballot paper template was a good development.  The regulations made in October provide for a similar template for presidential elections.  The option is available if a voter does not want to be assisted by a companion or a presiding officer in marking the ballot paper.  Ballot paper templates will be available in each polling station.  If voters tell the presiding officer that they wish to use a template, they will be handed a ballot paper with the template attached and given whatever personal assistance needed to vote in secret.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Raised print and Braille are used to identify the openings in the template that match the squares on the ballot paper.  The voters mark their choices on the ballot paper beneath the template.  When marked the ballot paper is detached from the template and placed in the ballot box in the usual way. <\/p><p>In 2015, my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, brought forward a Bill aimed at improving the voting system for visually impaired, incapacitated and illiterate voters.  The purpose of that Bill was to reduce obstacles and give those voters back their independence.  The legislation provides for electronically-assisted voting whereby a computer programme and printer would be used by visually-impaired people to cast their vote on a touch screen or keypad.

From many discussions I have had with him over the years I know of his steadfast commitment to equality.  He has demonstrated that in a practical and progressive way in the job he is doing and in the support he has given me over the years.  I acknowledge the presence in the Gallery of Robbie Sinnott whose court case led the way in ensuring that we are where we are, which is at the beginning of a process.<\/p> <p>This is a timely discussion, particularly following the presidential election ten days ago.  The tactile voting facility, which was introduced following on from Robbie's successful court case, is in its infancy.  It is a sincere and genuine start in terms of equality and facilitating people who are blind and visually impaired to vote.  As somebody who is visually impaired, I wholeheartedly welcome it as a starting point but like everything that is in its infancy, there are teething difficulties, and there were teething difficulties during voting in the presidential election.  It seemed to facilitate people casting their first preference vote in a reasonable way but when it came to determining a transfer, and if one was giving a candidate their number two or number three vote, there were much more challenges associated with it but they can be overcome.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State's Department should establish a formal process of engagement with the National Council for the Blind.  Its head of advocacy is Kevin Kelly, a great guy who worked the former Senator Mary Ann O'Brien for five years so he is well used to being around these Houses.  It would be a worthwhile exercise if the Minister of State set up a working group that would include Kevin to deal with the teething difficulties.  Every problem can be overcome.  With the advent of information and communications technology I am sure there are other ways that the tactile voting facility can be improved.     <\/p> <p>It might be no harm for the Minister of State to arrange for an audit to be carried out with the returning officers to get feedback on issues that arose at polling stations.  It would be a simple exercise.  The remit of the working group I suggested the Minister of State might establish to deal with the tactile voting facility could be extended to examine the matter of accessible polling stations, where difficulties and challenges arose, and the way the book of guidelines that is issued to presiding officers could be improved upon.<\/p> <p>I know from my experience that the issue of lighting in polling stations can be a factor.  When one goes into the polling booth it can be very dark.  Perhaps polling booths can be located under a light.  Many small aspects could be examined that could improve the overall experience for people in exercising their democratic right.  Many older people have told me that it is impossible to read the ballot paper because it is very dark in the polling booth.  It is a logical issue to address but it is only logical when it is pointed out to us.  We can improve on many areas.  Following a few more elections we could be in a position where we would have the most accessible voting facility in Europe but we have a long way to go.  I am totally convinced that the Minister of State, his officials and the Department are committed to this and want to make it happen.  I am only too happy to give any assistance possible in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#FF00400","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and the Department for the work that has been done and I also thank all the people in charge of organising polling stations around the country for elections.

With increasingly more public buildings having been made more user friendly for people with disabilities, considerable progress has been made but there are still places where not all the required facilities are available and some work needs to be done to address that.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of the change in the boundaries in my area of Cork.  I understand that change will come into effect on the day of the election.  There is a question mark over who will be in charge on the day of the election, as the city sheriff has jurisdiction over the current boundary of the city and the county sheriff has jurisdiction over the county.  People in some areas in the county will now be voting in the city election for the first time.  I understand this change will come into place on midnight before the day of the election.  That issue needs to be dealt with, given that while the county sheriff will not be dealing with new areas the city sheriff will, and they may not be  familiar with the new areas over which they will be in charge.  In some cases parishes will be divided following the change in the city boundary and new polling stations will have to be identified.  That issue needs to be examined to make sure there is access to every polling station, regardless of whether it is in the city or county or in a rural or urban area, for any person with a disability.  When such a changeover is happening it is important that is taken into account.  Much progress has been made and we have come a long way during the last 20 years.

It is good to see him back in the House.  I also welcome the use of templates in polling stations in the recent referendums on the eighth amendment and on blasphemy, and the presidential election.  It is a welcome move that allows those who are visually impaired to vote without assistance for the first time.  It is allows the independence that we should endeavour to provide to all.  While it took a High Court case commenced at the beginning of 2017 and the brave efforts of Mr. Robbie Sinnott, who is present in the Gallery, to bring it to this point, it still must be commended.  It is a start, albeit under an order from the High Court.<\/p> <p>In advance of these statements, I contacted the National Council for the Blind Ireland, NCBI, which has been strategically involved in the roll-out of templates.  Having spoken to the NCBI it is clear, and most welcome, that this has been an inclusive process.  I commend Department official and the manufacturing company, Pakflatt, who worked constructively with service users to provide templates as seamlessly as possible.  However, further and continued consultation is essential as we move from templates in national votes with general use cards to LEA-specific templates.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am not visually impaired but I want to take the Minister of State through what it is like to go to a polling booth with the new template so that we can understand it a little more.  There were numerous difficulties and these are what we learn from.  Most of those with visual impairment found the template not for purpose, although it was an improvement.  First one takes the template here - the \"T&aacute;\" or the \"N&iacute;l\" - which is more simplified than anything else.  It has a serrated edge so that one knows how to match it up with the ballot paper.  The ballot paper does not have that serrated edge.  That needs to be rectified.  The raised print where one reads the \"T&aacute;\" or the \"N&iacute;l\" needs to be enlarged.  It is 1.5 mm and the recommendation is that it go up to 2 mm so that it would be much easier to read.  One third of blind people have sensory deprivation in the fingers due to neuropathy, which is quite common for people with blindness.  <\/p><p>The Department was informed of the changes that were required following the referendum in May but, unfortunately, nothing was done.  We then went on to a bigger vote for the first time, the presidential vote.  I have here a template for the presidential vote.  It is obviously a lot more complicated than the \"T&aacute;\" and \"N&iacute;l\" template but it is not as complicated as what will be used in the general election and especially the local elections where one could have 25 to 30 candidates.  Again, the template does not have a serrated edge to match with the paper.  That is really important.  The paper does not have a serrated edge to allow the two to be matched together.  That needs to change.  One template was submitted on 6 September and was rejected.  This template was submitted for the presidential election at the beginning of October.  There really was no lead-in time to test it again.  <\/p><p>It is totally unsuitable for proportional representation voting.  We have six candidates here, one to six.  One lines up the template with the paper if one can get the edges together.  It is not that easy to do.  However, one needs to have a massive, fabulous memory to actually remember where one is to make the mark.  Who is number one?  One does not know.  Who is number two, or three, or four, or five, or six?  One does not know.  That information was provided on mobile phones but it took two and a half minutes to listen to and one still had to remember it all.  <\/p><p>It then gets really complicated when one casts a vote, perhaps for the sixth candidate.  That text also needs to increase to 2 mm.  If one gets to number six - and obviously Liadh N&iacute; Riada would have been my preferred candidate - and puts a \"1\" in there, one has no capacity to know that one has already voted in that box.  One might vote for the sixth candidate as one's first preference then go to the third candidate, Senator Freeman, as one's second preference.  Then one has a number one for the sixth candidate and a number two for the third candidate and one has to go on and on.  There are no little window shutters to say that one has filled out a box.  One cannot feel that one has done it and there are no windows to say that one has completed it.  People are using 10 cent pieces in polling stations.  These are slippery and there is a whip-round in polling stations to find 10 cent pieces.  <\/p><p>It is still unacceptable and it still disenfranchises people.  It does not make us equal in our ability to cast the most important vote that we have, a franchise to which we are entitled.  I hope the Minister of State will listen to the people and to the difficulties that were encountered because I dread to think of the next certain election - there may be a general election but the next one that is certain is the local elections - because it will be an absolute nightmare due to the length of the paper and the number of candidates.  It is not too costly to change it.<\/p><p>Article 29 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ensures equal access to persons for political rights, to be enjoyed on an equal basis.  We have signed up to an international protocol which commits us to equal access.  The refusal to ratify the optional protocol to the convention denies persons who feel their rights are not being realised the opportunity to pursue cases further.  This needs to change.  The optional protocol should be ratified without any undue delay.  One tool to enable equal access is online voter registration.  I have spoken before about how outdated and archaic the process is.  If the State has confidence that a passport can be renewed securely online, surely there is no reason it cannot have the same confidence in respect of voter registration.  An online facility with auditory and visual aids would help people with disabilities to register, but there is nothing online currently.  As Senator Dolan recently referenced in the Seanad, 11 constituencies have issues regarding access.  The Minister of State talked about ramps, the height of the voting booth and access to the school hall or whatever building is used as the local polling station in his area of Carlow-Kilkenny.  The Minister of State has given us an update on that and I hope it is improving.<\/p><p>The postal vote is available to many people with disabilities.  I suggest that the Department consider expanding this to the carers who might find it difficult to leave the house on polling day.  Accessibility should not just be seen in terms of physical infrastructure inhibitors.  Parents of children who have very debilitating illnesses may not be able to leave their homes.  In the last debate the Minister of State said that we have a generally high turnout in comparison with Britain.  While that is true, if participation policy generally favours one cohort over another, whether that be people without a disability over people with disabilities, older people over younger, upper class over lower class, the settled community over Travellers, or non-convicted people over prisoners, we will see a direct effect from that in terms of public policy and representation.  Our turnout might be high but it is skewed in favour of certain demographics.  <\/p><p>If we are truly to see all voters as equal, we have a big task of work ahead of us.  We cannot continue to deny the right to vote to the most vulnerable in our society.  As other Senators have said, we have come a bit of a way.  Unfortunately it took a High Court challenge to get this ball rolling.  We have a lot more to do and we need to listen to those with real experience on the ground, get them together and go over the simple steps I have outlined in respect of these templates, which are a start but certainly not the finish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#FF00600","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I raised this issue on the Order of Business on 17 October, as has already been referenced by Senator Devine.  I thank the Leader and I thank the Minister of State for coming back and presenting this statement.  On that day I asked that the Minister of State would set out a plan.  I find this a sandwich or two short of a plan at this stage, but it is a good start.  We need to get down and dirty with each polling station that is inaccessible and say what needs to be done and see how quickly it can be done.  We saw people get off their bums very quickly when we had issues about schools.  It is, in its own way, equally important that people can use their franchise.<\/p> <p>I particularly welcome Robbie Sinnott to the Seanad, as others have rightfully done.  Mr. Sinnott is in the Gallery and might not be happy to hear this but 30 years ago a woman named Nora Draper took the State to court, so we are not coming new to this.  Perhaps people who are dealing with it now were still going to school or were not involved at that time.  This is dragging on and on.  I named a number of constituencies where there were issues.  The Minister of State's constituency would probably come up first alphabetically.  I will list some problem polling stations for the heck of it: Castlecomer Castle primary school, Castlewarren Hall, St. Canice's Boys Club, Templeorum national school and Slieverue national school.  There are five and I could go through others.  We will not do that but it is useful to do in respect of the Minister of State's own home place.

I find it incredible that a Minister of State can come in here and state, &quot;Electoral law contains specific provisions designed to make voting as accessible and as inclusive as possible&quot; and not mention that we have ratified an international treaty in April this year.  That needs to drive the second part of the Minister of State's statement to the House.  I am asking him to come back and give an appendix to his statement which will show what actions are being taken.  Those actions will never be quick enough for people who are blind, visually impaired or whatever, but what actions are being taken to deal with each and every one of these issues?<br\/><br\/>Article 29 relates to participation in political and public life and states:<\/p><blockquote>States Parties shall guarantee to persons with disabilities political rights and the opportunity to enjoy them on an equal basis with others, and shall undertake:a) To ensure that persons with disabilities can effectively and fully participate in political and public life on an equal basis with others, directly or through freely chosen representatives, including the right and opportunity for persons with disabilities to vote and be elected, inter alia, by:<blockquote>i. Ensuring that voting procedures, facilities and materials are appropriate, accessible and easy to understand and use ...<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>Senators Conway, Devine and Ned O'Sullivan referred to the fact that things are being improved somewhat but that there is a need for them to be closed out and made easier and more accurate for people.<br\/><br\/>Protecting the right of persons with disabilities to vote in elections and public referendums - in secret and confidentially - without intimidation, etc., is the nub of the matter.  There are real issues, particularly for people who are blind or visually impaired.  I am glad that reference was made to Kevin Kelly, who is now working with the National Council for the Blind in Ireland, NCBI.  The point has been well made by Senator Conway.  I am delighted that there is engagement with the Irish Wheelchair Association, the NCBI and, hopefully, anybody else involved.<br\/><br\/>There are still real issues with those templates that pose problems.  It is not enough for the Minister of State to conclude, &quot;On balance, I think it is a case of remaining vigilant to the possibility of replacing inaccessible buildings with newer accessible buildings wherever they come on stream.&quot;  That is dragging one's heels.  The venues where people vote must be accessible.  It is good that we can find other accommodations for people to vote by post or whatever, but voting in a democracy, in its essence, involves people going into a public place - into the public realm - and casting their vote.  This is important for disabled people.  It is a mark that they count, not just in the context of votes, but as people in the public space and public realm.  That symbolism is very important.  People might ask what difference it makes, but we know enough about symbolism in this country.  It is important for disabled people.<br\/><br\/>I accept that am giving the Minister of State a bit of a hard time, but I ask him to come back in a couple of months and show us the templates and plans and outline where he has actively engaged with the different entities.  I am not getting the feeling that this is going to be progressed.  He is right that, in nine months, there will be at least two elections.  There will be another one either before or after those.  After 11 years of deliberation, in April the State said it would get this right.  Part of the article I read into the record is as good as Irish law.  That is what we have signed up to.  Let us hold our heads up internationally and, more importantly, let us hold our heads up in Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford and every other place where it needs to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#GG00200","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I will go through the matters different Senators raised.  Senator Ned O'Sullivan was first and spoke about the progression in franchise law which this year rightly marks the 100th anniversary of the first parliamentary vote for women.  We have also overcome all sorts of other hurdles and obstacles.  I am not sure I ever witnessed abuse of disabled voters but I certainly witnessed the clearing of polling stations on a number of occasions and times when presiding officers had to effectively mark people's ballots, which removes a certain aspect of the privacy of the ballot which is so crucially important.  I have heard of worse examples than that anecdotally but politics has changed and the situation that used to exist whereby, on polling day, representatives from political parties stood outside polling stations and tried to canvass at the last minute or brought people to polling stations, has certainly changed over the years.  That is not to say that it does not need to be changed further.<\/p> <p>The Senator referred to illiteracy in general and a Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members' Bill from a number of years ago.  We need to ensure that when people are casting their ballots, there can be no suspicion that their vote is identifiable as being different and that a vote processed through a machine or computer has the potential at least to be identified back to the person who cast it.  In small rural polling stations in Kerry and Kilkenny, that might apply to very small numbers of people.  In certain circumstances, it might only apply to one or two individuals.  That is not to say there is not merit in examining how it happens.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway referred to an audit of returning officers.  That is carried out after every election and referendum and that work has been done.  It has not been collated yet but the purpose of that is to try and improve things as we go on.<\/p> <p>The Senator also spoke about a working group, and Senator Dolan raised something similar.  The Department has liaised closely with the NCBI about the template and the provision of a template that would work.  I have no problem whatsoever with that becoming a formal working group, that it would be more than just the NCBI and encapsulate accessibility in its generality.  That is something which, having spoken to the national returning officer behind me, we can start working towards.  That group should be reflective of the different types of problems that people can have in terms of accessibility when it comes to voting.<\/p> <p>Senator Colm Burke's contribution was mostly about Cork.

The issue of the shutter did come up but there was not enough time available to deal with it before the most recent presidential election.  We have seven months until the next local elections and, in that time, the shutters, the serrated edge and changing the size and spacing in the font on the template can form part of the deliberations of the group.  Hopefully, we can improve it but it would be too definite to say we can get it right.  There needs to be a continuous process of improvement.  I fail to see why it cannot be in place in time for the elections due at the end of May next year.<\/p><p>Senator Dolan opened with a vitally important comment, one which is often not mentioned in discussions relating to voting and franchise.  I get a lot of demands, requests and suggestions - some of them useful and others not - as to how to improve the quality of the register and voter participation.  First, we have to provide people with the opportunity to cast their vote and, second, avoid doing anything that would undermine the system.  People have confidence in the electoral process, excluding the aberration which was the electronic voting plan, and all of us who have taken part in elections have witnessed the physical supervision of bundles of ballot papers which enables us to know what is happening.  Irish people will never deviate much from that but that is not to say things should not be improved where possible.  The fundamental aspect of this is ensuring the list of 23 inaccessible stations is dealt with.  It will probably involve the working group getting down into the nitty-gritty with returning officers in the constituencies involved.  This goes to the heart of being Minister with responsibility for local government.  There is significant local autonomy for returning officers in making provisions for the designation of polling stations and we can only set the rules.  There are places without permanent structures which are accessible for people who want to cast a vote but temporary measures such as the provision of ramps in old primary school buildings can be taken.  The polling station where I grew up, in a small village with ten houses, has all the necessary ramps for this purpose and this should be the case everywhere.  We cannot ensure for certain that there will be permanent buildings that are 100% accessible but we can make temporary buildings accessible for polling day and we are all at one on this issue.<\/p><p>I will endeavour to respond directly to the Leader on the development of the informal group into a broader working group on accessibility in time for the next local and European elections in May 2019.  I have no problem reverting to the House on that in due course.<\/p><p>I believe I have covered most of what Senators have said.  I also welcome Robbie Sinnott - I did not know he was in the Gallery when I was speaking.  He had to fight for rights for himself and others and has had a significant impact on our franchise arrangements.  The way we cast our votes is such a fundamental part of our democracy that we often take it for granted and I would welcome Mr. Sinnott being part of the broader engagement on accessibility in advance of the elections which are due in seven months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#HH00400","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541514600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.35 p.m. and resumed at 6.15 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017: Committee Stage (Resumed)","time":1541514600,"counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#NN00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541514600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>SECTION 27<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541514600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on Government amendment No. 66:<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541514600,"counter":171,"content":"<p><\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality to resume our consideration of the Bill.

In the intervening period I have considered what the Minister frankly admitted to be his understanding of the proposed impact of the legislation, including his amendments to sections 27 and 28, and the inclusion of the Attorney General as a member of the commission.  I have spoken to persons high and low about the suggestion that it should be a criminal offence for the Attorney General to disclose to the Cabinet the names of judges who applied for promotion and who have been unsuccessful.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There was a sense of general astonishment that the Minister could be contemplating a provision that would put the Attorney General in such an invidious position.  Like the Minister, I strongly support the inclusion of the Attorney General on the commission, if there must be a commission at all.  The Attorney General should be there with absolute regard to his or her function as the legal adviser to the Government.<\/p><p>I do not want to repeat a point I made at great length on the previous occasion, but this legislation purports to acknowledge that it is the right of the Government to promote any eligible judge to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court, regardless of whether he or she is recommended.  The escape hatch from complete unconstitutionality is that the legislation expressly recognises that the Government can decide not to have any regard to the views of the commission and can make its own decisions in the context of promoting eligible judges to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court, or to the presidency of either.  It is a really extraordinary proposal to state to the Attorney General, who is supposed to advise the Cabinet on the options open to it, in statute that he or she would commit a criminal offence if he or she told it that a certain judge had expressed an interest in a particular appointment and had not been short-listed but was available.  It is extraordinary to inform the Attorney General that he or she cannot tell the Cabinet that Ms Justice Bloggs wants a position, would be a good appointee and has applied three for promotion to the Supreme Court on three occasions but has been denied inclusion on the list.  The proposition that a criminal offence would be committed in those circumstances is staggering.  The Attorney General should not be so circumscribed in what he or she can tell the Cabinet.<\/p><p>This matter should be reconsidered at a fundamental level.  The current Attorney General would probably be in a slightly invidious position in advising as to his function in respect of this issue.  It is improbable that the Attorney General should consider it correct that he would commit a criminal offence if he imparted this information to his Cabinet colleagues.  It calls into question his membership of the commission if he is to be circumscribed in this way.  In order that there is no misunderstanding, I must point out that it has been the practice in this country since time immemorial that successive Attorneys General considered themselves not merely free, but duty-bound - particularly when asked by the Government, the head of Government or the Minister for Justice and Equality - to approach individual members of the Bench and ask them if they would consider promotion, and also to approach senior solicitors and barristers and ask them the same question.  What I really fear about this provision, taken in conjunction with the presence of the Attorney General as a member of the commission, is that we will have the worst of all worlds.  The Attorney General will effectively be silenced or sidetracked by a provision which imposes a criminal liability on him or her should he or she inform the Cabinet of the true position regarding what is happening at the commission.<\/p><p>Why should the Government not know what is happening at the commission?  The Government is bound by Cabinet confidentiality, so why should it not know that eight senior judges are constantly being turned down by the judicial appointments commission in favour of other nominees?  What common-sense or practical purpose is served by putting the Government in the position of having to play blind man's buff regarding who is available for judicial appointment and who is anxious to be appointed?  The Government will be put in the position of not being able to be informed of the true situation, on pain of the imposition of the true situation.  As stated previously, the effect of the ban on canvassing, the presence of the Attorney General on the commission and the prohibition on him or her - under pain of criminal sanction - not to disclose the identities of unsuccessful candidates to the Government, would be to drag the Bill across the line into the realm of unconstitutionality.  I repeat those points and re-emphasise my view that this is a remarkable new excursion in Irish constitutional politics, a remarkable inhibition on the role of the Attorney General and, above all, a remarkable circumscription of the real function of Government - which cannot be taken away from it - to make appointments in the full knowledge of who is available for judicial appointment and who is not and who wants to be appointed and who does not.<\/p><p>As I understand it, in order to prevent unseemly correspondence between judges and Ministers for Justice and Equality, a convention was recently entered into whereby members of the Bench who wished to be appointed to more senior positions under the current system were invited to notify the secretary to the Government of their desire in this regard.  I see no reason that should not be preserved.  If possible, I would like the Minister to outline his understanding of the ban on canvassing and certain other statutory provisions this Bill would enact and whether members of the Judiciary will be in a position to inform the secretary to the Government that they wish to be appointed.  By way of a footnote, one of the most extraordinary features of what is proposed is that we do not yet have clarity as to whether a judge or a candidate who is not successful in being short-listed in his or her application will be informed of that fact.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It must be a very strange provision indeed in statute law that a judge who applied on numerous occasions to be shortlisted would not be informed that his or her application to be shortlisted was turned down on every single occasion by the commission, a majority of the members of which are lay people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#NN01100","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>We have already had considerable discussions on this section and on these amendments.

I cannot comment on the situation under previous Administrations.  I want to acknowledge what the Senator has said about the Bill's confidentiality requirements.  He has queried whether those requirements imply that the Attorney General cannot disclose to the Cabinet the names of people who have not been recommended by the commission.  He has referred tonight and previously to circumstances in which the Cabinet is minded not to appoint a recommended person and the Attorney General is asked about another applicant.  In that context, the Senator has referred to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board provisions, which allow all the names to be brought to the attention of the Minister.  He has asked whether it will be permissible for the Attorney General, as the legal adviser to the Government, to advise the Government against the commission's recommendations in circumstances in which other people would be better suited to the position.  Of course there are difficulties here because the fundamental requirement of confidentiality, as envisaged under sections 27 and 28, is important.  That requirement is clearly set out in section 28, which makes it clear that a member of the commission, &quot;except for the purposes of this Act&quot; shall not &quot;in relation to persons applying for [...] judicial office&quot; disclose <i>inter alia<\/i>the &quot;proceedings of the Commission&quot;.  That is not dissimilar to the situation we have at present, whereby the proceedings of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board are not disclosed or discussed at any level, for important reasons.<\/p><p>I consider it important for the Attorney General to be a member of the commission.  I acknowledge that Senator McDowell has said he believes the Attorney General's membership of the commission is important.  We are in agreement on that.  In fact, the House is in agreement on that because it has considered amendments in that regard.<\/p><p>Having acknowledged the Attorney General's membership of the commission, I believe it follows that the Attorney General as a member of the commission should be bound by the same statutory obligations as other members of the commission.  I am not sure the Attorney General should be treated differently from other members of the commission.  The Attorney General of the day brings specific credentials, expertise and experience with him or her.  I do not think it would be fair to introduce a hierarchy of membership, whereby some members of the commission have greater powers or certain exemptions that are not enjoyed by others.  I think it is fair and reasonable for the Attorney General, as a member of the commission, to be bound by the same obligations of a statutory nature that are made clear in the Bill.  The Bill is clear on the precise information that is to be brought to the attention of the Government.  This does not include the provision of the names of people who may not be recommended, who have not been recommended, or who might be out there and may be appropriate and suitable but, in the circumstances, are not in the equation.<\/p><p>It is clear that the decision-making process is in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Bill.  Of course there are policy issues here.  The existence of the commission is such to facilitate the appointment of the best applicants.  In these circumstances, three names will be recommended.  If we were to give the Attorney General special status or exemptions under the law, the effect of that would be to facilitate second-guessing on the part of the Attorney General, who would then be in a position to undermine the entire process.  I do not believe it is the role of the Attorney General and the commission to second-guess a decision that has been made by the commission following due consideration.  It seems clear to me, having regard to the status of the Attorney General - I acknowledge the role played by Senator McDowell as Attorney General over a decade ago - that the Attorney General will be in a position to discuss the recommended names with his or her Cabinet colleagues when these matters are being considered by the Cabinet.  Of course this will be subject to the accepted confidentiality norms or requirements that apply to the Government.  I want to make it clear that as I see it, the position of the Attorney General, like other members of the commission, is such that he or she will be statutorily bound by the terms of the Bill.  The role of the Attorney General as a member of the commission will also apply, or will also have effect, when the Government is considering the names that have been recommended.<\/p><p>I listened to what Senator McDowell had to say at length the last time we discussed this matter.  Following that debate, I took the opportunity to seek further advice on it.  It is clear from that advice that the Attorney General would not be at liberty to say that a candidate who was not the subject matter of a recommendation and whose name did not appear was, in effect, more suitable then any of the three people who were recommended.  If that is the point that Senator McDowell is making, I differ from him on it on the basis of the Attorney General's membership of the commission.  I see this commission as being similar to other committees on which the Attorney General may be requested to sit, or other situations in which he or she may be requested to get involved.  When the Attorney General signs up to a report, it would be unlikely - in fact, it would be unacceptable - for him or her to say something completely different at a Cabinet meeting, or to do the opposite in practice.<\/p><p>Senator McDowell adverted to what he described as a rather invidious situation in which I might seek the advice of the Attorney General and put him or her in something of an invidious position.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not see it that way.  I see the Attorney General needing to be objective about the role and function of that office under the Bill.  I do not see that as having any implications, adverse or otherwise, for the exercise of the function of the Government under the Constitution advising the President on the appointments because at Cabinet, the Attorney General will still have the advisory role under the Constitution.  I do not see the type of inconsistency about which Senator McDowell speaks.  Under the Constitution, the Government can decide whether or not to go with the recommendation of the commission.  If it chooses not to go with a recommendation, it is simply rejecting a commission decision but it is rejecting a decision to which the Attorney General was a party.  I cannot envisage a situation where we depart from what is the policy issue on the matter of the recommendation of the three names because facilitating something different in effect undermines the policy platform of the Bill.  I welcome the fact that the Attorney General will be a member of the commission.  I acknowledge the constitutional role of the Attorney General in the Government and, of course, the consequent or overarching power and authority of the Government to reject in their entirety the three recommended names that might come forward.  I do not believe it is desirable to have a hierarchy of membership that would allow the Attorney General to have a completely different and enhanced role over and above other members of the commission.  That is the essence of Senator McDowell's argument.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#PP00400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I have heard what the Minister has said.  What he intends this legislation to achieve is now clear.  He intends that the Attorney General should be prohibited on pain of committing a criminal offence from imparting to the Cabinet the identity of unsuccessful candidates in the commission.  The Minister says that this is appropriate because to excuse the Attorney General from any such obligation would somehow allow him or her to subvert the decision of the commission, assist the Cabinet in doing so or have a status different from the other members of the commission.<\/p><p>Looking to the Constitution for starters, the Attorney General is not just some officer of State.  He or she is a constitutional officer of State whose function is to be the legal adviser to the Government.  That is the function.  The Attorney General is not like the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners or somebody who has just been appointed <i>ex officio<\/i>to this commission.  He or she only holds the position of Attorney General because he or she is the legal adviser to the Government.  Therefore, if we say that the legal adviser to the Government is to be <i>ex officio<\/i>a member of this commission, we must take the Attorney General as we find him or her under the Constitution, which is that he or she is the legal adviser to the Government and comes in that capacity and no other.  The Attorney General is not like the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, the Ombudsman or somebody else who is not a constitutional officer.  He or she is being selected directly because he or she is the legal adviser to the Government.  <\/p><p>The Minister has spoken about the undesirability of the Attorney General being in a position to, in effect, subvert a decision to which he or she was party but let us get the Constitution right on this.  If the Attorney General was adamantly opposed to Michael McDowell, S.C., being on a shortlist and was outvoted by a lay majority, as is possible under this statutory scheme, to say that he or she is party to the decision is stretching things a long way.  It involves saying that it is a decision to which the Attorney General is effectively handcuffed whether or not he or she likes it, opposes it or thinks it unsuitable.  To say in that context, as the Minister now seems to be implying, that because the Attorney General will be on this commission, he or she effectively has a duty of loyalty to the decision of the commission even where the Attorney General has been outvoted and must not advise the Government to take a different course is to subordinate him or her completely and ignore his or her role as legal adviser to the Government.  <\/p><p>Therefore, I do not accept the proposition now advanced by the Minister that this would create a two-tier membership.  We are bringing a man or woman on to this commission <i>ex officio<\/i>to perform a function.  By making the Attorney General an <i>ex officio<\/i>member of the commission, the only person we are bringing on is the legal adviser to the Government itself.  That is a constitutional status.  The Attorney General has a constitutional duty to advise the Government on all matters relating to law.  It has always been the case that the Attorney General of the day contributes to the debate on the suitability of a judge.  I think the Minister candidly admits that there would be no problem with the Attorney General looking at the shortlist and saying it should be &quot;A&quot; rather than &quot;C&quot;.  In my view, there is no problem with that.  That is a function the Attorney General has.  <\/p><p>As I said on the last occasion, it may have changed in the meantime but it was certainly the case when I was Minister for justice that the Attorney General had to be consulted under the Cabinet procedures before the Minister for justice made a proposal.  Why would that be among the Cabinet procedures if it was not the case that the Attorney General could advise the Government as to the merits of the Minister's proposal?  I believe that to function properly as Attorney General, the individual in question should be free at a Cabinet meeting to express his or her views not merely as between the shortlisted people, particularly when it is quite possible that he or she will not have agreed with the composition of the shortlist in the first place, but to indicate to the Government that there are other people who are interested in the job, have not been shortlisted and in his or her view, are more suitable for appointment.  I believe this function derives from the constitutional relationship of the Attorney General as legal adviser to the Government with the members of the Government itself and cannot be interfered with by statute.  If the Attorney General is to be deprived of freedom to disclose to the Government what he or she knows to be the true situation regarding the shortlist, who was and was not on it and who was and was not available, that seriously impairs the right of the Government to know whether it is making the best appointment.  <\/p><p>The Minister says there will be a two-tier membership if the Attorney General was to be excused regarding this obligation.  First of all, it is a current obligation on the Attorney General that naturally flows from the fact that Cabinet procedures require the Attorney General to be notified of any proposal by the Minister in advance of and to consult with him or her on the appointment of any person to be a judge.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It naturally flows from the constitutional function of the Attorney General that the occupier of that office should be free to give the Government his or her frank evaluation of the shortlist and of the Government's other options including persons who are willing to be appointed but who have not been shortlisted.  <br\/><br\/>Section 40(3), which is about the obligation to consult the commission about a judicial vacancy, states, &quot;Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as limiting the advice the Government may give to the President with respect to the appointment by the President, under Article 35 of the Constitution, of a person to be a judge.&quot;  That clearly is intended to recognise the fact that the Government is at large among eligible people to appoint them to judicial office, that the Government's right to appoint persons it considers suitable is a constitutional right, and that the Government's function in tendering advice to the President is a constitutional right and duty which the Government cannot delegate to anyone else.  In the end the Government must be free to make its own decision on this matter.  <br\/><br\/>The Minister then says that the Attorney General would be in a kind of a special category among the members of the judicial appointments commission if he or she was excused from the right to inform the Government of the true situation regarding applications from promotional positions and appointments in the Judiciary.  The Attorney General, however, is in a special category by definition because the function of the Attorney General is to advise the Government on the suitability of persons to be appointed as judges.  He or she is a special case and the Minister is putting a person in as a special case.  It raises the question, if that is not the function of the Attorney General, if that is not his or her status under the Constitution, or if that status is irrelevant to membership of the commission itself, why include him or her?  I strongly support the Attorney General's presence, but I know why.  It is because the Attorney General should be in a position to tell the Government that certain people are not the best and that, in his or her view, there is somebody better.  The Government should be entitled to say that it agrees or disagrees with the Attorney General as the case may be.  <br\/><br\/>It does raise the question of why the Minister sought in the D&aacute;il to have the Attorney General included.  If the Attorney General is going to disagree with the commission and to be outvoted and then not be in a position to say that he or she was outvoted, he or she would be in a very compromised position in the Cabinet discussion on the matter.  Some Ministers might say that they do not like the look of the shortlist while others might say that the Cabinet has to pay attention to it.  They may ask the Attorney General what he or she makes of it and he or she will have to say that he or she cannot tell Cabinet who the unsuccessful applicants were because to do so would be a criminal offence and would break the clear terms of the statute.  I cannot see what the function of the Attorney General is at all if he or she is put in that invidious position.  <br\/><br\/>I suggest that there is a problem here.  The first thing one should do is not to look at the terms of one's own Bill and say that this will be the law and that will solve the matter.  One should look at the Constitution first and ask what the power of the Government is.  The Bill itself acknowledges that the commission's recommendations cannot be binding on the Government and that, under the Constitution, the Government is free to make its own decision, including a different decision if it so wishes.  <br\/><br\/>That is the first constitutional proposition.  The second is that the Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government at the time it makes its decision on that very point.  The third constitutional issue is that the Government is entitled to have the advice of the Attorney General frankly and honestly given to it by reference not merely to the shortlist before it, but to its options outside the shortlist.  It is entitled to be informed of the fact that persons whom some members of the Government might consider more suitable, and who the Attorney General might agree are more suitable, have consistently been excluded from shortlists submitted to the Government.  <br\/><br\/>One cannot wriggle away from the Constitution and just say that this will be in the Bill.  Nor can one say that, by the way, the Judiciary recommended something like this.  The Judiciary did not recommend that the Attorney General should be prevented from frankly advising the members of the Cabinet about the other unsuccessful people.  If members of the Judiciary did so recommend, they would have to put on their thinking caps because if the underlying truth is that the Government is free to go outside the terms of a commission report it must be the case that the Government is entitled to legal advice from the legal adviser to the Government about whether, in his or her view, the shortlist is appropriate or not.  I do not see why we cannot just acknowledge that simple constitutional fact.  I do not see what the problem would be in so doing.  <br\/><br\/>The point is that one of the problems with legislation is that when it comes before the courts there is this double construction rule.  If legislation is open to two constructions, one constitutional and one unconstitutional, and if it is challenged, the courts look at it and seek to give it a constitutional interpretation.  That is clear.  It is an established part of our constitutional jurisprudence.  Here, however, we have a situation where the Minister is telling this House that he intends to put these restrictions on the Attorney General in respect of the advice that he or she can give to Cabinet and that he intends to do it through penal provisions in a statute.  He intends the Attorney General to be no different from any other member of the commission in respect of the obligation of confidentiality.<br\/><br\/>It is utterly and completely wrong to force the Government into a situation where the Minister for Justice and Equality is at Cabinet making the proposal and says that he or she does not know who else was interested, where the Attorney General is sitting beside the Taoiseach at the Cabinet table and does know who else was interested, where the Cabinet is sitting around the table wondering whether the shortlist is the best that can be done, and where it is to be a criminal offence for the Attorney General to tell the Government that in fact there were five other people whom he or she considered to be better but that he or she was outvoted at the commission.  I said on the last occasion that it seems to me to be unconstitutional and I believe it to be so.<br\/><br\/>Some people may think that this will become law and doubt that anyone will have <i>locus standi<\/i>to challenge it thereafter, but I believe that any citizen, and particularly any lawyer who is an applicant for judicial appointment or who wishes or is eligible to be appointed, would have <i>locus standi <\/i>to challenge the constitutionality of this provision.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The President would be well advised to put any Bill which contains these provisions before the Supreme Court for its adjudication on whether what the Minister says he intends the legislation to achieve is compatible with the Constitution.

I am not sure the extent to which the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board votes on the number of candidates put forward but I would be surprised if there were handbags at dawn every other day at its meetings.<\/p> <p>From the very beginning of this debate, Senator McDowell's disposition has been one of adversarial conflict in respect of all amendments but I do not see the situation in the same way.  I see the commission as being in a position to advise the Government and to assist and offer guidance in the process of reaching a consensus on the matter of judicial appointments.  I see the Attorney General as bringing expertise and experience to Government and using that expertise and experience to advise the Government on the matter of the shortlist.  The Attorney General will be in a position to make a positive contribution to Government on the matter of the names that might be before Government but it would not be desirable if, as in Senator McDowell's scenario, the Attorney General was to be outvoted at every remove.  It would not be advisable for an Attorney General to seek the power to tell fellow committee members that, while he or she may be in a minority, he or she will get back at them through Government and get the name of his or her person put forward to the President.  The Attorney General is in a unique position to bring expertise to the Cabinet table and to participate in the process.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell is right to say Attorneys General are consulted on all appointments, which is right given their unique experience and expertise.  I do not believe it is appropriate for the Attorney General to have a veto over all other members but that is, in effect, what Senator McDowell is arguing for.  The Attorney General would be in a position to upstage all other members and undermine the commission at every remove but I am not sure that is in the best interests of the commission.  It is important that the Attorney General has the same obligations, the same authority and the same requirements under the legislation as other members of the commission.  I do not see the Attorney General being compromised or unfairly treated, nor do I see his or her role, function and powers under the Constitution being interfered with by the legislation.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell asked who would inform an unsuccessful candidate who might, ultimately, have been one of the three whose names went forward to Government.  Section 43(5)(h) contains a requirement on the part of the commission to ensure standards are applicable and that they conform to good practice.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Of course the commission would be informing the unsuccessful candidates, having regard to the obligation to ensure the good and proper standards of the commission in meeting its obligations under the Bill.  I do not believe that in the normal course of events, the kind of conflict described by Senator McDowell will be front and centre in every aspect of the commission's deliberations.  I do not envisage that there will be the type of adversarial voting that he sees as being endemic in the context of the commission.  The manner in which the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has arranged its statutory obligations and functions in the past will ensure there will be a level of consensus between the lay members of the commission and the lay chair of the commission.  This process will be enhanced by ensuring the presidents of the Judiciary will be on the commission.  This will ensure a consensus can be forged.  I believe that will happen before the Government reaches its conclusions on the matter of the policy decision regarding the three people to be recommended by the commission for further consideration by the Government, including the Attorney General who has a role and function as a member of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#SS00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I want to interject briefly.  My colleague, Senator McDowell, is acutely aware of human nature and the way in which people interact with one another.  He has made his professional career out of that awareness.  While I understand the Minister's point that he does not believe we would finish up with an adversarial position in which the Attorney General is totally at odds with the remainder of the judicial appointments commission, I suggest that not believing it and it not being possible are two different things.  It is highly possible that this will happen.  Anybody who has ever sat on a committee of any sort in Ireland, or anywhere else, knows that this is possible.  Given that we are talking about the most senior law officer in the land, it is also possible that he or she could be at odds with the other members of the commission and could refuse to accept their deliberations.  The legislation we are putting in place here will probably last 25 or 30 years.  With all due respect to the Minister, we cannot go on his gut feelings on how it will operate.  We have to look for the worst-case scenario, which is exactly the scenario that my colleague, Senator McDowell, has just outlined.  In such a scenario, who or what will rule?  Will the constitutional position of the Attorney General and the constitutional prerogative of the Government rule, or will the legislation rule?  I will leave it to Senator McDowell to make any other comments he might wish to make.  I am a little concerned that we sometimes proceed on the basis of a Minister's views or opinions which may not be reflected in a subsequent court case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#TT00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I am speaking on the basis of my experience as someone who entered politics in my 40s, which is quite late in life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#TT00300","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>It is not that late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#TT00400","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>It is when one considers that many people come into politics straight from school with very little life experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#TT00500","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>There is nothing wrong with that<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#TT00600","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I would like to come back to the Minister's remarks.  After I became a member of a local authority, I became a member of several committees.  Whenever I fundamentally disagreed with the consensus view within a committee, it used to be explained to me that the committee had always worked on the basis of consensus.  I used to be told that the members of the committee did not want to vote on matters that had never before been voted on in the history of the committee.  They did not want me to cause division.  I have seen new people being pressurised in that way.  They have to listen to the old hands who have been around for a long time saying that they want consensus rather than division and that they want to agree on any names that are going forward.  I worry when I hear people saying they want to reach consensus because reaching consensus is sometimes the wrong thing to do.  It is sometimes better to have a voice saying \"I do not agree\".  At certain times, people should be asked to put their names to what they are supporting in a vote.  Votes can be a good way of making sure people are clear in their own minds about the decisions they are making.  I refer, for example, to requiring people to put their names to a vote on a particular recommendation.  I have seen many decisions change when they were challenged in that way.  The potential for conflict is there.  I am not an expert in this area, but I am somewhat nervous as I listen to the debate about tying the Attorney General's hands behind his or her back after he or she has sat in on meetings and listened to what was said.  If a member of the Cabinet who is not particularly happy with any of the three names put before the Cabinet decides to ask the Attorney General whether anybody else made an application, he or she will have to say that such information cannot be divulged on the basis that it would be a breach of the law to advise the Cabinet that names of good and substantial candidates were considered and voted down.  It seems that the Attorney General will not be allowed to express that view at a Cabinet meeting.  I am a little concerned about the language.  If I am misinterpreting what the Minister is saying, I apologise.  My remarks are based on the vibe I got from the answers the Minister gave to Senator McDowell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#TT00700","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I want to put it on the record that the Minister has informed the House that he believes unsuccessful candidates will be notified of that fact.  If that is the case, it will have to be made very clear on Report Stage.  We cannot treat this as something that the Minister hopes for, but the commission can decide not to do.  Is it the case that those who will be shortlisted will be notified of the fact of their having been shortlisted?  The commission will not be making the final decision, as it will be a matter for the Government.  If a particular judge is told that the commission accepted that he or she was one of the top three, but he or she is not appointed to the Supreme Court, he or she will have to draw the inference that this was a decision made by the Government.  As we live in a small world, he or she will know who is on the shortlist.  If we notify people that they were on the shortlist but did not make the grade at Government level, that will have certain implications as well.  I want to put it on the record that if the Minister blithely says he imagines that best practice will involve telling unsuccessful candidates that they were not successful in being shortlisted, consideration must be given to whether those who were shortlisted should be told that they were shortlisted, only for the fine members of the Cabinet to decide to go somewhere else in the last analysis.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would like to know exactly what the legislation is supposed to be achieving in that context.<br\/><br\/>The Minister indicated that I am being unduly adversarial in my approach.  Let me remind him of a few basic facts.  The Bill makes detailed provision in respect of how votes should be carried out, who has the casting vote and who is always in the majority.  It states that a lawyer, be he or she a judge or a practitioner, can never be the person with the casting vote on any issue.  I did not imagine this, I did not put it into the legislation.  This was put in by those who drafted it.  I do not have to tell the Minister that, besides himself, one of the great proponents of the legislation, his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has repeatedly indicated that the purpose of what is proposed is to end cronyism in the appointment of judges.  In stating this, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has implicated the Judiciary, as well as successive Governments, in acts of cronyism.<br\/><br\/>I am not bringing some new proposal before the House as to how judges should be appointed.  As far as I know, it is not the case that the existing arrangements require casting votes on the part of the Chief Justice.  I have never come across that.  The Minister asked a question that I am certainly glad to answer.  In my experience as Attorney General and as a member of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, there were no votes, just discussions.  There were sometimes disagreements but they were amicably resolved one way or the other.  Nonetheless, there was never a situation of raising one's hand for one person rather than another because the system did not require it.  JAAB indicated whether a person was wholly unsuitable or whether he or she could be recommended to Government.  If there was a serious group of people, even a minority, which thought that Mr. Kevin Humphreys was suitable, and the other members indicated that there was something iffy about him, his name would still go forward unless there was somebody stating that he was wholly unsuitable.  It was left to the Government to decide.  The Attorney General would have been at both meetings and would have been in a position to steer the Government on the issue.  There was nothing wrong with that.  It did not pollute the JAAB process at any point that the Attorney General was in a position to state that there was strong opposition to a candidate from some quarters but that the Attorney General felt he or she was a good person or a bad person, as the case may have been.<br\/><br\/>I do not accept the proposition that I am being unduly adversarial.  I would hope that the commission, like JAAB, would operate by consensus.  If then good people are seeking appointment to the High Court, it is much easier for a consensus to emerge and to say that here are ten good people and that it is now for the Government to decide.  It is bound to be the case that if we say that we cannot send forward more than three candidates, people will ask precisely why candidate A is better than candidate D and will state that they believe strongly in candidate D and that they do not believe candidate A is better.  There is going to be much more personal assessment by the members of this commission of the people they are putting on <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the people they are not putting on.  The comparative merits of two people on a short list will be of great importance.  That is inevitable.  It is not an adversarial thing.  The entire process will require that if those in the room agree on six people who have substantial support on the commission to be appointed to the Supreme Court, they will have to, by some process, knock out three and put the other three on the short list.<br\/><br\/>The Minister says that I am conjuring up a situation whereby the Attorney General is all on his or her own in opposition to somebody.  I am not doing so.  I am saying that it could well be the case that the Attorney General could be one of five or six people on the commission who had a strong objection to one person or a strong preference for another and who id not agree with what was done.  Let us remember that the system the Minister is putting place gives a majority of this commission the right to decide on each person.  It is not a proportional representation election.  One can have three votes.  It will be a matter of candidate A, candidate B and candidate C, and the majority of the commission being entitled to state that candidate D will not be on the list.  That process is done by a vote in the event of a disagreement.  If there is equality on any occasion, the lay chairperson is given a further vote.  He or she is given one vote to bring it to equality and a further vote to bring it over the line.<br\/><br\/>I am not conjuring up an adversarial scenario.  Having 15 members on the commission and giving them the function of winnowing out all the suitable and unsuitable people to the point at which only three names will go to the Cabinet, a situation is bound to arise from time to time whereby the Attorney General will be in a minority.  That is bound to happen unless the commission operates on the basis of complete consensus in respect of everything, which is not what is envisaged.  If there were to be complete consensus on everything, there would be no need for a lay majority, for a casting vote for the lay chairperson or for every committee and sub-committee of the commission to be chaired by a layperson.  That would not be required if it was all to operate by some kind of cosy consensus.  It is not designed to do that.  That is its qualifying characteristic.<br\/><br\/>Government Amendment No. 69 states that it will be a criminal offence for a person to contravene section 27(1).  If the amendment is accepted, it will be a criminal offence for the Attorney General to disclose confidential information.  The definition of &quot;confidential information&quot; in section 27(2) refers to &quot;information that is expressed by the Commission to be confidential&quot;.  A majority of the commission will decide what is confidential and the Minister has admitted here that he certainly envisages that the identity of unsuccessful applicants will remain confidential, even to the commission and to the particular individuals involved if they are informed of their lack of success by a letter issued to them.  There is a series of things here which I find strange.  An unsuccessful applicant will get a letter and will be informed that he or she has been unsuccessful in being short-listed, but the Attorney General, on pain of committing a criminal offence, will not be able to tell the Cabinet that such a letter issued in respect of any individual.  I cannot square that as a reasonable approach to all of this.<br\/><br\/>I am not seeking special privileged status for the Attorney General; I am just asking that his or her constitutional status be recognised and that it be stated in section 27 that nothing will inhibit him or her from giving a free and frank account to the Cabinet of the process of selection, including information on who was successful and who was not.  That would not allow the Attorney General to subvert the process in its entirety, but it would allow him or her to do what he or she is charged with doing by virtue of his or her constitutional position, which is to give proper legal advice to the Government on the suitability of candidates.<br\/><br\/>I am glad the Minister indicated that it is still the case that the Attorney General must, under Cabinet procedure, be consulted.  I had wondered whether that had disappeared.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#TT00800","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541514600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union: Statements","time":1541514600,"counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#VV00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>As the House will be fully aware, not least through the important work of the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, Brexit poses a unique and unprecedented challenge for Ireland.  Ireland will be more affected than any other member state by the UK's departure from the EU.  While we respect the UK's decision to leave, we certainly regret it.<\/p> <p>Brexit will bring changes for all of us.  Having joined the EU together with the UK, our shared membership of the EU has been an important and positive factor in the complex history of our relations.  Within the Union, Ireland and Britain have grown closer.  Our priority now is to ensure that this progress is not set back.<\/p> <p>The negotiations have at times been difficult, which is not surprising.  Brexit is, after all, a complex process of disentangling laws, trade agreements and co-operation that go back decades and touch on almost all state activities.  Although we had all hoped to reach an agreement in time for the European Council in October, regrettably, this was not possible.  A number of issues remain, most notably the backstop on avoiding a hard border on the island.  The negotiations are continuing but it is clear that they need to make decisive progress quickly if a withdrawal agreement is to be concluded and ratified before the UK leaves the EU on 29 March.  Mr. Barnier has sought to \"de-dramatise\" the backstop and focus on its technical aspects while also seeking to address the UK's stated need for a UK-wide customs arrangement as a means to find a solution and compromise.  This de-dramatisation would not alter the overall goal of the backstop, which is to ensure there is no return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland under any circumstances.  The EU has listened to UK concerns and has worked to address them.  Mr. Barnier has displayed imagination within the bounds of his mandate to seek agreement but he has been given clear guidelines within which to operate and he must do so.  I have complete confidence that he will do his utmost to achieve an agreement which is in line with the commitments provided by the UK in the joint progress report of last December and again in Prime Minister May's letter to President Tusk last March.  Equally, our fellow member states have displayed unwavering solidarity and support for Ireland.  I would like to express my sincere gratitude to them for that and for their understanding of the importance of the border issue to protecting the peace process.<\/p> <p>The invisible border was made possible in part due to the UK and Ireland's membership of the Single Market and customs union.  This is of critical importance to the more than 7,000 businesses that trade across the Border from north to south supporting more than 160,000 jobs.  Any introduction of customs checks or divergence in regulatory regimes would create an impediment to the operation of these businesses.  However, the question of the Border in the Brexit negotiations is not solely about economics.  It is also about people's lives and protecting the gains and benefits of the peace process.  Our shared membership of the EU and the elimination of all checks at the Border have been a vital support to the hard-won peace.  Crossing the Border has become a routine part of life and every month, there are almost two million car crossings.  Behind these statistics are people going to work, to study, to see a doctor, to see a friend or to do business.  All these simple everyday contacts and connections are integral to communities in the Border region and to harnessing the opportunities of peace over the past 20 years.  This is why that intensive work is also continuing on ensuring the common travel area will function post-Brexit and that the rights of people in Northern Ireland will be protected.<\/p> <p>There has been a lot of speculation in recent days about deals involving a time-limited backstop or the ability of the UK to unilaterally withdraw from the backstop.  When I met Secretary of State Raab and Minister Lidington last week, I made it clear, as did the Taoiseach in his phone call yesterday with Prime Minister May, that while there is an openness to consider proposals for a review mechanism, it must be clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop.  We also recalled the prior commitments made by the UK that the backstop must apply \"unless and until\" alternative arrangements are agreed.  We expect the UK Government to honour the commitments it has made in full.<\/p> <p>While the withdrawal agreement and the backstop are understandably the focus and priority right now as we seek a deal, agreement on the framework for the future relationship between the EU and the UK is also important for Ireland.  The Government has consistently said that we want the closest possible future relationship between the EU and the UK.  At the same time, such a relationship must respect the integrity of the EU's Single Market, a single market that has brought significant benefits for this country.  It is in our vital interests that it is fully protected.  Difficulties remain in finalising the withdrawal agreement but it remains the Government's view that a no-deal scenario is still unlikely.  No one wants a no-deal end game here.  Everybody loses in that scenario.  However, it is our responsibility to prepare for all scenarios and our activities in this respect are well advanced.   In July, the Government&rsquo;s preparedness and contingency process transitioned from the planning stage to the implementation stage.  As a result, work intensified across all Departments to prepare for both deal and no deal scenarios.  Each Department is preparing detailed actions plans for both these outcomes.<\/p> <p>We are particularly focused on the areas where the Government, rather than the EU, has direct responsibility, and on measures that need to be taken on an east-west basis, such as customs and veterinary controls at our ports and airports.  These preparations have been supported by recent budgets, which aim to assist businesses and farmers to ensure they receive the necessary support required to adjust to the changes that Brexit will bring.  For example, budget 2019 included a new future growth loan scheme of up to &euro;300 million for SMEs and the agrifood sector.<\/p> <p>No matter what the deal is, Brexit will bring change.  We cannot be certain about the exact form of this change as negotiations continue but it is important that we prepare for what we do know and plan for all eventualities.  It is important that others do the same, in particular, our businesses, big and small.  To this end, my Department has co-ordinated a nationwide Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign to assist the public in understanding how Brexit will affect them and their businesses.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As part of this, we launched a revamped website and dedicated social media channels.

These events, supported by Government agencies, provided local businesses with information on the supports available to them and provided practical advice on how to best manage the changes Brexit will bring.  More than 2,000 citizens or business people attended these events.  We will continue to engage with the people of Ireland in an open and honest manner, and we will continue to provide the appropriate assistance to businesses and individuals who need it.  In parallel, we will continue to engage closely with the European Commission and our EU partners both on the negotiations and on Brexit preparedness, given Ireland&rsquo;s unique position.  <\/p><p>I wish to refer to our bilateral relationship with the UK.  Many Senators may have heard at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference last week that both Governments have agreed to develop new ambitious structures which demonstrate the strength and depth of the unique relationship between Ireland and Britain.  I am very pleased that both Governments have committed to annual summits, led by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister, which will allow for broad and deep co-operation across a wide range of policy areas.  We look forward to developing detailed proposals in this respect over the coming months, ahead of the first summit, which will most likely be held in the second half of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#VV00400","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House, and thank him for coming to brief the Seanad on the present situation, in particular the ever-moving position of the British Government.  I remind the Minister that last December he said that the backstop was cast-iron and bullet proof.  Things do not seem to be quite as bullet-proof as they were last December.  I appreciate that the British Government is moving its position so regularly that it is very hard to keep in touch with what is happening.  In his speech he spoke about the invisible border which was made possible in part due to the UK and Ireland's membership of the Single Market customs union.  This is of critical importance to more than 7,000 businesses that trade across the Border, from North to South, supporting 160,000 jobs.  That is a remarkable figure; we should keep it in mind.<\/p> <p>We must have a frictionless border between the North and South, but also between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It is absolutely vital that we have direct access to mainland Europe through Britain, and that the access to the channel tunnel would be maintained in the post-Brexit era, beginning at the end of March 2019.  It is very important that planning is being done in that area and that negotiations are continuing in that regard.  It is also important that the technology required is developed.  I recently spoke at the National College of Ireland in Dublin, and the excellent students there brought a project to Leinster House recently which looked at how a solution could be devised using the most modern technology possible, allowing for the free movement of particular goods from Ireland, through Northern Ireland and Britain to the European mainland.  Our ports will be used to that end as well.  There is much work to be done in that regard.  <\/p> <p>This is a particularly worrying time.  The statements today by the British Government have caused confusion.  The T&aacute;naiste has been in touch with his counterparts in Britain about those comments and I know he has been in touch with Michel Barnier as well.  It is vital that the negotiations continue.  We have the good will of the other 26 countries, but no other country within the EU will be more affected than Ireland.  As a member of the Conference for Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC - and I know that the Acting Chairman, Senator Craughwell, attends meetings of that body - I am aware that there is not as much interest in Brexit in some European countries as one might think.  Those countries have their own worries.<\/p> <p>We must bear in mind that in the negotiations it has been agreed that the free movement of people within the UK and Ireland will be maintained.  It is a sacred agreement that was negotiated, and was there before we got our freedom and formed a Government.  There is a particularly strong relationship between the two countries.  It is also the case that under the Good Friday Agreement, every citizen of Northern Ireland is entitled to a dual passport.  It is a very important issue.  Everyone in the North has the right to apply for and get an Irish passport, which is also a European passport.  It is a very significant agreement that has already been reached between the United Kingdom and Ireland, through the European Union and bilaterally.  It acknowledges the conditions that existed prior to the establishment of the Republic in the 1940s.<\/p> <p>It should also be borne in mind that in 1965 iar-Thaoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, and Mr. Harold Wilson, then Prime Minister of Britain, negotiated the trade agreement between the United Kingdom and Ireland in advance of EU membership in 1973.  Our positions have been extremely close over that period of time.  No border can be enforced and it will not be enforced.  It cannot be enforced by the Irish Government or the EU, and will not be enforced by the British Government, because no customs post will survive there.  We should be blunt and say that they will not last for ten hours if re-erected along the Border.  The British Government must be aware of this.<\/p> <p>The consequences of a hard border are serious given what has been achieved under the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to this country and has benefitted every part of Ireland.  Over the last 20 years every part of Ireland, North and South, is benefitting from the relationships we have developed in areas such as tourism, trade, education and health.  We are integrated together and rightly so.  Anything that would put that in jeopardy would be absolutely diabolical and cannot possibly be contemplated.  I am confident that the British Government knows there must be an agreement.  There will be an agreement because it is not in the interests of the Government of the United Kingdom or any part of the EU not to reach a good, comprehensive agreement.<\/p> <p>As far as the Single European Act 1992 is concerned, I was the delegated Minister of State in the 1990s and happened to be there.  Mr. John Redwood, who is now a Brexiteer, was a conscientious member of the negotiating team on behalf of the British Government and co-operated fully with the decisions made at that time.  I can categorically say that the British Government was never voted down in any of those negotiations and neither was Ireland.  We received tremendous co-operation from the British Government during those negotiations.  I lament the loss of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  It is a major loss from our point of view.  We were Britain's friend and Britain was our friend.  Some people here know that.  Senator McDowell and the T&aacute;naiste, and anyone else who has served in government, knows the type of constant contact we had which led to the Single European Act, which in turn lead to advanced trading between our two countries.  <\/p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste has the full support of this House and of the Opposition.  The leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, who has been talking to his counterparts in Europe, is also fully supportive of the negotiations.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach are there to lead the negotiations in conjunction with Michel Barnier and the other 26 countries in the EU to bring about a just and long-term solution to this particular issue.  I am hopeful and confident.  The T&aacute;naiste should hold his nerve and not yield to any pressure from the British Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Terry Leyden:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=636\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have to hold firm but we have the backing of the other 26 member states to get the best possible deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#WW00200","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Uncertainty persists as time rapidly runs out on this discussion, but credit must be given to the T&aacute;naiste and to those who tirelessly pursue an agreement between the UK and the EU.  Two years on, it has become much clearer that a UK exit makes absolutely no sense, with no evidence of any economic or social argument to support a withdrawal.  We are informed, however, that this is democracy and that we must respect the referendum result, which we do.  The citizens of the UK spoke on 23 June 2016 on the basis of information much of which we now know to be questionable, not credible, possibly misleading, subjective and often completely untruthful.  Their decision was Brexit, but is it still Brexit?  If Brexit was the sale of a car, it would have been returned under mis-selling of goods legislation or trade descriptions legislation because what the electorate were sold and what they have received are completely different.  To continue the analogy of the car, the model is different, the colour is different, the engine size is different and the running costs are different.  As regards safety, we are not even sure if it has an airbag or a backstop.<\/p> <p>What is the responsible thing to do?  Perhaps it is to ask the people if the deal they are getting is what they thought or what they wanted.  If it is not, then let the British Government put the deal on the table and ask the people, in a truly democratic way, if this is the Brexit they want.  This is more important now than ever.  Last night, during a live debate on Channel 4 entitled \"Brexit: What the Nation Really Thinks\", the results of the biggest ever independent Brexit opinion poll were revealed.  This poll was conducted by Channel 4 and Survation and involved 20,000 people being interviewed between 20 October and 2 November.  The results are that 54% of people would vote to remain if the referendum was rerun tomorrow and that 105 council areas which voted leave in 2016 would now vote to remain.  However, there is still much confusion.  In the event of no deal, 35% state that the UK should stay in the EU and 36% think it should leave.  Only 19% want more time for negotiations, with 33% declaring that they would reject a deal based on what they currently know about the negotiations, 34% indicated that they do not know and only 26% would accept the deal.  Furthermore, and interestingly, most people do not seem to be concerned about the risk that Northern Ireland would leave the UK or that Scotland would seek independence.  Some 44% indicated that they have concerns for Northern Ireland but 42% state that they have none.  For those businesses that operate on one or both sides of the Border, however, this is no consolation.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the 7,000 businesses involved and the 160,000 people they employ.  Their fears are real.  For those who depend on supplying, servicing or sourcing across the Border, the survey offers no comfort.  Uncertainty is the order of the day.<\/p> <p>This indicates the highly divided nature of the UK electorate and the rationale that exists to justify a people's vote.  It would not be to question the 2016 referendum, but to validate the result.  If, based on what people now understand to be Brexit, they still vote to leave, then so be it.  As a democrat, this is something I, and we in this House, must respect and support.<\/p> <p>I am extremely disappointed to see how Ireland&rsquo;s role is being unfairly portrayed in these discussions, namely, as some sort of disruptor or with an agenda to disadvantage or act against the UK.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The importance of strong British-Irish connections cannot be underestimated, both in the past and in the future.  The efforts of those seeking to strike deals, on all sides, in the knowledge of how important this is for generations to come, needs to be applauded.  I am encouraged by the commitment to the annual summits between the UK and Ireland.  Ireland and Europe do not wish to see the UK leave, and the sensitivities of any backstop, from a unionist perspective, from a nationalist perspective, or from a British, Irish or Northern Irish perspective must be respected and understood.  If this was straightforward we would have negotiated this within the two-year timeframe.<\/p> <p>Last night&rsquo;s Channel 4 poll results have restored my faith in the UK electorate.  It is an intelligent electorate, keen to understand and to separate fact from fiction.  Respect for them entails giving them the opportunity to validate the decision to leave or kick this to touch until such time as all the arguments are made, supported and substantiated.  In a tweet earlier today, William Crawley of BBC Northern Ireland quoted Thomas Jefferson who stated, \"The cornerstone of democracy rests on the foundation of an educated electorate.\"  The British electorate is an educated electorate.<\/p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste referred to a no-deal scenario.  A no-deal Brexit would not serve Ireland well and nor would it serve Northern Ireland well.  Interestingly, it would not serve the UK well either.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste and the Government to support the UK and Northern Ireland in the context of an exit strategy.  However, I do not mean an exit strategy from the EU.  I am referring to supporting the UK and Northern Ireland in finding an exit strategy to prevent them jumping off the cliff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#XX00200","speaker":"1439"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste.  I want to express my appreciation of his constant engagement with the Houses of the Oireachtas on this matter.  I salute him, his officials and the diplomatic service on achieving solidarity with our EU partners and securing their constant support, which is no small achievement for a geographically peripheral country such as ours.<\/p> <p>The Good Friday Agreement is an international agreement.  It was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of Ireland, North and South.  The Human Rights Act is an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement and the European Court of Human Rights was incorporated into the domestic law of Northern Ireland to become the supreme authority.  Under the Equality Commission that was established in Northern Ireland, all forms of discrimination in employment, including on grounds of gender disability or ethnicity, were outlawed, although this may not have been perfectly achieved in the period since the emergence of the Good Friday Agreement.  After 2010, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights further enhanced the protection of children, workers, the environment and data.  Thankfully, in the British-EU negotiation joint report of 8 December 2017, the UK Government committed to protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, which means it supports the outlawing of discrimination, maintaining the common travel area and ensuring no hard border, as well as supporting human rights.  This is an important commitment and it is vital that we do not become responsible for imposing or enforcing any restrictive immigration policies that could arise later by way of an agreement.<\/p> <p>Speaking as a someone who lives in a Border area, it is not alarmist to say that hard frontier, or any regression from the current open arrangement, would put peace at risk on a number of fronts.  It would give an impetus to those forces that want to restart violence by providing them with a target.  We must have a backstop, but it is a last resort.  Our ambition, as a country, is to have a deal in which the UK enters into the closest possible agreement with the EU.  We want that for our own sake and for that of the UK.  The two islands need to be as integrated as possible within the EU.<\/p> <p>A market of 500 million people is not something the UK should eschew.  While it might seem worthy to seek new markets within the Commonwealth, the London School of Economics has stated that, when logistics are taken into account, a fivefold increase in trade with those countries would be required in order to achieve the same net return as from trade with the EU.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is taking into account the logistics of travel and transport and all the issues with that.<\/p><p>It is worthy of mention that with almost full employment in the UK and here the question of immigration comes into a new focus.  There is a need, particularly in the hospitality and intensive agriculture sectors on both islands, for immigrants, people from outside the EU.  Restrictive immigration practices may no longer be an economic option.<\/p><p>I have to race through these points but it is important I make them while the T&aacute;naiste is here.  I am very conscious of and happy that we have Brexit preparedness.  As someone who comes from a Border county, I make the point the change here with fluctuations in currency - no matter how ideal the new agreement is and we pray that it will  be - there will still be difficulties for the local economies in Northern Ireland and the Republic.  Fluctuations in currencies and various other issues which will create new pressures.  I was happy that there was &euro;44 million in direct aid to farmers in the last budget, that there is an improvement in the area of natural constraint with a new payment of &euro;23 million and that there are 27 capital programmes for the food industry, etc.  There is a whole range of budgetary measures in agriculture and the food sector.  I will not chronicle them all but it is an impressive and an important list.  I would like to hear the T&aacute;naiste say when summing up that he sees this as a budgetary process that will continue over the coming years and that we will insulate Border industries and agriculture in the Border areas and support agriculture and food production in a way that any changes in currency or difficulties that may arise in trading or additional costs would not cause the loss of jobs or the displacement of people as a result.  That is important.  As I said, this is a last resort situation.<\/p><p>We are anxious to maintain good UK-Ireland relationships, which are important.  We have a community on these islands that should be maintained and a community of interests and cultural and kinsmanship links.  I am very proud to be vice president of the one international assembly where the UK and Ireland will jointly work together, which is the Council of Europe.  This attaches great importance to our work on the Council of Europe.  We have had a number of bilateral meetings there with UK delegates to the Council of Europe.  My good friend Senator Leyden was a distinguished former member of that assembly and was present when we had joint functions, some of which I initiated, with the Irish and British delegations to ensure a continuation of good relations and that they understood our position and did not see us as people who were trying to be antagonistic but rather people who wanted to protect the relationship.  We cannot overemphasise the point - this was alluded to by Senator Marshall -  that the best interest of the people of the UK is served by the closest possible trading arrangement and cultural and human links with the EU.  One would not need a PhD in economics to understand that that is the case and naturally our best interest is served by that as well.<\/p><p>A good day's work has been done so far but I would like to hear the T&aacute;naiste say that we will be holding the line on the backstop and that the whole process of alleviating the difficulty that may be faced by the food sector, by agriculture and by industry in this country will be costed in budgets to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#XX00300","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Fearaim f&aacute;ilte roimh An T&aacute;naiste and thank him for tonight's contribution.  I also want to thank the Leader for ensuring that we had this time with the T&aacute;naiste at what is a crucial juncture, as colleagues and the T&aacute;naiste himself have acknowledged.  We are approaching the 11th hour and that is why we wanted to avail of the opportunity to engage with the T&aacute;naiste.  It is also why we are seeing a mobilised and an energised approach to the T&aacute;naiste from the business community, civic society, the community and voluntary sector, the political class and many more sectors in between.  I always appreciate and listen very intently when my colleague, Senator Marshall, rises to his feet, not least in debates such as this one.  I also followed the surveys done by and the debate on Channel 4 last night.  Despite the statistics and the polls, some of which were very striking for obvious reasons, what struck me was that much like the referendum lead-in itself there was no voice from the North in that debate.  There was no consideration given to the North.  One must wonder if that is manifest of British society.  Are lessons being learned?<\/p> <p>As colleagues have done, I wish the T&aacute;naiste and his officials every success because the T&aacute;naiste will appreciate that much of our welfare and, as he rightly acknowledged, our rights and entitlements and the peace that we avail of depend on this.  I assure the T&aacute;naiste, and he might be cynical about it but I hope he is not, that I want to part with politics and talk to him as a citizen who, like the 1,000 plus who wrote to the Taoiseach during the week, is on a knife edge as to the future and what we can come to expect.  While we could get into the argument around the text of the agreement last December and the cast-iron guarantees, the lesson has been learned on negotiation with the British Government and where the cast-iron guarantees rest.  That is where we are at.  I do not want to over-egg the pudding in making that point but we need cast-iron guarantees from the Irish Government and I believe we have got them.  We will be watching intently to ensure the Irish Government lives up to them.<\/p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste was right when he said the question of the Border and the Brexit negotiations are not just about economics and businesses or anything else.  It goes much deeper than that.  It is much more fundamental than that.  Colleagues, not least colleagues from along the Border like Senator O'Reilly, appreciate those nuances more than most.  That is why the letter to the Taoiseach by such a significant and broad representation of Northern society expressed and articulated people's fears and concerns but also their expectations.  I appreciate and acknowledge the T&aacute;naiste's and his officials' engagement with Northern society, not least with that representative group of Northern civic nationalism.<\/p> <p>That is why, to touch on another element of the T&aacute;naiste's speech, and appreciating the dynamics of this, I am not so green as to expect that we would have tanks rolling up to the Border.  That is not what anyone wants to see.  I believe the T&aacute;naiste missed a trick, however, when the State-wide Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign did not go North.  There was an opportunity there.  His Department, officials and the secretariat in the North can host discussions around the Decade of Centenaries, can host lectures and can host receptions.  It was not too much to ask, not least when one considers that the British Government told businesses in the North to engage with the Irish Government if they had any fears.  Hopefully, that will be a lesson learned and we can build on the existing infrastructure and utilise the Irish Government infrastructure in the North to facilitate engagement with civic society, the business community, the trade union movement, people who have a fear and citizens who have an expectation, an entitlement and a right to engage with the Government and with the guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>I have raised with the T&aacute;naiste before the possibility of seeing that intention of the Irish Government not to leave any of us behind and the utilisation of the existing infrastructure and the development of a facility, service or amenity that people can avail of - people who as we all know and as has been outlined are being trapped in a Brexit scenario they opposed.  Perhaps that is something that the T&aacute;naiste could reflect on.  Going back several months, the T&aacute;naiste said at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement that he would look at the idea, have a think about and engage on it.  Perhaps he might, as a result of his engagements, have a broader view on that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have two more points to make quickly.  I am conscious that other colleagues want to get in and I do not necessarily need to use all of my time.  The T&aacute;naiste said the Government was preparing for all scenarios.  On the one hand, that troubles me as it indicates an element that presents us with greater difficulty and situations we do not want to see.  In preparing for all scenarios, we need to look to the Good Friday Agreement.  If we are upholders and guarantors of the Agreement and want to avail of a democratic life jacket to ensure, as the former Taoiseach did, a re-entry of the North into the EU, we should look at preparing for Irish reunification.  We should not be afraid of that.  It is heightened.  I am an advocate and champion of it every day of the week but in a non-exploitative way.  There is a fundamental democratic onus on us in that regard if we are preparing for all scenarios.  No only is there historical and ideological obligation to look at all of that, there is now a case for the practical rolling out of that preparedness which makes clear and obvious sense.  We should not be afraid of that.  There is a growing expectation in Northern Ireland society that the Irish Government will facilitate opening that democratic discussion, discourse and space for people to engage in an informed, collaborative and respective way.  There are a couple of points to address there, not least what I have referred to previously as the citizenship hub.<\/p><p>I refer to the T&aacute;naiste's remarks on the backstop.  I want to have them before me so that I am fair to him and quote him accurately.  It is the issue of the review and the concession by the Government of an openness to considering proposals for a review mechanism.

There is no doubt that we are at a critical juncture now.  It is hard to figure we are there when a week or two ago, the British Prime Minister told us we were 95% there.  The T&aacute;naiste and many others have been working on the remaining 5% since it revolves around the backstop.  Britain was never more divided in its regions and across Scotland, the North of Ireland, Wales and within England itself.  Those of us who attended the recent British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly plenary in London discovered that both the Conservative and Labour parties were equally disunited.  I was surprised, having thought the Labour people were coming around, but that was not at all the case.  All people from constituencies along the east coast were concerned about was fishing rights and they were leavers.  They are totally divided.  Despite all that, British-Irish relations were never better.  The T&aacute;naiste has acknowledged that and we also found it to be the case.  I am delighted that at governmental level there will be annual summits to maintain the relationship.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly wants to improve things also and to maintain the strong relationships its members have.<\/p> <p>As Howard Hastings, a well-known and hard-nosed Northern businessman whom Senator Marshall will know well, said recently, Brexit is a monumental folly.  That is what it is but we have to deal with it because we have to respect the right of people to make that choice.  It is hard to see, however, how the withdrawal agreement will be ratified by the end of March, which is the timetable.  On the other hand, perhaps it is not so hard to see given that all that is left is 5% and the T&aacute;naiste, his officials and Michel Barnier's people are, presumably, working hard on this by the day.  As the T&aacute;naiste reminded us, Britain made commitments in writing on the backstop for the Border in December last and again in March.  It made a commitment that it would form part of the legal text of the withdrawal agreement.  We are delighted that the Government is holding fast to that.  A good deal is essential for both Ireland and Britain.  It is hard to countenance that Britain would opt for no deal.  In fact, it is unthinkable.  Why would it give up all of its existing European markets which include more than 500 million people?  How long would it take it under WTO rules to secure the bilateral deals about which they have been talking?  It does not bear thinking about.  It will be catastrophic for them, perhaps even more than for us.<\/p> <p>Regarding the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, if there is no deal and criminal gangs find weaknesses and gaps, they will play hell with us on the Border.  People are becoming slightly more conscious of this in Britain now and about what will happen between Dover and Calais and with the enforcement regimes involving the block on the French side.  We have to think about how 80% of our exports to continental Europe go through British ports.  I have no doubt the T&aacute;naiste is working on this and I hope the wordsmiths in Dublin, Brussels and London will come up with an 11th hour deal which is acceptable.  I do not mind if it includes a review mechanism as long as it does not interfere with the maintenance of the backstop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#ZZ00800","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House and I welcome the substance of what he has said.  It is important that he gets to say, other than in the context of a hostile interview or in an editable form, exactly what the situation is.  He has done so admirably.  I welcome in particular and agree completely with Senator Marshall's comments on the position of the Government.  It has not been unreasonable.  I was at the Garret FitzGerald memorial lecture last week at which Lord John Alderdice made a contribution.  He said two things, one of which I agreed with.  I agreed with his proposition that in the past a minority and elite in Brussels kept ploughing away on federalist rhetoric without working out what the effect would be in Britain.  However, he then came up with a second idea, which was that Ireland was perceived by many in Britain now, albeit he did not say he agreed with this, as following the proposition that Britain's adversity was Ireland's opportunity.  I was pleased that this is not a question of Ireland being opportunistic or taking advantage of a British embarrassment or an impasse in British politics.<\/p> <p>The Government's policy has been to mitigate the effects of the British decision to withdraw and to staunch what would otherwise be an open wound if these mitigating steps were not taken.  There is no sense in which we are exploiting the embarrassment or difficulty of others.  Most people in England should be conscious of the fact that the Irish people are well disposed towards them and regret their decision to go.  However, we are equally determined, if we can at all, to maintain the best relations with the UK and to have the UK's relationship with Europe remain as close as possible economically and politically in future.<\/p> <p>Today's newspapers will probably have impressed on the T&aacute;naiste that one of the problems we have faced here is that the media in Britain tend to exaggerate and operate on the basis of unwarranted leaked materials and briefings which are entirely insubstantial and which misrepresent other people's positions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I fully accept the T&aacute;naiste's comments that it is not a case of Ireland making last minute concessions.  Ireland's position has been very clear all along.  Nor is it the case that Ireland is being intransigent.  Ireland is simply saying that the backstop agreement, which was agreed to formally some time ago, is an absolute essential from our point of view.<br\/><br\/>I will add to this by recommending that Senators read<i>The Guardian <\/i>newspaper article by Jonathan Lis from Tuesday 6 November, which calls to book those politicians in England who have been misrepresenting Ireland's position and characterising it as exploitative and hostile.  The article shows very clearly that this is not the case.<br\/><br\/>In the final analysis - and this has been stated by Senator Leyden - the Border must remain open for every possible reason, invisible for every possible reason and, ultimately, the Good Friday Agreement must be maintained for every possible reason.  People say that Northern Ireland has to be treated identically to every other portion of the United Kingdom, but let us remember that the Good Friday Agreement provides that every person born in Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland is entitled to British or Irish citizenship, or both.  In that context, the people of Northern Ireland are entitled to European citizenship.  Northern Ireland is, by definition, a wholly exceptional part of the United Kingdom in that its citizens, whatever hue they come from, are entitled to avail of joint nationality and, by extension, European citizenship.<br\/><br\/>I commend the T&aacute;naiste on his steady, clear and unswerving commitment not to be intransigent but to insist on the bare minimum that would prevent Ireland from being very seriously and unnecessarily damaged by the Brexit decision made by the people of the United Kingdom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#ZZ00900","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I will begin by congratulating the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the Taoiseach on what I regard as probably one of the greatest achievements in cohesion of any Government.   The Ministers and the Taoiseach are all sending out the same message, as are their officials throughout Europe.  We have attended a number of meetings of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union and, as my colleague Senator Leyden stated, the message is always clear from Ireland.  I have not met anybody - from Bulgaria, to Georgia, to Brussels - who does not know the Irish position.  I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste and the Government on that.  It is a tremendous achievement.  Sadly, the British Government's position is far less clear and nobody is quite sure what way anybody is thinking.  I reject any criticism of the UK's decision to withdraw from the European Union.  That was their choice and they have made it.  They are leaving a market and they made the decision knowing exactly what they were going to do.  They must live with that.<\/p> <p>That brings me to the issue of the Border.  I have spoken to a number of people in industry and I have also spoken to politicians across Europe.  Nobody I have met is convinced that a solution can be found in respect of the Border.  I have not met anybody who believes that.  This is notwithstanding the fact that all politicians in the UK, in Northern Ireland and in Ireland are saying that the Border will remain open.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will not be able to answer now but I would like to know if we have war-gamed the possibility of having to close the Border.  Have we examined what would be required to close the Border if we have to do so, particularly in view of the fact that we are part of the European Union and that, from March next year, Britain will become a third country?<\/p> <p>The Good Friday Agreement brings with it certain responsibilities for Ireland, the UK and Northern Ireland.  While the British courts and the courts in Northern Ireland have been unwilling or unable to look at Brexit and the possibilities for a court-based solution in respect of it, we have a situation in the North of Ireland where every citizen has a right to an Irish passport.  Have we explored the possibility of using the courts to examine the referendum that took place in Northern Ireland?  I refer to the referendum as it happened in Northern Ireland not to the referendum in Britain, Scotland or Wales.  It might be worth considering doing this in a doomsday situation in order to look at how we protect the citizens of Ireland who are in Northern Ireland and who are also EU citizens.<\/p> <p>The issue of the land-bridge is a matter of serious concern to many exporters in Ireland.  A number of exporters are looking at the possibility of a sea route into the heart of Europe, especially to the Hook of Holland or to one of the German ports.  Is the Government prepared to examine this matter?  When we met Michel Barnier, he certainly said that there would be EU money available to develop deep-sea ports in Ireland in order that we could have a direct route into Europe.  I would be interested in knowing if the Government at least would support the exploration of those ideas.<\/p> <p>I attended one of the T&aacute;naiste's Brexit roadshows.  I will not say which one because I do not want to expose any specific geographical area.  It was a wonderful event.  Every agency in the State that is required to support companies in a Brexit situation was represented.  The heartbreak for me was when the facilitator at one of the sessions asked for a show of hands in respect of which companies had appointed someone with responsibility for Brexit-related issues.  Out of the entire room, only two companies had done so.  With all the work the T&aacute;naiste, the Department and the various agencies have put in, that was a very damning indictment of the business world.  Is the T&aacute;naiste finding the position to be the same everywhere he goes within the State?<\/p> <p>Once again, I thank the T&aacute;naiste and his officials for coming to the House and for the job they are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#AAA00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and I thank him and his officials for all the work they have done in the past few years.  It has been a very difficult time.  I compliment the Government, the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, the T&aacute;naiste and our spokesman in the Seanad, Senator Richmond.  Over time, it has been a very difficult few years but the Government's message has been clear, concise and fair.  All the Opposition parties have rallied together; not in wearing the green jersey but in understanding that this is a seminal moment in Irish politics.  It is a seminal moment for the island of Ireland.  The Taoiseach has said that there cannot be an expiry date or a unilateral exit clause in the backstop or it would not be worth the paper it was written on.  Ireland and the EU's position on the backstop remains clear and we cannot allow uncertainty about the Border and its impact on the peace process to persist beyond the UK's withdrawal from the EU.  Such uncertainty is causing grave concern in communities in the North and the South.  While our preference is for solutions to be found as part of the overall EU-UK relationship, it remains essential that a backdrop is agreed that provides certainty that a hard border will be avoided in any circumstances.  We have been clear on this matter.  How many times have people put the question and been told that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland?  Sometimes people do not listen.<\/p> <p>When Brexit happened, we were asked by British politicians, who are our good friends, what we thought of it.

We have to protect ourselves while appreciating that a good deal for the UK is a good deal for Ireland and Europe.<\/p><p>We should remember that next Sunday, we will commemorate the centenary of the end of the First World War.  We had our own Irish exit - or Brexit, for want of a better word - at the 1918 general election when the Sinn F&eacute;in party of the time won 46% of the vote.  Just as Brexit came about because of immigration, conscription was probably the main issue that got most of the Sinn F&eacute;in seats over the line in 1918.  The effect of this was the creation of a 26-county Republic.  It is felt that the conscription crisis was a crucial turning point in Irish history.  We often talk about the 1916 Rising and the shooting of the leaders of the 1916 Rising, but the effect of the issue of conscription can never be underestimated.  Although a conscription law was passed by the British Parliament, it was not enacted.  At the seminal moment of the 1918 election, however, the effect of the conscription issue was to ensure the Sinn F&eacute;in party of the time got its seats over the line.<\/p><p>We must ensure east-west relations remain close.  Senator Marshall has rightly referred to recent polls in the UK.  I hope they mark a realisation that leaving the EU could be bad.  It is unfair that the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach are seen as changing the pattern.  Nothing has changed.  It is exactly the same as it was when Deputy Enda Kenny was Taoiseach and Deputy Flanagan was Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We are united across all parties in this House to ensure there cannot and will not be a border on the island of Ireland.  In the words of Eamonn McCann, if there is a border on the island of Ireland, the people will tear it down with their bare hands.  We cannot say that forcefully enough.  We are not being anti-British when we state the facts as reported by a politician who is listening on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#AAA00300","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&iacute;or-f&aacute;ilte roimh an T&aacute;naiste.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for being here this evening, for making himself available to the Seanad so regularly and for his address to the House this evening.  Senator Feighan referred to the suggestion we have heard from Senators McDowell and Marshall that the world we live in today is volatile and deeply divided.  We are at a crossing point.  The mid-term elections that are happening in the US today can be said to equate to a referendum.  Tomorrow morning, there will be some certainty about the composition of the House of Representatives and the Senate.  We do not have such certainty in the case of Brexit.  That is not the fault of the Irish Government.  Brexit does not being clarity or certainty.  I heard what the T&aacute;naiste said about the imagination displayed by Michel Barnier.  I do not know about Mr. Barnier's imagination, but I certainly admire his steel, his toughness and his willingness to come up with different formulae.<\/p> <p>It is important to recognise that in his work as a Minister and as a constitutional republican, as well as in his visits to the North, his comments and his willingness to work with all sides of the divide, the T&aacute;naiste has provided a practical demonstration that Ireland's future relationship with the UK is important, as are the future relationships between all traditions on this island in the North and the South.  This is exemplified in this Chamber by Senator Marshall, by the T&aacute;naiste's remarks and by the T&aacute;naiste's actual work.  We must continue to build bridges.  There must be seamless interaction.  To be fair to the T&aacute;naiste, he has always said that Brexit will be a net negative because there is no good outcome from Brexit.  It will change our landscape for a generation or more.<\/p> <p>Notwithstanding the difficulties we have to encounter, we must recognise what has been achieved to date.  This House should join others in commending the officials in the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and of the Taoiseach on their work on Brexit and their efforts to build alliances across the EU.  We should unreservedly acknowledge and commend the stewardship of the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the iar-Thaoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny.  The work of our colleague and friend, Senator Richmond, in chairing the Brexit committee, in building relationships and in challenging untruths across many forums should also be mentioned.  To be honest, the Government's work has always been about protecting the interests of the island of Ireland, North and South, and the interests of all of our people.  It has been a reasonable and pragmatic position.<\/p> <p>As a constituency colleague and political competitor - not rival - of the T&aacute;naiste, I am very proud of the role he has played in wearing the green jersey and flying the flag of Europe.  Ireland is a central part of the EU.  The T&aacute;naiste can take great pride in the debate he has led, in the manner of his communication and in the way he has built alliances.  It is very important.  I am very proud.  I want to pay tribute to him for the work he has done.  He has been calm, diligent and honest.  He has shown leadership.  Senator Marshall used the word \"disruptor\" in his remarks.  The T&aacute;naiste is not a disruptor.  He is a leader.  He is about bringing people together.  That can be seen in the cavalry of support we have received.  I do not mean to be partisan when I refer to what I have heard from people in this Chamber and the other Chamber and say that this is far too important a matter to bring partisanship into it.<\/p> <p>This House will be addressed by the Lord Mayor of Belfast on Thursday.  It is a gargantuan move for this House and for the Oireachtas.  It would not have happened 20 years ago, but it is happening on Thursday.  That is what this Government has been about.  It has been about building bridges and bringing people with us.  We are at a very critical point in the EU and in the world as a whole.  I think we need to support our Government.  The T&aacute;naiste was right when he said in his opening remarks that this \"is not solely about economics\" but \"is also about people's lives and protecting the gains and benefits of the peace process\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#BBB00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I am delighted to welcome the T&aacute;naiste and his officials to the House once again.  I join everyone who has spoken in this evening's debate in rightly commending the T&aacute;naiste and the team in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on their sterling efforts over a difficult number of years.  I believe the first Brexit preparedness meeting in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade took place in December 2014, which was long before the referendum took place.  It is quite reasonable to say that the Irish Government was prepared for the fallout from Brexit long before the British Government was.  I think that is starting to come true.<\/p><p>It is right to acknowledge that we are at a very delicate stage in the negotiations.  Given that all of this was due to be solved at the European Council meeting in October, it can be said, without leaning too heavily on a sporting analogy, that we are in the championship minutes or in injury time.<\/p><p>I would like to pick up on a point that was eloquently made by Senator McDowell.  The atmosphere at the moment is very difficult.  We need to be careful about what we read, tweet and retweet.  Most importantly, we must remember that words matter, as our President has said in the context of other issues.  The briefing and the spin in the British media in recent weeks has been quite spectacular.  A report in the London edition of <i>The Times<\/i>cited a French diplomat who had apparently said that France was prepared to alter the backstop.  That afternoon, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the French ambassador absolutely reaffirmed France's solidarity with the Irish position.  Approximately a week later, the <i>Financial Times<\/i>reported that a German diplomat had said the German position was that the backstop needed to be surrendered.  Chancellor Angela Merkel came out within hours to clarify that European and German solidarity with Ireland's position is absolutely whole.  In the past week, such reporting has spread further into <i>The Daily Telegraph<\/i>and - I would argue - some of our own publications.  It is quite spectacular that the same story can be reported completely differently in the two leading newspapers of this State on the same morning.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Neale Richmond:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is very worrying because that spills out into political rhetoric.

That is what we must look at.  A deal is possible and I very much hope one is imminent.  However, we cannot risk the spectre of a no deal scenario despite what some politicians in other jurisdictions want to say, which is likely to be what might further their domestic aims.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste and his officials on their work.  I look forward to travelling to Helsinki in the morning to attend the EPP congress, which is the largest collection of European politicians across the continent, where they will once again reaffirm all remaining EU member states' commitment to and solidarity with the Irish position as well as the solidarity of the many parties from non-EU countries in the EPP political family.

I am glad to have the opportunity to speak without reading to try to address some of the issues that have been raised.<\/p> <p>It is worth saying that the Irish position on the choice of our closest neighbour is one of regret and also a recognition of what I have often described as a \"lose, lose, lose\" situation.  In time, this decision will be seen to have damaged the UK's standing in the world and may well have damaged the British economy, although the UK is big enough and strong enough to survive it.<\/p> <p>It is also a \"lose, lose\" situation for the EU.  The Single Market and the European economy will undoubtedly be weaker as a result of Brexit.  The political influence of the EU globally will be weaker as a result of Brexit.  The loss of our ally on many core issues we defended where we won the argument in EU debates will change the political dynamic in a way that is not good for Ireland.  We are working hard to recognise the new political realities and the need for new alliances on key issues such as taxation, competition, fighting against protectionism and ensuring the EU continues to have a globalised view of the world and our place in it.  From an Irish, British and EU perspective, Brexit is not good news.<\/p> <p>This process is about protecting Ireland, North and South, trying to ensure we limit damage where it is a threat and trying to ensure we sustain and maintain relationships that have been built up between the UK and Ireland, particularly over the past 20 years, in a way that allows us to try to find a way through this really challenging negotiations with those relationships intact.  This is why when I hear knee-jerk commentary that because there is a new issue under discussion, it is automatically viewed as a concession, weakness or weakening of our position, I find it frustrating because it is nothing of the sort.  This is not meant to sound in any way patronising.  It is just a fact.  One of the reasons we regularly hold stakeholder group meetings on Brexit, one of the reasons I regularly brief all of the Opposition parties and tell them things that arguably I should not tell them in the context of delicate and, in some cases, confidential negotiations and one of the reasons I have trusted Opposition spokespeople to respect the confidentiality of those briefings, which, by and large, have been respected, is because this is not a party political issue.  It is far more fundamental than that.  Whoever is in government in six months' time or six years' time will be dealing with the consequences of how these negotiations turn out.  <\/p> <p>I will go through the sequencing of how we got to where we are without speaking for too long about it.  It is important to understand that and the context in which we can get a deal.  This time last year, Members might remember that these negotiations were broken up into two different pillars.  The first was to try to get a withdrawal agreement agreed while the second was to negotiate a future relationship.  A lot of pressure was being built up this time last year to allow the negotiations to move on to stage 2 before stage 1 was fully concluded.  Everybody recognised that we were not going to get a full text of a withdrawal agreement agreed before we could start talking about a future relationship so there was a need for progress on the first to be able to start the conversation on the second.<\/p> <p>EU countries, along with the UK, were very anxious to move on to opening negotiations on the future relationship, including the future trade and security relationships.  We said that Ireland was okay with that but on the condition that we got some guarantees on core issues of vulnerability and sensitivity for Ireland.  Those core issues are the three Irish issues in the withdrawal treaty.  The first is the common travel area on which we have made very significant progress on a bilateral basis.  It is almost a mutual recognition of citizenship - not quite but not far off it - as well as facilitating the freedom to travel, work, study and be treated effectively as a local citizen in the context of accessing services and education.  That is largely done.<\/p> <p>The second issue is the Good Friday Agreement.  We expected, wanted and demanded that we would get very clear agreed language about protecting the Good Friday Agreement in full.  The third issue about which we wanted clear commitments and language from the UK side was the Border.  Unionists often tell me that it would be helpful to recognise there is a political border on the island of Ireland but that nobody wants it to be a physical barrier anymore, which is true.  We said that before we could support the process moving on to stage 2, we needed a very comprehensive political statement or declaration that would be a commitment between the EU and the UK on these core issues.  <\/p> <p>That is where the December agreement came from.  It was hard won.  It was a difficult negotiation in the build up to that because we were very demanding and I do not mind saying that because that point in the negotiations was a crucial period for us to calm nerves, particularly in Northern Ireland.  There were communities there that felt vulnerable because of Brexit and still do.  That is where this backstop concept emerged.<\/p> <p>In the context of the solutions about which we are talking, it is important to understand what that is.  The backstop emerged from both sides agreeing that we want to solve the Irish Border question to make sure there is no physical border infrastructure or any related checks or controls in the future.  We want to solve that through a comprehensive future relationship agreement.  That is preference 1.  We then said that if it is not possible to do that, preference 2 is for the UK to effectively offer bespoke solutions recognising the unique situation on the island of Ireland in order to solve that border question.  At the time, people assumed that would be proposals around technology.  We were very sceptical about that but it was not unreasonable to say that we would look at proposals if they were put forward.  However, if we could not get agreement on those bespoke solutions, the default position, or backstop, was very clear.  It was that the UK committed to maintaining full alignment with the rules of the customs union and Single Market in the areas necessary to protect North-South co-operation, an all-island economy and the peace process.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The language was clear.  The backstop was not some concept that was not described.  It was a fallback position, an insurance mechanism, or a floor below which we could not allow this issue to fall and how it would work was itemised.<br\/><br\/>In March, which was arguably an even more important agreement that did not get much recognition at the time, that order was reversed.  What was agreed in December was that we would try to get a future relationship that would solve the Border question, as well as a whole load of other things, but if it was not possible, option two was a bespoke solution and, if there was not agreement on that, the backstop would kick in.  The reverse then happened in March.  We said what was needed was to settle people's nerves about the Border question.  The British Prime Minister, to her credit, understanding the political sensitivities in Northern Ireland and people's concerns and fears, agreed that there would be a legally operable text on the backstop, consistent with paragraph 49 of the December agreement, which I quoted a minute ago, and it would be in the withdrawal treaty unless and until some other solution was found.  In other words, we are putting the insurance mechanism in first, upfront, and then we negotiate a better solution if we can.  People say the backstop has to be temporary and short-lived and is a stop-gap to fill a short period of time between the end of a transition period and the agreement on a future relationship.  That may be a use for a backstop but it certainly cannot be the limit of its use, that is for sure.  The backstop may be temporary but it cannot be designed in a way that requires it to be temporary because then it would not be a backstop at all.  That is the truth.<br\/><br\/>The context in which we are now talking about a review is that we have never had a problem with reviewing a backstop.  It is back to option two that was agreed in December whereby, if a backstop is required, in other words, if the future relationship cannot solve the Border question when it is agreed and a backstop kicks in, it is perfectly reasonable that, in time, we would review how it is working and if there are alternative proposals that could do the job more effectively that people would then consider those.<br\/><br\/>That is not a concession.  That is simply working with friends and a neighbour who is also trying to find a solution and trying to find a language that everybody can live with that is consistent with the commitments of December and March.  The one thing we cannot allow in that context is that, at the end of any review period, the United Kingdom would unilaterally be able to pull out of the backstop because then it would not be a backstop at all.<br\/><br\/>We are saying that the unless and until issue is what determines the timeline for the backstop.  I hope the backstop will never be used because I hope, during the transition period, we will be able to negotiate a future relationship that is comprehensive enough to ensure that border infrastructure between the United Kingdom and the EU is not required.  That will deal with the issue on the island of Ireland and it will also deal with the issue east-west which is a &euro;70 billion trade relationship where 38,000 Irish companies trade with the UK every month and 7,500 companies trade across the Border all the time.  That is what we would like to see.  Britain has decided at Government level, and I do not believe the people made this decision, not only to leave the European Union but also to leave the customs union and Single Market.  That decision creates the real challenge in the context of the Border.<br\/><br\/>In the context of the decisions and commitments made in December and the commitments made in March, we need to find a legal wording that is watertight and that will stand up to legal scrutiny and challenge because undoubtedly this withdrawal treaty will be challenged in a court somewhere.  We need to find a wording that is consistent with the political commitments that have been made.  I have to say, and it is not said very often in this Chamber or the other one, that Prime Minister May deserves credit for her commitments to Ireland and her repeated insistence that the commitments she made in December and March need to be part of the withdrawal treaty.  She has had to face down a number of prominent politicians in the United Kingdom who have looked to essentially do away with the commitments they made as part of the British Government at the time.  I think the Prime Minister and her Cabinet recognise that the commitments they have made need to be followed through on as part of the legal text of the withdrawal treaty and I believe it can be done soon.<br\/><br\/>We will work with Britain and in particular with Michel Barnier, who has done an astonishingly good job in understanding the complexity of the Irish issues, concerns and vulnerabilities and trying to factor those into the negotiations.  If ever there was proof of the benefit of EU membership to Ireland in protecting our core interests, the last 12 months is the proof of that.  We have unanimous solidarity and support across the other 26 countries which have their own vested interests and concerns around Brexit but continue to support Ireland.  This is the core issue, the last remaining outstanding issue preventing agreement on a final draft of the withdrawal treaty which we are running out of time to agree.  There is a good chance this can be agreed this month but we need to continue to work to support the negotiating teams who are negotiating as we speak in Brussels to try to find a way to ensure the backstop that has been committed to is followed through on but that there are review mechanisms built into that to ensure an onus on all of us who have been involved in this process, and will be involved in the future, to ensure the backstop and its use is permanent, if necessary, but also is constantly tested to ensure there are not other mechanisms that we could agree that could equally do the job.  That needs to be factored into the future discussion.<br\/><br\/>I have spent much time in Northern Ireland over the past year.  There are genuine fears in Northern Ireland.  Nationalists and republicans are understandably sceptical.  Memories of the Border are painful and difficult for many people and families and when one speaks to people in the Border areas, they get emotional quickly about this issue.  This goes way beyond trade and economics.  It is something that is at the core of this Irish question and Ireland's relationship with the United Kingdom and Britain, its history and complexity and, at times, its tragedy.  Some people in England, in particular, do not understand or grasp the complexity and depth of that feeling.  That is not their fault <i>per se<\/i>, it is just the reality.<br\/><br\/>Unionists feel equally fearful, from those I have spoken to, that the solutions we are exploring and the commitments we have got threaten their union.  That is why the outcome needs to be one that everybody can live with, that follows through on the commitments in preventing border infrastructure or related checks or controls, but does not and is not seen as undermining the integrity of the United Kingdom as a whole either.  The Good Friday Agreement deals with the constitutional issues on this island and Brexit should not interfere with that in any way.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Senators for their support, in particular Senator Richmond who has been a pillar of strength for our team in media messaging and ensuring the Irish position remains strong, consistent and firm, but also respectful.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I hope the political parties in this House can continue to work together until we get this job done.  Do not forget that the withdrawal treaty and agreement, if one wants to call it that, is just part 1 of this negotiation.  We are at the business end of trying to finalise part 1.  If we can get it agreed then we create some certainly that a transition period is going to take place, that citizens' rights issues are settled, that the financial settlement that Britain has to make between now and the end of 2020 with the EU is settled and that the core Irish issues that we insisted last December were addressed as comprehensively as they could be are followed through on to the maximum extent possible.  If we can get agreement on that, which is the withdrawal treaty dealing with those four key areas, we will have done a good job in mitigating the potential damage and challenges that Brexit brings.  Then we move on to stage 2 which is to get on with the negotiations on the detail of the future relationship which will take at least two years to deliver, and perhaps longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110600002#CCC00300","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541514600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.
