I seem to remember that the Department of Education and Skills invested in a scheme to achieve two aims, namely, to re-employ people in the construction sector who had fallen foul of the crash and to move children out of prefabricated buildings and ensure that as many as possible of the country's classrooms were permanent structures.  Every child deserves to be in a permanent classroom.  I am sure the Minister agrees with that.  We do not want to see 20-year-old prefabs in any national school in the country.  Can we work together to ensure that the children of Burrow national school have permanent classrooms and that these prefabricated buildings are done away with, so those children and the school's future pupils can look forward to a better future?  It is a fantastic school that is doing a huge amount, but the children deserve more than the 20-year-old prefabricated structures in which they are learning.

I thank the Senator for raising the matter, as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position with respect to Burrow national school, Sutton, Dublin 13.  Burrow national school is a co-educational school under Church of Ireland patronage.  The current staff of the school consists of the principal, nine mainstream posts, two special educational needs posts and one shared special educational needs post.  There are currently 226 pupils enrolled in the school.  The Department has no record of an application from Burrow national school seeking funding to replace prefabs.  I know the Senator is also making reference to additional accommodation.  As he is aware, under the national development plan's framework for the period from 2018 to 2027, my Department has an envelope of &euro;11.9 billion for education infrastructure over the coming decade.  This represents a 70% increase in schools capital funding compared to the last decade, rising from &euro;4.9 billion to &euro;8.4 billion.  Investment will rise to &euro;1 billion in 2027 compared to &euro;540 million of investment in 2018.  The budget for delivery of projects under the school building programme increased from &euro;540 million in 2018 to &euro;622 million in 2019.  Under project Ireland 2040 we have continued to make progress to increase our infrastructural capacity in order to meet demographic and other<\/p><p>demands.<\/p><p>Construction activity in 2018 and 2019 will involve more than 130 large-scale projects, around 38% of the 340 projects on the list, and around 280 smaller-scale projects under the additional accommodation scheme.  These projects will deliver more than 40,000 school places, including additional and replacement places; the replacement of more than 600 prefabs, which is a key element of our prefab replacement programme; enhanced sports facilities through the construction or modernisation of 48 PE halls at post-primary level; and 82 general purpose rooms at primary level.  The enhancement and modernisation of PE facilities in schools will also facilitate community usage of these facilities.  Construction will also include more than 200 modern science laboratories, which will support the delivery of the reformed science curricula and the roll-out of computer science as a leaving certificate subject.  In addition, in April of 2018 my Department announced that 42 new schools would be established in areas of population growth between 2019 and 2022.  The focus in 2019 is on start-up interim accommodation for the 17 schools opening in September 2019.<\/p><p>I wish to advise the Senator that since mid-2018 all schools approved for additional accommodation under my Department's additional accommodation scheme are also having all necessary prefabs replaced as part of their additional accommodation project.  Therefore, it is open to Burrow national school to submit an application under my Department&rsquo;s additional school accommodation scheme to address any immediate deficits of accommodation it may have, including the replacement of prefab accommodation.  The application form is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.education.ie.<\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i>I would once again like to thank the Senator for giving me an opportunity to outline the position to the House and I wish to assure him that should Burrow national school make an application under the additional school accommodation scheme, it will be considered and the decision relayed to the school authority directly.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe McHugh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I wish to assure him that should Burrow national school make an application under the additional school accommodation scheme it will be considered and the decision relayed to the school authority directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019032600002#C00200","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553610600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his positive reply.

I have raised this issue previously in the Seanad and with the Department.  It relates to pharmaceutical assistants.  The pharmaceutical association made a recommendation to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, recently that pharmaceutical assistants, most of whom have operated and worked in pharmacies for the past 35 years, should only be allowed to cover up to one hour per day in place of the pharmacist.  That is fine but those people have been doing that job for 35 years during which time they were able to provide cover if the pharmacist was ill or on holidays.  They brought a great deal of life experience to their work in pharmacies for the past 35 years but the association is trying to tell them now that their qualification does not mean anything.  Those people went to college for four years.  They did the practical side to the work.  It was like an apprenticeship in that they learned about the different medicines.  A number of them have taken part in upskilling and training to which pharmacists and their assistants are entitled.  Continuing education is the best way to describe that.<\/p> <p>I have had contact from a number of pharmaceutical assistants across the country who are very concerned that they will be seen now as unemployable because they will be only be able to cover in the pharmacy for up to one hour and, if these regulations go through, they will only be able to dispense repeat prescriptions and not any new prescriptions.  That means if a customer comes into the pharmacy with a new prescription when the pharmacist is not present, the pharmaceutical assistant will have to tell that person to come back in an hour when the pharmacist is back or else send the person to another pharmacy down the road.  That is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>I received a number of emails from people on the issue.  The pharmaceutical assistants have taken this very seriously and have made their own submission on it.  In terms of some of the things they are looking for, they say the following: it should be compulsory that all pharmaceutical assistants take part in the further education and training which is open to them; pharmaceutical assistants should be included in a core competency framework, similar to that which applies to pharmacists; all pharmaceutical assistants on the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, register should be required to undergo a practice to review with the Irish Institute of Pharmacy; the PSI rules 2015 should be amended to extend mandatory continuing professional development, CPD, to which I referred already, to pharmaceutical assistants; and the Pharmacy Act 2007 should be amended to make fitness to practise applicable to all pharmaceutical assistants.<\/p> <p>The pharmaceutical assistants are taking this matter seriously and have submitted their own options but they are concerned that if the regulations being suggested by the pharmaceutical association were brought into play by the Minister, their jobs would become obsolete.  Why did they spend four years going to college and the past 35 years working in pharmacies if they are now to become unemployable?  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019032600002#D00400","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1553610600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to speak on this issue because it is important that we acknowledge the work of pharmaceutical assistants and what they have done for many years.<\/p> <p>The Pharmacy Act 2007 established the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI.  The functions of the society are set out in the Act and are carried out on its behalf by the council of the society.  The council is made up of 21 members, comprising lay members and pharmacists, with a non-pharmacist majority of one.  Pharmaceutical assistant is a grade of pharmacy professional permitted under the Pharmacy Act 2007 to act on behalf of registered pharmacists during the temporary absence of the latter.  For many decades, pharmaceutical assistants have played a valuable role in the community pharmacy through the provision of skilled assistance to registered pharmacists.  I acknowledge that role.<\/p> <p>Section 26 of the Pharmacy Act 2007 requires that a registered pharmacist be present always in a registered pharmacy when a member of the public attends, whether to have medicines dispensed or to receive advice regarding medicines or other health matters.  Public assurance that safe and appropriate pharmaceutical care is always available in a registered pharmacy is based on this patient safety requirement.  Section 30 of the Act provides for an exception to the general provision in the Act, which requires the sale and supply of medicines at a pharmacy to be conducted under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist and specifies that no offence is committed where a registered pharmaceutical assistant acts on behalf of a registered pharmacist during the temporary absence of the latter.  Section 30 permits the council to make rules as to what may be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist and what constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist.<\/p> <p>Following a period of public consultation, the council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacists from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting on 20 September 2018.  The council approved the draft rules without amendment.  Following this, the PSI undertook to redraft the rules on what may or may not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of the registered pharmacists.  On 6 December, the council of the PSI approved a revised draft of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacists from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 for issuance for public consultation.  This public consultation commenced on 13 December 2018 and ran until 11 January 2019, affording any interested party the opportunity to make representations on the matter directly to the PSI.  At its meeting on 14 February 2019, the council of the PSI approved the draft rules subject to certain amendments made on foot of the council's consideration of the results of the latest public consultation.  On 8 March 2019, the PSI submitted the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacists from Pharmacy) Rules 2019 to the Minister for Health for his consent in accordance with the requirements of the Pharmacy Act 2007.  I will inform the Minister of the issues raised by the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019032600002#E00100","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1553610600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

When pharmaceutical assistants were surveyed, it was discovered that they will be working for only eight to ten more years because it is 35 years since one could become qualified.  The course has not been run since the 1980s.  Therefore, the last pharmaceutical assistant will have retired in ten years.  The youngest are in their mid-50s.  It is not the case that the grade is relatively new.  The pharmaceutical assistants have been working for over 35 years.

There is an attitude that there is no reason to pay a pharmaceutical assistant when, in the temporary absence of the pharmacist, the pharmacy could bring in another pharmacist.

Our thoughts are with those families as well.<\/p> <p>I would like to raise the issue of the ESRI report regarding the impact of Brexit with a deal and that of a no-deal Brexit.  We learn that there will be a cost to us of between &euro;1.8 billion and &euro;7.5 billion whatever the outcome.  Over ten years this will increase to between &euro;8 billion and &euro;15 billion.

The plans for the metro were released today.  Metro north is welcome, but we understand that the green line will be stopping at Charlemont.  I would have thought that Government would be more ambitious.  I was disheartened to hear an Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, automatically disregard the idea of a south-west line towards Terenure and Rathfarnham on the basis of population density.  It was encouraging that he said there is a possibility that the line could go as far as UCD.  Those living in the Terenure and Rathfarnham area will be aware of the traffic chaos.  There is a serious lack of public transport in the area, which really needs to be addressed urgently.  I cannot see any reason consideration for a south-western Luas should be disregarded from the outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019032600002#O00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1553610600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I would also like to raise the matter just mentioned by Senator Ardagh, that of the decision made today in respect of the MetroLink project.

The second thing, as Senator Ardagh said, is that the inevitable implication of bringing it to Charlemont will be that another Luas-type service will not be provided to serve areas of south Dublin like Terenure, Lucan, St. Vincent's Hospital, UCD and Stillorgan.  This plan is being proceeded with on a kind of autopilot basis.  We are not dealing with a postponement of the foolish plan to absorb the green line into the metro system.  We are dealing with a carefully worked out scheme.  All the preparatory work for it will be done.  I suggest that as soon as local elections and things like that are out of the way, there will be a rethink and it will be decided that it will go ahead and this money will be spent in this foolish way.  I remind the House that this whole project was never considered in advance by an Oireachtas committee.  Approximately &euro;170 million was spent on its planning.  I do not know how much money was spent on the southern spur, which is now to be abandoned or shelved, but it must have been a significant amount of money.<\/p><p>This is an example of how planning in this country goes completely wrong.  I live right beside the Luas.  I have property there.  I know that the people who live alongside it do not want it to be absorbed into a metro system.  It has been suggested that future traffic requirements will make it essential for it to be incorporated into a metro system.  All I will say is that I arranged to get information from the NTA on the current capacity of the Luas system.  At the moment, Luas carriages are packed to the gills at rush hour.  It transpires that a great number of additional 55 m tram sets, which would have the capacity to increase numbers travelling on the Luas in the short run, are on order.  If the other project had been proceeded with, God only knows what would have happened to the additional tram sets that have been ordered.  The point I am making with regard to decisions which are being made about Dublin applies to BusConnects, for example.  Rathmines Road is to be made a one-way route, in effect.  No consideration has been given to the implications of these decisions for traffic in Dublin.  Decisions are being made by a group of people who are not accountable to the Irish people.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, said he rejects this part of the proposal and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has said he rejects that part of the proposal.  Who is in charge of this country?  Who is spending this &euro;4 billion?  Who accepts responsibility for all this?  A group of people who are not elected by anybody comes up with these plans before collapsing or altering them.

It is all right - my mother is from Kerry.<\/p> <p>I wish to commend the organisers of the conference on valproate and its legacy which was held in Trinity College Dublin last Friday and which I attended.  In particular, I commend the Organisation for Anti-Convulsant Syndrome, OACS, Ireland, its chairperson, Ms Karen Keely, and Epilepsy Ireland for the work they put into the conference.  I thank all of the international speakers who had an input into the conference.  In stark contrast, there were no Government speakers in attendance, which is absolutely atrocious when one considers the seriousness of this issue which affects at least 1,200 people.  Children and young people have been left with disabilities because their mothers were prescribed valproate while pregnant.  I repeat my request for the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to come to the House for a full discussion of the issue of sodium valproate and the need for a proper, judge-led public inquiry into who knew what about this issue and when they knew it.<\/p> <p>I also wish to raise the issue of the looming prospect of carbon taxes.  The Taoiseach all but confirmed the Government's plans to pass on huge costs to working families rather than target the major polluting corporations.  Carbon taxes currently add approximately &euro;2 to the cost of a bag of coal, 50 cent to a bale of briquettes and 5 cent to a litre of diesel.  Fine Gael, backed by Fianna F&aacute;il, plans to massively increase carbon taxes over the next few years, which will lead to ordinary families paying an extra &euro;1,000 a year.  Under the plans, the carbon tax will add &euro;10.50 to the cost of a bag of coal, &euro;2.25 to a bale of briquettes and 26.5 cent to a litre of diesel.<\/p> <p>My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, tabled a parliamentary question on this issue.  The reply to that question, which he received yesterday, confirmed that VAT will apply to any increase in the cost of fuel caused by the carbon tax.  There will be a tax on a tax.  This sums up the priorities of Fine Gael.  Instead of taxing those who pollute and are responsible for Ireland missing its climate change targets, it would rather punish the ordinary people.  It will tax ordinary folk twice rather than dare to tax big corporations once.  At the Fine Gael conference at the weekend, the Taoiseach provided no clarity on whether it will be the major polluters or struggling families who will foot the bill.  I call for a debate on the carbon tax proposals such that hard-working individuals and families who are already hammered by massive insurance premiums and sky-high rents can learn if they will once again take the hit because Fine Gael certainly will not hit the big corporations.<\/p> <p>The carbon tax plans will particularly affect rural Ireland, where much of the housing stock is not insulated and public transport systems are not in place to provide an alternative to buying diesel.  This is another issue that will significantly affect ordinary people.  Many such people will also be affected by their mortgages being sold off to vulture funds.  They cannot understand how a vulture fund can buy a property for &euro;100,000, sell it on for &euro;300,000 and pay no tax on that, whereas if they were to do so they would have to pay a third of the profits in tax.  It is not right.  The way the Government is treating ordinary people in this country is not right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019032600002#Q00300","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1553610600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I wish to begin by thanking the Cathaoirleach, the Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il, the Oireachtas HR section and others for taking up a key recommendation of the Oireachtas Women's Parliamentary Caucus and commissioning a confidential dignity and respect in the parliamentary workplace survey of all staff and Members in these Houses.  This very important survey went live yesterday.

The results of a similar survey carried out in Westminster made for grim reading.  The survey found that one in five people working in Westminster had experienced or witnessed sexual harassment or inappropriate behaviour in the past year - that was in 2017.  A Unite official described a toxic and dysfunctional relationship between some British MPs, peers and staff.  Almost 20% of employees reported being bullied by their bosses, 58% suffered from stress, 36% reported having anxiety and 17% reported suffering from depression.  Those findings are stark and I sincerely hope we do not make similar findings here.  It is important that all Members of the Houses engage with the survey so that we surface what is actually going on, warts and all.  The survey sends an important message of zero tolerance of bullying and harassment in any form in these Houses and of the need for dignity and respect in how we work together in these Houses.  I urge all Senators to encourage their staff to complete the survey and to complete the survey themselves, as I intend to do later today.  I call on the powers that be who brought us this survey to commit to the full findings being published.  Moreover, I call on the Leader to commit to a debate in the House on the aggregated and anonymised results of the survey findings once it is complete so that the survey is not buried if the results are not to our liking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019032600002#Q00400","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553610600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I join others in expressing sincere sympathies and condolences to the people of New Zealand following the tragic and horrific attacks on the mosques in Christchurch on 15 March.

She was found by a passer-by and had been there for less than 24 hours.  The local community named the child baby Belle.  Despite numerous appeals for baby Belle's mother to come forward to receive the care and attention she needed, she did not come forward.  We in north County Dublin took baby Belle into our hearts.  We held a vigil for her and her mother to show love and compassion for both of them.  The appeals for her mother to come forward continued, but unfortunately she did not do so.  There was a huge outpouring of support and grief for the loss of baby Belle from our community.  We were assured that once the coroner had done the appropriate investigations, baby Belle's body would be released to the local garda&iacute; and the community.  Fingal County Council undertook to provide a dignified and respectful burial for her to allow the community to embrace her.  It was hoped that baby Belle's mother would come forward when she got over her grief and the grave would be a place for her to visit and heal.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, however, we found out via the media a couple of weeks ago that baby Belle had been buried at the angels' plot in Glasnevin Cemetery with no one but the gravedigger and an undertaker present.  No funeral service took place and nobody from Balbriggan was present.  We were not informed.  That is where baby Belle now rests.  Needless to say, this decision caused distress in Balbriggan and across north County Dublin because baby Belle and the situation her mother faced had an impact on all of us.  They were both part of our community.  We are deeply upset and we are grappling for answers as to why this happened.  How did the coroner allow this to happen when it was made clear that Fingal County Council and a charitable foundation would provide for the funeral service, allowing the community to be involved and creating a space for baby Belle's mother to visit, in time, when she wanted to?

There is no preparatory work relating to it.  Someone just spun out of the air that we will have a plebiscite on the issue of directly-elected mayors in Waterford, Cork and Limerick.<\/p> <p>It really does not matter what I think about directly-elected mayors but I can say, as someone who like many people in this Chamber has close contact with local elected members, that there are mixed views on it.  The views vary from who will pay for it and whether it is correct to suggest, as has been suggested in the media, and that it could cost between &euro;120,000 and &euro;150,000 to pay for these mayors in those three locations if it were to happen at some future date.  In that context, councillors are waiting months for the outcome of the review by Ms Moorhead, senior counsel, of local pay and conditions.  It is obviously an issue that is exercising them.  I predict on this day in this Chamber that unless there is a dramatic change in terms of the Government promoting this issue of elected mayors it will be defeated in Cork, Waterford and Limerick.

Entire regions have no access to life-saving medical help in the evenings or weekends. <\/p><p>Last month, a constituent of mine told me about their recent trip to the accident and emergency department in Waterford regional hospital because Kilkenny hospital did not have access to the care they needed.  My constituent sat in an overcrowded waiting room for more than nine hours.  There were 70 people in front of them who had seen a triage nurse but had nowhere further up the chain to go.  They were eventually seen in the middle of the night in some kind of supply room or storeroom because there was nowhere else to see a doctor.  The staff were doing their best but a particularly busy night for the ambulance compounded the problems.  Some people who were left waiting began to abuse the staff.  There was blood.  There were people who should not have been left in the waiting room.  Some patients could not take it and went home to return and join the queue again the following day.  Despite enjoying one of the youngest populations and having one of the highest incomes in the OECD, Ireland spends much more per person than average and yet this constituent's experience is not unusual.  Any staff member in any hospital in Ireland would agree.<\/p><p>I want the Minister to come to the House to debate Sl&aacute;intecare before we make these promises again because we cannot deliver three hospitals.  This is uncalled for.  We need to make sure we deliver to ensure there are no more people on trolleys and people are not on long waiting lists.  We have to deliver a service that is not there at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019032600002#U00400","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553610600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I give my condolences to the people of Christchurch in New Zealand on the shooting in the mosques during which 49 people were killed.

Our thoughts and condolences are with the friends and families of those three teenagers.<\/p> <p>I was at the Fine Gael national conference last Saturday and we had the honour of the attendance of Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson, MP.  I agreed with some of the comments he made and disagreed with others but it was wonderful to see somebody like him coming to address the conference.  It should happen more often across parties and across parliaments.  Things like that open up lines of communication.  <\/p> <p>Mr. Donaldson spoke about Ireland in the Commonwealth which is an issue dear to my heart.  I welcome the fact that Deputy Mary Lou McDonald said the debate about the Commonwealth should happen at the same time as a debate about Irish unification.  I do not like the term \"unification\", I prefer \"one Ireland\" or an \"agreed Ireland\".  If we were to have an agreed Ireland, aspects of Ireland's relationship with the Commonwealth will be a part of that.  Every dog in the street knows that.  Everybody from Sinn F&eacute;in to Fianna F&aacute;il to Fine Gael knows that to be true.  Some people say we should not put the cart before the horse but I believe we need to be imaginative.  We can use sport in that regard.<\/p> <p>Let us consider the Commonwealth Games.  If I am a citizen and a nationalist from Northern Ireland, I can compete in the Commonwealth Games.  If I am an athlete from the Republic of Ireland, despite the Good Friday Agreement and parity of esteem, I cannot compete in the Commonwealth Games.  It is a simple thing that this is a narrative that exists deep down.  The United Kingdom accounts for 2% of the Commonwealth but there is an anti-Britishness at play.  We can pretend there is not but there is.  Ireland would join the Commonwealth tomorrow morning if it comprised only Australia, New Zealand, Canada and new, high-tech countries such as India and Pakistan.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Sometimes we must address our own failings.

We should have an all-Ireland soccer team but we should do what we did when we had an all-Ireland soccer team between 1882 and 1924.  This team played all its home internationals in Belfast.  Would that not be a great compromise?  Unification or an agreed Ireland is not a one-way street.  Rather, it is a two-way street and we must be prepared to roll up our sleeves and compromise if we want to achieve that which people talk about, which I believe is an agreed Ireland where everybody on this island, unionist or nationalist, is a citizen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019032600002#V00200","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1553610600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>We saw an unfortunate return to violence in the Middle East last week.  It is quite clear how it started this time.  Hamas launched a missile attack on an area of Israel 50 miles north of Gaza.  The Israelis, as they always do, will react multiplied by ten.  If this was the other way around and the aggressor had been Israel, we would have many statements in both Houses condemning it.  However, there has been another resounding silence to this violence initiated by the Palestinian side.  Clearly, Hamas is trying to disguise the fact that it is in very serious difficulties due to internal problems with Fatah and the Palestinian Authority.  I will not engage in the business of condemning the last atrocity.  It never worked in Ireland and will not work in this case.

It is helpful to hear that the company is now prepared to make further submissions.  Hopefully, the HSE will take those on board and this drug can be approved because it is important for patients and their parents that the medication they require is made available to them.  It is also important that the drug company acts in a reasonable manner regarding the price in order that the budget is not cut elsewhere if the drug is included in the scheme.

It is an interesting discussion, which has nothing to do with who is or is not a member.  The issue is the value of the Commonwealth.  Those who have spoken to me about it query its relevance in this century.  Its importance in the previous century is probably overstated as well.  It is important to some on this island and, as such, it is worthy of debate.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will come to the House at some stage to discuss it.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was unable to come to the House for a Commencement debate on organ donation.  Organ donor week begins on Saturday.  We have this curious situation where the Minister, in a written reply to me, stated that he was unable, owing to Brexit and for data protection reasons, to make information available to doctors and nurses on those who have indicated they would like to be an organ donor by having code 115 marked on their driving licence.  In the past two years, he has made this information available to private companies, including eFlow, clamping companies, the courts and the Garda, as he should.  However, he is unwilling, and apparently unable for data protection reasons - that is the excuse he gave me - to make it available to doctors and nurses who are trying to save people's lives.  I wonder if the Minister would be available to come to the House to debate this issue.  We may propose an amendment the Order of Business tomorrow to have him come to the House if he is not willing to attend for a Commencement debate on this issue.  He indicated two weeks ago that he was not able to come to the House.<\/p> <p>We will propose a second amendment to the Order of Business on Friday.  We have seen prosecutions being taken in response to the Hillsborough disaster and people have been arrested in the North for manslaughter.  I have asked officials from the Department of Justice and Equality to meet me to discuss corporate manslaughter legislation and, despite promising to do so, they have not met me in six months.  In 2005, the Law Reform Commission stated corporate manslaughter legislation was needed because there was a gap in the law.  This requirement arose from the hepatitis C scandal when thousands of women suffered injury and hundreds of died because the blood transfusion service knowingly contaminated and killed them.  It did not care and no one went to jail.  If that happened again, there would not be any prosecutions and no one would go to jail.  Will the Government bring forward legislation to address this?  If an event such as Hillsborough were to occur here or we had a tragic incident such as occurred over the St. Patrick's weekend in the North when persons were arrested and are facing prosecution, people would not face prosecution because the Government has refused to pass legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019032600002#X00100","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1553610600,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I join Members of the House who raised the tragic events in County Tyrone in remembering the lives of Morgan Barnard, Lauren Bullock and Connor Currie.

Members will have an opportunity to have a debate, an interaction and an engagement with the Minister on transport-related matters.  On the issue of metro, it will be an opportunity for Members to make their speeches and bring in their brochures and leaflets.  I welcome Senator McDowell's point that it is about living in a city and, if making improvements, one has to expect certain modifications to roads and areas adjacent to them.  We will have an opportunity on that day to have a debate with the Minister.  On Senator Mark Daly's proposal on transport, I hope that response will satisfy him.  I do not control Commencement matters but to be fair to the Minister, Deputy Ross, he is one of the Ministers who comes to the House on a regular basis to take his Commencement matters.  He will, however, be here next Thursday week.<\/p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the conference on climate change in Trinity College and thanked all those involved.  Sometimes I have to smile at the members of the Sinn Fein Party.  They do a really good course in populism for which they must receive weekly training.  They try to be all things to all people.  They are for the environment but they do not tell us what they would do.  As Senator Warfield knows, carbon tax is not a form of raising money; it is about trying to change behaviour.  As the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il today, it is about investment in public transport and renewable energy.  Carbon tax is also about changing our behaviour.<\/p><p>As Senator Bacik said, the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which is not a Government committee but an all-party Oireachtas committee, will inform the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, as to the next step we will take as a country.  We have an obligation and a duty to meet our requirements.  It is not about being populist.  It is about ensuring that we meet the expectations and demands on us.  Are we really saying Government can provide everything to people?  Who then pays?  I would like the Sinn Fein Party to answer that question as to who pays for all the grants in respect of carbon pricing.  How is this funded?  How is behaviour changed?  I will be happy to have a debate on climate change when the all-party report is published.  I look forward to that debate where we can have suggestions and solutions from all sides of the House.<\/p><p>Senator Kelleher raised the issue of the dignity and respect survey.  It is a matter for people to complete it.  I am not sure whether we can have a debate on a completed survey but I will be happy to talk to the Senator about that.<\/p><p>Brexit and the impact it will have was raised by Senators Ardagh and Bacik and indirectly by Senator Feighan and Senator Mark Daly commented on Senator Feighan's contribution.  Brexit will have a profound impact on us and Government has put in place plans to support agriculture and business.  I will be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Coveney, come to the House.  We had a debate on the omnibus legislation prior to the break but I would be happy to have the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to come to the House again on this matter.<\/p><p>Senators McFadden and O'Mahony raised the issue of the Defence Forces.  I concur with them on the need for the Public Service Pay Commission report to be published.  There is a huge need to address the issue of pay in the Defence Forces, notwithstanding the commitments made by the Government in relation to  FEMPI and the restoration of pay.  There is an obligation on Government to ensure the men and women of our Defence Forces are paid properly.  As Senator McFadden, who has championed this issue here on a number of occasions, said, it is about the pride we have in the men and women of the Defence Forces and in the role they play in UN peacekeeping duties and the way in which they carry themselves around the world.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is, however, an obligation on Government to look after them in terms of pay.

Thankfully, we have moved away from being a very judgmental, draconian State to one that is embracing, inclusive and caring.

I noted the Senator's concerns and I understand the frustration he expresses, but to come into the House and say in a defeatist manner that the proposition will be beaten does not help the case if we want to see its passage through the Houses.  I accept the point the Senator makes, namely, that people need more information.  However, I make the point - and I am sure my learned colleague, Senator McDowell, who led the charge in the campaign for retention of the Seanad, will understand and perhaps assist me in this - that people do not engage until perhaps the final three or four weeks of a referendum campaign.  That is when they focus properly.  In this instance, we have time between now and 24 May to inform people of the important need for a directly-elected mayor, particularly for the city of Cork.  I heard the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, speak in the D&aacute;il this afternoon on the matter.  If he is so critical, let him come out and support and campaign for the proposition or otherwise state his position.  He is either against or for the proposition.  There is no point in coming into the Houses to be a hurler in the ditch.  This is an important plebiscite; a significant transfer of power is involved in the newly created position of directly-elected mayor -  to name just two, I refer to the power to propose a development plan and the power to propose a budget.  It is a very important position.  It is one which I wholeheartedly support and for which I will campaign.  However, I appeal to Members of the Oireachtas who are in positions of responsibility: if they are in favour of the proposition, they should come out and campaign for it rather than coming into the Houses of the Oireachtas to state that there is not enough information or whatever.  Let us campaign for it.  I accept that the Government must be more proactive but I believe we have enough time to make this position a success and that the plebiscite can be carried.  It is critically important, especially for the cities named because of the transformative powers it can provide, the level of accountability in can produce and the direction it can give to the cities in question.  I hope the proposition will be carried.<\/p> <p>Senator Hopkins referred to mental health and the Rosalie unit in Roscommon.  I understand her frustration and I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, will come back to her on the matter.  Perhaps a Commencement matter might be a more appropriate and more expeditious way to get a response.<\/p> <p>Senator Warfield referred to Viktor Orb&aacute;n.  My position is quite clear; I have made it known on the record of the House.  My party's position has also been quite clear: we are Members of the European Parliament, and we have no truck in Fine Gael with people who do not support and uphold human rights, for example.
