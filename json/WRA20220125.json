It is a long-term rental model, in which tenants only pay the cost of providing, managing and maintaining their homes.

Together with homes that will delivered by the LDA under Project Tosaigh, this will see approximately 1,500 Cost Rental homes provided for this year.<\/p>  <p>  In the applications that AHBs have received for the homes made available under Cost Rental so far, they have noted a strong demand for one and two-bed homes. However, there is a willingness to facilitate demand for a range of unit sizes in order to meet this affordability crisis. In fact, three and four-bedroom Cost Rental homes have made up approximately 24% of the 821 homes approved under CREL to date.<\/p>  <p>  My Department are also supporting the delivery of affordable purchase and Cost Rental homes through Local Authorities via the Affordable Housing Fund.

Private finance and institutional investment has a role to play in supporting new supply, particularly in high density apartments that would otherwise not be built and it is important to recognise the positive effects that institutional investment can have in terms of increasing the supply of housing; bringing diversity of supply with experienced large scale management practices; and increased choice for tenants, which is important for the market and for renters. <\/p><p>It is essential that we achieve the balance between addressing the issue of multiple purchases by institutional investors, whilst at the same time ensuring that the supply of financing to the market is not undermined, particularly for the construction of new developments.<\/p><p>In this regard, the Government absolutely recognises the need for protections to prevent investment moving into other areas where viability and demand are not issues and that is why as a Government we moved quickly in May 2021 to introduce the stamp duty increase and to provide guidance to planning authorities. <\/p><p>Furthermore, in December 2021, legislation was enacted as part of the Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Development) Act 2021 that sets out the requirement for a housing strategy to take into account the existing need and the likely future need for housing, in particular houses and duplexes, for purchase by intending owner occupiers.<\/p><p>To address the rent affordability challenges, building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP (CSO data for December 2021 shows HICP inflation of 5.7% p.a.) the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 provides, from 11 December 2021, a cap of 2% per annum pro rata on rent increases in RPZs, where the inflation rate is higher. In effect, this will mean that rents in RPZs may only increase by a maximum of 2% per annum pro rata during times of higher inflation. <\/p><p>In all cases, section 19(1) of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 prohibits the setting of a rent that exceeds market rent.<\/p><p>The RTB Rent Index is published quarterly and reveals the actual rents being paid for rented properties, as distinct from the asking rents which feature in other rent reports. It is compiled in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). It is based on actual rents paid on private tenancies registered with the RTB in the quarter, which is made up of homes new to the rental sector, new tenancies in existing housing stock and renewals of existing tenancies.

National Policy Objective (NPO) 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, NPO 19 of the NPF aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, and other weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining. NPO 19 is aligned with the established planning approach as per the 2005 Rural Housing Guidelines, whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part-time) need may be applied by planning authorities in certain rural areas under urban influence in order to prevent urban sprawl.<\/p>  <p>  Under the current Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing (2005), planning authorities are required to frame the planning policies in their development plans in a balanced and measured way that ensures the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing.  <\/p>  <p>  In considering the framework for policy within a development plan, matters such as the level of pressure for development in a county, the promotion of sustainable development patterns, landscape protection, Strategic Environmental Assessment of the impact of policy and National and Regional development objectives must be taken into account.  <\/p>  <p>  Adoption of a plan is a reserved function of the relevant local authority, undertaken by the elected members and advised by the Chief Executive. Assessment of planning applications is also a matter for the local authority, taking into account the objectives of the adopted development plan in addition to national policy and section 28 Ministerial Guidelines.  Each application must be assessed on its own merits, based on the documentation submitted, analysis of the particular site circumstances and compliance with adopted policy.  <\/p>  <p>  Comparison of grants of planning permission for rural housing in various local authorities does not reflect the particular issues and locational circumstances which have informed the policy framework of a local authority. These could include a location proximate to a large city and the significant level of urban-generated rural housing demand as a result, landscape sensitivity to development, the availability of land within a small local authority for rural and urban development needs and designation of significant land areas for Natura 2000 sites or other environmental sensitivities.  <\/p>  <p>  Updated section 28 guidelines on Rural Housing are currently being drafted by my Department to ensure consistency with new requirements and legislation at national and EU level introduced in respect of areas related to rural housing such as environmental protection, the Gaeltacht and climate action. The new guidelines, being prepared in draft in Q1 of this year, will ensure a more consistent approach between local authorities and alignment with NPF objectives. In the meantime, NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to prepare and adopt development plan policies for one-off housing in rural areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500060#WRB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rental Sector","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500060#WRB02700"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[3332\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500060#WRB02800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the way that he will address rising rental costs for properties in areas outside Dublin such as rents in counties Roscommon and Galway which have seen significant increases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>Section 24A of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended, provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with housing authorities, may make a proposal to the Minister that an area should be considered as a Rent Pressure Zone.

Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between  1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:<\/p><p>- Identification and description of defect,<\/p><p>- Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,<\/p><p>- Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,<\/p><p>- Severity\/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,<\/p><p>- Period of construction affected,<\/p><p>- Type of dwelling affected,<\/p><p>- Location of dwellings affected.<\/p><p>3. Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.<\/p><p>4. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.<\/p><p>- In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.<\/p><p>5. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:<\/p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,<\/p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work,<\/p><p>- individual dwellings or whole building approach,<\/p><p>- routine maintenance\/refurbishment or remediation,<\/p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.<\/p><p>6.

This is in conjunction with the policy framework as to how the Cost Rental sector will operate in Ireland, as set out in the Affordable Housing Act 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Over the period to 2030, it is intended that approximately 18,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered. They will be provided by AHBs supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan funding (CREL), by Local Authorities through the Affordable Housing Fund and by the LDA on their portfolio of sites or through Project Tosaigh.  <\/p>  <p>  Cost Rental delivery will be informed by National Planning Framework priorities. It will be focused, at least initially, on densely populated urban areas where rental affordability pressures are particularly acute and where State resources can have the biggest impact. It is important that the State targets its affordability measures towards the parts of the country that are experiencing the most extreme affordability challenges. This is why my Department requested Housing Delivery Action Plans from each Local Authority before the end of December 2021 and will use the data submitted to target the most affected areas.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of initial Cost Rental projects is being supported by the CREL scheme, under which Government provides loans to AHBs to finance up to 30% of the capital costs for new cost rental homes, while the Housing Finance Agency is offering AHBs very competitive commercial debt funding to cover the remaining capital costs. &euro;70 million was allocated to CREL in Budget 2022. <\/p>  <p>  A total of 390 Cost Rental homes were approved under the first tranche of CREL funding in early 2021. These new homes are located in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area and Cork, with cost-covering rents projected at a minimum of 25% less than comparable open market prices.<\/p>  <p>  The first 25 Cost Rental homes to be designated in Ireland were completed by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan and the first tenants moved into their new homes at Taylor Hill in August 2021. The cost-covering rents for these homes are approximately 40% below comparable open-market prices in the area, ranging from &euro;935 per month for a two-bed terraced house to &euro;1,150 for a four-bed detached house.<\/p>  <p>  Another 40 Cost Rental homes have recently been completed at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip, County Kildare, where all tenants have moved into their new homes. The cost-covering rents for these CREL-funded homes range from &euro;900 per month for the two-bed homes to &euro;1,250 per month for the three-bed homes, which are approximately 42% below market rent.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, AHBs are targeted to provide some 700 homes through CREL in 2022 of a total target of 1,500 Cost Rental homes to be provided this year.

It recognises that significant new supports are needed so that those who want to own their own home can do so, and that those who wish to rent are able to do so at an affordable rate. A number of measures are set out under the plan to support this goal. <\/p><p>A new Local Authority Home Loan, was launched in early January and is available nationwide, for those on modest or low incomes who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial banks to purchase or build a home. <\/p><p>The key improvement of the new revised home loan is an increase to the income ceiling for single applicants by &euro;15,000 to &euro;65,000 where the house price limit under the scheme is &euro;320,000 (i.e. Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath or Wicklow). In addition, a 0.25% interest rate reduction has been applied. These changes will have a significant impact on the numbers of potential applicants and has improved the affordability of the loan itself.<\/p><p>The Help to Buy incentive for first time buyers has been extended to the end of this year. An owner-occupier guarantee which requires Local Authorities to ensure home ownership as a tenure type is provided for and estimated in their Housing Strategies has also been introduced.<\/p><p><i>Housing for All<\/i>commits to the introduction of two new affordable purchase schemes. The first will see the delivery of affordable homes by local authorities. The second will see the introduction of a 'First Home' affordable purchase shared equity scheme for homes in private developments. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.<\/p><p>The delivery of Cost Rental homes is a key affordability measure under Housing for All, with State-backed rents that are in the order of 25% below what they would be on the private market. 65 cost rental homes have been tenanted to date, in developments in Balbriggan and Leixlip, and a further 1,580 cost rental homes are targeted for delivery in 2022.<\/p><p>To support local authorities in the delivery of affordable homes, the Affordable Housing Fund has replaced the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). The Fund has been open for applications from 1 September 2021. My Department has actively engaged with the Local Authorities to support and encourage them to develop and submit proposals. The homes that Local Authorities deliver under the Affordable Housing Fund will be sold at least 15% below open market value in respect of Affordable Purchase homes and in the order of 25% below open market value prices in respect of Cost Rental homes. <\/p><p>The Land Development Agency (LDA) has a key role in the delivery of affordable homes, including through &ldquo;Project Tosaigh&rdquo; aimed at accelerating the delivery of up to 5,000 homes. The first delivery stream of this LDA initiative to bring privately developed units to market affordably and quickly was launched on 12 November 2021. The LDA issued a call for Expressions of Interest for advance purchase agreements to developers, with a target scheme scale in excess of 150 units per development, in the Greater Dublin Area, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. The Expressions of Interest submitted are currently being assessed by the LDA with their priority focus and engagement being on schemes with potential delivery in 2022 and 2023. <\/p><p>Stream 2 of Project Tosaigh will be launched in the coming months and will target more comprehensive developer partnerships (rather than specific developments) to deliver a stable flow of affordable homes over a 3 to 4 year period. It is intended that the homes, upon acquisition, will be primarily owned and managed by the LDA for the provision of cost rental accommodation and\/or sold as affordable homes. These homes will be targeted at those middle-income households that do not qualify for social housing, but struggle to afford open market housing, i.e. household incomes of broadly &euro;45,000 to &euro;80,000 per annum<\/p><p>In addition, the LDA has specific statutory responsibility to deliver affordable housing, primarily on State land. Housing for All identifies 20 State land sites that will be transferred to the LDA which have the potential to provide 15,000 homes. Initial discussions are underway on the transfer of each of the sites identified in Housing for All, with work further progressed on 14 additional sites identified prior to the publication of Housing for All. A number of these 14 sites have received planning permission or will submit a planning permission application in 2022.<\/p><p>A key action under Housing for All provides that local authorities were required to prepare a Housing Delivery Action Plan, setting out details of social and affordable housing delivery over the next five years. All local authorities submitted their plan to me in December and my Department is engaging with local authorities on these plans, in particular their alignment with the targets and policy objectives set out in Housing for All. The Plans will be published in Quarter 2 of 2022. Increased capacity of the public service to deliver, along with the streamlining of approval processes in relation to housing delivery are key priorities under Housing for All. Over 200 additional posts have been sanctioned and are in the process of being filled across Local Authority housing delivery teams in order to deliver on the scale of Housing for All&rsquo;s ambition.<\/p><p>With regard to construction more generally, and the Government&rsquo;s plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade, indications of increased activity are becoming evident. The number of homes delivered in the year to end-Q3 2021 was 20,903, while the number of commencements in 2021 was 30,724, reflecting a greater than 3-fold increase in commencements since 2015 and a steady upward trend in the number of commencements. The most recent CSO figures on planning permissions also show a strong pipeline, with 39,077 units (apartments\/flats and houses) granted planning permission in the 12 months to end Q3 2021. This pipeline data gives confidence that we are on a strong upward trajectory in the delivery of our housing supply targets.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500061#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[2394\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500061#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason that time spent on a local authority social housing list is not retained when an applicant transfers to another local authority area housing list meaning that an applicant must start from the beginning again; if he will consider measures to retain time spent on the local authority housing list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1506","askee":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":110,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500061#WRC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[3197\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500061#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the work to examine the mechanism for funding local authorities to address anomalies in allocations across counties of comparable size.","asker":"1483","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>I assume the question refers to the allocation of Local Property Tax (LPT) following the first LPT revaluation and the addition of new residential properties that were previously exempt from LPT. <\/p>  <p>  As well as the revaluation, the Programme for Government commits to a move to 100% local retention of the tax.

As such, they are not covered by the statutory framework for employees in relation to maternity leave. <\/p>  <p>  I recognise that this is not an acceptable situation and is also an obstacle to the participation of women in local government. It is an issue I am determined to address as a matter of urgency, in a progressive and comprehensive manner. The role of the councillor must be one that is accessible, manageable and sustainable for all, thus helping to ensure that councillors are more fully representative of the constituents they serve. <\/p>  <p>  As matters currently stand, it is only under the provisions of Section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 that councillors may be absent from the role for maternity purposes. Under Section 18, a councillor shall be deemed to have automatically resigned from membership of a local authority if he or she is absent from meetings for a continuous period of 6 consecutive months. Where the absence is due to illness or &ldquo;in good faith for another reason&rdquo;, then the period of absence may be extended first to 12 months and then to up to 18 months by resolution of the Council. <\/p>  <p>  A councillor who is absent for 6 months will continue to receive the full amount of his or her Representational Payment. Thereafter this payment is reduced by 50% for absences of 6 to 12 months duration. A councillor who is absent for more than 12 months will not receive any further payments regardless of the reason for the absence. <\/p>  <p>  With effect from January 2017, the Social Welfare Acts were amended so that councillors gained access to the same benefits as self-employed contributors. Accordingly, councillors are now reckonable for the purposes of accessing Class S benefits, including Maternity Benefit. <\/p>  <p>  On 29 March 2021, I hosted the first meeting of a working group of women councillors established to examine all maternity-related matters, including wider supports other than maternity leave. This group, which is a representative and cross political party group of women councillors, met a number of times in 2021. Their extensive deliberations have given my officials and I greater understanding of the needs of women councillors and have been important in the development of a policy approach.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has since engaged extensively with the Office of the Attorney General on legal questions arising. My officials are also engaging in a positive manner with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in relation to bringing councillors under the maternity protection legislative framework.   <\/p>  <p>  Following this work, it is my intention to bring forward as early as feasible this year a package of maternity-related measures for councillors, which will include proposals for legislative change. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500061#WRC05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500061#WRC05500"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[3344\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500061#WRC05600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to put in place cost rental and cost purchase housing or affordable housing models.","asker":"1460","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":159,"content":"<p>The Affordable Housing Act 2021, the first ever standalone affordable housing legislation, established a basis for four new affordable housing measures. These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  This Act, supported by the unprecedented levels of funding committed to in the Housing for All strategy, averaging over &euro;4 billion annually, will underpin the delivery of affordable housing targets. Specifically, 54,000 affordable homes will be delivered between now and 2030 by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the first affordable purchase homes under the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will be made available in Cork in February. Cork City Council indicated the prices to be &euro;218,000 for a 2-bedroom and &euro;243,000 for a 3-bedroom dwelling. This will be followed by a Fingal County Council supported affordable purchase development (Dun Emer). Fingal County Council have indicated these will cost &euro;166,000 for a 2-bed apartment and between &euro;206,000 and &euro;258,000 for 3-bed dwellings.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, as part of Housing for All, additional funding of &euro;1bn was committed to the Land Development Agency in order for it to deliver on its pipeline of housing. This includes Project Tosaigh under which the LDA will enter into forward purchase arrangements to kick-start stalled private developments and increase the supply of affordable housing. The LDA initiated a call on 12 November 2021 targeting a scale in excess of 150 affordable units per development and is currently assessing the proposals received.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, the Housing Delivery Coordination Office (within the LGMA) issued a call to secure additional affordable homes across 14 local authorities with the most acute affordability constraint. This call is also focused on stalled private developments but targets smaller scale developments than the LDA initiative.<\/p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Act provided for the establishment of a Cost Rental sector in Ireland. Despite the impacts of Covid-19, 65 Cost Rental homes were tenanted in 2021 (25 in Balbriggan Co, Dublin, and 40 in Leixlip Co. Kildare). Over 700 Cost Rental homes will be delivered by Approved Housing Bodies in 2022, with more to be delivered by the LDA.<\/p>  <p>  The First Home shared equity scheme, under Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act, will primarily support first-time buyers purchasing newly constructed homes on the private market. This scheme will be available at a national level and will incorporate regional price caps based on median house price sales.

Confirmation of the final details of this scheme is ongoing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders and it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will be available for applications in Q2 of this year. <\/p>  <p>  This multi-faceted approach will improve affordability for all families or individuals across society wishing to secure a home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500061#WRC05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Persons Supports","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500061#WRC05800"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[3194\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500061#WRC05900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the progress in relation to expanding the Housing First approach to supporting persons experiencing homelessness; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>Housing First enables homeless individuals with high levels of complex needs to obtain permanent secure accommodation with the provision of intensive housing and health supports to help them maintain their tenancies.<\/p><p>The first National Implementation Plan for Housing First, published in September 2018, which put the programme on a national footing, was designed to provide this response, by delivering permanent housing solutions and associated supports for rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation.

This amendment was made, by the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Housing Loan Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations 2021, on the 7 December 2021. <\/p><p>It is intended that the scheme will be operated by a newly-established &lsquo;First Home Scheme Ireland&rsquo; Designated Activity Company which was incorporated in December last. Significant work is continuing on the detailed design and parameters of the scheme, and full scheme details will be confirmed upon completion of this work. It is anticipated that initial activity on key areas of work, including public communications, will be conducted in Q1 of this year, in advance of First Home&rsquo;s first receipt of applications and deployment of equity support, scheduled for Q2. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500062#WRD05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties","counter":214,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500062#WRD05300"},{"type":"question","counter":215,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[3278\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500062#WRD05400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the introduction of the new local authority-led programme for compulsory purchase orders of vacant properties for resale on the open market; the funding he is providing for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":216,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":217,"content":"<p>Question No. 146 answered with Question No. 111<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500062#WRD05700"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[3340\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500062#WRD05800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of new build social homes and new build affordable homes that were delivered in County Mayo in 2021; the targets for 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on social housing delivery for each local authority on a quarterly basis.

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.<\/p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational\/community\/religious buildings. <\/p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. Project scoping feedback has been received from interested parties through the draft Request for Tender process and has been considered by my Department in the development of the final Request for Tender documentation. My Department intends to publish the call for tender shortly. <\/p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department has advanced interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.<\/p>  <p>  The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001\/42\/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. It is anticipated that the formal SEA process will commence, with consultation with the statutory environmental authorities to inform the content of the Environmental Report, following the completion of the screening for Appropriate Assessment by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit. The SEA Environmental Report will be published alongside a draft of the interim regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This public consultation is expected to commence shortly. A copy of the draft interim regulations and the Environmental Report will be made available for inspection over this period. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before finalisation of the draft interim regulation. <\/p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with interim exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is expected to be completed in Q2 2022. As outlined, pending the finalisation of the aforementioned aviation safeguarding maps, these interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the proposed new solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.<\/p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed in the second half of 2022. The final supplementary set of regulations - delineating the final exclusion areas around airports and aerodromes in which the exemptions will not apply - will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500062#WRD06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500063#WRE00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500063#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[2897\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500063#WRE00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will propose legislation that will provide for the review and or appeal of decisions made by the Director of Public Prosecutions.","asker":"1451","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in the performance of her functions in accordance with provisions of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974.

The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and\/or labour shortages in the State, required to develop and support enterprise for the benefit of our economy.  However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.<\/p><p>The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit and these lists are subject to twice-yearly evidenced based review. <\/p><p>Since March 2020, my Department has implemented Covid-19 contingency arrangements moving employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment.  Feedback received from enterprise across the board has been universally positive.  In fact, Ireland was one of the few countries that has managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis. <\/p><p>From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permit applications are expedited with immediate effect. <\/p><p>My Department experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year.  Applications for Employment Permits increased significantly over the course of 2021, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  My Department issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity.  The impact of this has resulted in a significant backlog, which has increased from 1,000 in April 2021 to approximately c. 10,500 by mid January 2022, but it is now stabilising.<\/p><p>In addition, the extension of categories of employment permits following the latest Review of the Occupational Lists has increased the availability of employment permits for these roles.<\/p><p>Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack.  As a result, employment permit applications associated with the July 2021 Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other nonstandard methods.  This resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications, requiring staff to be temporarily reassigned to assist in the process and had a direct impact on wider processing times for other permit applications. <\/p><p>An Action Plan has been developed and is being implemented to tackle the backlog, with both human resource interventions and systemic changes.  The staffing actions being taken include: <\/p><p>- Recruitment of additional permanent and temporary staff.  This is an increase of 69% on our permanent capacity and 125% to include temporary staff to deal with the backlog in applications. <\/p><p>- Temporary reassignment of staff from other areas of the Department with relevant skills. <\/p><p>- Increased overtime arrangements.<\/p><p>As the Plan is implemented and begins to take effect, we expect to see improvements in the backlog from end-January, with thebacklog considerably reduced by the end of Q1 and substantially reduced by the end of Q2 2022.<\/p><p>In addition, further systemic changes have also been introduced.  My Department has worked with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Justice to streamline and extend the time period for General Employment Permits (GEP) issued to doctors.  A new two-year multi-site GEP for Medical Doctors in Public hospitals and Public health facilities was introduced in respect of the January 2022 Doctors rotation.  This will result in significant benefits for applicants, as well as major efficiencies for the Employment Permits Section, by eliminating the necessity to apply for additional employment permits when moving to a different Public hospital or Public health facility within this two year period. <\/p><p>The Department provides regular updates on its website in relation to processing times and engages directly with key stakeholders including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, AmCham, IBEC, representative groups and individual companies, as required, including regarding sectoral labour requirements. <\/p><p>The Management Board of my Department is overseeing the implementation of the Action Plan and its impact on the backlog and waiting times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500063#WRE04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence","counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500063#WRE05000"},{"type":"question","counter":275,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[3497\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500063#WRE05100","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"his Department&rsquo;s total capital and current expenditure budget for 2021 and 2022 for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence with a breakdown for each related allocation for both years in tabular form.","asker":"1466","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":276,"content":"<p>I wish to confirm to the Deputy that my Department does not have any discrete funding in its budget to specifically address issues of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.<\/p>  <p>  Insofar as the welfare of the Department&rsquo;s staff is concerned, the Department ensures that the various civil service wide guidelines and circulars that look to protect the welfare of staff in areas such as harassment, anti-bullying etc. are applied in respect of the staff of the Department and its Offices.

The Government is developing a framework of supports to enable homes, businesses, farms and communities to install renewable generation for their own consumption and receive a payment for any residual electricity they export to the grid. Micro-generation has an important role to play in empowering and driving engagement and participation. It creates opportunities for domestic, community, farming and small commercial customers to take the first steps towards investment in renewable technologies, which can play a role in shaping electricity demand and decarbonising homes and businesses.<\/p><p>The MSS is targeting support for 380MW of installed micro-generation capacity, to contribute to the target of up to 2.5GW of solar renewables under the Climate Action Plan. Depending on panel size, that equates to over 1 million solar panels, on approximately 70,000 buildings.<\/p><p>Non-domestic applicants will be eligible to receive the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff, for any exported electricity, at a competitive market rate from their electricity supplier. Projects between 6kW and 50kW will receive a Clean Export Premium (CEP) tariff per kWh exported, for a period of 15 years, from their electricity supplier. The CEP will be &euro;0.135\/kWh in 2022, which is higher than the current average wholesale electricity price. Any difference between the CEP tariff and wholesale electricity prices will be supported by the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy. Exported volumes of electricity eligible for the Clean Export Premium (CEP) tariff will be capped at 80% of generation capacity to incentivise self-consumption.<\/p><p>It is expected that the Clean Export Premium (CEP) will commence in the third quarter of 2022, when a payment mechanism will be determined by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500064#WRF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[3431\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500064#WRF03400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on a targeted roll-out of sectoral specific grants for microgeneration of wind and solar for SMEs that consume large quantities of energy such as dairy farms and supermarkets as a method of reducing demand on the national grid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1516","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>The pending introduction of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff represents the first phase of a comprehensive enabling framework for micro-and small-scale generators in Ireland that will allow them to receive payment from their electricity supplier for all excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, which reflects the market value of the electricity.The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision on 1 December 2021 outlining the interim arrangements for implementation of the CEG, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. The CEG will become available upon the transposition of Article 21 of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) into Irish law and will be available to both new and existing micro- and small-scale generators who comply with the CRU decision.<\/p><p>Businesses that use a large amount of electricity, particularly supermarkets, will benefit most when they consume electricity on site from their own micro-generation.

In addition to the IRHA request, the Department and the RSA were also in receipt of a number of similar queries from several other individual transport operators.<\/p>  <p>  The derogation was designed to assist in ensuring that key supply chains for food and essential goods were kept open. My Department and the RSA duly considered driver welfare, road safety, operational flexibility and supply chain aspects and reached a decision balancing all of these elements. The flexibilities which were provided are limited in scope and were provided for a limited 21-day period only, applied retrospectively from 9th January 2022 up to 30th January 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Regulation (EC) No 561\/2006 provides a common set of EU rules for maximum daily and fortnightly driving times, as well as daily and weekly minimum rest periods for all drivers of road haulage and passenger transport vehicles. The aim of this set of rules is to avoid distortion of competition, improve road safety and ensure drivers' good working conditions within the European Union. Article 14(2) of the Regulation lays down that Member States may grant, in urgent cases, exceptions from the application of the rules for up to 30 days to transport operations carried out in exceptional circumstances.  There is no requirement for a safety or impact assessment to be undertaken as part of the temporary derogation process allowed under Regulation No. 561\/2006.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to grant the derogation reflects past approaches for dealing with driver shortages during the pandemic.  Ireland, like all Member States, is entitled to grant temporary derogations from the EU driving and resting time rules for periods of up to 30 days when dealing with exceptional circumstances such as those caused by Covid. Other EU member states have granted similar derogations at various points during the crisis to alleviate any supply chain blockages. Information on these can be found on the European Commission website here  - transport.ec.europa.eu\/document\/download\/4b5a1e1c-3260-4f1f-a208-611e7007154f_en - <\/p>  <p>  Nothing in the derogation changes the rules relating to weekly working time (Working Time Directive for Mobile Workers Directive 2002\/15\/EC) which must continue to be adhered to. This was highlighted clearly by the RSA in their press release on the matter. In addition, the RSA reminded of the following key points for the implementation of the derogation - <\/p>  <p>  - Driver safety or other road user&rsquo;s safety must not be compromised. Drivers should not deviate from the rules if it jeopardises road safety nor should they be expected to drive whilst tired. <\/p>  <p>  - Employers remain responsible for the health and safety of their employees and other road users.<\/p>  <p>  - The practical implementation of this temporary relaxation of the rules should be agreed by employers with their drivers.<\/p>  <p>  The derogation is due to expire on 30 January. Since the omicron wave of Covid has now subsided and driver absence levels have reduced,  it is not proposed to extend the derogation beyond this date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500064#WRF06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coast Guard Service","counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500064#WRF06500"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[3023\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500064#WRF06600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the search and rescue aviation tender; the timeline for a decision and expected milestones; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":355,"content":"<p>On 27 July 2021, the Government agreed to commence the formal procurement process for a new Coast Guard aviation service.

Ireland was signatory to a non-paper to the Commission earlier this year requesting a phase-out date for the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the EU in line with the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 as well as the introduction of a legal framework that allows Member States to move ahead by taking action at national level to incentivise early phase-out of new petrol and diesel cars and vans. The paper can be viewed at www.permanentrepresentations.nl\/permanent-representations\/pr-eu-brussels\/documents\/publications\/2021\/03\/10\/non-paper---transition-to-zero-emission-light-duty-vehicles<\/p><p>In addition, on Transport Day at COP26, I signed a sponsored declaration to accelerate the transition to 100% zero emission cars and vans. The declaration is an important signal of ambition at a global level. In line with our Programme for Government commitments, Ireland has even greater ambitions, targeting a switch over of one million electric vehicles by 2030 to bring us on a trajectory to achieving electrification of all new car sales well ahead of 2035 <\/p><p>These declarations are consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s ambitions to tackle transport emissions. They follow the recent publication of the Climate Action Plan (CAP) &rsquo;21 which outlines a pathway to a radical and equitable transformation in Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector over the next nine years as it moves towards decarbonisation. Car manufacturers are responding to these initiatives by introducing a wide range of electric vehicles to the market, and over the coming decade, I envisage a progressive transition to EVs in our car fleet as electric vehicle technology becomes mainstream .  <\/p><p>My Department has convened the <i>Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group<\/i>to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The <i>EVPP Working Group <\/i>comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales. Scrappage schemes were discussed as part of these considerations. The Working Group considered the potential of this incentive but concluded that a general  scrappage scheme would entail significant additional costs; however, the Group concluded that niche markets scrappage schemes could potentially play an important role, such as the SPSV  sector. <\/p><p>Furthermore, considerable progress has been made to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500065#WRG04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":414,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500065#WRG05000"},{"type":"question","counter":415,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[3441\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500065#WRG05100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to prepare legislation for motorway filling stations to increase the number of rapid charging points for electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1516","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":416,"content":"<p>Preparations are under way to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV), as recommended in the Electric Vehicles Policy Pathway Report; this will play an important role in our transition to zero-emission vehicles.

I strongly welcome the re-opening of the Commission&rsquo;s review, as I believe now is the right time to discuss possible reforms to the existing fiscal framework in Europe. <\/p>  <p>  To date, the Commission has not brought forward any specific proposals for reforms to the governance framework. However, as I have re-iterated on several occasions, I support efforts to increase the transparency and predictability of the framework.<\/p>  <p>  The discussions on reform of the framework will be complex and take place against the backdrop of a number of fiscal challenges.  The most immediate of these is the challenge posed by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the public finances of EU Member States. Strong coordinated policy actions at EU and national levels (including the activation of the General Escape Clause of the Stability and Growth Pact) helped to reduce the societal and economic impact of the pandemic. While these measures were undoubtedly necessary and prudent, they have nevertheless resulted in significant increases in deficit and debt ratios throughout the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a number of more medium-term fiscal and structural challenges were already visible on the horizon before the pandemic hit. Amongst these are the challenges posed by the so-called &lsquo;dual transitions&rsquo; to a digital and green economy. Concurrently, population ageing over the coming decades will also have a significant impact on the public finances. In this context, I recognise that a balance must be met between the need to finance additional investment requirements and the equally important need to ensure financial sustainability, particularly given the impact of the pandemic on the fiscal positions of Member States.<\/p>  <p>  The structural budgetary challenges we are now facing, along with the economic interdependencies and risks which existed when the European Monetary Union was established, all speak to the continued need for fiscal rules at a European level. However, such rules must be appropriately calibrated in order to be credible. The rules must also contain a degree of flexibility, to allow Governments to tackle unanticipated shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, effective economic and budgetary coordination remains a key building block for ensuring stability and growth in the EU and for strengthening the Economic and Monetary Union. Maintaining the sustainability of public finances as an objective of the fiscal rules is essential in this respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500067#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":488,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500067#WRJ01600"},{"type":"question","counter":489,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[3175\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500067#WRJ01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the beauty industry is subject to a VAT rate of 13.5% while the hairdressing sector pays a 9% rate; if this anomaly can be rectified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":490,"content":"<p>The VAT rates applying in Ireland are subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.

The Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 was published on 23 June and enacted on 19 July 2021 and extended EWSS to 31 December 2021.   The Finance Act 2021, was published on 21 October 2021 and enacted on 21 December 2021 and extended EWSS to 30 April 2022 for eligible employers who are correctly registered for EWSS on or before 31 December 2021.   <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy, will be aware, eligibility to EWSS is based on the employer demonstrating that its business is likely to experience a 30% reduction in turnover or orders during a specific reference period and that this disruption to business is caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.   In addition, the business must also have tax clearance.   <\/p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the scheme, each employer availing of the scheme must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances at the end of each month and if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer meets the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments.   For July to December 2021, employers provide to Revenue details of this eligibility review on a monthly Eligibility Review Form (ERF), filed through ROS.   This form assists employers in determining whether they are eligible, ensuring timely deregistration and avoiding incorrect subsidy claims.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that employers who became ineligible for EWSS from 1 December 2021 on foot of the eligibility review they undertook at the end of November 2021 could contact Revenue via My Enquiries by 15 January 2022 to amend the December projections included in their November 2021 ERF, where the projections they prepared on 30 November were overstated having regard to the public health restrictions introduced on 20 December.   Once the December projections have been updated by Revenue, the employer can then amend their December payroll submissions to include the EWSS claim.  Any December payroll submissions already filed, that included an EWSS claim, do not need to be resubmitted. These are automatically processed by Revenue once the November ERF is amended. These employers were also required to file their December ERF, by 15 January 2022.   <\/p>  <p>  On 21 December 2021, in light of public health restrictions announced on 17 December 2021, I announced a re-opening of the scheme for certain employers who might otherwise be ineligible.   These were employers who were previously eligible for EWSS, but as their business activity was at a level where they would not have met the turnover qualification criteria, they were not eligible on 31 December 2021. In light of the restrictions introduced last December, some businesses may return to a position where they require EWSS support and as such the EWSS re-opened to certain employers from 1 January 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Where employers determined they were eligible to re-enter the scheme, they could do so by completing and submitting a short template of required information to Revenue via MyEnquiries by 15 January 2022. The relevant template and further information can be found in Revenue&rsquo;s guidelines on how employers can re-enter the EWSS.    <\/p>  <p>  If employers in either of those cohorts missed the 15 January deadline, I am advised that a submission can be submitted to Revenue by 31 January requesting that their late submission be considered.   This submission should include details as to the reason the initial deadline was not met.

Under this procedure, a household may apply for support to one housing authority only, which may be the authority for the area in which the household normally resides or with which it has a local connection, or the authority that agrees, at its discretion, to assess the household for support.  A household, meeting either the residence or local connection condition, may specify up to three areas of choice for receipt of support in the areas of all housing authorities in the county and city concerned and, if qualified, will be entered on the housing waiting list of each of those housing authorities. <\/p>  <p>  Consistent with the provisions in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is considered to be a social housing support and consequently households in receipt of a payment under the HAP scheme are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list. However, acknowledging that some households on the waiting list, who avail of HAP, have expectations that they would receive a more traditional form of social housing support, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, local authorities are also directed that HAP recipients who apply to go on the transfer list should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  Guidelines on inter-authority movement were issued to local authorities to facilitate the movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant wishes to access rented accommodation, with HAP support, in another local authority area. Inter authority movement is, however, subject to certain conditions, such as the relevant Social Housing Income Eligibility Bands and confirmation that the applicant's income is below the threshold in the new local authority. <\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain equity between all tenants in receipt of social housing support, inter-authority movement for HAP will be facilitated without reference to Social Housing Eligibility Income Bands in areas that offer shared areas of choice in their allocation schemes, as no change to existing treatment is involved in such areas. For example, in Dublin, the four local authority areas currently offer shared areas of choice in their allocation schemes. <\/p>  <p>  However, HAP tenants who avail of inter-authority movement, can only be offered access to the transfer list of the originating local authority.<\/p>  <p>  The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their own scheme of letting priorities.

In the case of remediation options 2-5 a similar but necessarily different approach will be taken to inform the appropriate rate for blockwork removal and replacement following consultation with SCSI.<\/p>  <p>  - A revised application process will be introduced which will only require the homeowner to submit an initial &lsquo;Building Condition Assessment&rsquo; at minimal cost recoupable on entry to the Scheme. The Housing Agency will take over testing, sampling and categorisation of homes on behalf of homeowners and local authorities and will thereafter recommend the appropriate remediation option and grant amount for each home. <\/p>  <p>  - Alternative accommodation and storage costs are to be included, subject to a maximum of &euro;20,000.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 will be available for essential immediate repair works recommended by a building professional as part of the Building Condition Assessment process.<\/p>  <p>  - In relation to works carried out under remediation options 2-5, a second grant option, will be available for such a home in the future if blockwork which was not removed as part of the initial remediation work subsequently proves defective in accordance with the IS:465 standard.<\/p>  <p>  - A new independent appeals process will be introduced.<\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme will be extended beyond the current scope of Principal Private Residences only, to also cover Residential Tenancies Board registered rental properties, subject to the introduction of a clawback mechanism upon re-sale within a set time period depending on the remediation option used.

The property in question must also meet certain eligibility criteria. The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant. The borrower surrenders their property to their lender who sells it to a MTR provider which can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life Ltd.  The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.   <\/p>  <p>  To the end of December 2021, 1682 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013. The 1682 households in the scheme represent 2738 adults and 2274 children who have remained living in their homes and communities. As of that date, 720 active cases were being progressed under the scheme. The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme on the Housing Agency's website at the following link: www.housingagency.ie\/housing-information\/mortgage-rent-statistics  <\/p>  <p>  Both the Programme for Government and Housing for All commits to strengthening the MTR scheme and ensuring that it is helping those who need it. Building on the significant amendments already made to the scheme in 2017, the 2021 Review, published on the 24 January 2022, examined the impact of these changes and what further changes would benefit those in need of the scheme. While the scheme is performing well, it was assessed that some further enhancements were needed to enable more households in need of State support with their long-term housing needs to avail of this scheme. Four broad categories of actions are identified in the review, including:<\/p>  <p>  a) broadening eligibility criteria;<\/p>  <p>  b) improving the scheme process, structure and financing;<\/p>  <p>  c) increasing communication and awareness raising; and<\/p>  <p>  d) responding to developments around mortgage arrears solutions. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the enhancements to broadening the eligibility criteria to ensure more households will be eligible for the scheme there is a new amendment to allow flexibility where the household concerned is over accommodated (i.e. has more than 2 spare bedrooms above the current needs of the household). Flexibility on over accommodation may be allowed where:<\/p>  <p>  a. the borrower or one of the joint borrowers is aged 65 and over<\/p>  <p>  b. the borrower, one of the joint borrowers or one of the borrower&rsquo;s dependents has a disability and the property has been significantly and permanently adapted to their needs<\/p>  <p>c.   the borrower, one of the joint borrowers or one of the borrower&rsquo;s dependents has a disability and the property is specifically suitable to their needs without adaptations<\/p>  <p>  In the case of (b) and (c) above, the household must also qualify for Social Housing Support on disability, medical or compassionate grounds in line with the local authority&rsquo;s allocation policy. Such flexibility is subject to the local authority or AHB (as appropriate) reserving the right to accommodate the household in more appropriate accommodation, if available, in the future.<\/p>  <p>  This is one of a number of changes outlined in the 2021 Review and will be implemented under the scheme from February 14, 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The 2021 Review of the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme for people who have borrowed from commercial private lending institutions is available on the Department's website under Publications: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/ed57b-2021-review-of-the-mortgage-to-rent-scheme-for-borrowers-of-commercial-private-lending-institutions\/<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500070#WRM02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":653,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500070#WRM02100"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[3426\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500070#WRM02200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of short-term let properties issued with warnings in relation to required change of use permissions cross tabulated with if the notice was complied with and the enforcement case closed by local authority in 2019, 2020 and 2021, in tabular form.","asker":"1488","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":655,"content":"<p>The information requested is provided in the two Tables below.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, with additional supports, including the provision of family supports, provided to families by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.<\/p><p>Supporting individuals and families facing homelessness is a key Government priority. <i>Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland<\/i>commits to working to eradicate homelessness by 2030 and provides detail on how the Government is approaching this as a priority.  It includes eighteen distinct actions on homelessness.  Two of these actions relate specifically to the provision of supports for families and children and in enabling their exit from homelessness.  There is a commitment to enhance family support and prevention and early intervention services for children and their families through a multi-agency and coordinated response, and the dissemination of innovative practice.  There is also a commitment to identify and provide enhanced tenancy sustainment supports to families experiencing long-term homelessness to help them exit from homelessness and maintain their homes.  These actions are being delivered with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Tusla.<\/p><p>In relation to the housing insecurity experienced by lone parents, in should be noted that local authorities are independent in the exercise of their functions and, as such, applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended. Lone parents are entitled to access all of the housing support delivery mechanisms on an equal basis with all other citizens.<\/p><p>However, the Government is determined to ensure that housing policy addresses the needs of those who experience social exclusion in our society by taking firm action. <i>Housing for All<\/i>contains a specific commitment to a Fresh Start principle which will be of assistance to lone parents who may wish to apply for affordable housing or a local authority home loan. <\/p><p>The increases in family homelessness seen in recent months are a serious concern for my Department and for the Government.

It places responsibility on local authorities to meet the accommodation needs of people in receipt of Rent Supplement for 18 months or longer, and who are assessed as having a long-term housing need. RAS has provided a more structured,  accommodation-based approach to the use of the private rented sector to meet long-term housing need, thereby eliminating dependence on temporary income support payments through Rent Supplement.

At the end of Quarter 3, 2021, there were 17,318 tenancies supported under RAS. <\/p>  <p>Legislation provides that both HAP and RAS are considered to be a form of social housing support. Households in receipt of HAP and RAS are therefore, not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list.

During Quarter 3 2021, 105 new construction schemes, (1,780 homes) were added to the pipeline. <\/p><p>To support Local Authorities in the delivery of affordable homes, the Affordable Housing Fund has replaced the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). The Fund has been open for applications from 1 September 2021. My Department has actively engaged with the Local Authorities to support and encourage them to develop and submit proposals. The homes that Local Authorities deliver under the Affordable Housing Fund will be sold at least 15% below open market value in respect of Affordable Purchase homes and in the order of 25% below open market value prices in respect of Cost Rental homes. <\/p><p>The delivery of Cost Rental homes is a key affordability measure under <i>Housing for All<\/i>, with State-backed rents that are in the order of 25% below what they would be on the private market. 65 cost rental homes have been tenanted to date, in developments in Balbriggan and Leixlip, and a further 1,580 cost rental homes are targeted for delivery in 2022.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Land Development Agency (LDA) has a key role in the delivery of affordable homes, including through &ldquo;Project Tosaigh&rdquo; aimed at accelerating the delivery of up to 5,000 homes. The first delivery stream of this LDA initiative to bring privately developed units to market affordably and quickly was launched on 12 November 2021. The LDA issued a call for Expressions of Interest for advance purchase agreements to developers, with a target scheme scale in excess of 150 units per development, in the Greater Dublin Area, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. The Expressions of Interest submitted are currently being assessed by the LDA with their priority focus and engagement being on schemes with potential delivery in 2022 and 2023.<\/p><p>Increased capacity of the public service to deliver, along with the streamlining of approval processes in relation to housing delivery are key priorities under <i>Housing for All<\/i>.

One of the ways the Government are trying to increase the supply of more affordable homes to rent under Housing for All is through the introduction of a new Cost Rental sector, the legislative framework for which was set out in the Affordable Housing Act last year. It is a long-term rental model, in which tenants only pay the cost of providing, managing and maintaining their homes.<\/p>  <p>We are committed to growing this sector, and through Approved Housing Bodies, Local Authorities, and the Land Development Agency under Project Tosaigh, approximately 1,500 Cost Rental homes are targeted for completion and tenanting this year alone. Overall, some 18,000 Cost Rental homes are targeted for completion under Housing for All to 2030.<\/p>  <p>The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to extend the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) until the end of 2024.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual local authorities. Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 sets out the purposes for which costs may be incurred by housing authorities in respect of the provision of homeless accommodation and related services.<\/p>  <p>  While responsibility for the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual housing authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis with a lead authority in place for each region.  A homelessness consultative forum has been established in each region in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.  Decisions on the range of emergency accommodation services and funding required in each region are a matter for individual housing authorities in consultation with the Management Group of the relevant regional joint Homelessness Consultative Forum. It is a matter for the management group of the consultative forum, in the first instance, to determine the homeless accommodation services required, the operation of such services and the funding required in each region.<\/p>  <p>Under Housing for All, the Government has committed to working to eradicate homelessness by 2030. The plan includes 18 distinct actions tailored to eliminate homelessness. These actions recognise that individuals experiencing homelessness have additional support needs and include specific measures to address these needs. These include measures to engage with and support rough sleepers into sustainable accommodation, the continued expansion of the Housing First programme, a focus on the construction and acquisition of one-bed homes, and, importantly, ensuring provision of the necessary health and mental health supports required to assist homeless people with complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  The new Housing First National Implementation Plan 2022-2026 was published in December 2021. Under the plan, an additional 1,319 supported tenancies are to be delivered over the next five years, with specific annual targets for each region now set out in the plan. <\/p>  <p>Increasing the supply of housing, particularly new build social and affordable homes, is a key priority of this Government.  Under Housing for All there are specific and costed plans to increase supply across all tenure types, including very significant commitments to social and affordable housing, with over 90,000 social homes and 36,000 affordable and 18,000 cost rental homes to be delivered by 2030. &euro;4 billion in capital is being invested annually on social and affordable housing.  This is the largest housing programme in the history of the State.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All specifically provides for the establishment of a National Homeless Action Committee.  The primary objective of the Committee is to bring together key Government Departments, agencies and stakeholders to oversee the implementation of the homeless inter-agency measures committed to under Housing for All and to ensure coherence and co-ordination of homeless related services in delivering policy measures and actions.  The first meeting took place on 20 December 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, new guidance was issued in December 2021 to local authorities on the preparation of local Homelessness Action Plans.

Despite pandemic-related disruptions throughout last year, the Passport Service issued over 634,000 passports in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals issued within one business day. The Passport Service expects a high level of demand for passports to continue throughout this year and has put several measures in place to meet this anticipated demand, including the assignment of additional staff.  <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports for children. These first time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants. In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis underpinning first time online passport applications, the processing time is 40 working days.<\/p>  <p>  The current passport processing times are:<\/p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals<\/p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals<\/p>  <p>  - 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online<\/p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service<\/p>  <p>  The aforementioned passport processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and relate to passport applications submitted to the Passport Service with required supporting documentation. When passport applicants do not provide all of the requisite documentation to the Passport Service, it takes much longer to process the application and issue a passport. Passport Service figures show that 45% of current applications are incomplete and the onus is on the applicant to submit the required documents to the Service. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. <\/p>  <p>  There are currently 30,000 first time child applications on hand with the Passport Service. Of these, almost 13,000 or 43% are incomplete applications that require additional documentation from the applicants&rsquo; guardians in order to complete the application and ensure that the child&rsquo;s passport can be issued.<\/p>  <p>  I urge parents of first time applicants to apply online for their children&rsquo;s passports in plenty of time, and all applicants to check the validity of passports before making flight bookings. The Emergency Passport service is available in cases of medical emergency or death of a family member abroad. <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants. Preparation is currently underway for several system and service improvements that will enhance the customer service experience and will improve processing times. In addition, my Department has been actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit additional permanent and temporary staff for assignment to the Passport Service. This recruitment drive has been underway since the last quarter of 2021 and will double the number of staff in the Passport Service from June 2021 levels. Over 180 additional staff are being assigned to the Passport Service in January alone and further staff will be assigned in February.  I am confident that the additional staff currently being assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce turnaround times and to respond to the current and anticipated high demand for first time and renewal passports in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500071#WRN04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"British-Irish Co-operation","counter":754,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500071#WRN04300"},{"type":"question","counter":755,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[3103\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500071#WRN04400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had recent contact with his British counterpart regarding the UK Nationality and Borders Bill 2021 which will impact on free movement in this country for persons without Irish or British citizenship; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":756,"content":"<p>We are closely monitoring the UK&rsquo;s Nationality and Borders Bill as it progresses through the legislative process in the British Parliament.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  The new first national training course for SNAs provided by UCD is now in place and aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. <\/p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.<\/p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department has been engaging in that process. <\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority and the Department's circular 36\/2020 and 51\/2019 sets out the current educational requirements for appointment as a Special Needs Assistant (SNA). In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. The Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and\/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.<\/p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, the Department is open to reviewing the position. However, the Department is not yet in a position to indicate when that review might take place but is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract proposed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement should be carried out and implemented first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500072#WRO04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Scoileanna L&aacute;n-Ghaeilge","counter":812,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500072#WRO04600"},{"type":"question","counter":813,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[2899\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500072#WRO04700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her Department has plans for an Irish language secondary school in the Swords, Malahide area of County Dublin (details supplied).","asker":"1467","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":814,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that new schools are established by my Department on the basis of identified demographic demand in an area. In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System, using data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent projections for the Swords and Malahide_Nevinstown school planning areas do not indicate a requirement for the establishment of a new post primary school.   <\/p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes.<\/p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:<\/p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  The New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) is an external independent advisory group which was set up in 2011 to advise the Minister on the patronage of new schools. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. <\/p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) provides objective information to parents in the relevant school planning areas to assist them in making an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction, i.e. Irish or English for a new school.   Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with other consideration such as the extent of diversity of provision currently available in these areas (including Irish-medium provision), are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process and to whether at post-primary level a school would take the form of an Irish-medium Gaelchol&aacute;iste or whether, if English-medium, the school would include an Irish-medium unit or &ldquo;Aonad&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  The other mechanism to establish an Irish-medium post-primary school is for a case to be made by the relevant school patron for an existing Aonad to transition to a standalone Gaelchol&aacute;iste.  Where an Aonad does not currently exist, a patron of a post-primary school, including those in Swords and Malahide areas, may make an application to the Department for the establishment of an Aonad in the post-primary school under its patronage.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the area to meet school place demand and will keep the requirements in Swords and Malahide_Nevinstown, as with all other school planning areas, under review. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500072#WRO04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":815,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500072#WRO04900"},{"type":"question","counter":816,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[2915\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500072#WRO05000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the new school building for a school (details supplied) in County Donegal; when the school will be completed and the children moved from the cold and damp prefabs into the new building; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":817,"content":"<p>The major building project referred to by the Deputy is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning, Stage 2(b) - Detailed Design, which includes the applications for Planning Permission, Fire Cert and Disability Access Cert and the preparation of tender documents.

As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a COVID-19 context.<\/p><p>The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools in 2020 and 2021, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.<\/p><p>My Department put a series of measures in place to assist schools in mitigating the impact of the school closures.  During the period of school closure, schools were required to implement a plan of action to enable continuity of learning for all pupils.  This involved teachers, including special education teachers, providing remote teaching and learning to all pupils in their class or on their caseload.<\/p><p>In September of 2021, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) published revised arrangements for the completion of Classroom Based Assessments for students in 3rd year in 2021\/2022 (cohort of students 2019 &ndash; 2022). These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 and 2020\/21 school year.

Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle. <\/p>  <p>The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships&rsquo;  .<\/p>  <p>  In April 2018, the then Minister for Education and Skills asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to undertake a major review of RSE in schools across all stages of education to ensure that it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The NCCA was asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum. These included but were not limited to consent; developments in relation to contraception; healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet and social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. <\/p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE\/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPE\/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today. These resources cover all topics including many of the topics that have been raised in the media during recent days as important for young people's education - there are resources to help teachers in teaching about rights and responsibilities in relationships, how to recognise healthy, unhealthy and abusive relationship, how to interact safely and respectfully (both online and face-to-face), the influence of the media (including pornography) on young people's understanding and expectations, sexual consent and assertive communication.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA Toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these and other related topics within the SPHE classroom. The Toolkit provides practical help designed to deepen teachers' understanding and skills so that they feel more confident in addressing important and sensitive topics.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.

Updated specifications for primary and senior cycle will follow immediately afterwards. <\/p>  <p>  In redeveloping the SPHE curriculum, the NCCA will be making explicit the importance of fostering young people's self-awareness and self-esteem and building the foundational skills and dispositions needed for building caring and healthy relationships (including respectful communication, showing empathy, appreciating difference). The new specifications will also foster skills needed for dealing with challenging times. Consent education will be included within the learning outcomes for RSE, across all levels, based on the principle that consent is a core dimension of all healthy interpersonal relationships. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500073#WRP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":837,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500073#WRP02000"},{"type":"question","counter":838,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[2962\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500073#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if provisions will be put in place for students who may be unable to sit their mock examinations and State examinations due to having been deemed a close contact.","asker":"1612","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":839,"content":"<p>As part of the arrangements being put in place for the 2022 state examinations, I announced that an alternative set of Leaving Certificate examinations would be run in 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018.  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  The new first national training course for SNAs provided by UCD now in place aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. <\/p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.<\/p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department has been engaging in that process. <\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority and the Department's circular 36\/2020 and 51\/2019 sets out the current educational requirements for appointment as a Special Needs Assistant (SNA). In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. The Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and\/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.<\/p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, the Department is open to reviewing the position. However, the Department is not yet in a position to indicate when that review might take place but is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract proposed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement should be carried out and implemented first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500073#WRP02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Facilities","counter":846,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500073#WRP02900"},{"type":"question","counter":847,"qnumday":369,"qnumall":"[3011\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500073#WRP03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of primary schools with designated ASD units in Cork city and county that are accepting enrolment for September 2022; the locations of same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":848,"content":"<p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government.  <\/p><p>This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. <\/p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. <\/p><p>There are currently a network of 357 special classes in Cork of which 309 are special classes for children with autism.

In the first term of the current school year, the Inspectorate conducted over 500 incidental inspections in primary schools, special schools and post-primary schools. Those inspections included a focus on how schools prevent and tackle bullying through promoting a positive school climate and culture.  This will help inform the review of the Action plan and review of the anti-bullying procedures by providing evidence of the type of bullying that is occurring in our schools and examples of approaches that can be successful in dealing with it. An important part of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s work is a focus on the priority actions of schools in relation to promoting a positive school culture and climate.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently extensive training and curricular supports, including through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and the Webwise Programme, to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet and on the prevention of bullying including cyber-bullying. <\/p>  <p>  The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA in December, 2019. The NCCA was asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum. These included but were not limited to consent; developments in relation to contraception; healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet and social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters.<\/p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE\/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPE\/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today. These resources cover all topics including many of the topics that have been raised in the media during recent days as important for young people's education  - there are resources to help teachers in teaching about rights and responsibilities in relationships, how to recognise healthy, unhealthy and abusive relationship, how to interact safely and respectfully (both online and face-to-face), the influence of the media (including pornography) on young people's understanding and expectations, sexual consent and assertive communication.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA Toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these and other related topics within the SPHE classroom. The Toolkit provides practical help designed to deepen teachers' understanding and skills so that they feel more confident in addressing important and sensitive topics.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  It is expected that a revised Junior Cycle specification will be completed by the end of 2022, following a period of public consultation. Updated specifications for primary and senior cycle will follow immediately afterwards. <\/p>  <p>  In redeveloping the SPHE curriculum, the NCCA will be making explicit the importance of fostering young people's self-awareness and self-esteem and building the foundational skills and dispositions needed for building caring and healthy relationships (including respectful communication, showing empathy, appreciating difference).

Covid-19 related absences arising from pupils\/students who have been requested to self-isolate by a medical professional or for pupils\/students who feel unwell with symptoms consistent with Covid-19 must be recorded in accordance with the school&rsquo;s normal procedures for the notification and recording of absences. However these Covid-19 related absences should be noted by the school as explained absences. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the current Covid-19 related environment that schools are now operating in, the statutory requirements for reporting pupil absenteeism will continue as normal. In this respect, the Education (Welfare) Act requires the principal of a recognised school to maintain records of the attendance or non-attendance on each school day of each pupil registered at that school.  Schools maintain a school register and a school roll. The purpose of the school register is to preserve a permanent record of the school history of each pupil\/student.  The purpose of the school roll is to record the daily and cumulative attendance of individual pupils\/students.  A pupils\/students name will be recorded as removed from the school roll following an absence of 20 consecutive days.  This is in accordance with the requirements of Department Circular 0028\/2013.  <\/p>  <p>  The decision to home school means that parents are effectively removing their children from school and the school will have no further role in their children&rsquo;s teaching and learning for the duration of the home schooling.  The decision to home school may also have implications for the children&rsquo;s school place should parents wish for their children to return to school at a later date. <\/p>  <p>  Where a child is removed from school for the purpose of home schooling, the pupil\/student&rsquo;s name will be recorded as removed from the school roll following 20 consecutive absences.  In addition schools are required under the Education Welfare Act 2000 to also notify the Education Welfare Service of Tusla when the aggregate number of school days on which a pupil is absent during a school year reaches 20 days.  The pupil\/student&rsquo;s education record remains on the school register and the only change that occurs is that the status of the pupil\/student&rsquo;s education record is updated to reflect the fact that the pupil has left the school.  Decisions therefore in relation to educating children outside of school are best made in consultation with the child&rsquo;s school and Tusla&rsquo;s Education Support Service (TESS). <\/p>  <p>  The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 section 14 sets out that Tusla is required to maintain a register of all children in receipt of education in a place other than a recognised school.  The provisions of the Act outline that, where a parent chooses to educate, or have educated, his or her child in a place other than a recognised school he or she shall apply to Tusla to have the child concerned registered on the register.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500074#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":878,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[3205\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500074#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that whilst provision is in place for children who are high-risk to be home-schooled there is no provision for parents who are deemed high-risk and who are in contact with each person their child is being exposed to; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1510","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":879,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[3392\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500074#WRQ00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the arrangements in place for students who cannot attend school due to the fact that they are immunocompromised or live with a person who is immunocompromised; the remote learning options available in this instance; the guidance for parents and staff; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":880,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 379 and 387 together.<\/p>  <p>My Department has always been guided by public health advice in relation to appropriate Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in place in schools.  These measures protect students\/pupils, their parents and school staff and are very effective when adhered to. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has issued specific advice about children attending school in the context of Covid-19.  This advice covers both children with underlying medical conditions and children living with family members with underlying conditions.  For all children, care should continue to be taken to reduce transmission through the infection control measures promoted by HPSC.<\/p>  <p>  The HPSC advice provides that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; categories can attend school and it is important for the child&rsquo;s overall well-being. This is consistent with public health advice internationally in relation to at-risk family members. The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus, through regular hand washing, etc. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the provision of education for children who are extremely vulnerable to Covid-19, my Department has published guidance in relation to students who have been medically certified as being at very high risk from Covid-19. As that guidance indicates, it is the responsibility of parents\/guardians to seek medical advice and certification to indicate if their child is at very high risk to Covid-19 and to inform the school of this. Where a school receives such medical certification, it will organise the most appropriate support for the student concerned.  The guidance sets out a number of options for schools to facilitate adapted education provision for students at very high risk to Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  The wellbeing of all students is a fundamental element of my Department&rsquo;s overall plan in sustaining the safe and effective operation of schools as we continue to manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  In this context the National Psychological Service of the Department (NEPS) is leading on supporting the wellbeing of schools communities. The response to support the wellbeing of all within school communities on the return to school requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate, largely preventative and proactive.  This requires a whole-school team approach to planning in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  The Department&rsquo;s response is aligned with the HSE guidance and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500074#WRQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":881,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500074#WRQ00900"},{"type":"question","counter":882,"qnumday":380,"qnumall":"[3254\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500074#WRQ01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of times she has met her officials in relation to a project (details supplied); and if there is a definitive timeline established for construction.","asker":"1514","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":883,"content":"<p>The school building project referred to by the Deputy is being delivered under my Department&rsquo;s Design and Build Programme.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. The review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  The new first national training course for SNAs provided by UCD now in place aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. <\/p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.<\/p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department has been engaging in that process. <\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority and the Department's circular 36\/2020 and 51\/2019 sets out the current educational requirements for appointment as a Special Needs Assistant (SNA). In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed.

Age related rates for young Jobseekers Allowance recipients were introduced on a phased basis from 2009 to tackle high youth unemployment and avoid long term welfare dependency.  Where a young jobseeker participates in approved full-time education or training they will receive the maximum rate of payment. <\/p>  <p>  Age related Jobseeker's Allowance rates do not apply those with qualifying child dependents, who were in care of the Tusla immediately before they turned 18 or who are living independently of the family home and are in receipt of qualifying state housing supports.  The age related rates do not apply to the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit scheme which is a short term social insurance income support subject to an individual&rsquo;s PRSI record.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to Covid-19, the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate for 2019 averaged approximately 12.5 percent.  Following the onset of the pandemic, the CSO&rsquo;s \"COVID-19 adjusted\" monthly youth unemployment rate, which includes all those in receipt of the PUP, increased dramatically, peaking at almost 70 percent in May 2020.  According to the latest data from the CSO, the \"COVID-19 adjusted\" youth unemployment rate for December 2021 was 11.4 percent while the standard youth unemployment rate for December 2021 was 9 percent. <\/p>  <p>  There has been a slight increase in jobseeker numbers since the announcement of new health restrictions on December 7th, to limit the spread of the omicron variant.  As of January 14th under 25s account for 14 percent of PUP recipients and 10 percent of Live Register recipients.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s national employment strategy, Pathways to Work, launched last July, includes targeted measures aimed at young unemployed people who have been disproportionately impacted by Covid 19.  It also contains education, training and other supports for those who lost employment pre pandemic and those young people seeking their first job.  <\/p>  <p>  A key initiative of the strategy is the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) which is available on a voluntary basis and provides qualify work experience for people, including young people, who have been unemployed for 6 months or more.  Participants on the WPEP receive &euro;311 per week. <\/p>  <p>  The Pathways to Work strategy contains provision for 50,000 additional further education and training places and the allocation of at least 1,000 out of the 3,000 new Community Employment and T&uacute;s places for young people.

Within 3 weeks of the payment being launched over 500,000 people had been paid.  The delivery of the scheme on such a scale and in such a short time represented a major achievement by my Department. <\/p>  <p>  To date, over 870,000 people have received payment under the scheme at a cost of &euro;9 billion and over 28 million payments have issued.<\/p>  <p>  My Department always has to strike a balance between applying tight controls and checks on claims on the one hand and not frustrating a person&rsquo;s entitlement to a payment on the other.  Throughout the Covid crisis, my Department has prioritised prompt claim processing and payment in order to ensure that people affected by the pandemic had the security of an income support payment.  This was necessary and appropriate in light of the circumstances prevailing at the time.  In addition, while prioritising prompt payment in the circumstances of the pandemic, payment and claim processing controls were applied to reduce the risk of incorrect or fraudulent payments.  Inevitably, some people will have sought to take advantage of the scheme, but most people, as would be expected, acted honourably and honestly. <\/p>  <p>  As part of its ongoing review and examination of operating processes designed to inform how controls can be improved, my Department&rsquo;s Internal Audit Unit conducted an examination of the controls in place over the PUP scheme in 2020.  The report concluded that the controls in place to assure the integrity of PUP payments were adequate, appropriate, and effective to provide reasonable assurance that risks were being managed and objectives should be met. <\/p>  <p>  The audit included an examination of a random selection of 100 claims from a claim load dated 9 August 2020.  The examination showed that 17 out of the 100 claims did not indicate an entitlement for the full duration that they received PUP.  These included claims correctly awarded but not stopped on time by the customer when they returned to work.  This resulted in short periods of overlap between receipt of PUP and employment.  Of the 17 cases, 14 were closed at the date of the audit report; of these, 5 had been stopped as a result of the controls in place and the remaining 9 were stopped by the customer.  Overpayments were therefore detected in 3 live cases (or 3%) out of the 100 cases examined. <\/p>  <p>  The Internal Audit report recommended that that control review activity should continue, using the various means in place, including analytical tools and risk-based analysis.  The recommendations were accepted by the Department, with a number of specific control projects undertaken as a result.  These projects were in addition to the on-going control activity of the Department. <\/p>  <p>  My Department follows up on all cases where it is identified that a person has been overpaid PUP and takes a reasonable approach to recovery of sums overpaid where these overpayments are believed to be due to genuine error or oversight by the claimant. <\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where fraud is suspected the Department will seek to prosecute the people involved; a number of prosecutions have been initiated and convictions secured.  More cases are being considered for prosecution.<\/p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500076#WRS04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Eligibility","counter":1023,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500076#WRS04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1024,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[3114\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500076#WRS04900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to cases in which medically vulnerable persons who have completed the period of entitlement to illness benefit but although medically fit to work, would be exposed to unacceptable risk while Covid-19 remains a significant threat and who are unable to obtain income support such as a case (details supplied).","asker":"1549","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1025,"content":"<p>Subject to satisfying certain PRSI contribution criteria, Illness Benefit may be paid to those who are certified as medically unfit to attend work.

Part-time courses are not eligible for support under the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  However, part-time students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  Students can be assisted towards costs such as rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books\/class materials. Students on full or part-time courses leading to a higher education award (NQF level 6-10) in the universities, institutes of technology and other approved colleges can apply for the SAF. The core allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million per annum which is expected to support circa 14,000 students. This includes &euro;1 million which was added to the fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups. Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. I have approved the allocation of an additional &euro;8.1m from the Return to Education 2021 funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation.  Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.  <\/p>  <p>  Also, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from the student&rsquo;s local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of a person re-educating, Springboard+ is a specific initiative that strategically targets funding of free part-time higher education courses to enable unemployed people, returners (formerly referred to as homemakers) and those in employment to upskill or reskill in areas where there are identified labour market skills shortages or employment opportunities. The courses, which are at Level 6 (Higher Certificate) to Level 9 (Master's Degree) on the National Framework of Qualifications, are being delivered in public and private higher education providers around the country. Further information may be obtained from the website springboardcourses.ie\/.<\/p>  <p>  A very important commitment in the Programme for Government was the review of the Student Grant Scheme, this review will help shape decision-making on how we support students over the years to come. Following a procurement process, the review has been undertaken by Indecon Economic Consultants, under the guidance of a steering group which has included student and sectoral representatives.  <\/p>  <p>  There was significant public interest in the Review, with around 280 submissions.  A very welcome feature of the process was engagement with students, and I understand that over 9,000 survey responses were received from students across the country. This strong element of public engagement, in addition to the economic work undertaken by the consultants, should provide a solid evidence basis for the recommendations of the review. <\/p>  <p>  The draft report was submitted to me in late December 2021.  Given the inter-connectivity between strategic student support issues and other reform priorities (e.g. the expansion of supports to part-time and blended learners as an enabler of lifelong learning or enhanced postgraduate supports as an enabler to equality, diversity and inclusion in the R&amp;I system) it is now my intention to bring the report to Cabinet shortly alongside the Future Funding Model report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500079#WRV00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","counter":1139,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500079#WRV00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1140,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[2960\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500079#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to date to develop and or introduce a gender-focused sexual education awareness campaign in the higher education sector.","asker":"1489","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1141,"content":"<p>Tackling sexual violence and harassment in our tertiary education system is and will remain, a key policy focus for me and my Department. Since I have been appointed, we have made some important changes. In August 2020, I wrote to all publicly funded HEIs outlining my commitment to tackling sexual violence and harassment in higher education and requesting a number of actions in this area, including the development of institutional action plans on tackling sexual violence and harassment. In this regard, I have been advised that all publicly-funded HEIs now have such action plans in place. I have also expanded the remit of the HEA&rsquo;s Centre of Excellence for Gender Equality to cover all areas of equality, diversity and inclusion, as well as oversight of the implementation of the Framework for Consent in HEIs. <\/p>  <p>  As part of monitoring requirements, the HEA requires that institutions, in respect of both staff and students, report progress on implementation of the Framework for Consent in HEIs on an annual basis. The annual HEI progress report on implementation of the Framework for Consent in HEIs addresses specific indicators related to the 15 Framework Outcomes. In addition to this, the HEI Annual Governance Statements submitted to the HEA require a statement confirming that an institution has an action plan in place to support the achievement of the objectives of the Framework for Promoting Consent and Preventing Sexual Violence in Higher Education and that this action plan is being implemented. <\/p>  <p>  The Framework aims to ensure the creation of an institutional campus culture which is safe, respectful and supportive. Institutions have a duty of care to their students and staff, and a responsibility to foster a campus culture that is clear in the condemnation of unwanted and unacceptable behaviours. The Framework outlined a number of aims for HEIs, students, staff and for the HEA and\/or my Department. To assist institutions with implementation of the Framework, funding of over &euro;400,000 has been allocated by my Department to a number of initiatives since its launch. These initiatives have mainly focused on training, education and awareness raising initiatives. The HEA has allocated further funding of over &euro;500,000 towards consent workshops, the development of the anonymous report and support tool, and the UCC Bystander intervention programme. <\/p>  <p>  Since the academic year 2020\/2021, the HEA&rsquo;s National Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion has worked with HEIs and the sectoral representative bodies to ensure the national, sectoral and local roll out of: <\/p>  <p>  -  Online consent training for all incoming students; <\/p>  <p>  -  Online bystander intervention training for all incoming students; <\/p>  <p>  -  An anonymous report and support tool for issues of bullying, harassment, and sexual harassment; and <\/p>  <p>  -  The national Unmute Consent awareness raising campaign <\/p>  <p>  There are two key actions in the Framework for Consent that focus on sexual education awareness: <\/p>  <p>  -  HEIs will provide direct student-facing activities including workshop\/classes that promote an understanding of consent; student understanding and skills for speaking up and calling out unacceptable behaviour; and <\/p>  <p>  -  Ongoing messaging to disseminate information consistent with the Framework aims for cultural change and awareness. <\/p>  <p>  In progress updates submitted to the HEA in late 2021, all HEIs reported that these actions are either complete or in progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500079#WRV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Mobility","counter":1142,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500079#WRV00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1143,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[3468\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500079#WRV00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department is currently undertaking a review of student mobility on the island of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1144,"content":"<p>I have been concerned at the pattern of student flows between Ireland and Northern Ireland, particularly in recent times.

First time registrations outside of the Dublin area are processed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) through the Garda Station network and securing of those appointments with GNIB are a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  The Registration Office of my Department registers permissions for those residing in the Dublin area.<\/p>  <p>  Since the onset of the pandemic, immigration permissions have been extended nine times, which means that people who held a valid permission to be in the State in March 2020 are legally permitted to remain until 31 May 2022.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the unavoidable delays created from closures and the reduced capacity of the Registration Office during Covid-19 restrictions , a high number of customers are now coming forward to seek an appointment. When the office is open, 50% of normal capacity or 200 first time registration appointments are permitted every day. This is the maximum allowed under current public health guidelines, which are strictly adhered to for the safety of all staff and customers alike.<\/p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to meet the current unprecedented demand for first-time registration appointments, on 10 January 2022, a Freephone service (0800 741 741) was introduced for customers. It is currently operating 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday (8am to 8pm) and 8 hours a day on Saturday and Sunday (9am to 5pm). <\/p>  <p>  Due to significant customer demand and the initial high volume of calls, some customers have unfortunately experienced delays or difficulties in connecting to the phone service. This situation has improved on a daily basis and, by the end of last week, the average customer waiting time was 8 minutes. Currently, there are between 15 and 20 customer service representatives taking calls and making appointments.<\/p>  <p>  All appointments for customers to register their immigration permission are now issued through this service, with operators offering one appointment per call, unless it is for an identifiable family group. As of today, 25 January, some 6,269 customer appointments have been allocated and registration will take place as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  This service, which is being paid for by my Department and was initiated as a pilot, is designed to improve customers' access to the available appointments. Due to measures taken by the service since it was initiated, it is also working to minimise to the greatest extent possible the practice by some parties of block booking appointments for sale, which has caused extensive problems for both the Department's customers and for my Department itself.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department strongly advises against the practice of providing sensitive and personal data to unregulated and unknown third parties.  <\/p>  <p>  The Registration Office&rsquo;s customer service team is available to support customers who may have language difficulties or may need assistance with translation.

While the act of stalking itself is already covered by existing law, I will propose changes to make the law clearer and stronger:<\/p><p>- Explicitly reference stalking as a criminal offence <\/p><p>- Make it clear that stalking includes watching or following a victim, even where they are not aware of being watched or followed<\/p><p>- Make it clear that impersonating the victim, and then communicating with a third party, is illegal<\/p><p>- Update the law to ensure that it covers all forms of modern communications <\/p><p>- I will also consider introducing a provision to allow a victim, in very serious cases, apply to the court for an order to prevent the alleged perpetrator from communicating with them in advance of a trial.  <\/p><p>Separately, non-fatal strangulation is already an offence prosecutable under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997. However, I believe that creating a new, standalone offence should encourage victims to come forward and report what has happened to them. It has been shown that this crime can be an indication of future, lethal violence and is a risk factor for homicides against women in the home.<\/p><p>In the summer, I will publish a new Hate Crime Bill which will introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender. This will mean that certain types of crimes can be prosecuted as hate crimes where they are motivated by misogyny.<\/p><p>For other crimes, where there isn&rsquo;t a dedicated hate-aggravated offence, the new legislation will require the court to take misogyny into account where there is evidence that this was the motivation, to reflect that fact in the sentence, and to reflect the fact that the crime was aggravated by this form of prejudice in the formal record. The aggravated offences will generally carry an enhanced penalty, compared to the ordinary form of the offence, and the record of any conviction for such an offence would clearly state that the offence was a hate crime.<\/p><p>Before the end of September, I will publish a new Sexual Offences Bill, which will introduce important changes including:<\/p><p>- Extending victim anonymity to further categories of victims<\/p><p>- Repealing provisions for sentences to be delivered in public<\/p><p>- Legal representation for victims <\/p><p>Separately, I will seek to enact the Sex Offenders Bill within months which will strengthen the management and monitoring of sex offenders in the community.<\/p><p>I will shortly sign an order to bring into operation the Criminal Procedure Act 2021. This Act provides for the use of preliminary trial hearings which will significantly improve the trial process for victims of sexual offences, including by reducing delay and disruption that might re-traumatise victims. They will also allow for sensitive issues to be addressed before the trial starts, such as questioning a victim about their sexual history.<\/p><p>Education and awareness raising are also part of the Government&rsquo;s fight against sexual and gender-based violence. Over the past number of years, the Department of Justice have been working to raise awareness generally about how we, as a society, need to stop excusing unacceptable behaviour. <\/p><p>The No Excuses campaign highlights this determination to challenge people and the culture, prejudice and values that allow any form of sexual harassment or sexual violence.

These services provide important information and support, including emotional support, court accompaniment, and accompaniment to Garda interviews, to sexual assault treatment units and referral to other services.<\/p><p>Under this scheme, organisations that provide support to victims of sexual crime, such as Rape Crisis Centres, can apply to receive funding. I should also say that many of the other organisations who receive funding from the Victims of Crime fund, such as Women&rsquo;s Aid and the Crime Victims Helpline, also provide support to victims of sexual violence, even if that is not their primary remit.<\/p><p>Our commitment in this area is reflected in the additional funding that has been secured by my Department under Budget 2022 with a total of &euro;4.9m allocated to Victims of Crime. This includes the retention of emergency COVID-19 funding of &euro;400,000 to address the impact of the pandemic on support services and an additional &euro;785,000 in direct supports to NGOs and for specific domestic violence intervention programmes. This will be important to ensure the momentum gained in supporting victims of domestic and sexual violence throughout the pandemic continues to grow.<\/p><p>As part of the implementation of <i>Supporting a Victims Journey<\/i>, we carried out a review of the supports and funding of civil society organisations providing frontline services to identify where gaps exist. At the end of last year, I announced an additional &euro;445,000 in funding for 18 organisations to bridge the gaps identified. One outcome of this is that court accompaniment services will now be available to all victims regardless of their location. <\/p><p><i>Supporting a Victims Journey <\/i>is a detailed roadmap for giving full effect to the O&rsquo;Malley recommendations. It includes a commitment to provide for preliminary trial hearings and the recently enacted Criminal Procedure Act delivers on that commitment. This legislation introduces key changes to how questioning on prior sexual history will unfold at trial. Other than in exceptional circumstances, the Act requires an application to question a victim on their prior sexual history to be made at a preliminary trial hearing, before the commencement of the trial. This will be of great help to victims in removing uncertainty around what they may face.<\/p><p>The implementation of<i>Supporting a Victim's Journey<\/i>will also ensure the victim's right to have the same legal representation at the preliminary trial hearing and during the trial itself if an application to question them about prior sexual history is made at the preliminary trial hearing and is granted.  In such a case, the recommendations also require the Legal Aid Board to endeavour to ensure that the victim is represented by counsel of a level of seniority similar to counsel representing the prosecution and defence.<\/p><p>The victim will also be entitled to their own, dedicated legal advice and support throughout the process (not just during the court case) and will be entitled to legal aid for this purpose.  <\/p><p>Under Budget 2022, I have secured an additional &euro;1.1m to be used to begin putting in place a legal advice and legal aid service in court for victims of sexual violence.  My Department will examine any recommendations or applications that are submitted when the work being led by the Rape Crisis Network is complete, in particular what the rationale may be for discontinuing the existing volunteer-led service and whether this idea commands support across the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500080#WRW02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Statistics Office","counter":1211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500080#WRW02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1212,"qnumday":492,"qnumall":"[3166\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500080#WRW02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will work with the Central Statistics Office to develop a national sexual violence survey and ensure that this is carried out regularly; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1213,"content":"<p>This Government is committed to preventing and addressing sexual violence in Ireland.

As part of the first phase of the review, I announced a public consultation (www.gov.ie\/topreview) on the operation of the Act. <\/p>  <p>  As I stated during my appearance before the Joint Committee on Health on 8 December, it is my intention to appoint an independent Chair to lead the second phase of the review of the operation of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018. <\/p>  <p>  As the costs involved in contracting an independent Chair to conduct the review were estimated as exceeding &euro;25,000, the legal advice I received was that the Department was obliged under procurement rules to tender for the appointment. <\/p>  <p>  The tender process is currently in train. Given the expertise required for the position, a small number of candidates, identified as having suitable experience, were contacted and invited to apply for the role of independent Chair. It is my intention that the appointment will be made as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions regarding a group to support the review of the operation of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 will be held with the independent Chair once an appointment has been made, so that he\/she may have an input into its composition. I expect that the Chair appointed will also have an input into the terms of reference for the review, and any necessary clarifications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500084#WRAA03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1443,"content":"<p>Question No. 568 answered with Question No. 567.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1444,"content":"<p>Question No. 569 answered with Question No. 567.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1445,"content":"<p>Question No. 570 answered with Question No. 567.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":1446,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500084#WRAA04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1447,"qnumday":571,"qnumall":"[3068\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500084#WRAA04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the percentage of general practitioner hours that are spent working in cosmetic clinics nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1448,"content":"<p>GPs are private contractors, most of whom hold contracts with the HSE for the provision of medical services such as contracts under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme for the provision of medical services without charge to patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p><p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p><p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p><p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p><p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p><p>The programme for the academic year 2020\/2021 was paused during the first few months of 2021 due to school closures and redeployment of staff to the COVID-19 immunisation programme. The inputting of uptake information for the schools-based programme was also delayed due to redeployment of administrative staff. The HSE has advised that the Schools Immunisation Programme 2020\/2021 (of which the HPV programme is included) has been completed across the country. This means that all those who were eligible to receive the HPV vaccine have now been been offered it.<\/p><p>  The current recorded uptake rate for the first dose of the HPV vaccine, in the 2020\/2021 academic year, is 76%. The current recorded uptake rate for the second dose of the HPV vaccine in this academic year is 65%. It should be noted that some areas are yet to input some, or all, of their data for both dose 1 and 2 so these figures are expected to increase.<\/p><p>My Department has asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:  <\/p><p>- girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and <\/p><p>- women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.<\/p><p>If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500087#WRDD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":1583,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500087#WRDD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1584,"qnumday":620,"qnumall":"[3366\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500087#WRDD02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the breakdown of the cost to the Exchequer of ShannonDoc services in County Clare between 2017 and 2021, inclusive in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1585,"qnumday":621,"qnumall":"[3367\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500087#WRDD02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of hours provided at each of the locations in County Clare in which ShannonDoc services operate in each of the years 2017 to 2021, in tabular form.","asker":"1520","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1586,"qnumday":622,"qnumall":"[3368\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500087#WRDD02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the level of demand, that is, appointments sought and scheduled by each of the locations in County Clare in which ShannonDoc services operate in each of the years 2017 to 2021, in tabular form.","asker":"1520","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1587,"qnumday":623,"qnumall":"[3369\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500087#WRDD02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the breakdown of in-person home visits and virtual consultations provided through each of the locations County Clare in which ShannonDoc services operate in each of the years 2017 to 2021, in tabular form.","asker":"1520","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1588,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 620 to 623, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>GP out-of-hours service providers are private organisations that are partially funded by the HSE.

In accordance with the target&rsquo;s set out in the Climate Action Plan, the Government will continue to promote afforestation to increase planting to a rate consistent with realising our 2030 climate ambition and to contribute to achieving carbon neutrality no later than 2050.  <\/p>  <p>  To achieve this, my Department fully recognises the need for afforestation to be complimentary to CAP.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the CAP Strategic Plan (CSP) tree planting actions have been included in both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2. The new Eco-Scheme (Pillar 1) includes a tree planting option as part of the menu of options that farmers can choose from. The Pillar II Agri-Environment Climate Measure (AECM) includes significant tree planting actions for specific objectives, such as riparian buffers for water quality, in belts for ammonia capture near the farmyard or in rows, groups or as parkland.  In addition, the AECM actions also include a farm sustainability review in which farmers can discuss a plan for their whole farm, including the identification of areas suitable for tree planting. In cases where farmers show an interest in planting trees on an area exceeding 0.1ha, the individual farmer will be encouraged to consider entering the afforestation scheme under the National Forestry Programme.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to point out that it is my objective to increase and encourage interest in small scale planting by removing the licensing requirement for areas not greater than one hectare, which may prove to be a barrier to such planting and be considered onerous and complex. Such an exemption would be available as part of a scheme which my Department intends to design and implement once the required legislative change is in place; the required amendment to the Forestry Act 2014, is currently moving through the Houses of the Oireachtas through the vehicle of the Animal Health and Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500090#WRGG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":1748,"qnumday":676,"qnumall":"[2902\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500090#WRGG03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the real inflation adjusted increase or decrease in the afforestation grant for all global product classification categories for each year from 2000 to date in 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1749,"content":"<p>The current national Forestry Programme 2014-2020 (extended to end 2022) provides significant supports for afforestation and includes 12 different Grant and Premium Categories (GPC) to promote a good species mix and covers 100% of the cost of establishing a forest. <\/p><p>Grant payments are made on a flat rate per hectare basis.

They cover areas such as support to victims of domestic abuse\/violence, support to vulnerable young people who are at greater risk of domestic violence, working with domestic violence groups to deliver supports and workshops.  Some examples are outlined below.<blockquote>In Cavan they have included an action in the 2022 plan that aims to support and resource disadvantaged communities and marginalised target groups to engage with relevant local and national service providers and relevant stakeholders in identifying and addressing social exclusion and equality issues. One specific element of this action aims to focus on planning around the provision of supports to victims of domestic violence.<br \/><br \/>In Bray, Co Wicklow, the Local Development Company is focused on supporting the local community centre where an emerging issue arising from COVID-19 has been increased incidence of people presenting to the centres as a result of domestic violence. A need has been identified in collaboration with Bray Women&rsquo;s Refuge to provide outreach services in the centre. The Domestic Violence Programme will provide monthly outreach clinics in the Resource Centres in partnership with Bray Women&rsquo;s Refuge.<br \/><br \/>In Cork, Kanturk, Newmarket &amp;amp; Millstreet an action has been included in the 2022 annual plan that focuses on the wider issue of the gender gap and includes a focus on domestic violence as part of the action. Although society has come a long way, there is still an extensive gender gap in relation to pay, pensions and equality. Because of this, women continue to be at a risk of suffering from disadvantage and poverty. The Duhallow Women&rsquo;s Forum is comprised of representatives from the ICA, Duhallow Carers, Women&rsquo;s Access Group, Domestic Violence, Community Childcare Facilities and Parent and Toddler Groups.

The role is intended to act as a single point of contact between telecoms operators and local authorities, between the local authority and members of the public and internally, between local authority business units. My department co-funds the employment costs of Broadband Officers. Broadband Officers have made a significant impact on the provision of telecoms services in the state, particularly in rural and under-served areas. <\/p>  <p>  As a national network, the Broadband Officers' Telecommunications Action Group (TAG) meets 10 times a year to discuss national, regional and sectoral developments, and to exchange information, experiences and ideas. TAG meetings are arranged by my department and are attended by Broadband Officers and their local authority colleagues, officials from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and representatives of telecoms companies involved in current projects - for example, NBI (National Broadband Plan) and Vodafone Ireland (Broadband Connection Point initiative) are regular attendees.<\/p>  <p>  Guest speakers are invited to present to Broadband Officers, including telecoms providers. These have, over the years, included satellite services providers, including at the most recent TAG meeting on 20 January 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The department has not made an introduction between the local authority broadband officer and a satellite provider in respect to the address provided. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has responsibility for telecoms policy, regulation and implementation. Notwithstanding this, officials at my department work closely with the Tipperary Broadband Officer on a number of innovative solutions to connectivity issues, including the Broadband Connection Point (BCP) initiative and the National Hub Network (connectedhubs.ie). Tipperary currently has 16 live BCPs and 4 more planned for completion soon.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there are two Broadband Connection Points within 11km of the address provided, both of which are live and operational and ready to use. These are publicly accessible sites for onsite community use. Locations of all live and planned BCPs may be found at www.myconnectedcommunity.ie  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the options available to those living in areas with poor connectivity, I would advise in the first instance that contact is made with the local authority Broadband Officer. The Broadband Officers in each of the local authority areas have excellent knowledge of the infrastructure and services available and can, if necessary, escalate issues to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500092#WRJJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Staff","counter":1853,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500092#WRJJ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1854,"qnumday":713,"qnumall":"[3972\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012500092#WRJJ03600","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the number of civilian and Garda ministerial drivers in her current corps of drivers; the breakdown of the civilian versus Garda drivers; and the total costs, including salaries, maintenance, fuel and so on incurred by the driver corps in 2020 and 2021.","asker":"1489","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1855,"content":"<p>The appointment of civilian drivers in my Department is made in line with the &ldquo;Instructions to HR Managers on Ministerial Appointments for the 33<sup>rd<\/sup>D&aacute;il&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Guidelines on the Staffing of Ministerial Offices for the 33<sup>rd<\/sup>D&aacute;il&rsquo;&rsquo;.<\/p><p>Ministers and Ministers of State may appoint 2 civilian drivers.
