At its most basic level, this can be categorised as trained or untrained personnel. Untrained personnel are those that do not complete their initial training for example General Service recruits or 2 Star Privates or Cadets. On average 22% of General Service Recruits do not complete their training. <\/p>  <p>  The number of trained personnel departing can vary year-on-year with\u00a0significant differences\u00a0not being unusual. The long run departure average for\u00a0trained personnel is approximately 500 per annum. Departures of trained personnel in 2011 and 2012 exceeded 600 each year reaching a high of 677 in 2012. Departures in 2013 and 2014 were below 400 each year, reaching a low of 356 in 2014.

As I have previously outlined, particular challenges exist in certain specialist areas, for example pilots. I understand that this has proved challenging for many military forces internationally and it is not unique to Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  There are a range of factors that influence a person's decision to remain in the Defence Forces. \u00a0 These include career progression opportunities, pay, personal development opportunities, work&ndash;life balance, job stimulation and work environment.<\/p>  <p>  There are significant opportunities for career progression and development within the Defence Forces and there were over 800 promotions in the PDF in 2018. The Defence Forces actively encourage and support personnel to undertake education and training as well as participate in physical development and sport.\u00a0 Members of the Defence Forces have opportunities for diverse service, including opportunities to serve overseas. I\u00a0am also aware that the military authorities have introduced further initiatives to enhance work-life balance and I very much welcome this.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement. In addition in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA, improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates, who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were implemented.\u00a0 The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020,\u00a0provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The increases due under the agreement from 1 January 2018, 1 October 2018 and 1 January 2019,\u00a0have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel.

On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September\u00a0\"A\" Company came under attack.\u00a0From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with Defence Forces Regulations the award of medals for bravery is time bound. These may not be awarded in any case unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff, not later than two years in the case of the Military Medal for Gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the Distinguished Service Medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made. Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.<\/p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: <\/p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to \"A\" Company in 2006. <\/p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. <\/p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. <\/p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. <\/p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company.

As such a Declined Cases agreement proposal is likely to have little effect, as insurers would simply price at what they consider the appropriate level for a particular risk. \u00a0Consequently, if there was an area where there was a significant level of claims, the price charged would likely reflect this and in many cases might be prohibitive cost wise for such businesses.\u00a0 Another difficulty with such a proposal is that insurers generally operate in niche areas of the business market based on their risk appetite and their understanding of these areas.\u00a0 Therefore, forcing insurers to take on risks outside of their expertise may result in them leaving the market and it may also discourage new entrants to the Irish market. \u00a0On this basis, I believe such a proposal could be counterproductive over the longer term and not in the best interest of the customer. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Government is acutely aware of the difficulties that the cost and availability of liability insurance is having on businesses across the country and every effort is being made to implement the recommendations of the second Personal Injuries Commission Report in order to address the awards level differential between this country and England and Wales.\u00a0 It is hoped that once this is done, there should be a significant positive impact on pricing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100051#WRB04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Registration","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100051#WRB04500"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[17043\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100051#WRB04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of primary schools registered for value added tax in each of the years 2015 to 2018; if his Department has a policy in relation to primary schools registering for VAT; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[17044\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100051#WRB04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of post-primary schools registered for value added tax in each of the years 2015 to 2018; if his Department has a policy in relation to post-primary schools registering for VAT; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[17045\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100051#WRB04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of third-level institutions registered for value added tax in each of the years 2015 to 2018; if his Department has a policy in relation to third-level institutions registering for VAT; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 to 53, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners\u00a0that the number of institutions registered for Value Added Tax between 2015 and 2018 is provided in the table below.

Under tax law, a school authority is regarded by the Revenue Commissioners as the \"Principal Contractor\" for tax purposes when it is delivering a building project.  My Department advises a school authority of this at the time the grant for the works is being approved.  Schools are also advised that the Revenue Commissioners has published a guidance document for school management authorities in this matter which is available on both my Department&rsquo;s website and the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; website.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department-funded Financial Services Support Unit (FSSU), which operates in the Primary, Community, Comprehensive and Voluntary Secondary Sectors, is an important source of advice and support for schools on financial governance matters including tax compliance including RCT requirements. <\/p>  <p>  The main requirement for a school authority to meet its obligations when delivering a school building project is to register with the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; online system and to follow the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; guidance in relation to deducting and paying over tax, where this arises, for the contractor carrying out the works.  <\/p>  <p>  It is a central principle that all bodies in receipt of Exchequer funding should be fully compliant with tax regulations and it is a core responsibility of the boards of these bodies to ensure such compliance. <\/p>  <p>  The stipulations of the Code of Practice for Governance of State Bodies in respect of taxation apply in the Department's aegis bodies.  More generally, the provisions regarding tax clearance for bodies in receipt of grant funding are set out in the appropriate circulars issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, namely circular 13\/2014 (management and accountability of grants) and circular 44\/2006 (tax clearance procedures - grants, subsidies and similar type payments).  <\/p>  <p>  With respect to schools, the Department has issued a circular to all management authorities (circular 51\/2013) on tax compliance. This circular set out the Department's expectation that all schools should be exemplary in respect of compliance with taxation obligations and drew their attention to relevant Revenue documentation.  In the ETB sector, the bodies are subject to audit by the ETB Internal Audit Unit and are externally audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. <\/p>  <p>  Capital payments for projects undertaken by higher education institutions are made through the Higher Education Authority (HEA).

One of the CCPC&rsquo;s principal statutory functions as a competent authority is to investigate suspected breaches of EU and Irish competition law (i.e. Article 101 and Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (&ldquo;TFEU&rdquo;), and section 4 and section 5 of the Competition Act 2002, as amended, (the &ldquo;Competition Act 2002&rdquo;), respectively).\u00a0 ComReg was empowered as a competent authority for competition law under the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007, specifically in relation to the electronic communications sector. <\/p>  <p>  At the conclusion of an investigation into a suspected breach of Irish or EU competition law, the competent authority may form the view that an infringement of either section 4 or section 5 of the Competition Act 2002 (and\/or Article 101 or Article 102 TFEU) has occurred. It may then decide to initiate civil or criminal proceedings in the courts against the undertaking(s) and individuals (including company directors and managers) involved. In Irish law, the power to impose financial sanctions for breaches of competition law is reserved exclusively to the criminal courts. <\/p>  <p>  Section 14A of the Competition Act 2002 sets out the two possible civil sanctions available. The competent authority may seek a declaration of illegality (i.e. a court ruling that a particular arrangement or behaviour is unlawful) and\/or an injunction (i.e. a court ruling requiring a particular arrangement or behaviour to be terminated). <\/p>  <p>  The Competition Act 2002 provides that all infringements of competition law are potentially criminal in nature and section 8 of the Competition Act 2002 sets out the possible criminal sanctions. If a summary criminal prosecution is brought for breach of competition law, the District Court may impose fines of up to &euro;5,000 on the business or individual concerned and\/or a prison sentence of up to 6 months on an individual. On conviction on indictment for competition law offences, the Central Criminal Court may impose fines of up to &euro;5 million or 10% of annual turnover on a business or individual. In the case of &lsquo;hardcore&rsquo; breaches of competition law, the Central Criminal Court can impose a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years on an individual. In addition, section 839 of the Companies Act 2014 (in conjunction with the Companies Act 2014 (Section 839) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 147 of 2016)) provides that individuals convicted on indictment for a competition law offence are automatically disqualified from acting or being appointed as a director or other officer, auditor, receiver, liquidator or examiner, or being in any way concerned in the management of a company for a period of five years after the date of conviction (or for such other period as the court may order).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition to seeking the civil and criminal sanctions described above, negotiated compliance agreements can be sought by the competent authority pursuant to section 14B of the Competition Act 2002. This mechanism provides that a party under investigation may offer binding commitments or undertakings to the competent authority to allay its competition concerns and thereby bring the investigation to a close. The commitments are then made an order of the High Court, breach of which exposes the responsible party to contempt of court. <\/p>  <p>  Directive (EU) 2019\/1 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 to empower the competition authorities of the Member States to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 14 January 2019. Known as the ECN+ Directive, it has to be transposed by 4th February 2021 and will give the competent authorities additional enforcement powers and will necessitate the introduction of non-criminal fines for breaches of EU competition law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100054#WRE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits Applications","counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100054#WRE03000"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[17157\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100054#WRE03100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if an application for a work permit will be reconsidered in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":273,"content":"<p>The Employment Permits Section of my Department inform me that the named individual applied for a General Employment Permit on 9th January 2019.

These were met through a mix of additional recruitment and agency conversion.\u00a0Indicative average figures from one model 4\u00a0hospital in the pilot\u00a0identified additional average\u00a0recruitment as\u00a02.5\u00a0whole time equivalent\u00a0per ward. (1.1 Health Care Assistant\u00a0 and 1.4 Staff Nurse).\u00a0 This uplift was in addition to conversion of agency.\u00a0This uplift is an average figure and the pilot demonstrated that some wards required no uplift, some required a skill mix adjustment, some required Health Care\u00a0Assistants only and some did require more than the 2.5 uplift.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE\u00a0is currently working on an implementation plan to rollout the Framework to all Model 4 hospitals. An essential part of the implementation is the acquisition and introduction of the supporting ICT system.\u00a0 The procurement process is at an advanced stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100056#WRG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":394,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100056#WRG03500"},{"type":"question","counter":395,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[17163\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100056#WRG03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical card will issue in the case of persons (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":396,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100056#WRG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100056#WRG03800"},{"type":"question","counter":398,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[17189\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100056#WRG03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children that will be in receipt of free general practitioner care if it is extended as proposed in 2020; and the net increase in the number of children covered resulting from the proposed change.

are living longer lives.\u00a0 For example, based on CSO figures, a 65 year old man in 1996\u00a0would have had life expectancy of 13.8 years (i.e. they could expect, on average, to live to 78.8),\u00a0whereas by 2011 this had increased to 17.7 years, an increase of over 28%.\u00a0 Over the same period, the life expectancy of a 65 year old woman increased from 17.4 years to 20.6, an increase of over 18%.\u00a0 In other words, average life expectancy rose by over 23% in a period of just 15 years.\u00a0 These changes are obviously very positive, but it is equally obvious that they result in significantly increased pension costs, if people continue to retire aged 65.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of this demographic trend, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.\u00a0 This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by\u00a0approximately &euro;1 billion every 5 years, and more when recent\u00a0rate increases are taken into account.\u00a0 For example, the cost of my Department's pension payments rose from &euro;7.1 billion in 2016 to &euro;7.75 billion in 2018, an increase of &euro;650m (or 9.2%)\u00a0in\u00a02 years.\u00a0 For comparison, the Consumer Price Index rose by 0.5% in the 2-year period from January 2016 to January 2018, and by 1.1% in the period from December 2016 to December 2018.<\/p>  <p>  This trend is not expected to cease.\u00a0 In the coming decades, the ratio of\u00a0people of working age\u00a0to pensioners is set to halve, from about five workers\u00a0for each\u00a0pensioner, to about two and a half\u00a0workers\u00a0per\u00a0pensioner.\u00a0\u00a0This\u00a0clearly has significant implications for\u00a0the viability of the state pension system, based as it is on a pay-as-you-go basis.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.\u00a0 If there is no change in State pension age, the proportion of a person's life spent in retirement will increase to levels where current workers will no longer be able to support current pensioners.<\/p>  <p>  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.\u00a0 Therefore, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.\u00a0 This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who had retired and who satisfied the PRSI qualifying conditions.\u00a0 This standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years (it was already 66 for non-contributory pensioners, and for contributory pensioners who worked to 66 or older).\u00a0 This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.\u00a0 The savings from these increases will assist in maintaining the sustainability of the overall state pension system, and make it more feasible for the rate of payment to grow in line with prices and\/or average earnings in the future.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Jobseekers Benefit is payable subject to the person satisfying the general scheme conditions.\u00a0 This entitlement is normally paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.\u00a0 Arrangements are in place to provide that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year can generally continue to be paid benefit up until pensionable age (currently their 66th birthday) provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions.\u00a0 The jobseekers schemes are kept under review and any further changes, including entitlement beyond the 66th year, will be considered in that context.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to\u00a0remember that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.\u00a0 While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.\u00a0 In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041100058#WRJ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobPath

In addition, an annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time.
