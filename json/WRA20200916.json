Similarly, if a student continues part-time work in a healthcare setting during the same period as attending clinical placements, they are required to complete this self-assessment on an ongoing basis so that any need for testing may be identified. The guidance makes it clear that students should not present on clinical placement if they have any symptoms of acute infection. <\/p><p>The Minister stated that, overall, the guidance facilitates students in completing their education and training and, in doing so, it does not preclude them from working part time so long as they adhere to the infection prevention and control requirements.

Revenue takes appropriate action where illicit activity is detected and this action is informed by intelligence on criminal activity and risk-based examination of commercial traffic and stock in retail premises. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Steps taken by Revenue to combat the illegal fuel trade include the introduction of stringent supply chain controls and reporting requirements, and a rigorous programme of enforcement action. In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation from April 2015. The industry view is that the actions taken have been successful in curtailing fuel fraud. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely and with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, in the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force, in acting against tobacco, alcohol and fuel crime. This cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups responsible for much of this criminality, who operate across jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the movement or importation of goods into Ireland, Revenue implements a risk-based profiling approach which is designed to facilitate the legitimate movement of goods and to secure payment and collection of duty and VAT, as appropriate, while also protecting citizens, trade and the environment. During the ongoing COVID19 pandemic, in order to &ldquo;green route&rdquo; critical legitimate pharmaceutical products and medicines, Revenue has prioritised the processing of declarations relating to these products at ports and airports to ensure their uninterrupted importation and supply. Where compliance risks are identified in any shipment as a result of risk profiling, Revenue take the appropriate action to address the risk including documentary checks, physical inspections and the deployment of Revenue resources including staff, detector dogs and Revenue&rsquo;s mobile scanner. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against cross-Border smuggling and the illicit trade in tobacco, alcohol and fuel products has achieved a considerable level of success. I am also satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s risk profiling regime addresses the ongoing risks posed by smugglers and organised crime gangs and that the cooperation at a national and international level is maximising effectiveness in combatting illegal and criminal activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600075#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600075#WRB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[24213\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600075#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons with annual income levels by category (details supplied) in the most recent year for which full data is available, in tabular form.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[24214\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600075#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons with annual income levels by category (details supplied) that received tax relief on their personal income for contributions to a pension, in tabular form.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":51,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[24215\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600075#WRB04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the gross amount of tax relief provided for pension contributions in each of the past five years for which full figures are available, in tabular form.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":52,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 to 33, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Regarding Question 24213\/20, I am advised by Revenue that they\u00a0publish a series of income distribution statistics which are available at link: <i><\/i>.

We are also in continuing close contact with EU leaders on this matter and the Taoiseach spoke most recently with Charles Michel, the President of the European Council, on 13 September. The Embassy in London also continues to have extensive contact with representatives of the UK Government. <\/p>  <p>  On 10 September, Ireland also took part in the extraordinary meeting of the EU-UK Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement at senior official level as part of the EU delegation. This meeting was also attended by representatives of the Northern Ireland Executive. At this meeting, the EU and Ireland made very clear to the UK Government our very serious concerns about the UK&rsquo;s Internal Market Bill.  Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic stated after the Joint Committee meeting that, if the Bill were to be adopted, it would constitute an &ldquo;extremely serious violation of the Withdrawal Agreement and of international law&rdquo;.  He called on the UK Government to withdraw by the end of the month those measures from the draft Bill which are in clear breach of substantive provisions of the Protocol.<\/p>  <p>  We are in regular contact at political and official level with Northern Ireland representatives on a range of issues, including those related to Brexit. I particularly welcome the meeting in plenary format of the North South Ministerial Council which took place on 31 July, the first in over three years. Given the impact that Brexit will have across a range of economic and social sectors and on how we cooperate North South in these sectors and more generally, Ministers discussed the implications of the UK withdrawal at this plenary meeting. The Plenary will be followed by Ministerial meetings across the NSMC&rsquo;s policy sectors in due course.  In July, I also met with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Belfast, as well as with the leaders of the parties, for constructive discussions including on Brexit related issues. I continue to have regular and ongoing contact with party leaders in Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In all of our engagements with the UK Government to date, we have made very clear the vital importance of full implementation of the Protocol, as agreed. Its negotiation was lengthy and detailed, and it represents a fair and balanced outcome for all parties, with compromises on all sides.  It is clear that any unilateral departure from the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement is not acceptable. <\/p>  <p>  Our view is that such a departure could seriously erode and damage political trust in Northern Ireland and between the EU and the UK. It also damages the trust needed to deliver a successful outcome to the Future Relationship negotiations. The Commission has clearly stated that violating the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement would put at risk the ongoing talks. <\/p>  <p>  We call on the UK Government to step back from this deeply concerning approach and to work now to repair the trust that is needed to successfully and faithfully implement the Withdrawal Agreement and Protocol. A positive resolution to this issue is in all our interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600077#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":128,"content":"<p>Question No. 62 answered with Question No. 61.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600077#WRD01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Reports","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600077#WRD01300"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[24389\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600077#WRD01400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if the commission on the Defence Forces will be ready by the end of 2020 as agreed in the Programme for Partnership Government; if he will provide a detailed timeline for its establishment and work and the details of its membership; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":131,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Programme for Government provides for the establishment of\u00a0an independent Commission on the Defence Forces. <\/p><p>The Commission is to be established before the end of this year, with a mandate to report within twelve months.\u00a0Planning for the Commission is in\u00a0the early stages and\u00a0no final decisions have yet\u00a0been taken to date on its terms of reference and membership.\u00a0 <\/p><p>I am working to ensure that the Commission is\u00a0established as early as possible before the end of this year.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600077#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600077#WRD01600"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[24236\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600077#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his plans to recruit an additional full-time clinical psychologist for the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":134,"content":"<p>There are currently two full-time clinical psychologists employed by the Defence Forces.

Personal safety is currently addressed in a variety of ways in the primary and post primary curricula.

This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.\u00a0 But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. <\/p><p>The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.\u00a0 This\u00a0standardising\u00a0process\u00a0happens every year and\u00a0would\u00a0have happened\u00a0in 2020\u00a0had\u00a0the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal. <\/p><p>The national\u00a0standardisation process\u00a0has led to some school estimates staying the same; some being increased; and some being reduced.\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0overall data\u00a0on\u00a0school estimated marks showed\u00a0that there was a very significant rise\u00a0in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally.\u00a0This\u00a0level\u00a0of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been\u00a0unrealistic.\u00a0For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%.\u00a0Even with the\u00a0standardisation\u00a0process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.<\/p><p>In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics (e.g. school type, student gender, etc.) either at the level of the student or the school. The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools.

The grant is based on the distance a family resides from their school of eligibility, with a minimum daily rate of &euro;2.60 and a maximum daily rate of &euro;5.10. Grants are not available to children who are not eligible under the terms of the transport scheme.

Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006\/130\/EC at the time and antiparasitics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.\u00a0<\/p><p>There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019\/6.\u00a0However, since that time, our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed.\u00a0 For example, antiparasitic resistance has been widely reported in parasites of livestock species in Ireland and globally, resistance is developing year-on-year and is now a significant animal health issue.\u00a0<\/p><p>In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in Regulation 2019\/6.\u00a0 A copy of the Report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website\u00a0<i>www.hpra.ie<\/i>.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Report states that the available scientific evidence shows that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019\/6. It also states that a consequence of this determination is that any such products that are supplied without veterinary prescription will need to be upregulated to supply under veterinary prescription. Therefore, Ireland and all other Member States must now comply with this regulation from January 2022.\u00a0<\/p><p>In accordance with existing national legislation, from January 2022 antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products for use in food-producing species that are supplied under prescription may be dispensed by veterinary practitioners, pharmacists and Licenced Merchant's.

Following a decline in the average income level in 2018, largely due to extreme weather, there was a recovery in average FFI in 2019. However, this recovery was uneven, with the average FFI concealing differences across the various farm types.<\/p>  <p>  Family farm income varies considerably by farm system. Dairy farms are consistently the most profitable farms. However, it should be noted that almost all dairy farms are classified as full-time farms, with farms requiring 0.75 of a standard labour input being defined as full-time and those requiring less as part-time. Most cattle farms and the majority of sheep farms are classified as part-time in terms of labour input requirements, even though in many cases the farmers may not have off-farm employment. Around two thirds of all farms are classified as part-time.<\/p>  <p>  Direct farm payments are a very important part of FFI, with an average\u00a0payment per farm\u00a0of &euro;18,452 in 2019, or 77%\u00a0of the average\u00a0FFI. There are noticeable differences between farm types; estimates for dairy farms show that the direct payments account for 31% of income, while cattle and sheep farms are very reliant on direct payments and many would be operating at an economic loss without them.<\/p>  <p>  A significant change in the methodology in the 2012 Teagasc National Farm Survey saw farms below &euro;8,000 of Standard Output (SO) no longer included in the survey sample. Up to 2011 the threshold for inclusion of farms in the survey field had been &euro;4,000. As a result, a straightforward comparison between the 2012 results and those of preceding years could easily lead to an incorrect interpretation of intervening changes. A further small methodology change occurred in 2018 based on data from the 2016 CSO Farm Structure Surveys and results from 2016 and earlier years are not directly comparable.<\/p>  <p>  However, looking at the results between 2012 and 2019, and bearing in mind the methodology change, FFI has fallen\u00a0over this period with average FFI down 6%. Dairy farms have seen FFI increase by 35%, while cattle and sheep farms have seen FFI fall by about 20%. Tillage farms have fallen back close to the average of 6% across all farms.<\/p>  <p>  The CSO&rsquo;s publication, &lsquo;Output Input and Income in Agriculture&rsquo; shows that aggregate farm income or operating surplus has risen over the past decade from &euro;1.8 billion in 2010 to over &euro;3 billion in 2019. Operating surplus is defined and calculated by the CSO by subtracting compensation of employees from farm income accruing from farm output.\u00a0 The figure is comprised of the operating surplus earned by farmers and that earned by agricultural contractors. It is an estimate of income before deductions for interest payments on borrowed capital, land annuities and rent paid by farmers to landowners for the use of their land. It does not include income from non-farming sources and may not be equated to household income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600082#WRJ03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600082#WRJ03600"},{"type":"question","counter":447,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[24418\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600082#WRJ03700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the degree to which he continues to explore ways and means to maximise the value of products from the agricultural sector with particular reference to achievement of the highest possible standards leading to market advantage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":448,"content":"<p>The agri-food sector has been well served over the last 20 years by having a series of ten-year strategies to guide its development and we have committed in the Programme for Government that this should continue with the preparation of a new strategy to 2030.

We have also introduced a single consent system for forestry road planning.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has a history of continually developing and educating forestry professionals, which is an essential part of improving the quality of applications.\u00a0 This is borne out by the advice and guidance issued in forestry circulars and supporting documentation.\u00a0 Forestry professionals are also obliged to attend formal mandatory training sessions, usually held annually, however these are currently on hold during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 The Department funds the Continuous Professional Development programme run by the Society of Irish Foresters and the Department keeps under continuous review the\u00a0training needs of professional foresters.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise, of course, that it is very important that the Mackinnon Review is fully implemented and that is why\u00a0I am\u00a0currently examining the appointment of an independent chair to oversee the process. \u00a0The intention is that this person will report on the feasibility of implementing\u00a0the Mackinnon recommendations for us to consider further. \u00a0A review of the Forestry Programme Implementation Group is currently underway to enhance representation so that the membership of the Group is best selected to help advise the Minister and the Department on the implementation of the National Programme. <\/p>  <p>  There is currently a huge amount of activity in forestry, especially on the reform of the planning and appeals processes and the introduction to the House shortly of a Bill to amend the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001. \u00a0Nonetheless, I understand that implementation of the Mackinnon Review is also a priority and\u00a0I expect to be making further announcements on this issue soon. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600082#WRJ05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agrifood Sector","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600082#WRJ05800"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[24331\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600082#WRJ05900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he has met with the banking sector or farmers organisations regarding the interest rates being charged by banks here on farm related finance and loans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":467,"content":"<p>My Department meets and liaises with the main banks on access to finance issues relating to the agri-food sector and is currently scheduling meetings for me with the CEOs of the main banks. There is also good cross-Departmental cooperation on banking matters with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) and the Department of Finance. In recent years there have been a number of initiatives undertaken, primarily through the publicly-owned Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to address gaps in the market. Currently, liquidity and working capital needs can be addressed through the COVID-19\u00a0Credit Guarantee\u00a0Scheme and longer-term investment needs by the Future Growth Loan Scheme<\/p><p>Last week, with my colleagues the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance, I launched\u00a0the &euro;2 billion COVID-19\u00a0Credit Guarantee\u00a0Scheme, the largest of its kind in the history of the state. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a severe disruption to economic activity.\u00a0 Following discussions early in the pandemic, the banking sector announced a three-month period of\u00a0flexibility for customers, including provision of payment holidays or emergency working capital facilities.\u00a0This was subsequently extended to six months and will expire in October. As the recovery begins, many COVID-impacted businesses will require additional liquidity and working capital facilities. The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is designed to incentivise finance providers to continue to support economic activity by providing liquidity and finance agreements to businesses.\u00a0 The Scheme is targeted towards businesses which have experienced an adverse impact of minimum 15% in actual or projected turnover or profit due to the impact of COVID 19 and have difficulties in accessing credit. <\/p><p>The CCGS will provide an 80% State-backed guarantee on bank lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years. The CRS will be administered for the State by the SBCI and SMEs will be able to go directly to the banks.\u00a0The guarantee can be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million, for terms between 3 months and 6 years. It will be available to all SME sectors, including primary producers, i.e. farmers and fishers.<\/p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme supports strategic long-term capital investment by SMEs, farmers and fishers. The Scheme was developed by DAFM and DBEI, in partnership with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the European Investment Fund (EIF). It is being delivered through participating finance providers\u00a0and made &euro;300 million of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agri-food &amp;amp; seafood sectors. The loans are competitively priced (an initial maximum loan interest rate of 4.5% for loans less than &euro;250,000), are for terms of 8-10 years and support strategic long-term investment. A minimum loan amount of &euro;100,000 applies up to a maximum of &euro;3,000,000 per applicant. Considering the needs of Irish farmers, a specific minimum of &euro;50,000 has been secured for them.<\/p><p>This is a financial product that was previously unavailable in Ireland. The unique characteristic of the Scheme is that loans up to &euro;500,000 are unsecured making it a viable\u00a0source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution. Food companies, too, have identified long-term investment finance of up to ten years as a critical need which is currently unavailable in Ireland. The effects of his product will be felt all along the food production chain from primary producer to processor. The\u00a0Future Growth Loan Scheme\u00a0has been open for loan eligibility applications through the SBCI website since April 2019. The scheme has been a success with very strong demand for investment loans.\u00a0\u00a0As part of the Government's Covid-19 response, a second tranche of &euro;500 million, with up to 40% available to the agri-food sector including farmers, was launched on 30<sup>th<\/sup>July 2020. <\/p><p>Food business operators can also avail of the Brexit Loan Scheme and COVID19 Working Capital\u00a0scheme. Further information on any of these loan schemes can be found on the SBCI website (<i>www.sbci.ie<\/i>).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020091600082#WRJ06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"}]
