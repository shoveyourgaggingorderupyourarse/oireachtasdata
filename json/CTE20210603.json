I thank the committee for the work it did on this Bill at pre-legislative stage, which was more extensive than any previous pre-legislative process and was effectively akin to Committee Stage, given that there were so many amendments in written draft form rather than just the heads of a Bill.  The amendments, most of which were incorporated in a revised draft of the Bill, that the committee proposed were beneficial in strengthening the Bill.  The work that the committee did was exemplary in that regard and I thank its members.<\/p><p>The first of my four amendments reflects a commitment in the programme for Government to end the issuing of new licences for exploration and extraction of gas.  A similar decision was taken by the previous Government in 2019 in respect of oil exploration and extraction.  My Department is no longer accepting new applications for exploration licences for either natural gas or oil.  The amendment in this Bill will implement that decision.<\/p><p>Subsection (1) in amendment No. 230 repeals the Minister's power to grant petroleum prospecting licences, licensing options, exploration licences, lease undertakings and petroleum leases under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960, subject to certain saving provisions to which I will refer shortly.  This subsection is drafted to ensure that the Minister's power to revoke licensing options and lease undertakings is maintained.<\/p><p>Subsections (2) to (6) provide for the limited situations in which further authorisations may be granted.  Existing authorisations will not be affected by the repeal of the provisions of the 1960 Act, in that they will continue to be able to apply to progress through the licensing stages.  This is necessary to allow existing authorisations, some of which have been in place for more than ten years, to reach a natural conclusion in accordance with their existing terms and conditions, given that the State and the companies involved entered into those agreements in good faith.<\/p><p>We have already seen the effect of recent changes in policy.  At the end of September 2019, shortly after the then Taoiseach's announcement that new exploration for oil would end, there were 55 authorisations under regulation.  In the latest quarterly acreage report published by my Department, which set out the position at the end of March 2021, there were only 29.  I expect this number to decline further as authorisations expire or are relinquished, with no new authorisations for exploration and extraction replacing them.<\/p><p>The saving provisions also provide for petroleum prospecting licences, PPLs, to be granted to the holders of other authorisations.  We are doing this because, as in the case of licensing options and lease undertakings, the licensing terms require the holders of those authorisations to also hold a PPL.  Holders of exploration licences and petroleum leases may also require a PPL in certain special circumstances where it may be necessary for the authorisation holder to acquire data outside the boundary of its authorised area in order to inform fully any work directly relevant within its authorisation.  In the case of a petroleum leaseholder, it is not uncommon during the lifetime of a producing field for new seismic data to be acquired for purposes that include monitoring changes to the field through time as a result of production.  However, it is important to note that holding a PPL does not entitle the licensee to any further petroleum authorisation.  It is also important to remember that any application for follow-on authorisation or applications to conduct activity in the Irish offshore under existing authorisations will remain subject to ministerial consent and will continue to be required to meet environmental, technical and financial standards.<\/p><p>These amendments will ensure that no petroleum authorisations for new exploration can be granted while allowing existing authorisations to apply to progress, with the applications remaining subject to assessment by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#D00800","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I wonder about some of these amendments in terms of where along the schedule they will have implications for existing licences.  Do they apply to all existing licences or tentative ones?  At what stage of the licensing process will licences be caught by these provisions or excluded?<\/p> <p>  We have discussed energy security in the D&aacute;il Chamber in terms of ensuring that we do not have blackouts.  The Sunday newspapers wrote much about the concerns in that regard at the weekend.  This brings me to the issue of assessment.  We have an energy review.  It is important that we see that information so that there can be confidence in the security of our energy supply for the years ahead and that we are not facing a cliff edge, as some call it.<\/p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in proposed amendments to deal with future situations where this legislation, including the Minister's amendment, might be contested.

Of the 29 existing authorisations, three are petroleum leases, only one of which is currently producing.  That is the Corrib gas field.  Four are lease undertakings, 18 are exploration licences, two are licensing options and two are petroleum prospecting licences.<\/p><p> The issue of energy security was debated extensively in recent years at hearings of previous Oireachtas committees.  We must remember that, statistically, our success rate in terms of the number of offshore wells drilled has been very low, even if there are 29 authorisations.  The strike rate in terms of discovering commercially recoverable oil or gas has been very low.  Anyone who argues that we will be energy secure on the basis of oil and gas exploration is mistaken and promoting false security.  The issue of security on our grid system is a completely different issue.  The Sunday newspapers were correct that we have an issue with gas-fired power generation being out of commission at present.  That will present a challenge for the coming winter.  We will have to manage our supply and demand very carefully in the coming years.  In many ways, that is a separate issue and it is not related to the issue of offshore oil and gas exploration.<\/p><p> With regard to the analysis of the switch away from oil and gas and the ending of new authorisations for oil and gas exploration, Mr. Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, stated when presenting the agency's world energy outlook at recent conferences and in giving its assessment of what we need to do for climate that every country needs to acknowledge the need to stop exploration for new oil and start cutting off the supply line of new fossil fuels.  The Government and that which preceded it have probably been ahead of others in doing this.  I have met representatives of the very small number of countries, including Costa Rica and Denmark, that have taken similar policy approaches.  The number is growing and will continue to do as I have described.  The Danes will be continuing with extraction and production for quite some time but they are taking a similar approach in that while they are not stopping existing authorisations, there are stopping new ones.  That is the approach we are taking.  What we are doing is very much in line with the leading-edge countries in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#D01000","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I confirm I am on the campus of Leinster House.  This is an historic move by the Minister.  It is exceedingly welcome.  Ireland will be among a handful of countries across the globe that will be banning oil and gas exploration.  I worry, however, why the Minister has felt the need to double down in this Bill on existing legislation, thereby allowing companies that have licences to move on to the next level.  While it is welcome that the Bill will prevent future licensing, why does the Minister want to double down on what is already in legislation?  I find that slightly worrying although it is very welcome news that several of the licences have expired and are not being renewed.  Why does the Minister want and feel the need to double down on what is already written into legislation?  Would enshrining it in this Bill, by way of a double whammy, not give reassurance to the fossil fuel industry that regardless of circumstances and if we failed to meet our targets and something awful happened on the planet, we would allow it to?  I agree with the Minister that we do not want a native fossil fuel industry.  We have moved beyond that.  Time is running out.  We need to move away from fossil fuel extraction.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the mass movement that pushed this issue.  It repeatedly stated we need system change, not climate change, and that fossil fuel should be kept in the ground.  That was the main slogan.  It is a great tribute to those people, mainly the young, who fought so hard to get us to this point.  It is welcome but I have questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#E00200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I agree that it is a significant and positive development.  The Deputy introduced legislation in this area four years ago.  At the same time, almost on the same day, we had similar legislation.  There was one variation or difference in that we accepted from the start that in any move of the kind in question, existing authorisations would work through to their conclusions.  The Deputy's legislation sought to stop the authorisations at the point of enactment.<\/p> <p>  One reason for our approach is that the State acts in good faith in terms of abiding by contracts it enters into and meeting expectations.  We do not have a stop-start approach to legislation and policy if we have initiated a process.  That is important because we are now turning the Department's and State's resources for the issuing of prospecting licences and the regulation of the development of energy at sea towards the development in future years of offshore wind, tidal and wave energy.  There are very similar mechanisms of authorisation, prospecting, licensing and planning.  We need to provide very complex legal certainty on the environment for the development of that critical resource for us to tackle climate change.<\/p> <p>  The State has done well in the context of the integration of wind power.  One reason for this, according to people in the industry, is that we do not change course.  When we have set ourselves on a course, we try to stick to it.  That is important because, considering the major investment required for the climate transition, we do not need a stop-start approach.  For that reason, among others, we are allowing the existing authorisations to work through to their conclusions.  I expect that my commentary will not lead to production but we will have to watch out for that.  At the same time, we will have to ramp up the development of offshore wind energy in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#E00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>The Minister said he expects this will not have to happen.  It is a bit like crossing our fingers and hoping it will not.  It is a real shame that the provision is being included in the Bill because we have not, in fact, entered into contracts with any of the relevant companies.  They have licences, which is quite different.  What the Minister is saying is that, regardless of how circumstances pan out, we are the gentlemen of the industry and honour our agreements with companies in the industry.  That is just not good enough.  If, for example, Providence or the Chinese corporations were to find oil and started to drill for it, would that not leave us with considerable egg on our face and make a negative contribution to the battle to stop the overheating of the planet?  I just do not regard this as necessary.  The companies already have licences and the Minister has the right to stop the progression of those licences.  He just admitted he will retain that right.  Why, therefore, is he doubling down on existing legislation if not to reassure what must be a nervous fossil fuel industry instead of letting it know that we are very determined about this?  I do not believe it is about gentlemen's agreements and it is certainly not about contracts because the companies are only owners of licences, nothing else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#E00400","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The reason is that I want to see those companies switch to using their skills in offshore energy engineering and systems to help us in the development of what will be the most secure energy resource for us.

The wind, particularly in the north and west of the country, blows with consistency.  I want to use the resources, expertise and capability of the companies to tap into that energy resource.  Working with them in a predictable way is one of the most important ways of securing that investment, particularly for our western, north-western and southern coasts.

It has major implications for the operations of the State in every aspect of its work.  The work done during pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill was, to my mind, highly unusual.  It is very unusual that a draft Bill goes for pre-legislative scrutiny where it is drafted line by line.

We listened and amended, quite significantly, the legislation to reflect that.  There is no disrespect to the committee.

Much very good work has been done in preparation for this Stage.  It is bitterly disappointing to think that none of the amendments will be accepted. <\/p> <p>  I am agnostic as to which climate justice amendments will be accepted, or what parts of them will be accepted but there is a very real need to improve that area and that language in this Bill.  As groundbreaking as the pre-legislative scrutiny was for this Bill, we should not consider it an outlier and something that will not happen too often.  It should be the basis for future legislation and not treated as something that happened this one time and probably will not happen again.  It should be built upon through all Stages.  <\/p> <p>  The danger is that the goodwill and engagement built up through pre-legislative scrutiny and carried through to Second Stage will be lost now.

I hope between now and the meeting this afternoon, and the scheduled meetings next week, the Minister might reconsider his approach and what is written in the speaking notes.

It is a significant problem for the climate movement generally if we are saying that there is no room for manoeuvre outside of what the Minister is putting forward.

We are looking for a reflection of what the Climate Change Advisory Council has recommended, which is that in terms of targets biogenic methane coming from agriculture should be dealt with separately to other methane and carbon emissions.  The argument has been put forward by the Climate Change Advisory Council that it should be dealt with separately because carbon and methane coming from agriculture are part of an overall cycle.  As the Minister knows, the issue is the increase in the amount of methane coming from the agricultural sector rather than methane <i>per se<\/i>.  As the Minister knows, it is part of a cycle.  Methane emitted from animals goes into the atmosphere and converts into carbon dioxide.  This carbon dioxide is then sequestered in the soil and grass and some of it is consumed by animals and goes back into the cycle again.<\/p><p>We are in a unique situation in Ireland in that we have substantial amounts of marginal land that is unsuitable for tillage.  Globally, there is a big push to move a lot of agricultural land into other types of protein crops where there is not the same scale of emissions, particularly with regard to methane.  If we look at many parts of Ireland where we have marginal land that is completely unsuitable for tillage, producing protein for humans from cattle is the only way the land can be productively used.  It is part of a sustainable process.  As the Minister knows, in the past we had a situation in the Burren where cattle were removed and had to be reintroduced because of the detrimental impact it had on biodiversity.  We had the same with sheep in many upland and mountainous areas along the west coast of Ireland.  A number of animals are required on land to be able to maintain it from an environmental and biodiversity perspective.  The same is the case in many areas of marginal land throughout the country.<\/p><p>I accept that agriculture has to do its bit to meet the overall climate targets but my concern is that agriculture emissions are the soft option.  The Minister knows from being in the Department, and from having been in the Department with responsibility for energy previously, how difficult it can be at times to get people to move and take the type of actions needed.  I have given the example already of electric buses.  We have to wait until 2023 for the first double-decker electric bus to be on the streets of Dublin even though the Cabinet took the decision in January 2018 to progress along this route and no longer buy fossil fuel buses.  My concern is that when we start to meet the thresholds for 2025 and 2030, and when we have not retrofitted 500,000 homes by 2030 and do not have 1 million electric vehicles on our roads, in order to meet these targets the squeeze will be put on the most vulnerable sector in agriculture, which is our indigenous suckler beef sector.  It produces very carbon-efficient beef on marginal land.<\/p><p>It produces protein for humans on land that is not suitable for any other form of protein production and carries out a vital role in biodiversity.  The evidence is already there in relation to that.  It is not just me putting forward this argument.  The Climate Change Advisory Council, in its 2020 report, strongly advocated that biogenic methane should be separated out, should be accounted for separately, and should have its own dedicated ring-fenced targets so that agriculture improves and reduces its emissions per kilogram and its emissions per hectare.<\/p><p> At long last we can see work ongoing, which is building on work I was involved with in respect of smart farming, to improve grassland management and to improve soil sequestration of carbon.  There is an awful lot that can be done in that regard.  There is no point in the agricultural sector carrying its burden, so to speak, on the 2030 targets and on targets beyond that date, if it all is to be nullified, come the eve of 2025 or the eve of 2030, when another scheme is introduced, effectively to reduce overall numbers of suckler cows in Ireland, as we have already seen in the reliefs and supports that have been put in place with Brexit.  It is about putting in place a fair and transparent balance.<\/p><p> The amendment I put forward here clearly reflects the goal, objective and intention of the Climate Change Advisory Council.  The Minister has already cited our international targets and what we have signed up to internationally.  The committee will be aware that all of these were drafted by industrialised countries.  These are the countries that set the agendas and targets on it.  Yes, they are challenging targets to achieve, but when one considers a country such as Ireland, where we do not have the heavy industry and where 37% of our population lives in isolated rural areas, our geography and our emissions profile is very different to that of other European countries.  That needs to be reflected in how we actually design our targets here.  Personally, I believe that our targets for biogenic methane emissions should be on a European Union level because the policy is developed in the context of CAP.<\/p><p> The reality is that the vast majority of food products we produce are consumed outside of Ireland.  This should be reflected in the emissions profile of the countries where this food is consumed, and not where it is produced.  This will cause a huge problem further down the road in the way the current system is structured.  We have a perverse situation where the targets, as they are currently designed, will force the wind-down of beef exports from Ireland, where we are the most carbon-efficient beef exporter within the European Union.  This will be replaced with beef coming from South America as part of the overall trade agreements we have.  That beef, coming from the Amazon basin in Brazil, has a carbon footprint 35 times higher than the beef produced here in Ireland.  Yet, in theory, from an accounting point of view, it makes sense.  It makes sense from the point of view of reducing Ireland's emissions profile, which it will do, but it will compound the problem for our atmosphere, our climate and the planet as a whole.   We will be replacing relatively carbon-efficient beef production in Ireland with beef production from South America that is disastrous for the environment and disastrous for the climate.  While that is okay for the accounting mechanism under the agreements that are currently there for the climate targets we have set for ourselves at EU level, it is imperative that we do not go down the same road given the mistakes that are being made with European and global targets, or that we do the same thing here in Ireland.  We should have a very separate and distinct target set for the agricultural sector.<\/p><p> I want to make it quite clear that I am not talking about agriculture getting a free ride on this.  There is a substantial amount of work that the agricultural sector can do.  The Minister of State, Senator Pippa Hackett, has a huge body of work to do around land use and land use change, which will be key to achieving our overall climate objective targets, and especially in the agricultural sector.  It is imperative that this work is done within a sector specific area because biogenic methane is very different to the carbon dioxide used anywhere else in society and in the economy.<\/p><p> It is not just the Climate Change Advisory Council.  Our colleagues in Northern Ireland have a very similar structure in agriculture that is also taking the separate approach to biogenic methane.  The Climate Change Committee there has specifically stated that there should be a different target for biogenic methane emissions in Northern Ireland, and that this should be offset against carbon sinks in other parts of the UK.  Members will be aware that New Zealand has also taken a very similar approach on this.  New Zealand has a very similar emissions profile to Ireland's, and it faces similar challenges to us.  They have separated biogenic methane from other forms of methane and other carbon dioxide emissions.  New Zealand has set separate targets on that.  New Zealand is our direct competitor in dairy production and sheep farming.  If we are serious about being fair to all sectors, and if we talk about taking the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council and the scientists who are experts in this area, every single one of them, to a man and woman, has said there needs to be a separate mechanism to calculate biogenic methane and that it should be treated in a different manner.  That is why I have tabled this amendment.<\/p><p> I hope the Minister will look at this fairly and reasonably.  I have listened intently to what the Minister said earlier, and that there is broad agreement on the Bill.  I accept that the Minister has gone through a tortuous process in securing the agreement on the Bill that he has already secured.  I can understand the Minister's logic for not being willing to budge any further on this and in having to try to go back to the Cabinet to try to get agreement on further changes on it.  I put it to the Minister, however, that we still live in a democracy.  Under our parliamentary procedures the first step is in carrying out amendments to the legislation.  We will also deal with it at a later stage in my amendments where I believe the way it is currently drafted is anti-democratic.  It is important that if the Minister is giving such a role to the Climate Change Advisory Council, which will be enshrined in this legislation and put on a statutory basis, then this key recommendation in the council's report needs to be adopted, included and incorporated into the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#J00500","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Deputy Naughten makes a good case for the farming sector.<\/p><p>We should start by acknowledging that the farming sector is challenged by our climate change objectives.  However, I would make a distinction between the vested interests of the agrifood business and the family farm.  The Deputy spoke about how we needed to deal with the increase in the herd over the past ten years.  It has been incredible.  Not only are we exporting to markets around the world, but we are creating those, too.  An Bord Bia sent people out to the Middle East and China to get their middle classes interested in foods they never ate before, for example, dairy produce and beef.  Those markets were created to fill the bank accounts of a certain cohort in our society who gain the most from doing so.  It has not benefited our farmers.  If it had, why would they be outside the meat factory plants or blockading the D&aacute;il and why would the Beef Plan Movement have begun?  Farmers have been left behind.  Continuing with the same policy does not help them.<\/p><p> I will move on to the science and argue against what is being said.  It is possible to treat biomethane as a special case in how we budget and plan for reductions.  The Government addresses this in its Bill, but that approach does not deal with the science.  In fact, there is no difference in impact on the atmosphere between methane from fossil fuels and biomethane.  There is not a special place for biogenic methane in terms of what it does in heating up the planet and how nature reacts to it.  It is the same gas.  Two separate cases have to be made.  One is for the carbon budget and not touching the beef and dairy industry, but the other is for nature and science.  There cannot be a special place for biogenic methane in the Bill.  One of the problems that arose during our earlier discussion with the Minister is that these matters are not being dealt with seriously.  There are flaws in the Bill, and one of the most serious is that biogenic methane has a special place.  Therefore, we are back to square one.<\/p><p> A key issue that needs to be addressed is being given an opt-out clause.  This will be viewed through carbon budgets rather than in terms of the science.  We can fool one another.  We might even fool the EU about our emissions if we do enough offsetting and carbon trading, but we will not fool the planet, nature or the science.  What bothers me about this approach is that we are viewing the carbon budget as something we must play around with to mask the reality, that being, there is no difference between biogenic methane and fossil fuel methane even though we are pretending there is to suit the industry.  That is dangerous, and it only suits the high end of the industry, not the family farm.  We need a just transition.  That is why many amendments have been tabled on the centrality of the just transition.  We need a just transition for farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#K00300","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>We will stick to a discussion on this amendment for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#L00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I am shutting up now, which I am sure the Chairman will be delirious about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#L00300","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>We have had a discussion.

When I read this amendment and its related amendments, it looked as though biogenic methane would not be considered in the national objective or the Bill's provisions.  One of our recommendations at pre-legislative scrutiny stage and in our report - I believe it was recommendation No. 36 - was that consideration would have to be given and meat would have to be put on the bone, for want of a better term, of what is meant by \"distinct characteristics of biogenic methane\" and the role of agriculture in society and what its implications would be for accounting and other requirements.<\/p> <p>  I have a question about this group of amendments, but I would also like to hear from the Minister about the prospect of split targets.

That is critical in this legislation.  How we do this will involve everyone and benefit everywhere.  Under the draft section 6A(9)(a)(ii), the advisory council would take into account relevant scientific advice, including on the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane.  However, I will not support the amendment in changing the definitions as proposed.  We must be careful with definitions of biogenic and non-biogenic methane.  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, biogenic methane covers wetlands, agriculture, including the rearing of ruminants and growing of rice and other crops, landfills, forests, oceans and termites.  Non-biogenic methane includes emissions from fossil fuel mining, biomass burning, waste treatment, geological sources, including geothermal and volcanic methane, and natural gas seepage in sedimentary basins.  Differentiating between definitions right now would be highly complex.<\/p> <p>  Something else to consider is that the UN process imagines anthropogenic emissions versus natural emissions.  We must differentiate between anthropogenic emissions &ndash; the likes of rice agriculture, livestock, landfills, waste treatment, biomass burning and fossil fuel &ndash; and emissions from natural sources, for example, wetlands, oceans, forests, fires and geological sources.  The definitions in this regard are best managed within the UN and IPCC processes as they must be based on international agreement and international standards.<\/p> <p>  As set out in the Bill's wording, we must take into account the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane.  The IPCC report from autumn 2018 recognised we would not reduce biogenic methane emissions or anthropogenic emissions from agriculture and other sectors to zero but we would have to do so in respect of fossil methane, which is the most critical step we must take.  We will have to reduce anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, though.  That is why there is no opt-out.  Every sector must be involved.<\/p> <p>  I might refer to the international approach.  Last autumn, the EU presented a new methane strategy.  Critically, it differentiated between fossil methane &ndash; to simplify, the petroleum industry's methane &ndash; and biogenic methane.  In this, there is an intimation of how differentiated the treatment could be.  The EU does not set the rules in this regard, though.  In an immediate sense, it sets the rules through CAP and other mechanisms, but Europe will have to adopt international agreements like the Paris process and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, process.  We are working on that with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney. We have a seat on the UN Security Council, which is an opportunity for us to connect the security issue to climate, including the question of how we treat biogenic methane.<\/p><p>In my contribution to President Biden's big event on climate last month, we referred to the approach we would like to see taken internationally on biogenic methane.  The US climate envoy, former Secretary of State, John Kerry, referred to that in his contribution when he spoken in Dublin recently.  The approach to be taken is to use the likes of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which is an organisation established within the UN system, to look specifically at the management of or approach to short-lived greenhouse gases.<\/p><p> Everyone knows that methane is a short-lived greenhouse gas.  It is short-lived in the sense that it oxidises in the upper atmosphere into carbon dioxide in a way that is very damaging and climate worrying.  There is real international concern about methane.  The level of methane in the atmosphere is rising rapidly and is of great concern.  I expect to see international scientific reports re-enforcing that later this summer, so we must address the methane issue.  The approach will and should differentiate.  It should take into account best science.  In the measuring and monitoring of this, a recent development has been the establishment of an EU-UN environmental programme, a methane monitoring observatory.  These are the sort of science sources which we will adhere to.<\/p><p> It is an international agreement which has different implications for different counties.  In regard to the area of agriculture, we should be supporting, wherever possible, agricultural systems that support not just our climate objectives - that must happen - but also our biodiversity and other objectives.  We should look to support the form of agriculture - pastoral and family farms - which is good at climate adaptation and resilience, as well as climate mitigation.  I am sorry for the long answer, but this is the crux of the issue.  In a global context, we should do that in our role on the UN Security Council, in particular, where climate has to been seen as a critical security issue in a way that supports developing countries in Africa and small island developing states, SIDS, and supports the form of climate-resilient pastoral family-farming which is small scale, less intensive and less feedlot-orientated agriculture in regard to ruminants.  That would have knock-on consequences for our country.  It would support the kind of family farming system of agriculture, which I think we are agreeing on here.<\/p><p> We will have to work on this internationally.  It can be good for the type of farming we want, which protects nature as well as rural Ireland.  We should take heart from this.  I listened intently to the president of the IFA today when he said - I know from my experience that the head of the ICMSA, Natura 2000 and hill farmers, and the other farm organisations increasingly understand this - that the vast majority of Irish farmers are committed to climate action.  They increasingly understand that what we will have to do is reduce our emissions and increase their income.  That is why I come back to how we treat and manage this.  It is to look at mechanisms, and not that agriculture will get an opt-out and will not play its part.  Going back to what I said earlier, in the autumn this committee will have to consider what the various sectoral allocations will be.  The truth is that if we reduce our ambition in one area, it may put impossible constraints or obligations on other sectors, which might have significant consequences for employment or other aspects in the quality of our lives.  Therefore, every sector is involved.<\/p><p> A key question within agriculture is, how do we increase income as we reduce emissions, including the reduction of the biogenic methane?  We must recognise that this has to be good for Irish agriculture, and I believe it can be.  That is the approach we will take on this.  We have recognised that in the provisions of the Bill which state we take into account the scientific advice on biogenic methane.  It is so complicated and multi-varied in its aspect that I do not think we can define it in the Bill.  However, we have sufficient recognition in the Bill to connect those international developments I mentioned briefly there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#L00700","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Bruton, who has not contributed yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#M00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I apologise; I had to go to the Chamber for a few moments.  I agree with what the Minister has said that we need a new vision for agriculture.  Anyone who seeks to try to present the case that nothing should change in agriculture is doing farmers a disservice.  In a decade&rsquo;s time when the price of carbon goes to well over a &euro;100 per tonne, the farming systems that did not look seriously at carbon and its management will leave family farms with much deeper problems than if they had made an early move to make those changes.  My only worry is that by setting very ambitious targets in a sector like agriculture, where the pace of change is not going to be easy given the age profile and mix of farming methods, we may be trying to force change faster than the system is capable of delivering.<\/p> <p>  We need to be thinking of paying for sequestration.  In international inventories, sequestration through forestry or land management of one sort or another is not counted as part of the inventory and would not count towards the 51%.  We must start to think differently because we need to start paying farmers to be farmers of carbon.  This inevitably means that apart from CAP funds, other funds need to be introduced which farmers can earn, taking account of the likelihood that farmers will be much more efficient, in cost terms, in bringing down our carbon footprint than some other sectors.  If one can relieve sectors of more expensive burdens, there should be scope to support farmers in delivering some of the changes that are available in the agriculture and land use sector.  It must be done in the context of new policy tools to allow farmers to make this transition.  If we rush to set targets and do not have those sorts of mechanisms, farmers will become frustrated.  What we have to do is try to get people on the one page in terms of combining the challenge to farm carbon while also delivering food.<\/p> <p>  I worry that this debate is often pitched as one group opposing another, and that is a dangerous arrangement.  We must find the space where a new vision for agriculture can be carved out and where people can see a decent family farm income coming in, albeit from doing different things compared to how things had been done before.

I acknowledge the comments made by my two successors as Minister in this area, namely, Deputies Eamon Ryan and Bruton.  They have both recognised the validity of the point I am making concerning the need for biogenic methane to be treated differently.  The only point of disagreement between the three of us is how that aspect should be reflected in the Bill and that is why I submitted this amendment.  I will return to that point shortly.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to answer some of the questions raised by colleagues, I made it clear at the start of my contribution this morning, as I did while I was the Minister and I will do so again, that agriculture cannot get a free pass when it comes to climate change.  Therefore, I am not stating that agriculture should not be touched, but that it must be accounted for separately and that there is a good reason for doing that.  Agriculture has a key role to play regarding the issue of land use.  Substantial progress can be made in agriculture.  However, with a deadline set for 234 weeks' time, the only thing that can be done in that short time that will have a real impact is herd reduction.  The difficulty with herd reduction is that it undermines the type of farming that the Minister has expressly said that he wants to support, namely, family farms and pastoral grazing.  That in itself is not good for biodiversity or overall climate emissions.  <\/p> <p>  Physical constraints exist regarding the retrofitting of homes and in rolling out electric vehicles.  I set up those plans and targets and they were to be in full operation now, but that is not happening.  Even greater pressure is therefore being put on what I believe is the soft option of cattle numbers, instead of land use management.  Some environmental zealots are trying to claim that methane from fossil fuels and methane from agriculture are the same, but they are not.  They try to shut down any discussion of this issue.  There is a big difference between the two forms of methane.  Methane from fossil fuels comes from carbon which has been locked away in our planet for hundreds of millions of years.  Methane from agriculture comes from carbon dioxide that was in our atmosphere a few hours ago, a few days ago or a few weeks ago.  It is being converted into protein for humans to consume.  It is part of an overall carbon cycle.  <\/p> <p>  In fairness, that aspect was acknowledged by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the former Minister, Deputy Bruton.  It has also been acknowledged by the Climate Change Advisory Council, the Government of the United Kingdom, the European Union and New Zealand.  However, it is not yet part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, accounting framework.  Having said that, though, I fully accept that CH, methane, in our atmosphere, regardless of the source, has the exact same warming potential and that is why agriculture has a key role to play in combating climate change.  My issue concerns how this element is accounted for in domestic legislation and international climate rules.  Internationally, this aspect should be accounted for through the consumption of food, which accurately reflects the impact that methane has on our atmosphere, and not where that food is produced.  Taking the latter approach leads to perverse situations, such as the consumption of meat from the Amazon basis being incentivised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#AA00100","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Deputy Naughten, but he has articulately and comprehensively addressed the issue and I want to move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#AA00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I am just about to finish.

Turning to my amendment, the Minister argues that there is sufficient recognition of biogenic methane in the legislation already.  I argue this is tokenism and non-binding.  The reality is that agriculture will become the fall guy for a failure to meet targets in other areas.  I fully accept that setting a separate target for biogenic methane is not a trivial task.  To answer Deputy O'Rourke's query, that is why I have not been prescriptive in this amendment.  I do not have the required detail available and I do not think that anyone does now.

There will be sectoral targets for agriculture and land use, which will be different from the targets for other sectors and probably less onerous.  However, the agricultural sector has to play its part too.  I reassure Deputy Bruton that it will be necessary to account for sinks as well as sources.  The Bill does that, and the definition concerning a removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere sets out that clearly.  It includes the use of natural or technological solutions, nature-based solutions being centre stage in that regard.<\/p> <p>  My key point is that we must increase incomes and reduce emissions.  Removal of greenhouse gases, in form of those sinks, could, should and will be the source of potential income for farmers, foresters and those involved in land use and reclamation management etc..  Critically, this should be a turning point for the better for agriculture.  We want to redirect some of the income currently going to the processing and retailing side of agriculture to pay for nature-based solutions and the environmental services that will be provided by farmers.  That is why many farmers are rowing in behind what we are seeking to do.  That income must go up.  We must have an Origin Green brand that is truly green in origin, in respect of protecting nature as well as stopping emissions.  <\/p> <p>  It can also increase income in many different ways.  As well as pasture-based family farming, we can also look at more secure incomes by having a diversity of income streams being derived from farming.  Last, but not least, this aspect concerns not just methane but also elements such as nitrous oxides, in addition to greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, from agriculture itself.  There is also potential to derive income from the generation of energy on farms.  Farm incomes could also be raised by reducing the use of nitrogen and nitrous oxide fertilisers.  This endeavour, therefore, is not just focused on methane.  It is about a variety of approaches, all of them centred on increasing income and getting a new generation of young farmers into the sector as emissions are cut.  I am afraid I cannot support the amendment but I think we agree on the principle that farming must play its part and, critically, the old narrative of the environment versus agriculture must end.

We are starting from different bases.<\/p><p>The discussion that most reflected this was on carbon taxes and the question of how they are implemented.  Carbon taxes, as they have been applied by the State, are exactly what we do not need.  This is not what just transition means.

The Bord na M&oacute;na workers are a good case in point.  The Minister says they will be given jobs retrofitting and money will be put into retraining them but giving them minimum wage jobs in a recycling factory is not a just transition.  It does not tick the boxes.  This really has to be developed in a way that defines just transition as being central to how we implement it.  It is very obvious that we will not bring communities and workers with us, and we will not bring all that we need to bring with us, if we do not have this at its heart.

People need to see that their voices will be heard within it, that they will be considered and brought along, that this will not be just a case of more of the same, and that this will not confirm and firm up these positions.

There is a real fear in communities about what the implications of climate action and the response to climate action mean.  We need to accept and acknowledge this as real and earnest.  Some of it is based on practical experience with regard to people struggling to heat their homes and pay their bills.  They are falling deeper and deeper into this scenario with the prospect, as they see it, of more of the same and worse to come.  The Bill needs to spell out that the Government and future governments have their backs.  It needs to spell it out in black and white because it is not there and there is deep concern about it.

The reality is that climate issues are not just about the environment.  They are part of a much broader issue and we cannot separate them out.  If we start dealing with environmental or climate issues separately to the economy, inequality and people's living standards we will not achieve what we need to achieve with the Bill.  We cannot leave people behind when we deal with the climate crisis.<\/p> <p>  We are at a crossroads.  We have an opportunity to use the Bill to meet our climate objectives and to create an environment we can all enjoy and live in.  If we do not do it right, there is a risk we will create a very divided Ireland where a portion of our communities are left behind.  If people are struggling to put a roof over their heads and food on their tables, climate issues and environmental issues will be the last thing on their minds and that is the reality.  Achieving the climate targets and the environment we need to move towards comes down to a cultural shift and a system shift.  We cannot do it unless we bring everyone along with us.  It is very important to ensure just transition is a component of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  The amendment I have tabled defines just transition and goes into what the principles are.  We need to have a conversation about what the just transition principles are.  Even during pre-legislative scrutiny, the officials stated that climate justice covers it.  It actually does not because it is a different concept.  It is a very broad concept but climate justice is more of an international global issue whereas just transition relates to Ireland and our workers and communities.  The first thing we need to do is to define it.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said we will not be able to deal with social inequalities in the Bill but we will have to address them because they are all part of the same thing.  We are all part of the same ecosystem.  We will not be able to deal with one issue without dealing with the other.  It is incredibly important that we incorporate this into the Bill.  This is an opportunity.  We can have it in the Bill and we can define it and have discussions on it.  We can look to countries such as Scotland which have done a very good job on this.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  Other countries have done a lot of this work.  We could learn from what they have done.  Many of the amendments are pulling from international expertise.  We can look at this as an opportunity to right some of the wrongs and rebalance our communities and how we are living.  We have to incorporate it in the Bill.  It needs to be there as a guiding point of principle to give this direction.  Otherwise it will be forgotten.<\/p> <p>  I have had this conversation with the Minister previously when he introduced the waste policy.  People with disabilities had very limited consultation.  No one represented people in poverty when the policy was developed.  This needs a very holistic approach.  If we do not embed just transition in the framework of the Bill, we will not be able to take an holistic approach.  It is absolutely critical that we get this right and it has to go in at this point.  Earlier, the Minister mentioned that just transition is defined in the Bill but it is not.  It was one of the key recommendations of the committee.  We heard from many experts and the majority of them said we need to take the principles of just transition into account.<\/p> <p>  I tabled an amendment that was ruled out of order on the establishment of a just transition commission.  This should be looked at because the difficulty with just transition is that if we are not proactive on it, and if we put in place the framework for the climate targets and start putting restrictions on emissions but we have not considered just transition policies in parallel with this, we will have a very reactive transition and it will not be good.  We need to build just transition principles into the Bill now to make sure the processes happen at the same time.  I know the programme for Government includes a just transition commissioner.<\/p><p>However, there have been no details of how that will be implemented and no focus on it.

I want to comment on them generally.  I am very strongly in favour of a role of just transition commissioner being established.  I am open to the Minister's view as to whether that would best be done through dedicated legislation.  During my time as Minister, we sought to establish the principle of just transition, albeit in the face of very significant changes that had to be managed, particularly those affecting the peat sector.  We appointed an interim just transition commissioner, who has done a really good job on much of the type of consultation that is set out in these amendments.  The interim commissioner supported new measures that will seek to develop substitute sectors and ensure people adversely affected by peat operation closures in the midlands, for example, will have access to accelerated retrofit programmes and measures to support community activity.  That principle, of both dialogue and a very active programme of supporting people who are impacted, is important.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith knows I do not agree with her on carbon pricing.  It is important to note that carbon price revenue has been used entirely to support people who have been adversely affected by carbon charges.  That was done through social welfare measures, including increases in the fuel allowance and accelerated implementation of the warmer homes scheme, which has a very significant impact through enabling people to avail of free retrofitting of their homes.  Carbon price revenue has also gone towards the restoration of peatlands and to support programmes of change in the midlands.<\/p> <p>  The principle behind these amendments is sensible.  We need to have a broader dialogue and my understanding is that the Minister is absolutely committed to such dialogue.  In fact, we will not succeed in bringing people with us on what is going to be a challenging journey unless we can have dialogue at various sectoral and community levels.  Some of these amendments reflect what is in the programme for Government.  However, I am quite open on how we should proceed.  I will accept it if the Minister considers that new legislation dealing with this issue in a more comprehensive way, with the capacity to have actions as well as simply expressing principles by way of a definition, is a better way to go.  We need an activist programme with access to resources and the sort of secretariat that would enable it to go beyond the work Kieran Mulvey has been doing so successfully on an interim basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#FF00200","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Bruton that what Mr. Mulvey and others have done in the midlands is a really good example of practical intervention on a just transition basis.  That work is far from complete and there is an urgency behind delivering some of the funding that has been allocated.  I recognise that, but what has been done is a start in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  The principles of just transition are embodied in this legislation in a whole variety of different ways, including in the provision for consultation that is contained within and throughout it.  We have already started that consultation in terms of the development of the new climate action plan and the enactment of legislation.  We have just completed a very significant climate conversation with the public in which more than 300 sectoral experts gave their perspective and views.  Approximately 3,500 Irish people have engaged directly with us.  That type of consultation is key and is provided for in various parts of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Whitmore said, there is a difference in terms of focus between climate justice and just transition.  Climate justice, by its nature, is focused on developing the emerging world and addressing the injustices occurring there because of climate change.  Definitions are important and legislation is about providing legal definitions.  While I cannot support the amendments, I absolutely agree with the need for decency, fairness and high-value work.  However, decency is not an easy thing for which to legislate.  Fairness is absolutely central but it is delivered by way of the tax system and investment delivered under the budget.  That is how we turn our objectives into reality.  The wording we have in the Bill and the principles that are stitched right through it, which come from a just transition perspective, are appropriate.  These amendments seek to define just transition but do not offer something better than what is already there.  Therefore, I cannot support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#FF00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":157,"content":"<p>On the question of just transition and taxes, what is happening is an attempt to tax people's behaviour without making alternatives available to them.  Pushing up carbon taxes for ordinary people is pushing up their heating bills.  Some people have poorly insulated homes, by any standards, and cannot afford to have them retrofitted.  Bringing in the taxes first, without addressing that reality, is saying to people they must change their behaviour but offering them no alternatives.  Many ordinary people do not have alternatives to turning on the gas, lighting the fire or driving a diesel car up and down the roads because there is no proper public transport, particularly in rural areas.  That behaviour is being taxed while, at the same time, the newspaper headlines today refer to an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft that made &euro;315 billion in profit in this country last year but paid zero corporation tax.<\/p> <p>  Climate justice is about addressing that type of unfairness.  I was standing beside Deputy Bruton outside Leinster House when he was Minister and a group of young people shouted at him \"System change, not climate change\".  He smiled and said he agreed with them.  Where is the system change in allowing Microsoft not to pay any tax on its billions in profits while more and more money is taken from the poor to heat their homes or drive a smelly old diesel car because there is no bus that will take them around their locality?  Without looking at those issues, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not dealing with just transition.  We need to spell out what it means and have a proper definition.  If not, we are feeding into climate denial.  What starts with people complaining about having more money taken from them or saying this climate business is too heavy on farmers and rural communities turns into climate denial and leads to a very fractious society where we are not all in it together and are not pulling together.

I tried to get a reference to a just transition commission into this Bill but I could not do it.  We need much more defined legislative provision for the establishment of a just transition commission and commissioner.  However, we do not have time to wait to nut out what the principles of just transition should be.

We have serious concerns about aspects of this Bill.  People in rural Ireland are struggling just to pay bills and put food on the table.  They are now being hit with this carbon tax, which will add a further &euro;100, &euro;150 or &euro;200 per year to a home heating oil bill.  There is no solution for ordinary working families because they will probably be above the income threshold and ineligible to receive favourable warmer home grants.  There are contractors who are worried they cannot afford to continue their daily work.  It is fine to say the country is tackling issues, but there are no solutions.  We will keep tabling amendments to create solutions.  We would appreciate it if the Minister considered supporting them or at least proposed solutions.  For example, people cannot use bales of briquettes from Ireland anymore but briquettes can be imported from abroad.  That is not a solution.  It is only a nod-and-wink exercise.

This is an important issue.  I can see the fossil fuel industry using gas a way of trying to greenwash its activities.  I subscribe to an online publication, <i>Natural Gas World<\/i>.  When I first subscribed, it contained a considerable amount of information about the trading being done, petroleum, drilling for oil and so on.  That information hardly appears now.  It is all about gas, liquefied natural gas, LNG, and how various countries are building terminals and pipelines to dig for and move, ship or import gas.  It is all couched in environmentally friendly terms and gas is being presented as a green transitional fuel, but we must blow that myth out of the water, pardon the pun.<\/p><p>This is will be an important debate for us in any energy security review.  The argument is that, when we burn it, gas is less intensive than coal and we must therefore move to it as a better way of using energy.  However, this does not take into account the full life cycle of what we use, from where it begins to how it is drilled for, fracked and extracted and the impact of those operations on the environment wherever they happen on the planet, be it Malaysia, New Zealand, Russia or wherever.  All of these countries are trading in gas, including LNG, and encouraging more investment.  This is worrying.  As those who inhabit the planet, who have created this mess and who can do something about it, how are we going to change this situation if we promote gas as a transitional fuel in this manner?  I feel strongly about the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#KK00600","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>We have to transition away from gas.

In fairness, both Deputy Bruton and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, have acknowledged it needs to be accounted for separately.  I do not believe the legislation here is strong enough in that regard and I believe agriculture will be left to carry the can for failures across other sectors of the economy.

One issue is that of planning permission for one-off houses for young people in rural Ireland.  It is becoming a complete nightmare.  More rules and regulations are being put in place that do not fit with the way of life in rural Ireland.<\/p><p>We want our rural communities to grow and prosper. Unfortunately, that is not happening on the ground at the moment.  It is the case that rural communities are being decimated by immigration and unemployment.  Droves of young people are leaving rural Ireland, heading to the bigger cities or abroad.  Those who want to live in rural Ireland are finding it almost impossible to live in their own communities due to all the rules and regulations that are being put before them.  They are finding it almost impossible financially to live in their own rural communities because of the expense of travel.  Public transport is an absolute disaster in my constituency.  It is the same in many constituencies in rural Ireland.  I have spoken to many other Deputies who have told me that, for example, a bus might stop at the door in the morning at 8 o'clock but there will not be another public transport service available until perhaps 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock that night.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the way I see it, there is a two-tier society.  These amendments have been tabled in good faith to see if we can turn this around and live in an environmentally clean world or countryside.  However, things certainly need to change dramatically.  To us, if these amendments are not accepted, we will be worse off.  We are facing a crisis and a problem with Irish agriculture.  We know the crisis fisheries is facing, but in rural Ireland agriculture is going through an enormous crisis.  There is a possibility we could be facing a 50% cull in farm activities and animals if this climate action Bill reaches its goals by 2030.  That will have devastating consequences for rural Ireland.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot see that things are going to improve.  The recent announcement in respect of the results-based environment agri pilot, REAP, scheme is proof of that.  Any farmer who has heather on his or her land will be excluded from the programme.  It is an ideal opportunity to reward people who have environmentally friendly farms.  Unfortunately, it is going the other way.  They will be fined, which will lead them into further financial difficulties.  Many young farmers are scratching their heads.  They do not know how they are going to put food on the table for their families or how they are going to live.  Grants are getting smaller, not bigger.  Unfortunately, anything that is coming up is not contributing to the survival of family-run farms.<\/p><p>I plead with the Minister to give serious consideration to these amendments.  Perhaps he can support them for what they seek to achieve.  They are seeking to ensure we secure young family farms.  They are seeking to ensure young men and women who want to build a one-off house in their community and live their life in a rural community can be fully supported in doing so.  There are many people who come to work and live in rural communities - they could be teachers or nurses - and who cannot get planning permission to build a one-off house to live in those communities.  At the same time, when I come to the city, I see there is transport, houses and high-rise buildings beyond belief.  There is no issue with planning in certain places.<\/p><p>Our amendment is very genuine.  I hope it is seen in the best light by the Minister.  It is an ideal opportunity for him to add these amendments into the legislation.  Then at least we will be seen to be working on a level playing field on which we can all agree to work.  As I said, we were careful in our approach to these amendments to ensure they were fair in every way possible.  Perhaps the Minister can comment on the amendments.  We expect he might support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#MM01900","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":244,"content":"<p>It is right up to 5.30 p.m.  In fairness to the Deputy, his colleagues and the Minister, the meeting cannot go beyond 5.30 p.m.  I will suspend the meeting and we can resume this debate when we resume in public session on Tuesday at 10.30 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#MM02000","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Can we replace ourselves on the committee if we cannot attend Tuesday's meeting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12021060300002#NN00100","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Yes.

This afternoon we are dealing with Supplementary Estimates for the Public Service.  Members will be aware that the D&aacute;il order that the Revised Estimates for the Public Service in respect of the following Votes would be referred to this committee for consideration: Vote 27 - international co-operation and Vote 28 - Department of Foreign Affairs.  Today's meeting of the select committee will consider these Estimates.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of Members of the select committee I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and international development, Deputy Brophy.  The officials accompanying them are Mr. John Conlan, chief financial officer in the Department of Foreign Affairs, Ms Siobhan Byrne, the director of the Passport Service, who is known to this committee and Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca, the director general of the development co-operation and Africa division, who again was with the committee recently.  I thank the team of departmental officials for the comprehensive briefing material provided to the committee and for the ongoing attention and very positive relationship with the committee on items we discuss on a weekly basis.<\/p> <p>  The proposed format for today's meeting is that the committee will deal with Votes 27 and 28 under the relevant programmes.  At the outset of consideration I will invite the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to give an overview on Vote 28, outlining pressures likely to impact on his Department's expenditure regarding the Vote for the remainder of this year, 2021.  The floor will then be open for questions from Members for each of the programmes.  I ask that Members put their questions on a specific programme so that we can progress in an orderly and efficient manner.  I also ask Members to be conscious of the time constraints.  Members will be aware that on the previous occasion when we discussed Estimates we were in some way challenged towards the end of the meeting in terms of having questions addressed.  We are operating under Covid time constraints.<\/p> <p>  When we have completed consideration of Vote 28, I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, to make an opening statement and we will proceed to consider programmes under Vote 27.

I am pleased to be here this afternoon to present the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2021.  As you said, Chairman, I will focus on Vote 28, the Vote for the Department of Foreign Affairs, and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, will address the committee after that on Vote 27.  Members are aware that there is considerably more money involved in the international co-operation vote than in the foreign affairs Vote.<\/p> <p>  Members will have seen the advance briefing notes provided by my Department on the two Votes, which summarise the main activities and priorities under each expenditure programme.  For 2021, the overall gross estimate for the foreign affairs group of Votes, which is Votes 27 and 28, is &euro;807 million.  This represents a &euro;30 million increase on the 2020 allocation.  For 2021, the total gross expenditure allocation for Vote 28, including a capital allocation of &euro;10.5 million, is &euro;281 million.  This is an overall increase of just over &euro;10 million or 4%.  This increase has been allocated to programmes to assist the Department in meeting the many challenges and opportunities we face in the coming year.<\/p> <p>  The Vote 28 priorities for this year include: the next phase of the passport reform programme; protecting our interests in a post-Brexit EU; Northern Ireland; maximising our position on the UN Security Council; the continued expansion of the overseas mission network under the Global Ireland 2025 initiative; provision for urgent capital building and security works in our network of missions abroad and; continuing investment in the Department's global ICT network.  My Department, and our mission network around the world, plays a critical role in promoting and advancing Ireland's interests through our international engagement,and will provide international support to the Government's economic recovery plan announced on Tuesday.  This is more important than ever as the country emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic.  We will continue to strengthen our  global presence, to ensure Ireland is ready to take advantage of new markets and opportunities and to continue to support our citizens and communities abroad.  As has been proposed, I will now proceed to make a short introductory comment on each of the programmes in sequence.<\/p> <p>  Programme A relates to our people.  Programme A, which has an allocation of &euro;85.3 million, covers many key policy areas for my Department, including consular services and assistance, the Passport Service, our emigrant support programme and Northern Ireland.  As Members might expect, some of the services have been put under a lot of pressure this year.  Others to date have not been, such as the Passport Office, but we expect significant pressure in that office as international travel resumes.  I can provide a detailed response if required.  The Passport Service and the provision of consular services and assistance lies at the heart of the Department's engagement with citizens.  This was clearly demonstrated during 2020, when the Department provided advice and assisted thousands of citizens across the world to return safely to Ireland or gave them advice on what to do in connection with international travel.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the Passport Service scaled up to more normal operational levels on 4 May 2021.  At that time, approximately 89,000 passport applications were on hand.  The Passport Office has processed approximately 45% of these applications, which works out at more than 42,000 passports.  Of the remainder, 70% are awaiting further action from the applicant, such as a new photograph or supporting documents.  With the full resumption of services, the Passport Service is issuing around 25,000 passports each week, which is a lot.  We are very focused on that.  During the month of May we issued more than 81,000 passports, which is a dramatic increase on the position in recent months.  By the end of quarter 2 this year, the passport online service for all application types will be available for 97% of applicants worldwide.  With this continued expansion, it is vital that the highest possible standards are maintained in security and service delivery.  The 2021 allocation includes a capital allocation of &euro;3.5 million, to be focused on the updating of the passport operating system.<\/p> <p>  The 2021 allocation for the emigrant support programme remains at the same level as it was in 2020, which is &euro;12.6 million, underlining the importance the Government attaches to supporting and deepening our bonds with our vibrant and diverse global Irish community.<\/p><p>I commend the work of my colleague Minister of State Brophy in this important area in his role as the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, and he will take any questions later on these matters.<\/p><p> This programme also deals with matters relating to Northern Ireland, North-South co-operation, and British-Irish relations, which are a particular emphasis of my Department now.  My Department remains focused on strengthening our relationship with the UK in the post-Brexit context.  I visited London in April, and I will travel there again immediately after this meeting, as it happens, for further meetings tonight and tomorrow.  I look forward to participating in the British-Irish Council summit and a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference later this month.  In July, we will open a consulate general in Manchester for the north of England.  The Government has committed to providing &euro;5 million in funding in 2021 to support the International Fund for Ireland&rsquo;s programmes.  Funding for the peace and reconciliation fund has also been increased significantly to &euro;5 million, reflecting the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to building cross community reconciliation in Northern Ireland and in the Border regions more generally.<\/p><p> The focus of my work under programme B, which is concerned with Our Place in Europe and accounts for an allocation of &euro;36.5 million, will be to safeguard Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the broader context of Brexit and the future direction and policies of the European Union.  It will also support Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU&rsquo;s global engagement on peace, security, trade and development, as well as security in the wider European region.  Programme B is also used to fund projects and proposals which further Ireland&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, priorities, support EU engagement and support the placing of Irish personnel in EU and international institutions.  These projects have a very positive impact on Ireland&rsquo;s profile internationally with respect to our key foreign policy objectives, and can help to shape and implement EU policies that work for Ireland.<\/p><p> The majority of current expenditure under programme C, which has an allocation of &euro;56 million and is concerned with Our Values, consists of contributions to international organisations.  The allocation set aside for these contributions, at &euro;34 million, is at the same level as last year.  We make a broad range of commitments under this heading to international organisations, predominantly UN bodies, concerned with areas such as refugees, healthcare and education, for example.  Another key pillar of our international engagement under programme C is our input into the shaping and formulation of the EU&rsquo;s CFSP, most notably at the monthly meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council, FAC, in which I participate. <\/p><p> Programme D, concerning Our Prosperity and which has an allocation &euro;44 million, will focus in 2021 on assisting Irish businesses in the context of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU and as we emerge from the pandemic.  The programme also includes a capital allocation of &euro;500,000 towards Expo 2020 in the United Arab Emirates, UAE, which is now set to run from October 2021 to the end March 2022.  We will continue to intensify our collaboration and co-operation with other Departments and State agencies, to ensure that we are effective and responsive to the needs and expectations of our citizens and our business sector.  Our annual St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day programme also comes under this expenditure allocation and this year, in partnership with other Departments and State agencies, we delivered a virtual programme, including more than 80 virtual receptions.  They ended up having an extraordinary reach online on social media and video platforms and there are some real lessons to be learned from that experience for the future.   <\/p><p> Finally, programme E, which has an expenditure allocation of &euro;48.7 million to cover activities under the heading of Our Effectiveness, covers the management and development of staff, the management and mitigation of risk, ICT, property management and compliance with statutory and legal obligations.  The programme also covers communication by the Department of its policies, objectives and activities to citizens at home and abroad. <\/p><p> That is a very quick overview of the main foreign affairs activities and priorities of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Defence for the year.  I welcome comments and questions from committee Members on any of the foreign affairs policy programmes and the broader work of the Department, which I assure the committee is very busy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021060300002#A00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I will touch on some specific areas and while there may be a little crossover between the areas of the Minister and the Minister of State, I will try my best to remain focused on Vote 28 for now.  I commend all the work that has been and is being done by the Department.  It has been an extremely busy year.  I commend all the staff for their Trojan work.  The example of the Passport Office highlighted the great challenges involved in trying to keep a system in place despite the impact of the public health restrictions.  I congratulate and thank everyone for all their efforts.<\/p> <p>  Mentioning the passport issue, and in the context of the continuing and expected numbers of applications for passports from people in the North, especially post-Brexit, does the Minister have updated figures in that regard?  Many in society in the North, including my party colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, have repeatedly asked about the possibility of opening a passport office in the North, maybe in Belfast.  Are there such plans?  If not, will the Minister and his Department examine establishing such an office in the North?  The figures I received previously indicated that there is a major demand for such an office.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, may touch on the issue of the diaspora later, but I will ask one question in this area now.  The new President of the United States, Joe Biden, has Irish connections and is very proud of them.  In that context, what approaches and discussions have occurred so far regarding undocumented Irish immigrants in the US?  Is it likely that a deal of some sort will be put in place to ensure that those people can regularise their status in America?  We do not need to reiterate the great difficulties undocumented Irish people living in the US have faced for many years.  <\/p> <p>  Moving to the situation in the North, unionism now has new leaders.  I congratulate the new leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and the Ulster Unionist Party, UUP.  However, there is a crisis within unionism in the North.  Historically, unionists have sought to find a route out of internal conflict through the manufacture of some sort of external crisis, and that nearly always comes at the expense of nationalists.  Unfortunately, issues have arisen regarding the Northern Ireland protocol and the positions taken towards it by the unionist parties.  The situation has escalated because the DUP is now boycotting the North-South Ministerial Council.  I ask the Minister to comment on the backtracking on commitments regarding key institutions such as that council.  <\/p> <p>  On the subject of the United Nations Security Council, the Minister recently and rightly expressed his disappointment concerning the events in Gaza and the failure by the Security Council to even agree a statement concerning the killing of civilians in Gaza.  It was ten or 11 days before the Security Council came to some sort of agreement on issuing a statement.  Last week, the D&aacute;il passed an historic vote in respect of recognising that an illegal annexation has taken place in the Occupied Territories.<\/p><p>Obviously, declaring that Israel has broken international law is an important step.  What are the Minister's intentions now to articulate the position taken by the Irish Parliament and the rationale behind it in respect of the Security Council?  He might give a little more detail because while it is a welcome step, on its own it is meaningless unless we are willing and prepared to articulate our position and go forward in respect of the consequences for Israel of breaking international law.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's view on that.<\/p><p> As for overseas missions, I welcome the move to establish consular services in Manchester.  I think the Minister mentioned Manchester but I am happy to stand corrected.<\/p><p> There is also a commitment to reopen the Irish Embassy in Iran.  That is a hugely important move and one I have called for previously, as have many other people, so I welcome that.  We as a country have significant responsibilities in respect of the establishment of the Iran nuclear deal.  The Minister recently met the Iranian President and foreign minister.  Could I ask the Minister for a brief update on the nuclear deal?  Could I ask him to pass comment specifically on Israel in respect of any future deal?  I think there have been reports recently that Israel is prepared to abandon its bilateral approach with the US and to take unilateral action against Iran if a deal is reached.  Will the Minister comment on that?<\/p><p> I have a lot of other questions, mostly referring to Vote 27, I think, so I will leave it at that for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021060300002#B00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":266,"content":"<p>There were a lot of questions there for the Minister.

Specifically, could he comment on the situation regarding J1 visas, relating to international education between Ireland and America?

Regarding the Passport Office in Northern Ireland, the truth is that the vast majority of passport applications now are submitted online, so the physical presence of a printing press and where it is located are not anything like as relevant as they were before, when people had to come into the Passport Office and fill out forms to get their passports.  It is now very much an online process, and I think considerably more than 90% of applications now are submitted online.  Members might be interested to know that before this meeting I had a good briefing on the Passport Office because I was anxious to make sure I could give the committee accurate numbers and a sense of what is happening weekly.  Last week, for example, 16,435 applications came in.  That is the figure for renewals of passports and applications for new ones.  The Department issued 20,689 passports in the same week, so we are issuing more passports than we are getting applications.  That said, there are still just over 93,000 applications in the system.  At the moment we are meeting our target for the number of adult applications for renewal done within ten days.  Some of them are done in a considerably shorter time than that.  We are setting ourselves a target that if you are an adult applying for a passport renewal, you will get your passport back within ten days.  Children are more complicated in respect of the security and verification issue, but we think that by the end of next month we will have our ten-day benchmark turnaround time implemented for all renewals and new applications for both adults and children.  That is pretty impressive, given the fact that we have had to ramp up in recent months from almost a drip-feed of applications coming through to now doing, as I said earlier, 81,000 in the month of May.  I expect we will issue about 25,000 passports a week or something close to that as we move into this period now when many people are planning for a reopening of international travel.  I think that will remind people to look at their passports maybe for the first time in 18 months and all of a sudden we will find that many people want passports renewed quickly.  That will put us under pressure but we are gearing up for that in a serious way.  I want to put on the record that the staff and the team working in the Department have been phenomenal when it comes to passports.  This is a difficult environment to work in in the context of Covid restrictions, with many people working in very close proximity in big open-plan offices.  We have everybody back working now, and I just wanted to put on the record my thanks to them for that.  It has been a huge effort.  They are working from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. on shifts to try to get on top of the passport issue, which we know will ramp up significantly.<\/p> <p>  We are watching Northern Ireland closely.  During the past 18 months or so, during Covid, a significant proportion of the passport applications have come from the UK and from Northern Ireland.  That balance is now changed somewhat as many people in the Republic of Ireland want to get their passports renewed.  We will keep that option open.  At the moment the focus is, I think, on delivery through the systems and platforms we currently have.  There is no problem for anyone in Northern Ireland looking to get a passport or a passport renewal through the online system.  It is very efficient.  We also have a call line.  To give the committee a sense of the numbers of people we are dealing with in terms of customer service in this call centre, the passport service is currently interacting with up to 10,000 customers each week.  Our phone service for citizens has been considerably scaled up to complement the web chat service, which we encourage people to use and which has operated throughout the pandemic.  This is a very busy part of my Department and is doing a really good job in what have been quite difficult circumstances in recent months.<\/p> <p>  I will let the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, deal primarily with the issue of the diaspora.  Regarding the issue of the undocumented that Deputy Brady raised, we have worked and continue to work to look at options that are available in Washington, particularly in Congress and in the Senate, to try to help undocumented Irish in the United States.  As the committee will know, we have been working with proposals on an E3 visa system.  I do not need to go into all the detail of that but it remains a focus of ours.  There are many friends of Ireland helping us on Capitol Hill, and that is important.<\/p> <p>  We have a very good relationship developing with the new US Administration.  I met both Antony Blinken and Jake Sullivan as they travelled through Shannon.<\/p><p>One was on the way to the Middle East.  The other was on his way home.  It shows the strategic benefit sometimes of having that Shannon stopover available.  At times, it really opens up a helpful line of communication.  I impressed upon the Secretary of State the importance of a US special envoy to Northern Ireland and I think they have very much taken that on board.  I spoke to Jake Sullivan about that in some detail and I think that will be a message that is passed on directly to the White House.  Given the changing nature of politics in Northern Ireland, the polarisation that is there, the vulnerability there and the complexity in the context of the Protocol, Brexit and the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, it would be a good strategic move to have a special envoy to Northern Ireland at this moment in history, and which I think would be useful.<br\/><br\/>In do not want to get into commenting on unionism or unionist parties.  I would just say I had a very good dialogue with the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, yesterday.  It was a direct straight-talking meeting, as one would expect.  I wished Doug Beattie well.  I think he is a very able politician and I look forward to working with him.  The new leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, is likely to meet the Taoiseach shortly and I expect that I will be meeting him, as leader of the DUP, shortly as well.  Of course, we will have an opportunity to meet on other occasions as well in the weeks ahead - I mentioned the British-Irish Council, BIC, earlier.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the North-South Ministerial Council, we can work on making sure that we get the North-South Ministerial Council back up and running.  Both unionist leaders have said that it is their desire to have a good working relationship with the Government in Dublin and certainly we are in that space as well in terms of trying to make sure that we can make North-South Ministerial Council meetings work effectively.  It is a really important pillar of the Good Friday Agreement and the institutions - North-South co-operation on a regular basis.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the UN Security Council, I expected Deputy Brady to raise the Middle East peace process.  Anyone who knows me knows that I have had a long-standing interest in this issue, have been to the region many times and hope to go there many more times.  I, the D&aacute;il and the Government felt that Ireland needed to be clear and vocal in relation to what we were seeing in the latest round of violence between Israel and the Palestinians.  There was an unacceptably high loss of life of children and civilian populations.  I was very vocal about that.  I think it is Ireland's job on the Security Council to call out what we would regard as breaches of international law and where there are concerns, we call them out even if that makes for an uncomfortable political space at times.  We called it out on both sides.  Firing rockets from Gaza into civilian populations is completely unacceptable, is a breach of international law and needs to be utterly condemned, and is not justified under any circumstances, but also the military force that was used on a population in Gaza also needed to be called out, and was by me and the Government.  I refer to the motion that we put down in relation to recognising the scale, the extent, the pace and the strategic nature of the expansion of settlements in the West Bank, in particular, close to East Jerusalem.  It is difficult to interpret such action as anything but <i>de facto<\/i>annexation because of the permanent nature of that infrastructure and the growing population living in settlements on the West Bank now.  It was a reflection of our assessment of what is happening on the ground, and working with many others who were also following that.<br\/><br\/>Let me be very clear.  I want to have a strong and positive diplomatic relationship with others, unlike some who want to expel the Israeli ambassador and want nothing to do with Israel.  Theirs is not the position of the Government.  We believe that the way forward to achieve a peace agreement, a historic peace agreement that can last between Palestinians and Israelis, is to engage with both sides, bluntly and honestly.  There will be times when we strongly disagree with the approach of one side or the other, and we will call that out, but I will certainly continue to adopt the approach of speaking to both sides, honestly and with an open mind.  I think that is the right thing to do, despite calls for me to take a very different approach, that, I think, would be seen internationally as one-sided and therefore limit my ability to be seen as a credible voice on these complex issues.  Let me tell Deputy Brady that I intend on being very much involved, at a UN level and an EU level, in trying to break a political cycle that has continued to deliver misery, hatred, violence and death for far too long.  We have to find a way of breaking that cycle and moving towards a more progressive peace negotiation that can result in two states that are safe, security and, ultimately, prosperous in the future.<br\/><br\/>In terms of overseas missions, just so that the committee will know the extent of the project of expansion of the Department of Foreign Affairs footprint on behalf of Ireland, we have in the past couple of years opened new embassies or representation in Cardiff, Monrovia, Santiago, Bogot&aacute;, Vancouver, Amman in Jordan, Mumbai, Wellington, Frankfurt and Los Angeles, LA.  This year, we are moving ahead with Rabat, Kyiv, Manila and Manchester.  The cycle continues.  We are strategically opening up, developing and investing in footprints in parts of the world where Ireland has an interest, needs to have a strategic voice and can avail of significant opportunities for diplomatic relations, partnerships and trade.  We will continue on that project, which is project Ireland 2025, to double our overall global impact in terms of standing and voice.<br\/><br\/>Finally, in relation to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, which is the Iranian nuclear deal, some people have asked the question, what is an Irish foreign minister doing heading off to Tehran for the first time in 20 years and a few weeks later, inviting an Iranian foreign minister to Dublin for what were fairly substantive discussions.  The reason for that primarily is that we have a specific responsibility on the UN Security Council.  We are the country that is the facilitator for the resolution that is the basis for the Iranian nuclear deal.  We are committed to trying to ensure that that deal gets rebuilt and committed to because a number of years ago then US President Trump moved away from it in a robust way which obviously had a serious consequence.  Ultimately, it is our belief that the world would be a safer place if we have the Iranian nuclear deal in place which provides as many guarantees as we can put in place that Iran is not developing and will not develop a nuclear weapon through robust and transparent international inspections and in return the international community is willing to remove sanctions that would otherwise have been in place in the absence of that deal.  In our view, that makes sense for Iran.  It makes sense for the United States, who are a big partner in this, and for the other parties to the JCPOA who are also committed to rebuilding this agreement.  I would not overplay our role in encouraging Iran back to that negotiating table, and, indeed, others too, but it certainly has been a factor.  That is the story of the Security Council - taking on awkward issues and speaking to people who one may have a strong difference of opinion with in many areas.  It is taking on the role of an international credible country that is involved in big debates and big discussions on big global issues.  This is certainly one of them and that is what we are doing.<\/p><p>Over time, I inform Deputy Brady, we will re-open an embassy in Tehran, probably in 2023 and in the short term we will have a representation there on the premises of the German embassy.  Most European countries have embassies in Tehran.  We will have a presence on the ground to ensure that we are fully informed and have channels of communication open where necessary and appropriate.<\/p><p> On Israel&rsquo;s concerns about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, there are also a number of countries who have real concerns about this and whether they can trust Iran as regards the threat of a nuclear weapon.  Israel is obviously to the fore in that.  I do not want to make any further comment on that apart from saying that any country has the right to defend itself if it feels it is threatened.  As long as that happens within the framework of international law, that is a matter for Israel and for, hopefully, a new government which looks like it is developing in Israel in the past 24 hours but we will have to wait and see what happens in that regard because Israeli politics can be unpredictable.<\/p><p> On passport applications from Northern Ireland, I can provide the statistic to members that in 2020 we received 40,000 such applications representing 10% of the total number of 2020 applications.  Some 40,000 such applications is a big number.<\/p><p> Addressing Deputy Stanton, we are very conscious on the ICT issue that given what has happened in our health system and the cyber attack there that our systems need to be very robust and well protected in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Much private and sensitive information is passing to this Department on a regular basis as is the case for that matter with the Department of Defence.  We are regularly testing our ICT systems to ensure that they are robust.  We have had attempts by people to try to access our system in the Department of Foreign Affairs which is not something that I like to say but it is reality.  I suspect that there is not a foreign office in the world, and certainly not in the western world, that has not had regular attempts to hack into their system.  We need to ensure that our systems are robust in that regard.  I believe that they are but one can never be complacent in this space.<\/p><p> I am pleased to inform the committee that my Department continues to support the Fulbright Commission in Ireland to further education exchange between the United States and Ireland.  We have maintained a commitment of &euro;404,000 for 2021.  The work of the commission has benefited more than 2,000 Irish and US citizens in the areas of scientific research, applied research and the arts in the past four years.  With increased funding for my Department, the Fulbright Commission in Ireland has expanded in the talent that it reaches, bringing in more diverse fields of scholarship such as technology and cyber.  This year 31 Irish Fulbright awardees have been selected for the 2021-2022 season.  We recognise Fulbright as the pre-eminent exchange programme between Ireland and the US and it plays an essential role in building transatlantic understanding and fostering extraordinary academic and people-to-people links, which I wish to clearly state as it is important.  <\/p><p>The news is not as positive on the J1 Visa issue.  In truth, because of travel restrictions this is effectively not happening.  The US Embassy is primarily focused on facilitating US nationals returning to the US and managing the restrictions linked to Covid-19.  I hope that we will see that change in the weeks and months ahead as Ireland and the EU opens up on the basis of a structured Covid-19 certification system.  As Ireland does that from 19 July, we will also look to not only opening up international travel for EU countries and for Irish people within the EU but also for the UK and US on the basis of people travelling with a full vaccination or having recovered from having Covid-19 in the past nine months.  People who are not vaccinated will still probably have to have polymerase chain reaction, PCR, tests before they travel and may be required to quarantine as well although not in hotel quarantine unless, of course, a significant variant of concern issue emerges that we have not seen yet.  I would certainly like to see and I am confident that there will be a situation  that when we open up to EU travel that we will also be opening for people who are vaccinated.  We must not forget that the vast majority of adults in the UK and in the US will be fully vaccinated by the time we reach 19 July and as the summer moves on, just as the vast majority of people here will have been, I am glad to say.<\/p><p> I believe that deals with all of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021060300002#C00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and return now to members and call Deputy Cowen to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021060300002#E00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

The approach we have taken is that Ireland recognises genocide and calls it as such under the precedent and on the back of an international court ruling or if an international consensus builds around a certain issue.  I understand that that is not ideal on a number of levels.<\/p><p>First, it is often not possible for an international court to determine whether genocide took place because of the burden of proof required.  Second, the international consensus issue is often problematic because of political interest, different perspectives and regional interests on the Security Council.  <\/p><p> I take the point in relation to the Yazidi population, which has been targeted and treated in an appalling fashion.  If both Deputies want to follow up with a meeting on that, we can maybe look at whether we can do more in that area.  Iraq is in a vulnerable place with a government trying to find its feet.  There is still a significant presence of foreign troops there.  If we can do more to support the organisations linked with the assessment of what happened to the Yazidi population and how it should be categorised or with humanitarian assistance, I am open to that.  We have a flexible aid budget.  We have to prioritise within it because it is an endless ask but if members want me to focus more on that, I would be happy to do so.  I will follow up with Deputy Cowen on it.  Maybe we can have a meeting on it and I will get a more detailed briefing.<\/p><p> Our consular services will say they have never had an 18 months like we have just been through.  Thousands of Irish people needed assistance and support to understand their options for returning home and navigating their way through Covid restrictions in different parts of the world. That is particularly the case in Australia and New Zealand, where difficult choices are faced by Irish citizens because, once they come home, the chances of them going back, in terms of jobs and career opportunities, have been very limited in the short term due to restrictions.   In other parts of the world, we have had to charter planes to get people home or work with the UK or other EU countries to share the chartering of planes.  We chartered a plan out of Nigeria, a plane out of Peru and we have been in partnership with other countries in chartering planes out of India.<\/p><p> Our consular services have been heroic in quietly getting on with the job.  There has been somewhat of an increase in resources there but most recent increases have been linked to the Passport Office.  We do not have the option to shift huge numbers of new people into consular services.  We put many people who would otherwise have been working in the Passport Office into our consular services to run call centres.  Applications for passports were dramatically down so we had people we could shift into consular services.  Over the Christmas period last year, we essentially had a travel call centre.  We banned all commercial flights between Britain and Ireland.  Instead, we did a deal with Aer Lingus and, predominantly, Ryanair to fly Irish residents home on a chartered schedule each day.  My Department acted as a travel agency and our consular team were under huge pressure through the Christmas period on the phones. <\/p><p> The reason we are not seeing a big increase in expenditure is that we effectively shifted resources into consular services from passport services.  That has not resulted in a Revised Estimate but it meant that the our consular team grew significantly.  As consular cases fall back, international travel opens again and we get more demand in your Passport Office, people have shifted back to the passport service.<\/p><p> We ended up also effectively running a call centre for mandatory hotel quarantine.  That is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Health but the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs have played a big part in ensuring it works efficiently around information call centres, standards in security and making sure everything is being done as it should be.  That involves Defence Forces presence in airports, hotels and the transport systems between them.  This is a Government effort and the year we have been through was so out of the ordinary that we have had to be flexible.

When I asked the Minister about the Government acknowledging and recognising that the Armenian genocide took place, following numerous countries that have done so, he said he would talk to his officials, look at the position adopted to this point and maybe review it.  While it would be difficult to get findings of guilt in court or anything like that, there is a lot of historical evidence showing genocide happened against the Armenian people.  Hence, many countries, including quite recently the US, have come out and said genocide did take place.  It is important to call these things out in the hope it will help in future instances to stop genocides taking place.<\/p> <p>  We have to wait until 15 June for our Yazidi meeting to see what actions we need to take and then follow up with the Minister.

Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief.  Many diverse communities, including Christians and Yazidis, have ancient roots in Iraq.  The EU's Iraq strategy addresses reconciliation and the preservation of Iraq's ethnic and religious diversity.  Full implementation of Iraq's programme for national reconciliation will be important to avoid inflaming sectarian divisions.  We welcome the recent passing by the Iraqi Parliament of a Yazidi female survivors law, which represents progress in addressing the legacy of ISIS crimes against Yazidi and other minority groups.<\/p> <p>  A UN Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da'esh\/ISIL, UNITAD, was established by Resolution 2379 (2017).  It requests the Secretary General to establish an investigative team, headed by a special adviser, Mr. Karim Khan, to support domestic efforts to hold ISIS accountable by collecting, preserving and storing evidence in Iraq of acts that might amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed in Iraq.  The head of UNITAD reports directly to the UN Security Council.<\/p> <p>  In June 2020, Mr. Khan told the Security Council the team had already identified 344 alleged ISIS perpetrators involved with the 2014 massacre of Yazidis in the Sinjar district of northern Iraq.  UNITAD also welcomed a draft Iraqi law, presented in November 2019, which would allow Iraq to prosecute acts committed by ISIS as genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes.  The primary responsibility for investigating crimes normally lies with the host government and UNITAD is helping to build the capacity of the Iraqi authorities to investigate these crimes and prosecute those responsible.<\/p> <p>  The most recent UNITAD report, from November 2020, noted the team had commenced the provision of training and support to Iraqi investigative judges in building case files for the prosecution of ISIS members for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.  Ireland strongly supports the work of UNITAD and will support its mandate at the Security Council if and when it arises.<\/p> <p>  Irish Aid gives &euro;9.5 million to the Iraq humanitarian fund.  We are making a contribution.  I am sorry for the long answer but I know colleagues are interested in and concerned about that matter.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to Deputies on the Armenia issue.  I said we would take a look at it and I thought we had a very good and mature debate on it and there was no evidence of party politics.  There were some genuine concerns raised and I said we would take a look at it, which we will.<\/p> <p>  The truth is our Estimates are relatively straightforward in the work we do and foreign policy is much more complicated.  The committee will speak next to the Minister of State who is responsible for the spending of much money that keeps many people alive, educates many young children and supports many very vulnerable communities.  The Irish Aid programme is respected across the world as one of the most transparent, efficient, effective and impactful aid programmes of any country.  We repeatedly get peer-reviewed and very positive feedback from those peer reviews relating to the impact on the most vulnerable people, or the furthest behind, to use a UN term.  That is how Irish Aid is measured in the work it is doing.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, can deal with those matters as he is more than capable of doing that.  I hope people are happy to allow the Estimates for Vote 28 to move ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021060300002#G00200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the members for their consideration and questions on Vote 28, with sections dealing with our people, our place in Europe, our values, our prosperity, our influence and appropriations-in-aid.

Vote 27 funds approximately two thirds of Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance, ODA, programme, better known to the public as Irish Aid.  The Vote provides the funding necessary to deliver on the Department&rsquo;s high-level goal, which is to work for a more just, secure and sustainable world.<\/p> <p>  For this year, the Government allocated a total of &euro;868 million to official development assistance.  This represents a total increase of almost &euro;30 million, or approximately 4%, on the 2020 level.  That means that 2021 is the seventh consecutive year in which the Government has increased the overall allocation to the development co-operation programme.  Of this total, &euro;571 million is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs through Vote 27 &ndash; International Co-operation.  This is an increase of &euro;20 million, or almost 4%, on last year&rsquo;s allocation.<\/p> <p>  The remaining estimated &euro;297 million is managed through other Departments.  By far the largest component of this other element of ODA is Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU development co-operation budget.  The Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Finance and Justice also manage significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s total ODA.<\/p> <p>  The 2021 allocation for ODA is yet again a demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to international development.  Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme is both an important statement of who we are as a people and a clear reflection of Ireland&rsquo;s values and interests.  The global pandemic we are living through demonstrates that we each have a stake in making this a better world.  The Irish Aid programme is an investment in a better, safer and more sustainable world.  It provides Ireland with an opportunity to expand our influence and to strengthen our partnerships today and for tomorrow.<\/p> <p>  In the Our Shared Future programme for Government, we committed to making incremental, sustainable progress towards achieving the UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income to ODA by 2030.  Sustained, managed increments in ODA will be required to deliver on this commitment.  Careful planning and consultation with other Departments and stakeholders will be also needed to ensure it is done effectively.<\/p> <p>  We are adopting a steady and phased approach, taking into consideration the range of demands across government, recognising that to deliver on this ambition will mean making difficult choices between competing priorities.  For 2021, based on current estimates for gross national income, GNI, the ODA to GNI outturn is projected to run at approximately 0.32%, which is a similar level to 2020 but a significant increase in cash terms.<\/p> <p>  Official development assistance is an integral component of Ireland&rsquo;s overall foreign policy and national presence overseas, enabling Ireland to respond to complex human needs and humanitarian crises around the world.  Ireland has built a distinguished track record of responding to global development challenges and delivering a high quality, untied and coherent approach to development co-operation.  A Better World, Ireland&rsquo;s policy for international development, provides the framework for our development co-operation programme in the decade ahead.  A whole-of-government policy, A Better World affirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to realising the central pledge of the sustainable development goals to reach \"the furthest behind first\".<\/p><p>To do so, Ireland focuses our efforts on four policy priorities: gender equality; reducing humanitarian need; climate action; and strengthening governance.  The policy also outlines a commitment to intensity work in three clusters of interventions where Ireland has proven expertise namely, protection, food and people.<\/p><p> As the Covid-19 pandemic is increasing poverty and vulnerability around the world, Ireland will continue to play our part in responding to the needs of those most affected.  This year, we will continue to invest in global public health and contribute to global efforts to develop a vaccine and ensure it will be available to people regardless of income or where they are from.  We are investing money through Vote 27, and knowledge.  Officials in the Department are working with HSE experts to deliver improvements in public health in partner countries in Africa.<\/p><p> In 2020 the OECD Development Assistance Committee, DAC, undertook a peer review of Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation policy, programme and systems.  The peer review found Ireland is a strong development partner, with many areas of excellence.  The quality and impact of Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation programme was found to be high, with Ireland allocating overseas development aid and assistance, ODA, to least developed countries and fragile states, priority partners and sectors.  This clear focus enables Ireland to channel our development assistance to where it is needed most, to exercise leadership and obviously to make a visible difference.<\/p><p> Ireland does development well.  We have a well-earned reputation for the quality of our aid programme and being highly effective at reaching those in extreme poverty.  What we do works, and has real impact.  Ireland, and we as Irish people, can be proud of our programme.  Our international development cooperation and humanitarian action, along with our human rights, peacekeeping, disarmament and security policies and actions, are at the heart of our efforts to create a more secure, stable and inclusive world.  It reflects our best interests as well as our values.

I welcome the Minister of State.  I begin by commending the work of people in his section, both at home and abroad.  When I was at the Department of Justice, we spent a certain amount of time in the UN in New York, Geneva and other places.  As the Chairman knows well, we spent our time there lobbying for a place on the UN Security Council, which we got in the end.  During that time we met with many colleagues and the respect in which Ireland is held by those other countries is just enormous.  It was amazing to see.  Much of that is down to the work done by our ODA people abroad, the money we spend and the relationships we have.  It is important to say that.  It was tangible, it was warm and it was friendly and Ireland was highly respected.  The Minister of State will get an opportunity when the travel restrictions are over to meet some of these people as well and I am sure he will agree with me.<\/p> <p>  I have just a few questions.  On the climate unit and the money being spent on countering climate disruption, could the Minister of State give a few examples of how it is being spent in various parts of the world?  I met people from some of the Pacific islands and they were worried about their islands being swamped by rising sea levels, for instance.  As such, this is a real issue.  There are some people out there who feel it has gone past the point of no return in this regard.  The Minister of State might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  An issue has arisen which may not be in the Minister of State's remit but which he may wish to comment on anyway.  Quite a number of Irish people are in places like Dubai and the Middle East generally as teachers and want to come home for the summer break.  They have been vaccinated with a vaccine not approved by the European Medicines Agency, EMA, such as Sinopharm, which is the Chinese one, or the Russian one, or others.  It appears there may be some difficulties in their coming back, if they do so.  Will the Minister of State comment on that situation because the time when these people will be coming home is coming up very soon?  People have been in contact with myself and others about that.<\/p> <p>  I noticed another issue in appendix 2 of the documentation we were given.  There is an item called \"Other Channels\" at 16% and &euro;1.42 million.  The Minister of State may not have the details to hand now but he might make available to us at some stage a breakdown of that considerable amount of money.  A number of years ago there was a discussion about in-donor refugee costs, meaning some of the ODA money was being spent here in the country on refugees and asylum seekers.  I am not sure if that is still the case.  The Minister of State might comment on that, or send us a note later if he is not in a position to do so now.  To finish off, the work being done by our ODA people is amazing and the money is being spent in a very good way.  I thank the Minister of State's officials for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021060300002#H00300","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I begin by expressing my support for the increase in the ODA budget; it is up &euro;30 million, which is roughly 4%.  It is critical we maintain our commitment to reach the figure of 0.7% of GDP by 2030, to which the Government has committed.  The Minister of State might outline the road map for how we are going to get to that position because progress has been very slow.  I have serious concerns that target will be missed so I ask him to outline the road map for that.<\/p> <p>  I turn to the recent demolition of Palestinian structures and the destruction of donor-funded projects in the occupied territories.  We had a number of witnesses before the joint committee and one of the groups, the West Bank Protection Consortium, gave us evidence that in 2020, for example, 156 donor-funded structures were destroyed by the Israeli occupying forces in the occupied territories.  That was a massive increase of 23% on the 2019 figure of Palestinian structures destroyed.  When we talk of structures, these are of course houses, schools, solar panels and other basic infrastructure.  The West Bank Protection Consortium told us it had lodged a compensation claim of around &euro;625,000 with the Israeli authorities over the destruction of those donor-funded structures.  The consortium told us not a penny of that had been paid, yet this is bigger than getting the money back off the Israelis, it is ultimately about holding them to account for their illegal activities.  What actions are being taken by the Minister of State and by the Department to follow up and ensure that Israel is held to account, and that compensation claim is paid out for the destruction of those donor-funded structures?<\/p> <p>  Another area I want to touch on is Ethiopia, particularly the Tigray area.  Ireland is one of the largest partners in terms of Irish aid to Ethiopia and the Tigray area.  This has obviously been going on for many decades and we have seen the horrific abuses and we have seen deaths.  We have seen the humanitarian crisis that has unfortunately evolved because of the conflict which is still playing out, not just by Ethiopian troops but also with the involvement of neighbouring countries.  I therefore ask the Minister of State to outline the impact the crisis in Ethiopia is having both on the budget for Irish Aid, the impact it is having on humanitarian access and our future plans in relation to Ethiopia.<\/p> <p>  I also want to touch on probably the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world, which has been largely forgotten by the international community, namely, the situation in Yemen.  War, cholera, poverty, Covid and a looming famine are having an absolutely devastating impact on civilians there.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State outline what Ireland is doing in terms of our obligations and response to the horrific situation in Yemen?<\/p><p> Lastly, I wish to refer to the roll out of vaccines.  I reiterate that I welcome the increase in the overseas development aid budget but believe it is necessary to consider the key issues thrown up by the Covid-19 pandemic.  There is no doubt that lower income countries such as Yemen and, unfortunately, many other countries have been impacted more severely than other nations regarding the long-term impact of Covid.  The impact of the pandemic will severely impact far outside infection and mortality rates in areas that already suffer so many serious challenges such as hunger, conflict, global warming and poverty,  just to name a few.  We, in Ireland, should be commended on increasing our funding to the World Health Organization.  When it comes to vaccine inequality and access issues for people who live in lower income countries, as the Minister is aware, these are also related to intellectual property rights and on reaching agreement on a Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, waiver at the World Trade Organization.  I believe it is incumbent on the Irish Government to play a constructive role and to use its status within the EU to influence its position ahead of the meeting by the TRIPS council on 8 and 9 June.<\/p><p> We need to lead the charge on the TRIPS waiver.  Unfortunately, we have been very mute in terms of supporting the TRIPS waiver, which is and will continue to have a massive negative impact on developing countries across the world.  It has the potential to undo a lot of good work in terms of trying to bring peace to countries such as Mali and other countries where women, in particular, who have been imbedded into peace process have been pulled out of those processes to look after their families and communities.   Until we have a TRIPS waiver, and until we see equality in terms of the roll out of the vaccines, unfortunately, it has the potential to undo a lot of good work that has been done.  I ask the Minister of State to outline his views of the TRIPS waiver.  What is being done to articulate the need for a TRIPS waiver?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021060300002#H00700","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":293,"content":"<p>Members will be aware that aspects of the TRIPS waiver are more primarily a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  However, I am sure the Minister of State will acknowledge the report that this committee undertook earlier this year on the matter of global vaccines, vaccine equality and the importance of ensuring that every effort is made to have vaccines distributed, particularly to the less developed regions of the world.<\/p> <p>  There was an earlier issue that arose with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that the Minister of State might be in a position to address briefly and that is the engagement, or otherwise, his Department and himself have had with the American Administration, with particular reference to the Irish undocumented, under the heading of diaspora.  It is an issue that has been ongoing for some time and we wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours there.  Perhaps there might be a fresh impetus having regard to the change of Administration in the United States.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady mentioned the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia.  Again, in the opening comment there was mention of the importance of protection, food and people.  Obviously, the humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region is striking at the heart of protection, food and people.  It seems that the Eritrean Government is not in the business of withdrawing its troops as initially stated early in the year by both the Eritrean Government and the Ethiopian Government.  This has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in the region.  The harvest is now in doubt in terms of the inability of farmers to plan and sow crops.  There is a humanitarian crisis looming and a real risk of famine.  Obviously Ireland has a position in the United Nations with reference to the Human Rights Council and the Security Council.  We trust that every effort is being made having regard to the special relationship between Ireland and Ethiopia over the years.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I wish to acknowledge the great work that both the Minister of State and his Department are undertaking for and on behalf of Ireland in areas of great challenge across the region, as evidenced by the questions from Deputies Stanton and Brady to date.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021060300002#J00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I shall follow on directly from the comments made by the Chairman and that of Deputy Brady about Ethiopia and Tigray.  Obviously it is, as the Chairman quite rightly described in his remarks, a situation in which Ireland is very actively involved both from the UN side and our relationship with Ethiopia.  It is an important country for us in terms of Irish Aid.  Obviously, we very much welcome the situation where we now have some inspections on the ground from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission to investigate reported atrocities there.  The key situation is to try to get a peaceful cessation of hostilities.  We did put in emergency aid worth just over &euro;3 million and we have an ongoing aid programme with Ethiopia.  As the year progresses we will look at reviewing that.  Very much our goals and efforts, particularly through our UN involvement in the Security Council, is to try to bring about a peaceful solution there.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanton mentioned a couple of things.  Apologies, as this is the first time doing this and if I miss out on anything I will come back to it or attempt to come back to it.  The Deputy is quite right in his comments about the high regard in which we are held by so many people in terms of the work done over the years by so many in Irish Aid and in terms of work on the ground, in particular.  That represented itself in the response of people to the Covid pandemic outbreak right around the world both in terms of our missions, the staff on the ground and Irish NGOs.  I refer to the cumulative response to immediately work, to adapt and do quick changes to work to mitigate the immediate impact of Covid in the areas in which they worked.  The way we did that was a credit to them.  They have worked in an incredible way over the past 18 months and a very large thanks is due to them for that.<\/p> <p>  One key thing about the climate unit is that a lot of the previous approach was about mitigation.  What we are primarily looking at is adaption and making climate finance available for that.  Deputy Stanton or another contributor quite rightly mentioned the small islands and the countries that are most affected.  When we talk in the West about staving off the impacts of climate change, those small islands and countries will say the impacts are with them now and that it is not a solution down the road in five, ten or 15 years that is needed but immediate solutions to help them deal with rising tides and with the  impacts, particularly severe weather that can have a devastating impact.  We very much work in that space.  In the area of climate finance, we are seeing a significant increase in our commitment, particularly in terms of moving the focus away from mitigation to adaptation and putting that in place.<\/p><p>Even simple things, such as working with village communities on putting in place a cooker burner system that stops wood being burned on an open fire, has a direct benefit for rural communities in Malawi and other places.  There is a combination of mitigating climate impacts as well health impacts through direct immediate measures.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanton raised the question of vaccines.  It is probably not directly in my area but I will comment on it because it is very much a diaspora related area.  As the Deputy correctly mentioned, a large number of Irish people, in particular teachers, work in the United Arab Emirates and various parts of the Middle East.  Usually they go out on a 12 month programme and return to Ireland around this time of year.  We need to look at this situation.  The Chinese vaccine is recognised by the World Health Organization as valid and this is the vaccine in overwhelming use in the Middle East.  Therefore, Irish people will be returning fully vaccinated with a certificate of full vaccination.  We need to think about broadening how we look at this, in terms of opening up aviation to allow for this vaccine to be taken into account.  If I am correct, and if not I apologise, one of the quirks is that the US has not approved AstraZeneca as a vaccine and if it took the same approach as we are taking in Europe we could have all types of interesting scenarios.  Globally we need to look at this and state when World Health Organization approved vaccines have been administered that people are fully vaccinated, and we should look at this as proof of vaccination.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanton is quite right that there is a figure on the development aid side in the Department of Justice.  The figure has reduced this year.  As the Deputy is well aware from his previous role, which he did so well, there was a first year cost on the refugee side of things in Ireland.  I believe I have covered all of the questions.<\/p><p> To answer Deputy Brady, the key issue for me in terms of the roadmap to achieve the 0.7% target is, as I said in my opening remarks, to have a very stable and incremental approach.  Unfortunately, we have seen other countries that moved very quickly to 0.7% and had to pull back from it.  The direct impact of a country pulling back from it on millions of people's lives is even worse.  The main focus of what I want to do through the budgetary process in the coming years is to negotiate a steady and sustained path so that when we reach the 0.7% level we want to reach, not only will we have buy-in on the political side of things but also from society and the country at large and, therefore, that we have a ring-fence around it that makes it a stable amount and we do not end up in the situation we have, unfortunately, seen in other nearby parts of the world, where there was 0.7% and then there was a reduction, which had quite severe impacts.<\/p><p> I join Deputy Brady in his condemnation.  It is awful when we see aid projects funded either by Irish Aid or the European Union targeted or destroyed as part of any hostilities or situation developing.  Structures are in place to enable compensation to be sought and this should be done.  Even if something is going to become a target or eventually gets damaged because of a situation, it is still imperative that we are there putting in place the aid in the first place and making a contribution.  As has the Deputy, I have seen some very upsetting pictures of a destroyed building, school or institution that was doing so much good on the ground for a community and is now lying in ruins.  What is key is to make the contribution in the first place, and if we have to go back and do it again we will have to be continuous in our support to make sure we do so.<\/p><p> I addressed Ethiopia at the beginning.  The Deputy spoke about vaccines and access to vaccines.  I always speak about two matters with regard to vaccines and they are very important.  It is vital that we have as much equality of access to vaccine as possible.  COVAX is really helping to deliver this.  Very much from the conversations I have had, it is important to ensure we have the funding in place.  This is something of which Ireland can be particularly proud because an area of development aid in which we are particularly strong is health systems to deliver the vaccines.  There is absolutely no point in flooding a country with vaccines unless we have enabled it to have in place the health system to deliver them.  We have a commitment of more than &euro;100 million in 2021 on global health.  This is all about what we have learnt over the years in our experience of dealing with Gavi and other institutions and organisations in this area.  To make sure it works not only do we have to ensure the vaccines are there but also make sure the healthcare professionals are there and the right structures and facilities are in place, as are the right PPE and all of the things necessary in the background to enable a health system to work in order to get vaccine delivery.  This is something on which we have been very strong.  COVAX is ramping up at this stage and we are beginning to see increased access.<\/p><p> As the Chair mentioned, intellectual property falls very much within another Department's area.  We as a country are open to looking at how we can work co-operatively together with all other countries.  We acknowledge what President Biden has said.  We acknowledge the comments of the European Commission in this regard.  While all of this is important, it is a long-term process and it will enable many discussions to take place in many institutions over months.  What COVAX is doing is putting vaccines on the ground now.  This is why we have put &euro;3 million into it, to make sure there is an immediate flow of vaccines.  Yes, more needs to be done and I hope we will see very quickly a substantial increase in what COVAX is doing.  It is a very positive way of delivering.<\/p><p> Deputy Brady mentioned Yemen.  Obviously, the situation in Yemen is a horror story that has fallen off the world's headlines and in many ways has not received attention.  Consistently what we will find through the work of Ireland, and the work of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on the Security Council, is that we have a tradition as a country of prioritising conflict resolution and working with the international institutions in this area, and it is something on which we are very strong.  This is something we will continue to do.  I hope I have covered most of what was asked in the questions.<\/p><p> The Chair asked about the visa situation.  We welcome the change of Administration in the United States and the tone President Biden set within weeks of coming into office.  He spoke openly about looking again, not just in the context of Ireland on which we have been working so hard but in an international context, at working on pathways to citizenship and regularising the status of people.  This is a very welcome step.  We welcome the work Congress is doing at present on this with the Administration.  We will continue the work we have been doing.  The undocumented Irish are people for whom we have worked very strongly over a number of years.  It was very difficult in recent years to try to get a resolution on this.  I hope this time around that Congress and the Administration will consider it as part of an enlarged solution.  In the meanwhile, there are other visas such as the E3 Visa, for which we will continue to prioritise access.<\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has mentioned that there is a very difficult situation with regard to J1 visas at present.  The decision on access is one for the US Administration.  There are many deeply disappointed students in Ireland who would love to have had the option of a J1 visa.<\/p><p>I got a J1 visa and really enjoyed it but, unfortunately, that was a long time ago.  I do not know whether this was raised, but it also impacted students who have gained scholarships to a large number of American universities and received a full offer of a place in the university but, unfortunately, do not have a visa access point.  We continue to work to see what we can do in that regard as well.<\/p><p> I think that covers most of what I was asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021060300002#J00300","speaker":"1573","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I am aware from my constituency of issues relating to people who are currently in the United States and have a difficulty renewing their visa.

As the Minister of State noted, it is an exciting time for those availing of a J1 visain terms of building up experience of life and otherwise.<\/p> <p>  There is time remaining in the meeting.  I will go back to Deputy Brady.  I thank the Minister of State for dealing comprehensively with the questions asked.  Deputy Stanton raised an issue relating to Irish returnees from the United Arab Emirates, possibly from Abu Dhabi or Dubai, and the issue of the recognition of the vaccine or otherwise.

I appreciate the Minister of State may not be aware of the details of this issue.  If he is not, he may be able to get a note for the committee on it.  There was specific reference to it being up to the Government to follow up with regard to the non-payment of the compensation claim.  If he does not have knowledge of the issue, that is fine, but it is important.  I hear what he is saying in terms of going in to rebuild structures that are demolished in the occupied territories, but the point here is about accountability.  I mentioned the historic decision made by the D&aacute;il last week when it declared that annexation has taken place in the occupied territories.  Such annexation is illegal under international law and there needs to be accountability and consequences for those measures.  Similarly, there must be consequences for the Israeli occupation forces in the context of the demolition and destruction of Irish-funded structures and aid in the occupied territories that have been illegally annexed.  The compensation claim has been made, but what is the Government doing in terms of following up on that to ensure there is accountability?  It is not good enough for us to fund it and put it in place only for it to be demolished and subsequently rebuilt.  The demolition cycle will continue if there is no accountability.  Like in the case of the illegal actions being perpetrated on civilians in the Gaza Strip, unless there is accountability, Israel will continue to act with perceived impunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021060300002#L00300","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Obviously, follow-up on this issue takes place on the ground through our diplomats.

It is about putting a situation in place on the ground which, as a by-product, will stop migration and people having the necessity to move.  If one looks at what causes most global migration, much of it relates to food shortages, such as where crops fail due to climate, etc.  What we are trying to do in so many of our programmes is to address such issues in order that people have the ability and the means to remain on the ground.  I have not had the chance to discuss some of our really positive programmes, particularly in the areas of education and gender equality.  We are one of the strongest countries in terms of leading supports in areas to ensure that girls can remain in school.  We can break the cycle of poverty through the work we do in ensuring there is education available for young girls which keeps them in school.  That not only benefits young girls in society, but also the whole of society in terms of breaking that poverty cycle.  All of those things combined, which is what Irish Aid is really about, will, it is hoped, enable countries to move away from the situation of people in those countries wanting to move to Europe.  The current situation in that regard is not sustainable.<\/p> <p>  I am often challenged by people who ask why we are spending money on overseas aid and what the benefits are to Ireland and Europe of all this money going there.  The benefit is that the world cannot continue to have the type of structure it has had to date for so many reasons, including the climate challenge we are now facing.  We need to create a far greater equality between the wealthy countries of western Europe and elsewhere in the western world and those in the remainder of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere in Africa, where there is still devastating poverty.  If we do not do so and proactively engage on that issue, our children and our children's children will feel the impact.  The impact will be felt even more quickly than that.  As the Deputy stated, we saw through the events in the Mediterranean what can happen very quickly and the appalling loss of life that can result when people are desperate and wish to move.<\/p> <p>  I think the figure he is seeking in that regard is 16% on the justice side.  I think it is &euro;142 million.  I will double check that and come back to the Deputy with a note on it.  Appendix 2 is &euro;142.5 million, which relates to the other channels the Deputy asked about in his original contribution.  As I outlined in response to Deputy Brady in terms of the pathway to allocating 0.7% of GNI* to ODA, it is very much an incremental approach that is designed to make it sustainable.  I think I have covered the points raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021060300002#L00600","speaker":"1573"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":302,"content":"<p>The Minister of State gave a comprehensive answer on vaccines but there is one thing on which I am unclear.

To be clear, the situation is that only vaccines approved by the EMA are regarded as complying fully with our requirements and obviating the need for quarantine.  That is the situation as it stands.  Teachers vaccinated with the Chinese vaccine would be required to quarantine on their return.  It is a situation which includes many Irish citizens and members of the diaspora, which is my area of responsibility, who view themselves as being fully vaccinated and who are living their lives in that way in the countries in which they reside.  They are enjoying all the benefits of being fully vaccinated, and yet that is on foot of a vaccine that the WHO has recognised but that we do not.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Health was asked about this matter in the D&aacute;il as well.  He stated these matters must be considered in the context of where we will be in the coming months.  I am also conscious that we must be guided by advice from the NIAC and all the public health advice.  It is what feeds into the Government's decision-making in this area.  From the perspective of the diaspora, which is my main area of responsibility, therefore, it is important to recognise that situations of this type will arise involving Irish citizens.  It will not just affect the teacher cohort we have been talking about because many locations globally are using vaccines supplied by Russia or China.  Therefore, this is a matter for us to consider in the context of the advice we get from the health professionals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2021060300002#M00200","speaker":"1573"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who was with us earlier, and their officials for attending.

The CSO is an independent office of the Civil Service under the aegis of the Taoiseach.  The role of the director general of the CSO, as prescribed by the Statistics Act 1993, provides that the officeholder acts independently and exercises sole responsibility in professional statistical matters.  The National Statistics Board, with the agreement of the Taoiseach, has the general function of guiding the overall strategic direction of the CSO.  This independent position reflects international best practice for the organisation of official statistics.<\/p> <p>  The Central Statistics Office plays a vital role in the functioning of the State in providing independent and verifiable data to citizens and policymakers on a broad range of topics, including social, economic and environmental issues.  The ability of the CSO to inform has been evident throughout the current pandemic.  The CSO delivered on the vast majority of its planned statistical work programme for 2020, publishing 421 releases and publications.  Of these, 29 were new products specifically related to providing insight on the impact of the pandemic across society and businesses, for policymakers and citizens alike.<\/p> <p>  The CSO delivered 59 individual publications from the 29 new products, which included publications focused on the business and social impact of Covid-19, the numbers of deaths and cases, the impact on the labour market and experimental outputs on excess deaths and on mobility during the pandemic.  Alongside the new products developed and delivered to provide additional insight, the CSO provided statistical and analytical expertise and new data services to support analysing health data sources in a safe and secure environment.  The CSO has supported modelling, analysis of health and of real time data and analysis to provide insight regarding trends and identifying emerging issues all to support central government&rsquo;s response to the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has, of course, impacted on the CSO's statistical work programme during the past year, with the greatest impact on processes that require face-to-face interactions with survey respondents.  The single largest casualty by scale was the postponement of the census of population from 2021 to 2022.  On consideration of the challenges caused by Covid-19, the Government decided to postpone the 2021 census until April 2022 to enable the CSO to undertake a comprehensive, inclusive and safe census in 2022, which will provide valuable and accurate data for our country in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>  Other surveys, such as pilots for the programme for international assessment of adult competencies and the household budget survey, were postponed until 2021.  Face-to-face collection at airports and ports also ceased during 2020.  While face-to-face interviewing for household surveys ceased, new technological solutions and mixed mode collection options were implemented to maximise the delivery of the statistical work programme.  The CSO has also developed new interactive graphics, infographics, new formats, namely, bulletins and frontier series, and outputs to provide the additional insight needed by the public, businesses and policymakers on the impact of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  The CSO has continued to publish key economic indicators and has tracked the impact of the crisis on business sectors and the economy, including via the monthly exports and imports of goods, the quarterly national accounts, Government deficit and debt, the quarterly balance of payments, the labour force survey, the monthly unemployment and live register figures and the survey on income and living conditions, among others.<\/p> <p>  Planning has continued for census 2022 with the options for a potential census in 2026 are also being considered.  In both cases, an increase in the use of administrative data is being explored and the possibility of the development of an online response facility is being considered in respect of census 2026 which, if approved by Government, would mark 100 years since the first State census.<\/p> <p>  The CSO is continuing to work on a survey on the prevalence of sexual violence, with a pilot going into the field in 2021, and is progressing work on the data collection and processing of the next wave of the State's longitudinal study of children and youth, Growing up in Ireland, from 2023.<\/p> <p>  The CSO now faces a different challenge in measuring how our economy and society emerge from the Covid restrictions.  Sustainable, secure access to data and the reuse of high-value data sources in the form of administrative data and some private data sources are essential for the CSO to provide timely and accurate data that are meaningful to policymakers.  To enable this, the CSO has been to the forefront of building the national data infrastructure under action 24 of the Civil Service renewal programme on improving how data are collected, managed and shared.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic has confirmed what we have always known, that along with access, the quality of the data sources is crucial.  Continuing to build the national data infrastructure across the public service is a key component to delivering on the quality necessary for the creation of official statistics and to deliver the broader data framework to serve the needs of the State.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant international dimension to the work of the CSO.  The EU institutions, primarily EUROSTAT and the ECB, the International Monetary Fund, the OECD and other international bodies are all important users of official statistics.  These bodies also have a significant role in defining and monitoring standards for the compilation of comparable information.  The CSO subscribes to the standards set out in the UN's fundamental principles of official statistics and the European statistics code of practice.<\/p> <p>  New EU legislation introduced in 2015 fundamentally changed the role of the CSO, and that of its director general.  Following this legislation, the director general of the CSO now has responsibility for co-ordinating and overseeing the quality of all European official statistics in Ireland.  It is now the responsibility of the CSO to ensure that all compilers of European statistics in Ireland are adhering to the quality and methodological standards set out by the EU and detailed in the European statistics code of practice.<\/p><p> Turning to the CSO's budget, the net allocation for 2021 is &euro;63.155 million.  The funding provided reflects the Government's commitment to the office to meet its obligations under national and EU law, to continue developing the Irish statistical system, and to produce new outputs to meet domestic demand through the provision of trusted and robust official statistics.  Members of the public are increasingly aware of, and able to access, statistics and indicators on social, economic and environmental issues, as demonstrated by nearly 15 million web hits on the CSO website in 2020.<\/p><p> I commend the values and principles that inform the CSO's work.  The CSO makes an important contribution to Ireland's public service and public policy by providing a high-quality and, importantly, independent statistical service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021060300002#A01700","speaker":"1475","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I will give her the position, and if she needs more detail, I will try to get it to her directly.  The Deputy is referencing Vote 6, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  The majority of expenditure on external expertise by that office and by the Office of the Attorney General is on engagement with counsel, whose services are required so the State can adequately defend itself in legal proceedings taken against it and ensure it is not exposed to significant financial or reputational risk as a result of such proceedings.  They jointly operate a system of evaluating the work done by each counsel and then decide on the appropriate fee in each and every case.<\/p> <p>  The Chief State Solicitor's office has, since 2019, instigated a far more intensive process of evaluation of fees to be paid in a tight budgetary management process.  This is being supported in that particular office by the work of a high-level professional fees control group and greater guidance to staff.  The methodologies for assessing fees at the higher levels consist of the application of the assessment process.  Following nomination by the Attorney General, counsel undertake the legal work and submit a fee note.  That is evaluated and a decision is then made on what level of fees are reasonable for the work, taking into account the complexity of the case, the amount of work done by counsel and his or her performance.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy stated, it is fair to say that fees paid by the State are lower than those in private practice.  Expenditure under that particular subhead is difficult to predict as it is a demand-led service.  The number of cases before the courts and the value of actions taken against the State is outside the control of that particular office.  Projections are based on expenditure in previous years but it can fluctuate as well.  If the Deputy needs any further detail, I can ask that it is sent to her. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021060300002#C00900","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I have a quick follow-up question.

As the committee is aware, the Moriarty tribunal was established in October 1997 and published its first report in 2006, with its second report in March 2011.  Following completion of its final report the tribunal is dealing with applications for third-party costs.  The tribunal is also subject to a number of legal proceedings.  The total amount paid by this Department in respect of the tribunal from its inception in 1997 up to the end of April 2021 was &euro;66.3 million.  It will not be possible to ascertain the overall cost until all third-party costs have been settled.  Provision of &euro;4.209 million is included in the Estimates for 2021.<\/p> <p>  The Cregan commission of investigation, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, commission, was established by Government order in June 2015 following consultation with Oireachtas parties.  The commission was originally required to investigate certain transactions, activities and management decisions of the IBRC between January 2009 and February 2013.  Mr. Justice Cregan submitted an interim report in November 2015 that raised a number of significant issues that had arisen with regard to legal and professional privilege, banking confidentiality, and where the commission considered changes were required to its terms of reference.  New legislation, the Commission of Investigation (Irish Bank Resolution Corporation) Act 2016, was enacted to provide a new legal basis for the commission.<\/p><p>The commission&rsquo;s terms of reference were amended following consultation with the Opposition representatives to provide that the first module of its work was the transaction with Siteserv plc.<\/p><p> In 2020, a total expenditure of &euro;2.2 million was incurred by the IBRC commission with costs since its establishment in 2015 of &euro;9.9 million.  The commission&rsquo;s original deadline for reporting, as members know, was 31 December 2015.  The commission submitted its ninth interim report on 8 April 2021 in which it requested a further extension of it timeframe for reporting on the Siteserv transaction, until 31 October 2021.  The Taoiseach granted the commission&rsquo;s request for a further extension to its timeframe to report, given the apparent advanced stage of preparation of its final report.  If the commission&rsquo;s request was not granted it would have effectively dissolves the commission with no findings to show for in return for the substantial costs incurred to date and those incurred but not yet paid.<\/p><p> In relation to the Cooke commission of investigation, the NAMA commission was established on 3 June 2017.  Mr. Justice John Cooke is the commission&rsquo;s sole member.  In the first module of its work, the commission is charged with investigating the sale by NAMA of its Project Eagle portfolio.  The commission&rsquo;s original deadline for reporting was 31 June 2018, but following several requests from the commission, its timeframe for reporting has been extended.  Most recently, in March 2021, the Taoiseach granted the commission&rsquo;s request for an extension of its timeframe for reporting until the end of September 2021.<\/p><p> In 2020, a total expenditure of &euro;855,000 was incurred by the NAMA commission with a total cost since its establishment in 2017 of &euro;3 million.

I raise it as often as I can with the Taoiseach because this is now the tenth year since the murder of that young man on the roadside.  It is two years and almost six months since the scoping exercise commenced.  The family is deeply upset that the scoping exercise has not concluded and the work of the inquiry, or whatever may be suggested, is more limited than it had expected.  Is there anything that can be done through the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office to speed up that process and ensure we have a wide-ranging investigation into all aspects leading up to this young man&rsquo;s death and thereafter.  I refer to the failure of the courts, for example, the failure of the DPP&rsquo;s office and the failure of the Garda in particular, in this regard.

I raised it with previous holders of the office of Taoiseach when they came before the committee, so I am not doing anything extraordinary in raising it here again with the Minister of State representing the Taoiseach.  I refer to the Grace case and the 46 other cases which are being dealt with by the Department of Health.  It is shocking that the State would not show more compassion in respect of those cases.  These were non-verbal, mentally challenged young men and women.  We do not know the outcome.  While the investigations are ongoing, it has now been years spent on this.  As Head of Government, I ask the Taoiseach to ensure this is brought to a speedy conclusion, not just for Grace, as she was known, but for the other 46 individuals.  It is a reflection on the Government when we do not show this type of compassion and understanding in cases like these.  I ask that the Minister of State ensures he is given that information.<\/p> <p>  As for the whistleblowing legislation, which this committee is undertaking to review on foot of the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, it is greatly important that there be a whole-of-government intervention in this regard because it does not pertain to just one Department but will spread across numerous Departments, as it has done.  There are still outstanding cases being fought in the courts.  There is one case in particular about which I have spoken to the Taoiseach and the Minister.  It is to do with a whistleblower in Cork Institute of Technology, CIT.<\/p> <p>  When these matters are not dealt with, they linger on and affect the lives of people, whether they are those generally associated with the Grace case or the individual in the CIT case, as well as other whistleblowers.  It is likewise with the Shane O&rsquo;Farrell case.  Perhaps driven through the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office, we should be establishing a more efficient manner in dealing with all of these matters in order that they can be heard publicly and we can learn from the processes and give some closure and comfort to the families and individuals concerned.<\/p><p>As I have said to the Minister of State previously, I have raised this matter with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, when he was Taoiseach, and the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, when they were before the committee.

The point was made yesterday by the Secretary General, Martin Fraser, and I am hopeful the Taoiseach might comment on that.  At yesterday's meeting, the Taoiseach may have misunderstood me as I was not talking generally about civil servants.  Rather, I was talking specifically about the Secretaries General in terms of their appearances before committees.  That needs to be strengthened in the context of the work that committees do to ensure that we achieve the type of transparency and accountability that are required.  The Taoiseach, as the Head of Government, should reinforce that point with the Secretaries General of the different Departments to assist the committees in their work.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is going through the Estimates with the committee because we could not find a date to accommodate the Taoiseach.

In addition, the LDA will be required to report to the Minister on its progress on a periodic basis, with the first report due in 2024.

Amendments Nos. 61 and 62 seek to substitute the provision in section 8 that the report that the LDA is required to submit to the Minister on the achievement of the purposes of the Act should be prepared annually instead of every five years.  While I understand the intention behind the proposed amendment, I am opposing these amendments, as the provision for an annual report is already included at section 47.  In addition, the acquisition and development of land can take a period of time so it is not appropriate that this report is done on an annual basis.  It should be noted that the report by the LDA specified in section 8(2) is required by 31 March 2024 and every five years thereafter will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  In addition, under section 8, the Minister can at any stage require the LDA to report to him or her on the LDA's progress in achieving the purposes of the Bill.  In addition, the LDA will be required to report to the Minister on its progress on a periodic basis, with the first report due in 2024.<\/p> <p>  Under section 47, the LDA is already required to furnish the Minster with an annual report by 30 June each year.

I am genuinely surprised by the Minister of State's response because, on the one hand, he seems to be saying that there is a provision elsewhere in the Bill for annual reports, but the provision that there would be an initial annual report and then a report every five years seems to contradict that.  Perhaps he could explain the position because it could be the case that I do not understand the relationship between the two relevant sections of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I find it incredible that anybody would be against the publication of an annual report by any State agency, commercial or non-commercial, that is going to be spending substantial sums of taxpayers' money and engaging in substantial land and residential property deals with other State agencies and potentially with commercial actors, depending on what happens.  That is surprising given all the difficulties we have had, for example, with NAMA, and the lack of accountability and transparency and subsequently the very significant charges that deals were done without the adequate level of attention to the public interest.  We only get access to that information when it comes to light several years later, either in the Comptroller and Auditor General's look-back report or through good investigative journalism.  Surely, if the Government wants the public to have confidence in this new agency, the publication of an annual report and the maximum level of transparency would be a good thing.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 70 relates to a requirement for the Minister to put in the public domain information regarding directions to the agency within 30 days of those directions, as opposed to \"as soon as practicable\", which is the wording in the Bill.  Again, the public and Opposition and backbench Government Deputies need to have access to the maximum level of information about the operations of this agency to protect the public interest.

If the Minister considers an annual review is too frequent and it is every two years, I could probably live with that, but as it is a new agency an annual review would ensure that the LDA is operating in compliance with the purposes of the legislation.  The reason I am tabling the amendment is that it is a good, sensible measure.  To be clear, the Bill allows for an annual report.  That side of it is fine, but every five years for the review of the achievement of the purposes of the legislation is far too infrequent, especially given that the agency is new.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#C00800","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I want to avoid any doubt in terms of the conflation of two different issues.  The aim of the annual report is to ensure that the agency is accountable in terms of its actions and operations.  Its performance in the context of the achievement of the objectives outlined in the legislation is outlined in the five-year report.  Other State agencies have also introduced timescales to reflect their activities.  The role of the LDA is to acquire sites and deliver the construction of homes and a significantly lengthy period is required to carry out the work.  A five-year timescale has been deemed appropriate to best reflect how the agency is performing in terms of the Act considering the timescale required to deliver on these sites.  Everyone on this committee knows the job is challenging.  The Bill also provides for the Minister to request a report at any time on how the agency is adhering to its objectives.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 70 seeks to replace the timeline of \"as soon as practicable\" at section 8(6) for a timeline of \"within 30 days\".

It is normal, as part of the governance of State agencies, that the Minister can issue a direction to an agency.  These directions will generally relate to the implementation of Government policy.  The LDA is required to comply with any direction issued under this section .  The proposed amendment seeks to provide that the Minister shall cause copies of any direction given under this section to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 20 days of the direction given or action taken.

Amendment No. 71 is one of the most fundamental amendments my colleague Deputy Gould and I have tabled.  It is to make the case for a land development agency, if such an entity is to exist, that is a non-commercial semi-State body.  The original proposition on the LDA, as announced, by Fine Gael in 2018, was to have an off-balance-sheet vehicle because it did not want its borrowings and expenditure to be State borrowings and expenditure.  Fine Gael wanted to set it up as a commercial semi-State body using the DAC model.  As we know, to secure off-balance-sheet status under EUROSTAT, a majority of a body's activities have to be on the open market.  That is why, when the LDA was originally announced, 60% of the homes it was to deliver were to be sold at open market prices, with a social housing proportion of only 10% and an affordable housing proportion of 30%, as members will remember.<\/p><p>One of the significant changes in this Bill is that the proportions of 10% and 30% and the 60% for open market sale are gone.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien, as Minister, has repeatedly told us he wants a majority of the homes on LDA land to be social and affordable.  He has been quite coy about what the proportion of unaffordable, open market priced homes would be, particularly on sites such as St. Kevin's in Cork and on the Dundrum Central site, but there will be open market sales.  The LDA is going to remain on balance sheet for some time, however.  If, as we know, 100%, 90% or 60% of the homes in the first round of projects are to be social and affordable, the transactions cannot be off balance sheet.  Therefore, all the agency's borrowings and expenditure will be on the general government balance sheet.<\/p><p>There is no reason, therefore, for it to be a commercial semi-State body.  One of the great advantages of making it a commercial semi-State body is borrowings.  It will be able to get the advantageous State borrowing rates which are much cheaper than private borrowings.  That is the case with Irish Water.  One of the great values of that entity, for all of its historical problems, is that it is on balance sheet.  It also provides for greater transparency and accountability.<\/p><p> To repeat a point I made in the previous meeting, if I want information about what a local authority is spending on land or housing, that information is available to me.  It is fully transparent.  Once one uses a commercial semi-State body, because of the application of the Companies Act, commercial sensitivity applies.  Significant volumes of information about spending and borrowing are redacted and transparency is greatly diminished.  That was one of the many problems with the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and using public private partnerships being as a mechanism for delivery of social housing.  I will not rehearse my arguments on why we should not take that approach.  However, I am strongly of the view that if we are to have a State agency, it should be a non-commercial State agency which accesses cheaper government borrowing and provides full transparency on its borrowings and expenditure so the public has full visibility on its activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#E02000","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":458,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett has two amendments in this grouping as well, amendments Nos. 72 and 73.

It is noteworthy that the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, appears to have moved over to the socialist position on housing policy, on which I commend it.  It may give the Government pause for thought on its misguided approach to resolving the housing crisis and its determination, through the Land Development Agency Bill, to involve private investment vehicles in trying to resolve the housing crisis.  The ESRI, it would appear, differs with the Government and concurs with the views of the left in that what we should do is have direct State investment.  It is suggesting we should be borrowing between &euro;4 billion and &euro;7 billion per year to invest directly in delivering public and affordable housing.  It is suggesting we could develop 18,000 public and affordable units per year, a figure remarkably similar to the one in People Before Profit's proposal on dealing with the housing crisis.<\/p> <p>  The Government, in responding to us and others on the left with a similar policy, such as Sinn F&eacute;in and the Social Democrats, regularly dismisses it as fanciful.  It now seems the ESRI does not think it is fanciful.  The ESRI points out, as we have repeatedly done over many years, that the net cost to the State would reduce over time because the State could progressively reduce the huge waste of money being spent on housing assistance payments, HAP, and leasing arrangements if it directly invested, upfront and big time, in its own public and affordable housing stock.  Over time, it would reduce the huge outgoings on HAP and leasing payments.<\/p> <p>  It is in that context that we are saying the LDA should be a purely public agency.  It should not be a commercial agency in any shape or form and should not involve private finance or capital.  There is no need to do that, as the ESRI points out.  If the Government has not listened to us in recent years, it may listen to the ESRI which is echoing our view that what we need is for the State to directly provide its own public and affordable housing building programme.  It also needs to scale up and double the current level of investment, as the ESRI suggests.  It is in that context that it makes sense for the agency to be purely public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#F00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I invite the Minister of State to respond on amendments Nos. 71 to 74, inclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#F00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank members for their contributions.

Subsections 2, 3 and 4 concern the naming of the agency, the disapplication of certain provisions of the Companies Act and provide for the agency to be independent in the performance of its functions.<\/p> <p>  Section 11 provides for the formation of the Land Development Agency as a designated activity company limited by shares, under the Companies Act.  The LDA will be a commercial semi-State body and will be independent in the performance of its functions.  Subsections 2 and 3 concern the naming of the agency and the disapplication of certain provisions of the Companies Act.  I am opposing this amendment because all three of these subsections are integral to section 11.  Deletion of these subsections would cause the section to only refer to the establishment of a DAC and would delete any reference to the naming of this DAC.<\/p> <p>  I am opposing these amendments because the Government has decided the LDA will be a commercial State company and there would be a significant cost to the Exchequer if these amendments were accepted.  The Bill has been drafted on the basis that all provisions have been carefully considered and drafted to ensure the LDA can work commercially.  Subsections 2, 3 and 4 are integral to section 11 and their deletion would cause this section to only refer to the establishment of a DAC and would delete any reference to the name of the DAC and its being independent in the performance of its functions.<\/p> <p>  The LDA is being established as a designated activity company.  As a DAC, the LDA will be able to receive investment funding from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, through its share capitalisation.  The initial shareholding in the LDA will be &euro;100 million, with the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform holding shares with a value of &euro;99 million and the Minister for Housing holding shares of &euro;1 million.  Deputy Boyd Barrett can clearly see it is a publicly-owned company.  There is no ambiguity or doubt surrounding that.<\/p> <p>  On a number of other points raised by Deputies, the independent adjudication of EUROSTAT is that the State should make LDA expenditure off balance sheet.  The Government's intention is that this expenditure would not be permanently on balance sheet.  For this reason, we are trying pave the way to achieve that.  We know the scale of the challenge ahead in terms of the capital that has to be raised to deliver housing in this State.  The LDA is a key actor in that delivery.  We know the high thresholds that will apply as regards affordability rates and we want to see almost 100% affordability achieved in the Dublin area.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding members' views, a number of semi-State agencies are fully publicly-owned and the new agency will not be any different.  I also remind members that the fiscal rules, which are currently suspended, may be reintroduced in future.  The State and the new agency must have the capacity to operate in a countercyclical manner to ensure they can deliver housing at scale, which our citizens so badly need and deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#F00500","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  He indicated that establishing the Land Development Agency as a non-commercial semi-State body would create a considerable expense on the Exchequer.  Every single euro the LDA acquires through the ISIF or borrowing and every euro it spends for the next number of years is on balance sheet.  That is the current position.<\/p><p>If it is the intention of the Government to honour the commitment given by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, that the majority of homes on LDA sites will be social and affordable, getting this funding off balance sheet will not be possible.<\/p><p> The Minister of State is completely correct that this is a matter for the CSO, in the first instance, and then EUROSTAT to decide if a vehicle is on or off balance sheet.  We know the bar that EUROSTAT sets for such a decision because in the very significant EUROSTAT decision on Irish Water, the five points it outlined as to why Irish Water would be on balance sheet are all very clearly in evidence here, in that the majority of the activity of the LDA, as promised by the Minister, will be non-commercial, that is, providing sociable and affordable housing.  The system for allocating those homes will be nominations through the local authorities for the social housing but also for the purchase of the affordable element.  The board's policies, particularly the requirement to abide by Government policy and direction, are enshrined in this legislation.  It is virtually impossible to see how the LDA can come off balance sheet unless - this is a very important point that the Minister of State made &ndash; it is in order to satisfy the core requirement of the market corporation test of EUROSTAT by providing that a majority of the residential units on LDA land are sold at commercial open market prices.  I do not dispute the Minister&rsquo;s view and I know it is Fine Gael&rsquo;s desire for the LDA to be off balance sheet.  However, if the Minister wants to achieve this, the only way he can do so is if, in the round, 60% of the homes the LDA delivers will be sold at open market prices, which we know are eminently unaffordable.<\/p><p> Given that the majority of the LDA activity is going to be in Dublin, the Government cannot, on the one hand, promise that up to a majority of the homes in Dublin will be social and affordable while, on the other hand, saying that it wants the LDA to be off balance sheet.  This is a crucial issue and I understand the LDA itself is quite concerned about this because it is not understand how its target of 150,000 homes, as promised by the then Taoiseach and current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the then Ministers, Deputy Donohoe, and Mr. Eoghan Murphy, back in 2018 is going to be achieved if the agency is not off balance sheet.  The LDA does not see how it is going to be off balance sheet if the promise of the Minister that the majority of the homes will be social and affordable is to met.  <\/p><p> This response by the Minister of State exposes a fundamental flaw in how the Government is dealing with this matter.  It shows the deeply confused nature of this legislation and the different promises of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael as to what the LDA will deliver.  On that basis, I am pressing this amendment because it would be cheaper and more efficient to have a centralised housing agency on balance sheet as a non-commercial semi-State body and borrowing, exactly as Deputy Boyd Barrett stated and as recommended by the ESRI today, at historically low rates to provide the volume of public homes that we need.  As I said, this exposes the fundamental flaw of this entire enterprise and on that basis, this amendment is even more valid than it was before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#F00600","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I would like the Minister of State to respond directly to the point I made and, more to the point, to what the ESRI has said today.  It is directly challenging the logic behind the Government&rsquo;s approach, as embodied in the Land Development Agency Bill.  The Government&rsquo;s obsession with public private partnerships and involving private investment, as well as the knock-on consequences of all of that in having to operate on a commercial basis, leads then to the requirement to sell some of the housing at full market price.  All of this is being justified on the basis that we have to keep the LDA off balance sheet, we do not want to inflate Government debt and so forth.  The ESRI is directly challenging that logic.  The Minister of State should respond to the point.<\/p> <p>  I add to that the point I made about the huge cost we are incurring annually, which continues to grow, through leasing and HAPs arrangements because we are not building enough of our own stock of public housing.  In the case of the LDA, we will not maximise the potential we have on our own land to deliver our own stock of public housing because the Government insists that some of it will have to be sold privately at market prices and so on.  It is, therefore, limiting the ability of the public land bank to develop public housing which can then wean us off the extortionate annual cost of the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and HAP arrangements, which are required to substitute for the failure of the State to develop on a sufficient scale its own stock of public housing.  The Minister of State should also respond to that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#G00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":465,"content":"<p>The ESRI report today is highly significant, not least because the ESRI is an independent, mainstream and very well established centrist think tank.  The game is up now for the Government and it can no longer ignore the very clear and strong calls for public investment along the lines of what the ESRI and the rest of us have been saying for a long number of years.  The Government can no longer dismiss that argument.<\/p> <p>  On the on balance sheet versus off balance sheet argument put forward in respect of the LDA, Deputy &Oacute; Broin is correct that the LDA is going to be on balance sheet for the foreseeable future.  There is no question about that.  The question that arises is whether the EU fiscal rules and orthodoxy will still exist by the time the LDA is possibly off balance sheet.  Those rules belong to a previous era and mainstream economists no longer subscribe to that fiscal orthodoxy.  That said, even if mainstream thinkers still subscribed to it, there is a very strong case, given the housing emergency we have, for breaking those rules, if needs be.<\/p> <p>  The idea that we would, because of the orthodoxy of the EU fiscal rules, perpetuate circumstances in which more than 8,000 people are living in emergency accommodation and 120,000 people are on housing waiting lists or in insecure HAP tenancies is utterly unacceptable.  Bearing in mind that European Union member states are engaging in serious breaches of the rule of law, involving breaches of fundamental democratic rights, human rights, press freedom and attacks on the LGBTI+ community, all without proper sanction, the idea that the European Union would sanction Ireland for investing in public housing in the middle of an emergency crisis while turning a blind eye to all of those breaches of the rule of law and democratic rights is not in any way credible.<\/p> <p>  The Centre for Housing Law, Rights and Policy in NUI Galway has produced very good research on EU state aid rules and cost rental housing.  It very clearly put forward the legal case that a legitimate case can be made under EU state aid rules to support interventions in housing to address housing market failure.  We very clearly have housing market failure.  We do not need today&rsquo;s ESRI report to know that.  The case for public investment is overwhelming and the use of the outdated and previously mainstream EU fiscal orthodoxy, which some of us have never supported, as an excuse is a red herring.

The use of open market sales to subsidise or reduce housing investment on the site is therefore not Government policy.  The Minister has said that very clearly in the course of this debate.  This Bill allows the LDA to establish DAC subsidiaries to deliver affordable housing and public housing.  The Affordable Housing Bill allows for council-led affordable housing on council land.  As late as this morning the Secretary General of the Department confirmed that the &euro;500 million we spend on HAP needs to be phased out because it is better value for money for us to spend capital money on the delivery of housing.  In many ways all the last few contributions re-fight an argument that was settled in the general election.  The State is back in the business of building houses, we are going to do it on a massive scale, and the Housing for All programme we will see in the summer will, I believe, do exactly what the ESRI wants us to do, which is to increase significantly the capital spending on this.

The LDA Bill and the Affordable Housing Bill are two key mechanisms in that, but I agree with and support what the ESRI says in that we need additional investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#H01200","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett, I ask you to be as brief and as direct as possible, please, and then I will go to the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#H01300","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":480,"content":"<p>Sure, and I apologise for coming in.  I just thought it would be important to respond to Deputy McAuliffe's point.  The point is that we should legislate in line with Government policy.  If the new policy of the Government is the direct provision of public housing, as Deputy McAuliffe says, and for 100% public and affordable housing on public land, let us first acknowledge that that is a departure from the initial conception of the LDA.  The problem is that the legislation is in line with the old policy.  The actual detail of the legislation is not in line with the policy Deputy McAuliffe is articulating; it is in line with the old policy.  Critically, this centres on the amendments we are now discussing.  If what we are trying to do is deliver public and affordable housing on public land, why set up the agency to do this as a commercial company rather than a public agency?  The two things do not go together.  I am afraid verbal commitments from the Government that it is in favour of what we are arguing for, what the ESRI is now arguing for and what Deputy McAuliffe says the Government is now in favour of do not tally with what is in this Bill.  What this Bill is about is setting up a commercial entity that is allowed - and this legislation facilitates this - to enter into commercial arrangements with private investment vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#H01400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":481,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett, you have made that point and I do not want to get into repetitive arguments.

I thank the members again for all their genuine and valuable contributions.  I understand where each and every one is coming from.  I note members saying the fiscal rules may not be here at some point in the future.  Unfortunately, I cannot operate that scratch card type of economics whereby you have a crystal ball before you and you make predictions and put legislation through that affects citizens based on that.  My job is to try to put through the best Bill we can put through that will deliver the largest scale of social and affordable housing in this State.  I remind members that the affordable percentages are not limits; they are a minimum target.  That is the first key thing.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has been very clear that in Dublin he expects the delivery mechanism through the LDA to result in 100% affordable housing.  With the previous Government it was 30%.  Again, that was not a limit but a minimum.  I remind members that through Part V we have the increase to 20%.  There seems to be a huge misunderstanding on the committee as to how EUROSTAT and the CSO compile or accredit what is off balance sheet and what is not.<\/p><p>Affordability is not a metric for any agency that is off balance sheet.  The metric is whether it can wash its face and how it carries out its business.  The LDA, like Coillte and other semi-State companies, will carry out its business by project managing with local authorities.  The affordability criteria are set in stone for public lands.  There will be a minimum of 50% social and affordable housing, with prices reduced by 20% under Part 5.  That gives the LDA capacity and it will project manage with local authorities.  The cost-rental element will be 30% below cost rents.<\/p><p> Anyone in this committee who suggests that, notwithstanding the massive economic challenges this State faces and the requirement to build 350,000 houses for citizens over the next decade at a probable cost of &euro;100 billion, the State can shoulder the full cost in future and we should not have a semi-State agency that can deliver housing units countercyclically, regardless of how stressed the State is, is living in fantasy land.  We have to provide the maximum number of affordable housing units.  The Minister has said it is his intention to deliver 100% affordable housing in Dublin.  <\/p><p> I remind Members that these figures are minimum rates, not targets.  We have to have an honest and open debate on how to deliver these affordable houses our citizens badly need.  I also remind members that the LDA is a publicly-owned semi-State company.  I hope that will allay concerns.<\/p><p> With regard to the ESRI report on the challenge the State faces, the Department has a record budget for delivering housing.  There is no point in muddying the waters by saying affordability is a criterion applied by EUROSTAT.  It is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#H01600","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I have listened to the Minister of State for several minutes and all I heard out of his mouth, again and again, were the words &ldquo;affordable housing&rdquo;.  How will the Government address affordable housing when there has been a 37% increase in the cost of materials coming into this country since 1 January?  That increase is due to the 2040 plan brought in by the Government in 2018.  The Government refused to accept an amendment by the Rural Independent Group on this two weeks ago.  Nobody in this country will be able to get affordable housing because that Bill was not amended.  We now have a shortage of housing, not only in built-up areas, a 37% increase in material costs and a lack of contractors to do the work.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State says he will deliver affordable housing.  He gave a rough costing of &euro;100 billion.  What he is saying is not accurate.  I have been in construction all my life.  I see the changes daily.  There are ships on the seas carrying materials that are being bid for by different countries and the highest bidder gets those ships into port.<\/p> <p>  Brexit has caused a massive problem in our ports, with goods held up for the last three weeks.  The costs are caused by what is happening in the ports and one section not talking to the other.  The Government is causing a bigger problem.  To get affordable housing we have to get equipment and materials into the country and we must have the right number of people available to build it.  The 2040 plan has caused a 40% to 50% hike in prices for housing.  The Government has caused a problem in local authorities with the number of planning applications coming in at the moment.  I have 70 applications for housing on my books.  I am getting phone calls daily on a programme introduced by a Fine Gael-led Government in 2018, which has led to a 37% increase in costs.

I am strongly of the view that all appointments to the board, whether of the chair or of other members, should be made through the public appointments process.  This is a discussion we had frequently with the previous Government and ordinarily we were told that, even though the appointment is made by the Minister, it is intended that the public appointments process be used.  The difficulty, however, is that, unless this process is explicitly required by the legislation, the process for public appointments may be bypassed.  In fact, if I understand correctly, that happened recently in respect of some appointments made by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to the Climate Change Advisory Council.  We have a public appointments process for a reason, which is to ensure that there can be no political patronage or cronyism, and nor can there be a perception of such patronage or cronyism.<\/p><p>I am therefore strongly of the view that all such appointments to State boards, whether they be the boards of commercial or non-commercial agencies, should be made through that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#L02800","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for his amendments.  The Government has two amendments in this grouping, Nos. 103 and 105.  These amendments are technical amendments to provide that the appointment of the board and chair of the board will be subject to the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The provision as currently drafted provides that the Minister appoints individuals to these roles and these amendments bring these provisions in line with similar provisions for other commercial State bodies by ensuring that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as shareholder, also consents to them.<\/p> <p>  I would remind Deputies that all appointees to the board, including the chair, will be recruited through the State boards process and in line with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The Public Appointments Service is currently running a competition to appoint the chair of the Land Development Agency and I hope that this process will be completed shortly.  <\/p> <p>  I will address now address amendments Nos. 102 and 104, which have been tabled jointly by Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Deputy Gould.  Amendments Nos. 102 and 104 seek to amend a provision in section 15 to the effect that all members of the LDA board and the chair are to be appointed by the Minister and to substitute for this a provision to the effect that appointments are to be made through the State boards appointment process.<\/p> <p>  I am opposed to this amendment as it will be the case that all appointments to the board of the LDA will be carried out through the State boards process.  This is in line with the code of practice for the governance of State boards.  As is standard, the Public Appointments Service will run all LDA board competitions, in partnership with the New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewERA.  Shortlisted candidates will be presented to the Minister for consideration.  As I said, the appointment of the chair is currently going through this process.  <\/p> <p>  It is clear that we have to abide by the code of practice.  It is a robust document.  Any changes that would have to be made to it if we were to accept this amendment to the legislation would necessitate a whole range of changes to different Acts as we would be adopting the principle that Acts would be changed each time.  We want one robust document for public appointments and we have one.  The document is really satisfactory.  There is nothing like action.  The appointment of the chairperson is currently going through the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#M00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":564,"content":"<p>As I expected, the Minister of State has given exactly the same rote response as his counterparts gave when we discussed these matters in respect of earlier legislation.  The difficulty is that, unless this is legally required under the Act rather than being advised in a voluntary code of practice to which the Government adheres, a Minister can make direct appointments, bypassing the public appointments process.  In many instances, including during the term of this Government, Ministers have done just that.  I used the recent appointments to the Climate Change Advisory Council as a case in point.  I fully accept what the Minister of State has said with regard to the code of practice.  In general, the Government does use the Public Appointments Service, but it does not always do so.  There should be no circumstances in which a Minister, regardless of who he or she is, can bypass that process.  This caused enormous controversy in previous governments.  Ministers appointed people who were widely believed to be politically aligned with the general thinking of those Ministers to significant State boards despite the fact that the code of practice which the Minister of State has outlined was in place at that stage.  I refer not only to the previous Government but the Government before that, when Fine Gael was in government with Labour.<\/p> <p>  I do not accept the argument that making the use of the public appointments process legally required creates complications.  It is a simple amendment which would prevent a Minister from making a direct appointment.  All of our parties agree that not only do we want to end cronyism, but that we want to end the perception of cronyism.  The best way to do so is to make sure that no Minister can make an appointment outside of the public appointments process.  I will be pressing the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#M00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"vote","time":1622674800,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 3; N\u00edl, 6.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#M00400","aye":["1453","1550","1468"],"nay":["1595","1574","1597","1566","1626","1568"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 103:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 16, line 25, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#N00100","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622674800,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 104:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 16, to delete line 26 and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;(2) A chairperson of the Board shall be appointed through the public appointments process.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#N00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622674800,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1622674800,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 105:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 16, line 26, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform,&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021060300002#N00500","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622674800,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622674800,"counter":572,"content":"<p>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1622674800,"counter":573,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 11.35 a.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 June 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
