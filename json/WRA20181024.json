This funding, together with additional private funding, would then facilitate the provision of additional housing units by the AHB sector, in support of the Government's Social Housing Strategy.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government established a Clearing House Group, under the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, to work with the sector with a view to developing a new model that could use the &euro;400m in this way.  Unfortunately, however, it proved very challenging to find a model that would be capable of using the funding while remaining off-balance sheet in Eurostat terms.  <\/p>  <p>  However, the Clearing House Group considered that there were aspects of some of the proposals considered that appeared to offer potential, in terms of the possible development of a new &lsquo;affordable rental&rsquo; initiative.  This would seek to provide long-term affordable residential accommodation for low to moderate income key-worker households in urban areas of high demand. <\/p>  <p>  In response to this outcome, it was decided to convert the commitment from a single lump sum payment to fund the initial capital cost of social housing provision, into a commitment to provide &euro;10m per annum, indexed for inflation, over a much longer period &ndash; at least 20 years.  This ongoing funding could then be used to fund a pilot scheme for the provision of subsidised housing, thus making the housing available on an affordable basis over a 20 year period.  <\/p>  <p>  This additional &euro;10 million in annual funding was allocated to the Vote of the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government from 2017 onwards.  In addition, this commitment to increased funding for social and affordable housing has been subsumed into a much more significant commitment to increased support for the programmes of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the area of housing - as reflected both in the National Development Plan 2018-2027 published in February 2018 and also the further &euro;266 million in additional capital funding allocated for this purpose over 2019-2021 in Budget 2019. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400072#WRA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Funding","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400072#WRA03000"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[43885\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400072#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the capital funding being provided for works in Mountmellick on flood relief.","asker":"1232","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[43884\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400072#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if funding is available for immediate short-term works for river channel clearing in Mountmellick, County Laois.","asker":"1232","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 77 together.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the immediate short-term works for the town of Mountmellick, the Office of Public Works&rsquo; representatives on the steering group have advised Laois County Council that there is the option to apply for minor works funding for interim defences.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, Laois County Council have confirmed that maintenance works commenced on the River Owenass in Mountmellick following the most recent flood event, and a summary of these works are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Irishtown Bridge on the N80 has had silt and vegetation removed from the eye of the bridge, improving capacity and conveyance<\/p>  <p>  - At the Convent Bridge on the R422, the third eye has been cleaned and both the upstream and downstream approaches have had vegetation and silt build up removed.<\/p>  <p>  - Works are ongoing on the stretch of river between the above-mentioned bridges clearing vegetation (above current low water level) with tree\/limb cutting to commence next week to remove any potential impediments in the channel. Once vegetation is cleared, it is anticipated that bank repairs will be necessary where slippages are evident. Repairs will be undertaken as required.<\/p>  <p>  - Any fallen trees and potential debris blockages have been removed when observed or upon receipt of notification of same.<\/p>  <p>  - Cleaning of a number of feeder drains\/streams to the Owenass and Barrow have taken place with further works planned throughout this month.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise the critical importance of drainage maintenance to flood risk management and I have written to the Minister for Housing Planning and Local Government on the current funding constraints some Councils have highlighted to meet their statutory maintenance obligations.

These FRMP&rsquo;s identified a viable solution for the flooding problem in the town of Mountmellick, and the cost of implementing this plan is estimated at &euro;4.7 million. As such, the Office of Public Works has allowed for this funding in its capital works budget. <\/p>  <p>  A steering group has been established for the progression of the Mountmellick project, and is made up of representatives from Laois County Council and the Office of Public Works. This steering group has been working together over the last number of months to collect the relevant data in order to compose a detailed brief for the procurement of engineering consultants, and it is hoped that this contract will be advertised by the end of the year. Once the consultants are procured, they will use the data collected throughout the CFRAM study, and the local data collected by the steering group, to assess further the solution identified in the FRMP&rsquo;s. The cost of implementing flood defences for the town will be reviewed in the light of this further analysis.

Insolvency statistics published for Q1 2018 indicate the construction industry recorded 42 insolvencies (22% of the total number of insolvencies), a 17% increase on Q1 2017.  Published analysis points to legacy issues related to the property crash rather than the public works contracts as the cause of these insolvencies. <\/p>  <p>  The total capital expenditure channeled through the public works contracts accounts for approximately 20% of the total value of construction output (industry estimates put this at &euro;19.5 billion for 2018).  Whilst it is accepted that a number of the insolvencies that have arisen involve companies who were operating under public works contracts, those same companies would also have been operating under a range of the other forms of construction contract widely used by private sector construction clients.<\/p>  <p>  Analysis undertaken in the UK in the wake of the collapse of Carillion has highlighted the low margins (between 1 &ndash; 2%) generally made by main contractors in a sector that is traditionally seen as high risk.

This culture must be addressed by the industry if it is to service its client base in a professional manner.<\/p>  <p>  The impact of awarding contracts at low prices was highlighted in the Report on the Review of the Performance of the Public Works Contracts published in 2014.  A range of measures was recommended in that report to discourage unsustainably low pricing, amongst other aspects.  Most of these measures have been implemented since 2016 and are designed to give contracting authorities much greater detail on the price make-up.<\/p>  <p>  A further measure identified in the Report is the development of a medium term strategy for the procurement of public works projects.

Existing retire and rehire arrangements operating in the various sectors are being used to facilitate affected public servants.    <\/p>  <p>  On the issue of  whether the legislation will be backdated to the date of publication of the Bill, I appreciate that there are individual public servants who have availed of the interim arrangements, whereby they have been facilitated to remain at work between the age of 65 and 66, and who would like to be covered by the new legislation.  Unfortunately, this is not something that can be facilitated.  The legislation will come into effect from the date of its commencement.  Until then, the current statutory position of the compulsory retirement age of 65 must be respected.  This requires public servants to retire at the age of 65 and those availing of the interim arrangements have done so and received their pension benefits, subject to pension abatement.      <\/p>  <p>  On that basis they are in a different position to those existing public servants who reach the age of 65 after this legislation has commenced. If the interim arrangements had not existed, those availing of the interim arrangements would have had to cease working at age 65.  <\/p>  <p>  The general policy across the public service, subject to overall policy considerations including the demand for scarce skills etc., is that where a retired employee is re-hired, they are paid at the minimum point of the relevant scale, rather than at the pay point they had reached when they retired.  This practice is continuing in the context of the interim arrangements.   In most cases, the combination of the pension in payment and the new salary brings the person back up to the income level they had reached before they retired. However, after the date of commencement of the Bill, the interim arrangements will no longer be required as public servants reaching the age of 65 will be able to remain at work up to the age of 70, if they so wish, on current terms and conditions. Incremental progression will continue up to the date of retirement and additional service will count towards pension accrual subject to the statutory maximum of 40 years. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the numbers of public servants who have availed of the interim arrangements, I would not have access to numbers for the individual public service sectors.  In the Civil Service, for which I have responsibility, I am aware that fewer than 100 people availed of retention in the six months after the arrangements were announced. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400072#WRA07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400072#WRA07200"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[43834\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400072#WRA07300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans in respect of the establishment of a supplementary pension in relation to public service pensions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>A supplementary pension scheme has been in place since 1995 for those public servants recruited between 1995 and 2012, whose public service pension is integrated with the Contributory State Pension (CSP).<\/p>  <p>  This integration with the CSP means that the public service pension paid to them is based on the assumption that they will also receive the CSP at the maximum personal rate on retirement, in addition to the occupational pension paid to them.<\/p>  <p>  Where a post-1995 recruited public servant retires before reaching state pension age (currently 66, rising to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028) they are not entitled to the CSP until reaching that qualifying age.

It is because of this additional revenue, along with higher than anticipated Exchequer tax receipts, higher-than-projected non tax revenues, and lower non-voted current expenditure, that the increase in gross voted expenditure can be accommodated, while at the same time seeing an improvement in the General Government deficit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400073#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400073#WRB01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naval Service","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400073#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[44069\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400073#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if letters of invitation are being issued to Naval Service reservists to transfer to the Naval Service; and his views whether this is an appropriate method of recruitment for the Defence Forces.","asker":"1276","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>The Naval Service Reserve\u00a0(NSR) is an\u00a0important component of\u00a0the\u00a0Defence Forces\u00a0and\u00a0there are 125 effective\u00a0personnel in the\u00a0NSR (as at end August). <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the military authorities that an informal query was issued by a staff officer in the\u00a0Reserve Defence Force (RDF) Directorate to ascertain\u00a0if any Naval Service Reservists were interested in joining the Permanent Defence Force in the future.

The governing legislation in this regard is contained in the Finance Act 1975. Where a gaming machine is available for play, without a proper licence displayed, it is liable to forfeiture in accordance with Section 43(10)(b) of that Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that it has started a national compliance project on the gaming and amusement machine sector, which is designed to identify and tackle any non-compliance with tax and excise licensing obligations. This project is ongoing across all geographic regions and to date site visits have been carried out by Revenue officials to 250 separate premises. A range of follow-up actions are now being pursued with respect to the tax and licensing issues identified.  <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has also advised me that prior to the start of this project it was necessary to obtain legal advice regarding the application of its enforcement powers in this sector. This issue arose on foot of a legal submission received from the industry. With the recent receipt of the required advices which clarified the position, Revenue is now proceeding with tackling any licensing issues identified using the full suite of powers available.

My own Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported on each month against\u00a0expenditure profiles in the Fiscal Monitor published by the Department of Finance. <\/p>  <p>  The management of expenditure within the overall fiscal parameters over the last number of years has played a key role in ensuring that we have continued to meet out fiscal targets. However,\u00a0given the scale of Government expenditure - &euro;61.8 billion in aggregate for gross voted expenditure in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018 - and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons, including policy decisions, timing issues, and overspends. They are a budgetary tool that allows for the proper alignment of funding allocations with planned expenditure. Of course, they can only be allowed where they can be accommodated within the overall fiscal parameters.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure at end-September 2018 was &euro;44,874 million, which is broadly on profile.\u00a0Net voted expenditure of &euro;36,042 million was &euro;45 million below profile with net voted spending in\u00a014\u00a0out of 17 Vote Groups being below profile. As outlined in the Fiscal Monitor, current spending is 0.6 per cent ahead of profile, with\u00a0the main driver of this variance\u00a0being Health expenditure. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in Expenditure Report 2019, as a result of policy decisions, including in relation to the provision of a 100 per cent Christmas Bonus to social welfare recipients, additional capital for the Department of Housing and expenditure pressures in particular in the Health sector, the gross voted expenditure outturn for the year is now estimated at &euro;62.8 billion, an increase of &euro;1 billion relative to the gross voted expenditure amount in REV 2018. A key element of the increase in gross voted expenditure is an expenditure overrun in Health of &euro;645 million, with an additional &euro;55 million being required for a shortfall in receipts.\u00a0 As I outlined in my statement to the D&aacute;il on Budget day, I continue to look at choices that we have to make in healthcare regarding how we can accompany all time high levels of investment with improved governance, accountability, effectiveness and value for money.<\/p>  <p>  A number of measures are in place to support value for money in terms of capital and current expenditure.  During 2018, my Department has engaged with a range of Departments on year two of the Spending Review process, with a view to reinforcing a systematic analysis of existing spending programmes, focusing on an assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability. In the last two years of the Spending Review process, over 50 analytical papers have been produced.  These papers:<\/p>  <p>  -  Provide an evidence base in relation to Departmental spending that informs the choices made in relation to budgetary allocations;<\/p>  <p>  -  Identify areas of existing expenditure that require ongoing analysis where issues emerge during the Spending Review; and<\/p>  <p>  -  Outline key sectoral trends and provide analysis with international comparisons on expenditure levels and efficiency.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the output of the Spending Reviews in 2017 and 2018, the intention is that the Spending Review in 2019 will once again focus on an assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of specific spending programmes. The Spending Review in 2019 will continue to support the development of better policy options for Government by broadening and deepening the knowledge of a range of complex policy areas to facilitate future discussions regarding the evolution of Government expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to capital expenditure, the National Development Plan (NDP) has set an investment in infrastructure of almost &euro;116 billion over the ten year period to 2027. Such a level of investment requires a strong framework to drive its implementation and increased transparency on the projects and programmes being supported by this investment. In this regard, a high-level Project Ireland 2040 Delivery Board has been established.\u00a0 The Project Delivery Board will continue to provide strategic direction and leadership to the NDP and National Planning Framework (NPF) implementation process. The Delivery Board will monitor and oversee implementation structures and performance across the various sectors to ensure a co-ordinated and collaborative whole of Government approach to NDP and NPF delivery. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to public service reform, Our Public Service 2020 is the framework for\u00a0reform and innovation in the public service which was launched in December 2017. This phase of public service reform focuses on supporting sustainable, continuous progress across the public service. It aims to build a stronger public service and to deliver better quality services to the Irish public.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400075#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400075#WRD02100"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[44178\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400075#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which his Department has made the necessary preparations to combat the effects of Brexit;

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has responsibility for the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which sets the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland.  This framework enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector.<\/p>  <p>  Public procurement practices are subject to audit and scrutiny under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993, and the Local Government Reform Act 2014, and Accounting Officers are publicly accountable for expenditure incurred. Individual contracting authorities are responsible for establishing arrangements for ensuring the proper conduct of their affairs, including conformance to standards of good governance and accountability with regard to procurement. <\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan, launched new Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services in July 2017. The guidelines facilitate Public Bodies in meeting their corporate governance requirements in relation to procurement. These guidelines provide a comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement directives and have been designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules. <\/p>  <p>  Procurement reform is a key element of the Government's overall reform programme and is aimed at delivering increased value for money, more accurate and timely data and improvement in the capacity and capability of procurement across the public service.  The central procurement frameworks and contracts established by the OGP and our sector partners in Health, Education, Local Government and Defence have been designed to optimise benefits including savings to the State through the strategic aggregation of its buying power.  <\/p>  <p>  The reform is being carried out in a manner that recognises the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country's economy.  The aim is to drive fair, transparent and open competition in the marketplace but also to work with business to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.   In this regard, Minister of State O&rsquo;Donovan chairs quarterly meetings of the SME Advisory Group, in accordance with the Programme for Government, where he hears at first hand the concerns of industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400075#WRD03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":231,"content":"<p>Question No. 147 answered with Question No. 138.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":232,"content":"<p>Question No. 148 answered with Question No. 146.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":233,"content":"<p>Question No. 149 answered with Question No. 138.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Construction Contracts","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400075#WRD04300"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[44190\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400075#WRD04400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to protect small contractors that engage in State work; and if the final payment in relation to a social housing site (details supplied) is being withheld from a company until the subcontractors have been reimbursed.","asker":"1259","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>The conditions of most construction contracts in use between construction clients and building contractors in both the public and private sectors require that payments are made at defined intervals and that payment is contingent on work being completed to a pre-determined standard.\u00a0 There is usually no contractual obligation on the main contractor to make payments to sub-contractors because this is left to the commercial arrangements that are contained in their respective contracts.<\/p><p>The public works contract is no different, it imposes a single point of responsibility on the main contractor to deliver a construction project on time and within budget.<\/p><p>Poor payment practices prevalent in the construction industry prompted Senator Feargal Quinn to table a legislative response in the form of the Construction Contracts Bill which was initiated in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in May 2010 as a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill.\u00a0 Analysis undertaken during the development of the Bill highlighted the liberties that were taken by some contractors in the absence of a structure to determine payments down the supply chain.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Bill received Government and industry support and was enacted in 2013, it applies to all contracts entered into after 25 July 2016 in accordance with the 'Construction Contracts Act, 2013 (Appointed Day) Order 2016' (Statutory Instrument No 165 of 2016).  The imposes minimum payment requirements and provides the necessary tools to enforce those payments between the main contractor and their sub-contractors and so on down the supply chain.\u00a0 It applies to all construction contracts (as defined in the Act), public or private sector, whether they are written or oral and whether they include payment provisions or not.<\/p><p>The Act provides important statutory protections for subcontractors in the construction industry and includes:<\/p><p>- a maximum payment interval of 30 days and a requirement to honour payment requests within 30 days for sub-contractors;<\/p><p>- a right to suspension for non-payment; <\/p><p>- a right to refer a payment dispute to adjudication; and<\/p><p>- the prohibition of arrangements that make entitlement to payment conditional on certain events, (e.g. &lsquo;pay when paid&rsquo; clauses, which delay payments until the payer has, in turn, been paid), which were prevalent in most forms of sub-contract.<\/p><p>The public works contracts were amended prior to\u00a0the Act's\u00a0commencement in June 2016 to accommodate its requirements and to facilitate cash flow in accordance with the payment terms imposed on main contractors with respect to their sub-contractors.<\/p><p>Whilst much of the interest from industry surrounding the Act was centred on the introduction of adjudication, it is the discipline that the legislation imposes on payments that appears to be largely ignored.\u00a0 Arguably these are the most important provisions in the Act but sub-contractors must be proactive in enforcing their entitlements with the contractor for payments that are due.<\/p><p>The Act does not cut across the normal rules for company liquidation\/receivership and so where this arises the only route for recovery is through the normal insolvency process.\u00a0 However the magnitude of the exposure that many sub-contractors currently face upon the insolvency of a contractor would not arise if the provision for payments were insisted upon and the remedies available were exercised where payment is not forthcoming.<\/p><p>It is unacceptable that sub-contractors are suffering losses as a result of the insolvency of a contractor on a construction project.\u00a0 However the issue raised would suggest that sub-contractors are not exercising the rights provided for in the Construction Contracts Act which is surprising given the welcome it received by all contracting tiers in the industry and indeed the support it received from members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Construction Contracts Adjudication Service in the Department of Business, Enterprise &amp;amp;

Schools should supervise and support children who are distressed or out of control until they have recovered and are able to re-engage in the classroom. In some circumstances this may mean the temporary removal of a child from the environment where the problems have arisen. Schools are not required to report on such interventions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Schools owe a duty of care to all their students and any action taken\u00a0in relation to managing behavior must be proportionate.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla's\u00a0Educational Welfare Service,\u00a0under the aegis of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs,\u00a0has\u00a0published guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour which all schools are required by law to have in place. The guidelines advise that specialised behaviour management strategies, such as the use of restraint, should not be used without expert advice, training and monitoring. In particular, the guidelines point to certain sanctions which are regarded as inappropriate, including leaving a student in an unsupervised situation while in the care of the school. All parents must be made aware of behaviour management strategies employed by the school.<\/p>  <p>  Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Services psychologist, from the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service which includes Special Educational Needs Organisers, the National Behavioural Support Service and the Special Education Support Service, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.<\/p>  <p>  A range of guidance is available for schools in relation to the management of student behaviour. The Department published Guidelines for Supporting Pupils with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social Difficulties, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.education.ie. The National Educational Psychological Services document Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties &ndash; A Continuum of Support also provides advice for teachers, including some advice on the use of &ldquo;time out&rdquo; procedures in the classroom.<\/p>  <p>  Training is available for schools in relation to the provision of support for children with special educational needs from the NCSE&rsquo;s Regional Service. The Special Education Support Service can, as part of their designated training modules, provide guidance for schools in relation to the management\u00a0of difficult behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Following a request by the Department for policy advice from the NCSE, which provided recommendations in relation to crisis situations and complex behavioural needs, work on developing guidelines for schools is underway. The Department will engage with education partners on these in the coming months. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be finalised by the end of this school year. The\u00a0guidelines will\u00a0assist schools in responding in circumstances where students pose an immediate threat of harm to themselves or others.<\/p>  <p>  The guidelines will be underpinned by the principles that\u00a0such intervention\u00a0is never used for the purposes of discipline; that it should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to de-escalate the situation. The guidelines will also underline the importance of continued supervision of children during a crisis period including matters related to behaviour. It is also expected that the guidelines will underline the importance of recording such incidents and how they are managed.<\/p>  <p>  Where a parent, or any other person, has concerns about the care or safety of a child in school they should report these concerns to the Board of Management of the school in the first instance.<\/p>  <p>  Where a parent or other person has a concern about the welfare or protection of a child in a school they may report the matter as a child protection concern to Tusla or\u00a0to the Department of Education and Skills who will then report any child protection complaint in accordance with the Department's procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400076#WRE05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400077#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[44124\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400077#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the specific aspects of the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004 that have been implemented; and the timeline for the implementation of the remainder.","asker":"1222","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that a\u00a0number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 have been commenced.  The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. <\/p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation<\/p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs<\/p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools<\/p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. <\/p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards<\/p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act<\/p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council<\/p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. <\/p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced. \u00a0The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; <\/p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).<\/p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.<\/p><p>- an independent appeals process.<\/p><p>The NCSE\u00a0estimated, in its implementation Plan which was developed in 2006,\u00a0that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. <\/p><p>The view of the Department of Education and Skills was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice provided to that Department also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.<\/p><p>In light of the difficult economic situation and the significant costs involved, the Government of the day, and subsequent Governments, deferred the full implementation of EPSEN.<\/p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>The Government\u00a0is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. <\/p><p>In 2018, my Department will invest over\u00a0&euro;1.75 Billion in this area - 1\/5 of my Department's budget and up 42% since 2011, at which point &euro;1.24 Billion was invested.\u00a0This increased investment has allowed the Government to increase the number of:<\/p><p>SNAs by 42%, from 10,575 in\u00a02011 to 15,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>Special classes by 138%\u00a0to\u00a0over 1,300 at present, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.<\/p><p>Special education teachers\u00a0by 38%\u00a0from 9,630 in 2011 to\u00a0over\u00a013,300 at present in2018.<\/p><p>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government,\u00a0I have\u00a0committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress\u00a0aspects of\u00a0the Act on a non-statutory basis. <\/p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of the new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017.  Further consultations\u00a0took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report.<\/p><p>Consultations also took place in relation to providing power\u00a0to the National Council for Special Educational need to\u00a0designate a school place for a person with special educational needs,\u00a0which is now\u00a0provided for\u00a0in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.<\/p><p>I can also advise that, whereas there is not currently a statutory requirement to provide individual education plans for children with special needs, at present, all schools are encouraged to use Education Plans.\u00a0The Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs. In line with Circular 30\/2014, schools are also\u00a0required to put in place\u00a0Personal Pupil Plan including a care plan for all pupils availing of SNA support while the Guidelines for schools on implementing the new special education teacher allocation model as point to the important to ensuring that student support plans or educational plans are in place.<\/p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also\u00a0published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice. Full consultation will also take place with stakeholders before adjustments are made. <\/p><p>I can assure you that this Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support and I\u00a0am confident that ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400077#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":300,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 175 to 178, inclusive, answered with Question No. 171.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400077#WRF00900"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[44138\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400077#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 143 of 18 October 2018, the procedures to cover maternity and sick leave absence; if there is panel of teachers to cover short and long-term absence; and if schools under contract are obliged to cover such absences.","asker":"1306","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012).

This is for the relevant Planning Authority to determine, and any person may request (for a prescribed fee), under Section 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a declaration on the matter from their Local Planning Authority. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of further support, the revised Woodland Improvement Scheme will allow eligible landowners to avail of a second thinning grant. This will assist forest owners in managing any continuing impact of Chalara in their plantation. This scheme is due to be launched shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400081#WRK04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ash Dieback Threat","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400081#WRK04400"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[44030\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018102400081#WRK04500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will request the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to initiate a survey through the local authorities in order that all trees that are adjacent to roads and affected by ash dieback are felled by those responsible due to the spread of ash dieback nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":558,"content":"<p>My Department conducts systematic and targeted plant health surveys in relation to Ash Dieback on an annual basis.\u00a0 These include a targeted survey of forestry plantations, \u00a0a systematic survey of National Forest Inventory points across the country as well as surveys in commercial nurseries, garden centres, private gardens, roadside \/ motorway landscaping plantings and farm landscaping \/ agri-environment scheme plantings.<\/p>  <p>  A general Guidance note on the recognition of Dangerous Trees is available from my Department. \u00a0However, the initiation of any survey of all trees adjacent to roads is an operational matter for the bodies responsible for the respective roads, which in the case of public roads are by and large the local Roads Authorities and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, and the relevant Ministers.

A number of these recommendations are within my own Department&rsquo;s remit.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 2 addresses the leadership role of the State in addressing climate change. My Department published a Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy in 2017 which provides for a coordinated, whole-of Government approach to meeting the Government&rsquo;s target of improving its own energy efficiency by 33% by 2020 and thereby reducing the contribution of the public sector to Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions. The Strategy provides, inter alia, that public bodies are required to implement the Nearly Zero Energy Building standard two years in advance of the private sector and also provides a framework for investment in public building retrofits. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Recommendation 5, the Government launched, on 31 July, a grant- aided pilot micro generation scheme, targeting solar PV and domestic customers with self-generation. The pilot scheme also supports the use of battery storage for installations over a certain size. This is in line with industry best practice where installations are sized appropriately with the maximum amount of renewable electricity generated being consumed on site by the customer.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 6 addresses community ownership of renewable energy projects. The new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme will provide for communities to develop their own renewable electricity projects and for developer-led projects to offer investment opportunities to local citizens and communities. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Recommendation 9, a strong package of measures to support the roll out of electric vehicles is now in place, supporting the NDP objective of having at least 500,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  While much progress has been made in relation to a number of the Assembly&rsquo;s recommendations, the Government recognises that further consideration will need to be given to some of the report&rsquo;s other proposals, including through the ongoing work of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.
