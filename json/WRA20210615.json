I attended the G7 meeting in London in the context of my role as President of the Eurogroup, and I do not speak on EU taxation matters in my role as President of the Eurogroup. The Eurogroup is an informal body where the ministers of the euro area member states discuss matters relating to their shared responsibilities related to the euro. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance for Ireland, I represent Ireland&rsquo;s views at EU meetings where taxation is discussed. These meetings take place in a format where all EU Member States participate, known as ECOFIN, where the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union chairs the meetings. The Presidency is currently held by Portugal; from 1 July 2021 Slovenia will take over.<\/p>  <p>  As part of Council discussions late last year, all member states agreed to await the results of an OECD discussion on a global solution are available, but also maintained the commitment that the EU should act alone, in case no agreement is reached in the OECD.<\/p>  <p>  The G7 communique is an important signpost towards an agreement but it is also important to remember that there are 139 countries in the OECD's Inclusive Framework on BEPS who are the decision making body. An agreement will be a compromise reached through consensus, and will need to meet the needs of small and large countries, developed and developing.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest to achieve an ambitious agreement at the OECD discussions on the international tax architecture to provide the necessary certainty and stability.  <\/p>  <p>  The minimum rate is a sensitive one for Ireland and other small countries for good reasons.  I believe that any agreement must be able to accommodate healthy and fair tax competition. At the same time I strongly believe in the need for robust boundaries to guard against aggressive tax planning.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that a threshold will apply to the minimum effective tax rate.   The threshold proposed for Pillar 2 is &euro;750m annual global turnover.  Thus, the vast majority of businesses in Ireland will not be subject to these new rules.  It is also relevant that subsidiaries of US multinationals are already subject to a similar regime in the US known as GILTI which is expected to coexist with Pillar 2.   <\/p>  <p>  There will be further talks in late June and early July on an inclusive International agreement, and there is a lot to play out. I have said for some time that change is coming and we will adapt to this change as we have done before. Ireland will remain an attractive place for inward investment with an attractive tax rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500060#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":13,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 57 to 59, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500060#WRB00900"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[28455\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500060#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a viability test will be applied to all childcare providers seeking Covid-19-related employment wage supports until the end of 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[30770\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500060#WRB01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the employment wage subsidy scheme will continue to be made available to childcare providers without the income reduction requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 338 together.<\/p>  <p>  Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the operation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.<\/p>  <p>  While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, position of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of scheme is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;3.4 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;565 million have been granted to 49,800 employers in respect of 579,400 workers.<\/p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 1st June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021.<\/p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy. It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of December 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).<\/p>  <p>  For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%. There are no changes in respect of the qualification criteria for EWSS eligibility for the childcare sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has approved the extension of the EWSS for Q4 2021, however, it is considered too early as yet to prescribe the precise operational parameters of the scheme that should apply for that quarter.  Decisions in that regard will be taken closer to the time, possibly around the end of August\/early September, with the benefit of more up-to-date information on a number of variables, including the overall epidemiological situation, progress made in reopening all sectors of the economy, the vaccine efficacy, as well as the operation of the EWSS during the early parts of Q3.  As such, no decisions have yet been taken on any changes to the scheme for Q4 2021.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that, as the recovery gains further momentum, supports are further recalibrated in the longer-term interests of businesses that are in receipt of those supports and in the interests of the wider body of taxpayers. As such and as already signalled, for Q4, consideration will be given to a future change to EWSS which will require an employer contribution towards employee wages. This possible change is being signalled now to provide sufficient notice to businesses in respect of same.  Such a move, if it were to be introduced, could have the effect of testing the viability of businesses to the extent that they would be required to make a contribution against the background of a reduced overall subsidy from the State under the EWSS.  As with all firms that will benefit from the scheme in the months ahead, businesses in the childcare sector would be subject to the impact of this potential change.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, for those businesses who may need additional support during this period, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS) which has been extended, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme. I also announced on 1st June a new additional business support scheme (Business Resumption Support Scheme or BRSS) for businesses with reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions to be implemented in September 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500060#WRB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":18,"content":"<p>Question No. 61 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500060#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[31513\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500060#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated net contribution Ireland will make to EU funds in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) are expected to rise over the coming period, from approximately &euro;3.25 billion in 2021, to approximately &euro;3.95 billion in 2027, an average of &euro;3.6 billion per annum. <\/p>  <p>  Data on Ireland&rsquo;s EU Budget receipts are published annually, for the previous year, in my Department&rsquo;s Budgetary Statistics each autumn &ndash; i.e. 2020 receipt data will be published in autumn 2021.

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  <\/p>  <p>  At present, Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax and where certain conditions under different categories including, 'Income Level', 'Hardship', 'Personal Insolvency' and also to 'Personal Representative of a Deceased Person' are met. In most cases the property must be the sole or main residence of the liable person. The current income thresholds are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a married couple, civil partners or cohabiting couple. Deferral in respect of half of the local property tax payable is possible, where the gross income is above the threshold but less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.<\/p>  <p>  The deferred tax remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed.

As well as being recommended by the 2019 inter-Departmental Review of LPT this approach was endorsed by the Oireachtas Budgetary Oversight Committee in its September 2019 Scrutiny Report on the 2019 Review.

In this regard, I welcome the adoption of the new Personal Injuries Guidelines, which came into force on 24 April.  This is a key achievement in the Government&rsquo;s reform agenda that was realised several months ahead of schedule.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines significantly reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries, particularly those of soft tissue.  Of note is that a number of common injuries will now move to the jurisdiction of the District rather than the Circuit Court, thus reducing associated legal fees. The Guidelines also provide guidance in relation to injuries previously not included in the Book of Quantum and will be used by both the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the judiciary. Therefore, the Guidelines should help to bring more certainty to claimants and insurers, and as such reinforce the benefits of using the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to settle claims. This in turn should further reduce the costs of claims, particularly legal fees.  I have previously set out my view that these costs rather than the profit component tend to represent a bigger factor in the cost of insurance premiums. As such it is important that they are lowered.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the benefits accruing from reduced award levels, my expectation is that insurers will live up to commitments made, and will now commence reflecting savings to consumers, businesses and other groups.  In this regard, I recently met with the CEOs of the main insurers operating in Ireland to set out the Government&rsquo;s expectations in this regard and hear how they will respond to these recent developments.  These engagements were positive and I will meet with them again later this year to review progress.  <\/p>  <p>  While I continue to believe that this engagement is key to holding insurers to account, I have also asked officials in the Department to engage with the Central Bank to consider what enhancements could be made to improve transparency further through the National Claims Information Database so that the impact of the Guidelines can be seen in future motor, employer and public liability reports.

The report provided a basis for policy discussions and the amendments which were introduced in Finance Act 2019. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to IREFs, amendments were made in Finance Act 2019 to prevent the use of excessive debt and other payments to reduce distributable profits, and to prevent the avoidance of tax on gains on the redemption of IREF units.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to REITs, Finance Act 2019 extended the obligation to deduct DWT to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals.

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct companies as to what terms and conditions apply in relation to cover. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy&rsquo;s question is referring to life insurance, including mortgage protection insurance. It is my understanding that generally, insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life insurance and what terms to apply.  These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle.  In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration.  In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule.  In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors.  Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.<\/p>  <p>  While the above applies in general, I am aware of reports that some customers, including those with Type 1 diabetes, have experienced increased difficulties in obtaining life insurance or mortgage protection cover in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This is an issue that Minister of State Fleming and my officials have raised in meetings with Insurance Ireland, and more recently with the CEOs of the main insurers in the Irish market.   Insurance Ireland stated that while unaware of any cases where life cover has been denied, such policies are assessed on a case-by-case basis and that underlying health conditions, such as Type 1 diabetes, will be taken into account by underwriters, as was the case pre-COVID-19.  It will continue to keep in close contact with its members on this issue, which I welcome. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that both Minister of State Fleming and I have consistently and publicly stated that in the context of COVID-19, we expect insurance firms to treat their customers fairly, honestly, and in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  <\/p>  <p>Finally, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider.

In Budget 2021, a record total of &euro;3.3 billion was allocated towards housing, including an Exchequer allocation of &euro;3.1 billion. The capital spending on housing for 2021 is 26 per cent higher than the previous year, and almost two-and a half times what it was in 2017, demonstrating the massive commitments Government has already made in the area of housing.<\/p>  <p>  There are also significant non-fiscal constraints to achieving the desired level of output &ndash; a pandemic, labour shortages and material shortages. There are also skills shortages, which is why the Government is providing significant investment in skills and trades as announced last week in the Economic Recovery Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The funding landscape for residential development remains challenging particularly outside the main urban areas and commuter belt where demand is less proven. Even within the main urban centres the availability of finance very much depends on the entity, their track record and their previous relationship with banks or alternative lenders.

More recently, the announcement of some lenders exiting the Irish market has created further funding gaps. <\/p>  <p>  To address these ongoing gaps, Home Building Finance Ireland has expanded its product offering to cater for schemes from 5 to 300 units across Ireland. It has also adopted a regional focus with a view to targeting those developers and regions where the availability of funding is even more limited. <\/p>  <p>  Irish banks remain well capitalised and all funding metrics are substantially above minimum requirements which means they remain in a strong position to lend. Financial performance in Q1 2021 was positive across the three banks in which the State has a shareholding with stable loan volumes, no deterioration in asset quality and strong liquidity positions. Mortgage drawdowns for house purchase grew by 5% yoy in Q1 despite the public health restrictions that were in place.

The G7 agreement is an important signpost towards an agreement but it is relevant also that there are 139 countries participating in the OECD\/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS which is the formal decision body for any agreement. Any agreement will be a compromise and will need to be a consensus, and it must meet the needs of small and large countries, developed and developing.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, it is important to stress that the Government believes that it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest to achieve a sustainable, ambitious and equitable agreement on modernising the framework for international tax to reflect increasing globalisation and digitalisation. Secondly, it is also important to highlight that reform of the international tax rules has been an ongoing process since 2013.<\/p>  <p>  In this respect, Ireland has very much played its part in reframing these rules for the benefit of business and citizens, and we have proactively and diligently reformed our tax code in line with the new international norms. A lot has been achieved through the OECD&rsquo;s BEPS process and we now have far more robust international tax rules and safeguards to prevent abuse, arbitrage, base erosion and profit shifting than existed a decade ago.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2018, Ireland has constructively engaged in the more recent discussions to find a solution at the OECD to address the broader tax challenges of digitalisation and globalisation.  This is the subject of the current negotiations which are expected to conclude this year. The OECD is proposing a two pillar solution. Pillar 1 concerns the allocation of a proportion of taxing rights to the market jurisdiction, while Pillar 2 concerns a series of rules, the Income Inclusion Rule, the Under-Taxed Payment Rule and the Subject to Tax Rule which are designed to ensure a minimum effective tax rate for large multi-national enterprises.  It is important to note that the Pillar 2 proposals are broadly based on an existing US regime, GILTI, which applies to US multinationals in Ireland may already subject them to a top up tax in the US.   <\/p>  <p>  The minimum rate creates challenges for Ireland and other small countries for good reasons.  I believe that any agreement must be able to accommodate healthy and fair tax competition. Small countries, and Ireland is one of them, need to be able to use tax policy as a legitimate lever to compensate for advantages of scale, location, resources, industrial heritage and the real, material and persistent advantage enjoyed by larger countries.  At the same time, I fully accept that there needs to be clear boundaries to ensure any competition is fair and sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  It is my intention to continue to make a case for the agreement to accommodate Ireland&rsquo;s low but substantial 12.5% rate.<\/p>  <p>  There will be a meeting of 139 members of the Inclusive framework on 30 June and 1 July in order to try reaching a consensus agreement. Further technical work will continue over the summer and in the autumn with a view to achieving a comprehensive agreement in October in lines with the principles agreed.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has said for some time that change is coming and we will adapt to this change as we have done before. Ireland will remain an attractive place for inward investment. <\/p>  <p>  My Department previously estimated the annual cost to the Irish Exchequer of agreement of BEPS related measures could be between &euro;800 million and &euro;2 billion, depending on the design of the final agreement.  The starting point for the Department&rsquo;s estimate was a provisional jurisdiction-specific revenue modelling-tool circulated to each country bilaterally by the OECD. <\/p>  <p>  While this change could have a significant cost in reduced tax receipts, this is a price worth paying for the stability and tax certainty that will provide a robust international tax framework into the future.   We have seen the seen the escalating trade tensions brought about by the introduction of unilateral digital taxes.  It will benefit us all to avoid the risk of tit-for-tat sanctions negatively impacting the global trading environment.  As a small open economy the imposition of sanctions could result in a disproportionate negative impact to our trading environment. <\/p>  <p>  Regardless of the outcome at the OECD, Ireland will remain an attractive place for inward investment.    Tax is not the only driver for multinational enterprises deciding to locate in Ireland, all of the building blocks that make Ireland an attractive place to invest will remain in place.   We will maintain a competitive tax rate, with a stable business trading environment, and a young, well educated, English speaking workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500061#WRC04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":73,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 79 to 81, inclusive, answered with Question No. 65.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":74,"content":"<p>Question No. 82 answered with Question No. 55.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Real Estate Investment Trusts","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500061#WRC05000"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[31810\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500061#WRC05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the effective tax rate in the form of dividend withholding tax paid by Irish real estate funds as a proportion of operating and pre-tax profits respectively in each of the years 2018, 2019 and 2020; if he will consider increasing the rate of dividend withholding tax while removing exemptions for corporation tax and capital gains tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>The rules relating to Irish Real Estate Funds (IREF) are set out in Chapter 1B of Part 27, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, and were introduced by Finance Act 2016.

IREFs operate a 20% IREF withholding tax (as opposed to Dividend Withholding Tax (&ldquo;DWT&rdquo;)) on distributions to non-resident investors, who may be entitled to a refund of some or all of any tax withheld under a double tax treaty.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, there are a number of exceptions from the operation of IREF withholding tax such as for pension schemes and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax, provided the appropriate declarations are in place. <\/p><p>Unit holders in an IREF are generally subject to 20% IREF withholding tax on the occurrence of an IREF taxable event. An IREF taxable event can broadly be defined as any way in which the value of the profits of the IREF are passed to the unit holder, e.g. by way of a relevant payment (which is akin to receiving a dividend), and the IREF taxable amount in broad terms is the profit element of that payment.  Information on the amount of the taxable amounts and associated IREF withholding tax deducted for various years (2017, 2018 &amp;amp; 2019) is published by Revenue in section 4.3 of &ldquo;Corporation Tax &ndash; 2020 Payments and 2019 Returns&rdquo;.[1]  <\/p><p>IREFs are obliged to electronically file financial statements with Revenue for each accounting period (under the Investment Undertaking Electronic Account Filing Requirements Regulations 2018 SI No. 368 of 2018). <\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s request for information on tax withheld by an IREFs as a proportion of their pre-tax profits and operating profits, I am advised by Revenue that financial statements are presented in accordance with relevant accounting standards and any difference between pre-tax profits and operating profits would depend on an individual IREF&rsquo;s income, expenses, profits and gains and the applicable financial reporting standards. However, Revenue has advised that generally the difference between operating profits and pre-tax profits is finance costs. Finance Act 2019 amended the IREF regime to provide that IREFs with excessive deductions for financing costs are now regarded as having income subject to income tax.  For the three-month period to 31 December 2019, income tax of &euro;6.2m associated with excessive deductions for financing costs, was paid by the IREFs. <\/p><p>The Deputy has asked for a hypothetical effective tax rate calculated as the IREF tax as a proportion of profits.  However, such an effective tax rate would not reflect the effects of timing or the manner in which IREF tax is applied. As such, it could not be regarded as an accurate measure of an effective tax rate applicable to IREFs.  There are two key timing differences which such a measure would ignore.<\/p><p>The first is that IREF withholding tax applies to IREF taxable events &ndash; which generally speaking is the point at which the profits are passed from the IREF to the unit-holder.  The profits retained within the IREF, and not yet distributed to unit holders, will in the future be IREF taxable events and will be within the charge to IREF withholding tax at that point.<\/p><p>In addition, as IREFs hold real property, their operating profits and pre-tax profits will include revaluations of the property they hold.  Capital gains tax on gains on an investment property would only arise where the property is actually disposed of and any revaluation gains previously booked through the profit and loss account realised.<\/p><p>As such, it would not be appropriate to compare the rate of IREF withholding tax as a proportion of IREF profits (either operating profits or pre-tax profits) with either the rate of corporation tax or capital gains tax.  However, in Table 1 below, I have set out the profits of the IREFs, the IREF taxable amount for each year (being akin to the distributions made by the funds in those years) and the tax paid by the fund in those years.<\/p><p>Of note, Revenue has advised that the provision of the profit amounts disclosed in Table 1 come with a number of caveats: <\/p><p>Some of the figures contained in accounts are net figures &ndash; in this regard the income &amp;amp; losses, unrealised and realised losses and gains have been netted and therefore the figures should only be used for indicative purposes.<\/p><p>There can be inconsistency in the length of financial periods, with some in excess of 12 months. This was evident in 2017 filings and again last year where a number of the IREFs sought derogations from the Central Bank to prepare 18 months set of accounts for the 2019\/2020 period due to impact of Covid-19. Therefore, instead of preparing financial statements to 31 December 2019, some IREFs have now prepared and filed 18-month accounts to 30 June 2020, which will form part of the 2020 filing figures. <\/p><p>Table 1: Profits, IREF taxable events and tax liabilities of IREFs<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>2017<\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td>&euro;m<\/td>       <td>&euro;m<\/td>       <td>&euro;m<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Operating Profit per Financial Statements<\/td>       <td>912<\/td>       <td>868<\/td>       <td>1,159<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Profit Before Tax per Financial Statements<\/td>       <td>691<\/td>       <td>498<\/td>       <td>725<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>IREF taxable amount<\/td>       <td>45<\/td>       <td>213<\/td>       <td>369<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>IREF WHT<\/td>       <td>8.3<\/td>       <td>28.2<\/td>       <td>65.8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Income tax<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>6.2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total tax <\/td>       <td>8.3<\/td>       <td>28.2<\/td>       <td>72<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tax as percentage of IREF taxable amount<\/td>       <td>18.44%<\/td>       <td>13.24%<\/td>       <td>19.51%<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Proposed increased rate of IREF WHT and removal of exemptions from corporation tax and capital gains tax<\/p><p>The IREF withholding tax rate (20%) was not increased in Finance Act 2019 in line with the DWT rate (now 25%). I increased the rate of DWT to 25% to more accurately reflect the tax liability of Irish individuals who receive dividends from Irish companies.  IREF withholding tax, on the other hand, is targeted at non-residents, who may be entitled to a full or partial refund of any tax withheld under a double tax treaty.  The commonest rate to which IREF withholding tax can be reduced under such double tax treaties is 15%.<\/p><p>As the IREF withholding tax is levied on non-residents who may be entitled to a refund under a double tax treaty, it was not appropriate to increase the IREF withholding tax rate. <\/p><p>The reason that the IREF regime applies an exit tax, rather than an entity level tax, is because IREFs are collective investment vehicles.  Ireland&rsquo;s policy on collective investment vehicles, since 2000, has been to ensure that there is not two layers of taxation: one at the entity level and one at the unit holder level.  This is achieved by exempting certain regulated collective investment vehicles from taxation.  The IREF withholding tax is the alternative to an entity level taxation for a collective investment vehicle. <\/p><p>A number of anti-avoidance rules were brought forward in Finance Act 2019 to ensure that the IREF withholding tax was not being avoided, including both a debt cap and an income to interest ratio. <\/p><p>With regard to capital gains tax, when introduced in 2016, the IREF regime included a capital gains tax exemption in respect of property assets held for more than 5 years. However this exemption was removed in Finance Act 2017.  As a result, where IREF property assets are sold and the gains distributed to investors, IREF withholding tax at 20% applies on those gains. <\/p><p>The success of the 2019 targeted anti avoidance measures , in addition to Finance Act 2017&rsquo;s removal of the capital gains tax exemption, can be evidenced by the increased tax paid by IREFs as set out in Table 1.<\/p><p>Officials in my Department and Revenue continue to monitor the taxation of IREFs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500061#WRC05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500061#WRC05300"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[31696\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500061#WRC05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has had discussions recently with a bank (details supplied) on its decision to withdraw from the market and with another bank in relation to its plan to close 88 branches here given the concern of employees and customers on the resulting loss of banking competition here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[31779\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500061#WRC05500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will take steps to protect jobs and services in the banking sector; the engagement he has had with bank management and trade unions in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1522","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 129 together.<\/p>  <p>  The withdrawal of Ulster Bank and the potential withdrawal of KBC Bank Ireland (KBC) from the market as well as the decision by Bank of Ireland to close 88 branches in the Republic of Ireland are regrettable, particularly for their customers and staff and they represent unfavourable developments for the Irish banking market. <\/p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy will be aware, decisions with regard to staffing matters and the provision of services, are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the individual banks, which are run on an independent and commercial basis and as Minister for Finance, I have no role in such decisions.<\/p>  <p>  I note that Bank of Ireland has commented that it will be working closely with all colleagues at these branches and will be setting out a range of options, including relocating to a different branch, moving to a new role in the bank, or voluntary redundancy for those who choose it.

This year so far we have seen several major announcements including the withdrawal of Ulster Bank by Nat West and the potential withdrawal of KBC Bank Ireland, the forthcoming closure of a large number of bank branches by Bank of Ireland and a smaller number by AIB. While these decisions are regrettable, I welcome the engagements which are taking place between Nat West and AIB and PTSB and between KBC Bank Ireland and Bank of Ireland with regard to the transfer of business.<\/p>  <p>  I note the news on  Friday 11 June 2021 that Ulster Bank has reached a new Colleague Agreement with the Financial Services Union (FSU) and that this agreement is subject to a ballot of FSU members. While these are commercial negotiations, the Government is supportive of trying to bring about an outcome that is good for the banking sector, as well as for the staff and customers of Ulster Bank and KBC and for the Irish economy generally.<\/p>  <p>  The sector is facing a number of long running challenges such as negative interest rates, technological change that is reducing the barriers to entry to a whole range of new entrants, and changing customer preferences as they use more and more digital services, while still wanting the traditional branch network to be available.  Competing with online firms while coping with high cost structures is posing a considerable challenge for the traditional full service sector. Overall, this puts pressure on banks' profits, and, in turn, the attractiveness of the market. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish retail banking system is concentrated with retail banks accounting for the majority of new mortgage lending and new lending to SMEs. However, price competition is possible even in a concentrated system. Notwithstanding the recent announcements in the banking sector, Ireland continues to have an extensive network for banking services, including post offices and credit unions.  An Post also offers counter services for AIB, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches and Bank of Ireland has recently announced that it is following suit. A number of non-banks have also expanded their offerings in the mortgage and SME sectors recently.<\/p>  <p>  The Government wants to ensure that the banking and financial system is one which will effectively contribute and support economic growth and employment.

The objective of these mortgage measures is to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households and to reduce the risk of credit driven house price spirals from developing. <\/p>  <p>  The mortgage measures apply certain loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) restrictions to residential mortgage lending by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank. For example, the LTI limit is 3.5 times the borrower&rsquo;s income. For first-time buyers (FTBs), the LTV limit is 90% of the value of the residential property and for second and subsequent buyers (SSBs) the LTV limit is 80%.  However, lenders also have a certain flexibility at their own discretion to provide a certain amount of mortgage lending in excess of these thresholds. <\/p>  <p>  While regulated lenders must comply with the various rules within the macroprudential and consumer protection frameworks, the extension of credit by lenders to potential customers (including a joint mortgage application) is ultimately a commercial decision for the lender themselves and each lender will have its own individual credit lending policies.<\/p>  <p>  Before providing a mortgage, lenders are required to undertake thorough creditworthiness assessments to ensure a borrower will be able to repay the mortgage. This assessment must take into account the individual circumstances of the borrower, including personal circumstances and financial situation.  In this context, lenders can and do take into account rental payments when making their affordability assessment as part of regular credit worthiness assessment and underwriting process. <\/p>  <p>  However it is also worth noting that a mortgage is the largest liability that most households will take on in their lifetime and that it comes with less flexibility than a rental contract, leaving borrowers more exposed to shocks to incomes, house prices and interest rates in the future. Therefore, the ability to make regular repayments &ndash; evidenced through rental payments &ndash; does not substitute for the protection for borrowers in having a down payment for the purchase of a residential property.  A mortgage deposit acts as a cushion of housing equity, and can help households to absorb house price falls without the borrower falling into negative equity. <\/p>  <p>  By way of additional information the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses including rent and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate and lenders must be satisfied that mortgages are affordable for borrowers for the duration of the life of a loan. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated entity is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated entity. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500062#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":92,"content":"<p>Question No. 88 answered with Question No. 65.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":93,"content":"<p>Question No. 89 answered with Question No. 78.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stability and Growth Pact","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500062#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[20479\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500062#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the fact that while EU fiscal rules limit Government deficits to 3% of GDP and a debt of 60% of Ireland&rsquo;s GDP, the 2020 budget deficit here was 6%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1504","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, in March 2020 the General Escape Clause (GEC) of the EU&rsquo;s Stability and Growth Pact was activated for the first time.

In addition there is a commitment to bring new homes, which are currently exempt from the LPT, into the taxation system. <\/p><p>Accordingly, the Government recently gave its approval for the General Scheme of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021 which has been published. The measures proposed for this Bill will fulfil the Programme for Government commitments in this area and will secure the future of the Local Property Tax.  Properties that were previously exempt or fell outside the tax will now be brought into scope.  <\/p><p>The Government has agreed that a modified version of scenario 5 of the 2019 Inter-Departmental Review of LPT should form the basis for the calculation of future LPT liabilities. As outlined in the 2019 Review, there are significant gains to progressivity from the adoption of a scenario 5 approach to a new method for liability calculation. The Review included a Distributional Impact Analysis using the ESRI SWITCH Model (Simulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes) tax and benefit micro-simulation model, which allow an assessment of how regressive or progressive the impact of the different policy scenarios would be for households.<\/p><p>It estimated that scenario 5 would result in average increases of 0.40 per cent to households&rsquo; equivalised disposable income as a result of the measures. There would be a broadly progressive trend, with households in the first two deciles gaining the most in relative terms at 0.46 per cent and 0.43 per cent respectively, while households in the top three income deciles experience below average gains of 0.37 per cent. The proposed approach provides for a  new valuation band 1 from &euro;0 to &euro;200,000, with an LPT charge fixed at the current  rates for bands 1 and 2,  of &euro;90 and &euro;225 respectively. This results in the vast majority of current band 1 properties remaining in the new band 1 and continuing to pay the same amount as presently.  The approach also provides for higher rates above &euro;1.05million and above &euro;1.75 million. Both of these measures are designed to further improve the progressivity of the tax. <\/p><p>The Government has decided to both cut the rate of the tax and widen the bands to make the changes affordable.  This means that the majority of homeowners are likely to see either a decrease or no change.  Where increases arise, the majority will be a single band (&euro;90), notwithstanding the significant increases we have seen in property values since 2013.  The overall structure of the tax, which is broadly understood and accepted, is being maintained.  <\/p><p>I look forward to publication in due course of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500062#WRD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":105,"content":"<p>Question No. 95 answered with Question No. 65.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Policy","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500062#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[31607\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500062#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to address aggressive tax planning as part the Government&rsquo;s priority reform commitments made under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan; the way this will impact on the bottom line of the Exchequer and on budget forecasts; his views on a recent IFAC report which states the loss to the Exchequer due to international changes in corporation tax rules could be &euro;3.5 billion; if he plans to instruct his Department to provide an updated forecast report on the potential loss to the Exchequer due to international changes in corporation tax rules and the options for replacing these tax revenues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>Ireland has committed to addressing issues highlighted in recent Country Specific Recommendations as part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan that has been submitted to the European Commission.<\/p>  <p>  The draft Plan, involving projects with a value of almost &euro;1 billion, will enable Ireland to access funding under the EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility which forms the centrepiece of NextGenerationEU, the Union&rsquo;s response to the global pandemic.

The scheme ended on 30 April.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 1 October 2020, a total of 66,058 receipts have been uploaded to the Revenue Receipts Tracker, as at 9 June 2021. The related expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;10,862,004, and the potential tax cost is &euro;2,172,401, assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief. Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme was developed at a time last year when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.   <\/p>  <p>  While I am very mindful of the significant difficulties that remain to be faced by the hospitality sector, I made the determination that the broad interests of taxpayers would not have been best served by extending the scheme over the summer months in circumstances where most will be staying at home and hopefully holidaying in Ireland. This is particularly the case when other very significant support measures will remain in place.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, I do not have plans to re-introduce the Stay and Spend scheme.  However, it may be useful to highlight and summarise the significant supports that remain available to support businesses in the hospitality sector:<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9% from 1 November 2020.  This is a temporary but important measure to provide support to the sector, where many businesses remain closed for now and those that are open are operating at significantly reduced capacity. It was originally to apply until 31 December 2021. However, as I announced recently, the reduced rate will be extended to 1 September 2022. The extension until the end of the 2022 summer season allows for a longer period of recovery for the sector.  It should be noted that this VAT rate reduction came after the introduction of the Stay and Spend Tax Credit and reflects the fact that the latter was not intended to be the sole sector-specific support for hospitality. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) (extended to 31 December 2021) continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the hospitality and tourism sector and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with COVID-19 Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The extension of the tax debt warehousing scheme to allow the period where liabilities arising can be &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; to be extended to the end of 2021 for all eligible taxpayers, with an interest free period during 2022, and to include overpayments of EWSS in the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500062#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":118,"content":"<p>Question No. 100 answered with Question No. 65.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500062#WRD03300"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[31514\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500062#WRD03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost to the Exchequer of not charging any USC on the first &euro;13,000 of assessable income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>Ireland has one of the most progressive personal income tax systems in the world, which plays a crucial role in the process of income redistribution.

Following the Government meeting on 1 June, I announced a number of measures to provide certainty to businesses as public health restrictions are lifted and allow them to plan for the future as they re-open and resume normal trading. <\/p>  <p>  These measures include<\/p>  <p>  the extension of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to the end of 2021, <\/p>  <p>  the extension of the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme to the end of 2021 and its enhancement to provide additional support to businesses upon re-opening, <\/p>  <p>  a new additional business support scheme (Business Resumption Support Scheme or BRSS) for businesses with reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions to be implemented in September 2021, <\/p>  <p>  the extension of the tax debt warehousing scheme to allow the period where liabilities arising can be &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; to be extended to the end of 2021 for all eligible taxpayers, with an interest free period during 2022, and to include overpayments of EWSS in the scheme, and <\/p>  <p>  the extension of the reduced rate of VAT of 9% applying on a temporary basis to Hospitality and Tourism related goods and services until 1 September 2022. <\/p>  <p>  An enhanced CRSS restart payment is being introduced for businesses availing of CRSS who can re-open from 2 June, they will be eligible to claim an enhanced restart payment of three weeks at double rate of payment paid in one &lsquo;restart week payment&rsquo; as they exit the scheme. The statutory maximum payment will be increased from &euro;5,000 per week to &euro;10,000 per week for this restart payment. This means that businesses opening from 2 June will receive a maximum of &euro;30,000 restart payment calculated with reference to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  As the economy re-opens, a new general scheme the BRSS will be introduced, aimed at businesses which have had reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions.  Similar to CRSS it will apply to businesses registered with Revenue, whose profits are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, and their turnover is reduced by 75% in the reference period ( 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021) compared with 2019.   Qualifying businesses will be able to apply to Revenue for a once-off cash payment, representing an advance credit for trading expenses that are deductible for income and\/or corporation tax purposes.  The scheme will be implemented in September 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The extensions of the EWSS and CRSS, the tax debt warehousing enhancements and the new BRSS will apply across the economy and are not specific to any sector. However, the Government recognises the continuing challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sectors, and have agreed that the reduced VAT rate of 9% applying to the sectors on a temporary basis will be extended to September 2022. The extension of the reduced rate until the end of the 2022 summer season allows for a longer period of recovery for the sector. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess matters as we move forward with the reopening of the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic as far as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500063#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Programme for Government","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500063#WRE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[31807\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500063#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of progress to implement the programme for Government commitment to reduce the cost of insurance and increase competition in the market.","asker":"1481","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>The Government recognises the concerns felt around the cost and availability of insurance. As such, timely implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform is high on the Government&rsquo;s agenda. This sets out 66 actions which aim to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden that insurance costs can have on business, community and voluntary organisations. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to note that significant progress has been made to date in this regard. This includes:<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of an Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance; <\/p>  <p>  The adoption of new Personal Injuries Guidelines by the Judicial Council; <\/p>  <p>  The creation of a public process on enhancing the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB).<\/p>  <p>  Work is continuing to progress other key actions, such as reforming of the duty of care, strengthening the laws on perjury, enhancing the enforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), expanding the National Claims Information Database (NCID) with a view to  publish its first report on employer and public liability insurance, continuing to reform PIAB, and considering issues related to the Central Bank&rsquo;s upcoming report on differential pricing so that we can respond accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the new Personal Injuries Guidelines came into effect on 24 April. These materially reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries, particularly those of soft tissue. As a result, a number of common injuries will now move to the jurisdiction of the District rather than the Circuit Court, thus reducing associated legal fees. In addition to the lower awards and legal fees, the Guidelines will be used by both the judiciary and PIAB. Accordingly, they should help bring more certainty to claimants and insurers and reinforce the benefits of using PIAB, thereby further reducing the costs of claims. <\/p>  <p>Another key achievement of the reform agenda is the creation of the new Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market  . Since its establishment, the Office has held meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, representative bodies, civil society groups and other state regulators on the issues surrounding competition. Minister of State Fleming chairs meetings of the Office which has met on a number of occasions since its establishment and reports on a regular basis to the Cabinet Sub-Group on its progress.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure the timely implementation of the Action Plan which will have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500063#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":148,"content":"<p>Question No. 111 answered with Question No. 109.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500063#WRE01500"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[31594\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500063#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will confirm the use of the &euro;2.5 billion allocated to Ireland under the SURE instrument operated by the European Commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>In the Budget 2021 speech, I announced the Irish Government&rsquo;s decision to make a formal application to the European Commission for funding under the Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) Instrument. <\/p>  <p>  The SURE instrument is intended primarily to support Member States with efforts to protect workers and jobs, and also support some health-related measures.<\/p>  <p>  The application was submitted on 26 October and was based on costs already expended by the Government as part of the Covid-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), which satisfied the conditions of the SURE instrument.

As such the Government cannot interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance, or direct as to what cover is provided on. Consequently, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in this, as reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive). <\/p>  <p>  Current Government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is primarily focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. Almost &euro;1 billion in flood relief measures is being invested over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027, with an expectation that insurers will provide cover where this has occurred. A key pillar of Government policy is the  Memorandum of Understanding between the Office of Public Works (OPW) and industry representatives Insurance Ireland. This provides for the exchange of data in relation to the 18 completed flood defence schemes which should, in turn, provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in these areas. While there has been an overall increase in the provision of flood insurance between 2015 and 2020, it is acknowledged that some households are still experiencing difficulties in areas with demountable flood defences. My officials are engaging with both Insurance Ireland, the OPW and other stakeholders regarding flood defence schemes and how the levels of insurance cover might be improved in areas where flood defence works have been completed.<\/p>  <p>Legislating for compulsory flood insurance was an option considered by my Department in its review of policy in relation to flood insurance in 2016, which formed part of the &lsquo;Interdepartmental Flood Policy Coordination Group Interim Report&rsquo;.

This new stamp duty rate replaces the pre-existing stamp duty rates for residential property, which are 1% for the first &euro;1 million in consideration and 2% on amounts above &euro;1 million (on a per-property basis).<\/p><p>In brief the new measure has the following effect.<\/p><p>The charge applies to bulk purchasers, being a purchaser who acquires 10 or more residential dwellings (other than apartments) within a 12 month period.<\/p><p>When the threshold of 10 is passed, the higher 10% rate applies in respect of all purchases within the 12-month period.  For example, a purchase of 4 houses in August 2021 would be liable at normal residential rates.  If the same purchaser acquires a further 6 units in November 2021, the 10% rate applies on all 10 houses, with credit allowed for stamp duty already paid on the earlier purchases.<\/p><p>The measure applies in respect of bulk purchases of residential dwellings, other than of apartments in apartment blocks. Apartments are defined as a multi-storey building of 5 or more units, having common or shared access.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>Alongside the recent stamp duty measure, my Department has also introduced a number of measures in recent years designed to regularise the tax affairs of property focussed investment funds and to ensure they are taxed at an appropriate level . <\/p><p>Finance Act 2013 introduced the regime for the operation of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in Ireland, based on an established international standard. The purpose of the REIT regime is to allow for a collective investment vehicle which provides a comparable after-tax return to investors to direct investment in rental property, by eliminating the double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply. <\/p><p>Finance Act 2016 introduced the Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) regime to address the use of certain fund vehicles facilitating the investment in Irish property by non-resident investors, thereby avoiding a charge to tax on profits arising from Irish real estate. The regime provides that the profits arising to an Irish fund from Irish property remain within the charge to Irish tax. Generally IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on distributions to non-resident investors. <\/p><p>Finance Act 2019 made amendments to the taxation of REITs and IREFs to ensure the regimes operate as intended. In relation to REITs, Finance Act 2019 extended the obligation to deduct Dividend Withholding Tax to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals. In addition, the deemed disposal provisions upon cessation of REIT status were restricted to REITs that have been in operation for at least 15 years, in line with the regime's stated objective of encouraging long-term, stable investment in rental property. In relation to IREFs, amendments were made in Finance Act 2019 to prevent the use of excessive debt and other payments to reduce distributable profits, and to prevent the avoidance of tax on gains on the redemption of IREF units. These amendments were made to ensure appropriate levels of tax are paid by investors in Irish property.<\/p><p>Given the timescales involved in property investment, it is not yet possible to assess the impact of the various more recent measures, including (where appropriate) their impact on the affordability of housing. I can however assure the Deputy that my Department keeps tax issues under ongoing review and I will consider any further measures in respect of the taxation of property funds if and when I think it necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500063#WRE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":170,"content":"<p>Question No. 119 answered with Question No. 77.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":171,"content":"<p>Question No. 120 answered with Question No. 65.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500063#WRE03800"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[20056\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500063#WRE03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding his engagement with the insurance sector specifically related to individuals and businesses that are unable to get flood protection cover despite the completion of OPW flood defences to protect the location of their properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial services regulation, including for the insurance sector, while the provision of cover is a separate commercial matter for insurance companies.

In particular, the ESRI refer to potential for increased revenue by bringing properties built since 2013 into the charge for tax. This supports the Government&rsquo;s recent decision to take this course of action  which is projected to deliver a yield of &euro;560 million. <\/p>  <p>  Aside from the role of the Local Property Tax as a functional wealth tax, it is also important to note the ESRI&rsquo;s findings of the difficulties associated with introducing a wider wealth tax. Namely, that it would be difficult to raise substantial revenues from a wealth tax without applying it at a low level, with few exemptions. However, without such exemptions, tax liabilities would fall heavily on low income households. Furthermore, the authors refer to a number of economic distortions which could result from the introduction of a wealth tax, such as potential disincentives for earnings, to a further increase in the price of owner-occupied housing. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that, as well as the Local Property Tax, Ireland already taxes wealth in a variety of other ways, such as through our Capital Gains Tax and Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT),  which are levied on an individual or company on the disposal of an asset in the case of CGT, or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance, in the case of CAT.  <\/p>  <p>  I would also highlight that analysis previously undertaken by the ESRI, using OECD data, shows that Ireland&rsquo;s tax system does more than any other country in the EU to reduce the gap between market and disposable incomes, which is an important consideration in wider discussions around the redistributive role of our tax system. <\/p>  <p>  My Department keeps tax options under ongoing review, but there is no plan at this time for it to conduct a specific analysis of the type the Deputy suggests. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500063#WRE04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500063#WRE04700"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[31814\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500063#WRE04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the policy statement published by the Financial Conduct Authority on 28 May 2021 to end the practice of dual pricing in the insurance market; if his Department has consulted the Financial Conduct Authority, Central Bank or the insurance industry on the details of this policy statement and its impact on insurers operating in both the Irish and British markets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[31193\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500063#WRE04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he is taking to eliminate dual pricing in the insurance industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 354 together.<\/p><p>The Deputies will be aware that the Programme for Government includes a commitment to work to remove dual pricing, a form of differential pricing, from the insurance market.

Accordingly, completion of the analysis will be essential in order to ensure a full market perspective, evidence-based conclusions and in turn appropriately calibrated regulatory interventions as are needed to apply to the specificities of the Irish market.  In addition, the associated consumer research will also provide insights which will be essential to the Central Banks&rsquo;s overall analysis.<\/p><p>Both Minister of State Fleming and I have repeatedly called on the industry to treat its customers fairly and in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  Minister of State Fleming has raised his concerns with the main insurers that dual pricing in particular may be unfair for some customers and that it be proactive in responding to the Central Bank&rsquo;s interim findings.  However, the Government also believes that prior to bringing forward any solutions, it is important that the Central Bank&rsquo;s review is completed, so as to ensure remedies are evidence-based and do not impact consumers negatively, including impacting the ability of consumers to shop around for better deals.

Research in this area is highly valuable for informing policy development. I take positives from this report such as employment rates growing for many of these groups over the period 2014 to 2019 as an indicator of a pre-pandemic baseline. I also note that there is still progress to be made in relation to challenges which young workers, people with disabilities, ethnic minorities, lone parents and those with lower educational attainment face when trying to access decent work, when compared to the general population.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key lessons highlighted in the report is in relation to the need for robust and widespread disaggregated data in order to better understand equality in Ireland. There has been other recent work in this space with the publication of the report &lsquo;Ireland's UN SDGs &ndash; Goal 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, 2021&rsquo; which is the 8th in a series of publications from the Central Statistics Office monitoring how Ireland is progressing towards meeting its targets under the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from the United Nations. This report was done in collaboration with my Department and provides indicators in relation to decent work, employment rights and policies, economic growth and infrastructure. Together with the work from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and ESRI report it will allow for better ongoing monitoring of Ireland&rsquo;s current position on decent work. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also continues to work to promote decent work by strengthening employment rights. Ireland has a comprehensive body of employment, equality and industrial relations legislation, in respect of which the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is mandated to secure compliance.  Ireland&rsquo;s employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of service, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees. Employment rights legislation was strengthened by the addition of the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 which prohibited zero-hour contracts except in the following circumstances: <\/p>  <p>  - Where the work is of a casual nature;<\/p>  <p>  - Where the work is done in emergency circumstances; or<\/p>  <p>  - Short-term relief work to cover routine absences for the employer<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work on multiple aspects of decent work such as those outlined in the ESRI report: access to work; adequate earnings; employee voice; security and stability of work; equality of opportunity and treatment in employment; and health and safety.

From early-June 2020, in addition to their statutory functions, all WRC Inspectors have been deployed in support of the Health and Safety Authority in ensuring that Covid-19 Return to Work Safety Protocols are being observed in specified sectors. To the period June 2020 to end May this year WRC inspectors completed almost 6,800 such Covid-19 visits which were carried out alongside the WRC broader remit.

Generating additional demand for energy upgrades will be necessary in order to achieve these targets.  SEAI has conducted qualitative and quantitative research among homeowners in order to clearly identify the most important benefits and most significant challenges associated with retrofit. This research shows that we need to convince homeowners of the comfort, cost and environmental benefits of home energy upgrades. We need to inform them of the availability of grants to support their efforts as well as free services for eligible energy poor homes. Finally we need to mitigate misgivings homeowners may have about cost of works and disruption. <\/p>  <p>  SEAI Home Retrofit Demand Generation activity is constantly developing with successful programme promotion and awareness building ongoing.  One recent example was actively targeting Heat Pump installations following the lifting of Covid lockdown restrictions in April.

The number of premises anticipated to be passed by NBI in Mayo by the end of 2021 is\u00a0some 2,100 premises.<\/p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays on delivery of aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors with restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally), as well as the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale, up including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract to address the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the project.<\/p>  <p>  \u200bFurther details are available on specific areas within Mayo through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence.\u00a0I am advised that\u00a0NBI is working\u00a0to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.

BCPs installed with high speed publicly accessible broadband include Keel Community Centre, Clare Island Community Centre, Kilmovee Community Centre, Belderrig Community &amp;amp; Research Centre, Cushlough Community Centre, Taugheen Community Centre, Killaser Community Centre, Bofeenaun Community Centre and Islandeady Community Centre.<\/p>  <p>  Cloghans National School, Scoil N&eacute;finn, Midfield National School, Meelick More National School, Kinaffe National School, Facefield National School, Errew National School, Shraigh National School, Rathbane National School, Rathnamagh National School, Dookinella National School, Tavraun Central National School and Saint Coleman&rsquo;s National School are also installed\u00a0as part of this initiative.

As society begins to reopen and passenger demand for taxis increases, this will become an important support for drivers as they return to work. Drivers who earn over &euro;960 may be eligible for the COVID-19 Part Time Job Incentive for the Self-Employed Scheme. The COVID-19 Enterprise Support Scheme, worth up to &euro;1,000, is also open to SPSV operators to meet the costs associated with returning to work. All of these schemes are administered by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  That is the context in which my Department has funded additional measures specifically targeted at the costs incurred by SPSV industry. As the Deputy will be aware, many of the major costs faced by SPSV operators, such as insurance and dispatch operator fees, can be deferred or cancelled during a period of inactivity. In last year&rsquo;s Budget, I allocated approximately &euro;2.6 million towards the waiver of standard vehicle licence fees, in recognition of the fact that this was a cost borne by SPSV operators which could not be deferred. <\/p>  <p>  The replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator and I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero\/low-emission vehicles. That is why I have increased the funding available to the Electric SPSV (eSPSV) grant scheme for 2021 to &euro;15 million, up from &euro;1 million. I also doubled the amount payable under the scheme to &euro;20,000 for operators who scrap older vehicles and make the switch to full electric models. This scheme can be used in conjunction with COVID-19 investment and liquidity measures, such as the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. There has been a strong interest in the revised scheme since its launch in February with over 500 applications received to date.<\/p>  <p>  In April I met with the Advisory Committee on SPSVs and discussed my hope that passenger demand would begin to return this summer as public health restrictions are lifted and the tourism and hospitality industries begins to reopen. I understand the difficulties facing operators across the country and considered possible additional measures to target the statutory, non-deferable costs faced by SPSV operators. <\/p>  <p>  Last week, following consultation with the Advisory Committee, I announced further measures worth &euro;6.5 million split between 2021 and 2022 to address these costs. The measures will waive standard licence renewal fees again in 2022, and will refund the cost of NCTs and SPSV Motor Tax for a given 12 month period. The NTA will administer these refund schemes, the commencement date for which has yet to be decided, but likely to be during Q3 of 2021. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that many other measures been taken to support the industry. At the start of the pandemic, the industry&rsquo;s regulator, the National Transport Authority waived late licence renewal fees and engaged with the insurance industry to facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those operators who decided to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences. The Authority has also extended age limits for taxis and hackneys three times since the start of the pandemic. The most recent extension, made last month, ensures no vehicle will be forced to exit the fleet due to age limits in 2021 and I trust that the Authority will keep this issue under review as society and the economy reopens and passenger demand returns. I understand that the Authority will also shortly advance a public consultation on extending the period of time that SPSV licences may be placed in &lsquo;inactive status.&rsquo;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500071#WRN05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":638,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500072#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":639,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[31844\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500072#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the budget allocated to the public charge point scheme in 2021; the spend on the scheme in 2020 and to date in 2021; the number of charge points constructed in each county under the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":640,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Charge Point Scheme has been in place since September 2019 and will continue to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers.

However, before introducing such a tax it is of course important to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long term vacant dwellings, and the reasons why they are vacant.<\/p>  <p>  An independent report on this topic commissioned by my Department was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in September 2018 in accordance with the provisions of section 86 of Finance Act 2017. The independent Indecon Consultants report on the Taxation of Vacant Residential Property presents a detailed evidence-based assessment of vacancy rates in areas in which the demand for housing is most acute.  This assessment suggests that the vacancy rate in these areas was significantly lower than the national average and had fallen in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  The report suggested that the vacancy rate within rent pressure zones, excluding holiday homes, was approximately 6% but that most of these vacancies were short and medium, with a low level of long term vacancies &ndash; the rate lying between 0 and 3% for Dublin for example. The report estimated the rate of properties which are vacant long term and habitable to be only 0.8% of properties in rent pressure zones. The report also suggested that the vacancy rate was likely to continue to fall due to market developments. <\/p>  <p>  Indecon Consultants did not recommend the introduction of a residential vacant property tax, as they did not believe it would be an effective response to deal with the housing shortages.  Indecon&rsquo;s view was that the very low vacancy rates in the areas of greatest demand for housing, particularly in terms of medium-term vacancy, indicate that the potential for a vacant property tax to increase housing supply was very limited and could represent a distraction from the need to significantly accelerate the building of new social housing, affordable housing and the facilitation of other housing supply.<\/p>  <p>  It is of course necessary to monitor the position and I understand in that regard that the CSO plans to deploy an enhanced approach during the next Census to the collection of information in relation to residential properties that appear to be vacant. I would like to use the LPT revaluation opportunity to obtain some limited information about vacant residential properties which would be useful in terms of future policy making. Revenue is currently redesigning its LPT return form to take account of the new arrangements. It is likely that the questions will be limited to whether a property is vacant as at 1 November 2021, if so, if it has been vacant for a specified period and the reason for the vacancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500073#WRP02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":720,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500073#WRP02300"},{"type":"question","counter":721,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[30497\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500073#WRP02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will extend the parameters for the criteria that qualify a business as a start up for the purposes of receiving the employment wage subsidy scheme which is currently capped at 37 weeks trading in 2019 for eligibility in 2020 recognising that a business takes at least one year to establish itself such as a business (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":722,"content":"<p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) was legislated for under the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  On 1 June last, the Government announced an extension of the scheme and full details will be published in forthcoming legislation. The EWSS is an enterprise wide support available to employers of businesses impacted by Covid-19.  <\/p><p>The current eligibility criteria for EWSS states that an employer must be able to demonstrate that his or her business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 July and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Additionally, the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible for the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme. This includes all businesses, including start-ups, where the conditions are satisfied. <\/p><p>For 2020 paydates, the reduction in turnover or customer orders for the period 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2020 is relative to:<\/p><p>- the same period in 2019 where the business was in existence prior to 1 July 2019;<\/p><p>- the date of commencement to 31 December 2019, where the business commenced trading between 1 July and 1 November 2019; or<\/p><p>- the <i>projected<\/i>turnover or orders for 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2020, where the business commenced trading after 1 November 2019.<\/p><p>For 2021 paydates, the reduction in turnover or customer orders for the period 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021 is relative to:<\/p><p>- the same period in 2019 where the business was in existence prior to 1 January 2019;<\/p><p>- the date of commencement to 30 June 2019, where the business commenced trading between 1 January and 1 May 2019; or<\/p><p>- the <i>projected<\/i>turnover or customer orders for 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021, where the business commenced trading after 1 May 2019.<\/p><p>The legislation prescribes qualifying criteria and relevant timeframes for all businesses that are in start-up mode and there is no reference to, or provision for any &ldquo;cap at 37 weeks trading in 2019 for eligibility in 2020&rdquo; in either the legislation or in the Revenue Guidance.In the circumstances outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, it is unclear how the business which started trading in June 2019 could operate for &ldquo;39 weeks that year&rdquo;.  The business, in common with all others in a similar position, is required to demonstrate a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders in the period 1 July to 31 December 2020 versus the same period in 2019 and if it is unable to do so, it is not eligible for the scheme. I am advised that the criteria for start-up businesses provided for in the EWSS legislation has worked effectively for the vast majority and I will be adopting a similar approach for the legislation to implement the extension of the EWSS recently, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>I should also point out that the EWSS legislative provisions require that immediately at the end of each month, from August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the scheme must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances and if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer meets the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, then the business must immediately cease claiming EWSS payments.<\/p><p>The administration of the EWSS is placed under the care and management of Revenue.  Revenue&rsquo;s focus on the EWSS in the early stages was concentrated on getting the scheme up and running and ensuring that all employers who are eligible for subsidy payments received the payments quickly.  Revenue is now operating a real-time compliance programme to ensure the qualifying criteria contained in Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 are met.  This includes identifying employers who should be excluding themselves from the scheme, based on their self-review of the qualifying criteria, but have failed to do so.<\/p><p>Where Revenue identifies that the subsidy paid to an employer was incorrectly claimed, it must then be repaid. However, the employer has the right to appeal Revenue&rsquo;s determination that it was not eligible to avail of the scheme to the independent Tax Appeals Commission (TAC). The appeal process requires Revenue to assess the subsidy amount owed as a &lsquo;relevant tax&rsquo; after which the employer has 30 days to lodge an appeal with the TAC.<\/p><p>Where the employer accepts that the subsidy amount was incorrectly claimed but cannot afford to repay it in a single payment then Revenue may agree to a phased payment arrangement over an extended timeframe. The employer may also be eligible to temporarily &lsquo;park&rsquo; the debt under the Debt Warehousing scheme, providing the business meets the overall eligibility criteria for that scheme.<\/p><p>Finally, guidelines on the operation of the EWSS including comprehensive information on employer eligibility and supporting proofs is available on the Revenue website. Information regarding the Debt Warehousing scheme is also available on the Revenue website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500073#WRP02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":723,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500073#WRP02600"},{"type":"question","counter":724,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[30528\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500073#WRP02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if car insurance providers are entitled to discriminate in the provision of insurance policies based on age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":725,"content":"<p>At the outset, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct companies as to what terms and conditions apply in relation to cover. <\/p>  <p>  The Equal Status Acts 2008-2018 prohibit certain kinds of discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services, obtaining or disposing of accommodation and in relation to educational establishments. The legislation protects against discrimination on nine specific grounds, including age. However, the legislation also provides that people can be treated differently on any of the grounds (except gender) in relation to insurance &ndash; but only if the differences are based on actuarial or statistical data or other relevant underwriting or commercial factors and are reasonable.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance companies consider a number of risks when determining the premium for a proposed insurance policy.  I understand that motor insurers, in making decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, use a combination of rating factors such as the age of the driver, the type of car, claims record, driving experience, number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  Insurers also price in accordance with their specific claims experience and do not use the same combination of rating factors. Accordingly, premium prices vary across the market, demonstrating why it is important for consumers to shop around on their insurance policies.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it may be useful for the Deputy to know that Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance industry in this country, operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.

To qualify for the relief, the first sale or purchase must occur between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2022. The next sale or purchase must occur within 24 months of the first sale or purchase. Following an ex-post review of this relief, the relief, which was due to expire on 31 December 2019, was extended to 31 December 2022 as part of Finance Act 2019. <\/p><p><b>Retirement Relief <\/b><\/p><p>Business or farming assets are relieved from CGT where the person disposing of the asset(s) is aged 55 or over and both owned and used the asset(s) for the ten years prior to the disposal. While this relief is commonly referred to as Retirement Relief, it is not necessary to retire from the business or farming in order to qualify. <\/p><p>The operation of the relief differs between the disposal of a business or farm to a child and disposals to anyone other than to a child. The operation of the relief also differs between persons aged 55 to 65 years and persons aged 66 years and over. <\/p><p>From 1 January 2014 if the person is between 55 and 65 years of age and the disposal is to a child, the full relief may be claimed. If the person is 66 years of age or older the relief is restricted to &euro;3 million. <\/p><p>If the child disposes of the asset within 6 years, the relief will be withdrawn and they must pay the full amount of CGT on the original disposal and the subsequent disposal. <\/p><p>In the case of a disposal of a business or a farm to someone other than a child, the full relief may be claimed when the market value at the time of disposal does not exceed a threshold of &euro;750,000 if the person is under 66 years of age. The threshold is &euro;500,000 if the person is 66 years of age and older. <\/p><p>These thresholds are lifetime limits and if they are exceeded the relief is withdrawn and CGT is payable on the gains on all disposals. Marginal relief may apply to gains that exceed the thresholds limiting CGT to half of the difference between the sale price or market value and the threshold. <\/p><p><b>Revised CGT Entrepreneur Relief<\/b><\/p><p>The revised CGT entrepreneur relief applies to an individual who disposes of qualifying assets, including shares in a qualifying company. Gains on such disposals are charged to CGT at the rate of 10%, subject to a lifetime limit of &euro;1m. <\/p><p>For the relief to apply, the assets must be used for the purposes of a qualifying business carried on by the individual or the individual must own a shareholding of at least 5% in a company carrying on a qualifying business. A qualifying business is a business other than the holding of securities or other assets as investments, the holding of development land or the development orletting of land. Business assets must have been owned by the individual for a continuous period of at least 3 years in the 5-year period immediately prior to the disposal. Where the individual disposes of shares in a qualifying company, they must have held the shares for a continuous period of 3 years at any time prior to the disposal. Agricultural assets used in a qualifying business may be considered qualifying assets for the purposes of revised entrepreneur relief. <\/p><p><b>Transfer of a site to a child<\/b><\/p><p>An exemption from CGT is available on the transfer of a site by a parent (or both parents simultaneously) to their child and the spouse or civil partner of that child to build a house which is the child&rsquo;s only or main residence. For the purposes of this exemption, a transfer includes a joint transfer by an individual, and their spouse or civil partner, to their child. The area of the site must not exceed 1 acre and the value of the site must not exceed &euro;500,000. <\/p><p>All taxes are subject to ongoing review, which involves the consideration and assessment of the rate and the relevant reliefs and exemptions.

The relief is granted at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%), where an individual pays qualifying fees for an approved course whether on his or her own behalf or on behalf of another individual.

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.<\/p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Also a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gov.ie partially complies with the double-A WCAG 2.1 standards and the 4 principles of accessibility in that it is perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. This is similar to most other government sites across the EU. One way in which accessibility is being improved is by improving the level of plain English used for services on the site to allow users of all levels to find and understand information as quickly as possible. The Gov.ie team have performed multiple accessibility reviews since the website has gone live and has engaged with an accessibility expert to outline all accessibility requirements. This is an ongoing process. Following the last accessibility audit, 65 issues were fixed and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer has since released updates to the core code of the site to improve accessibility. <\/p>  <p>  The following is the position in relation to bodies under the aegis of my Department that are within the scope of Directive 2016\/2102 (EU), as articulated in SI No. 358\/2020:<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s accessibility statements for its websites are currently under review and will be updated later this year. The accessibility statement for the Bank&rsquo;s main website will be published later this month and this will include information on the areas of focus to ensure compliance. Statements for the remaining websites will follow. The Central Bank&rsquo;s main website is partially compliant with the harmonised European Standard Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services (based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1). The accessibility standard for the Bank&rsquo;s other websites is under review and a roadmap for enhancement is expected later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has advised that its website accessibility statement will be published shortly. The Fiscal Council recognises the importance of ensuring that its website is accessible and ensures that its videos are subtitled, that images have alt text (a short written description of an image, which makes sense of that image when it can't be viewed) and that content on the website is machine readable so that it is compatible with immersive readers. It is committed to ensuring that its website continues to meet the basic four POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) in respect of accessibility and will draft future policies to ensure that this is achieved on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  While the current website of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) meets the majority of the Directive&rsquo;s requirements, the FSPO is developing a new website which will be based on the requirements of the Directive. The new website will include an Accessibility Statement, as outlined in S.I. No. 358\/2020, confirming the FSPO&rsquo;s compliance with the regulations under the Directive, as well as details of a mechanism through which users can provide feedback on the accessibility of the FSPO&rsquo;s website\/app.<\/p>  <p>  Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) has advised that it is in compliance with the Web Accessibility Directive in respect of HBFI.ie. An Accessibility Statement can be found on the &lsquo;Legal&rsquo; section of its website under &lsquo;Accessibility&rsquo; outlining the steps taken in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal is currently working with an IT consultant to ensure that all content on its website is in compliance with the Web Accessibility Directive and expects to publish its accessibility statement in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) has a statement of compliance which can be viewed under the &lsquo;Accessibility&rsquo; section of its website. While NAMA does not provide services to the public, it advises that it is committed to making the information on this website accessible to all in compliance with the Directive. <\/p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) is in compliance with the Web Accessibility Directive in respect of its primary website. A programme of works is currently being undertaken in respect of secondary NTMA websites and, following same, all secondary websites will be in compliance with the Directive. The NTMA has an accessibility statement in place that can be found under the &lsquo;Accessibility&rsquo; section on its website and a contact mechanism is available in the event that content is not accessible, in line with Article 7 of the Web Accessibility Directive. The Accessibility Statement will be updated shortly to take account of outstanding requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (OCAG) is in compliance with the accessibility requirements of S.I. No. 358 of 2020. The Office is currently preparing an Accessibility Statement which will be available on its website soon. OCAG has taken measures to make the website more accessible, and thereby perceivable, operable, understandable and robust, through the installation of accessibility software. It has also engaged a specialist company to conduct an accessibility scan and assessment review of the website, in order to optimise its accessibility. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners maintains an Accessibility Statement on its website. In order to comply with Directive 2016\/2102 (EU), its public-facing web-based systems and mobile app service are built to Level AA requirements based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Revenue has advised that it keeps all such services under review and addresses any accessibility issues identified as quickly as possible and ensures that new system enhancements and developments continue to meet the accessibility standards required.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has advised that it is in compliance with the Web Accessibility Directive and that an Accessibility Statement is available under the &lsquo;Disclaimer&rsquo; section on their website outlining the steps taken in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) is in the process of drafting an Accessibility Statement to meet its obligations and this will be published on its website soon. The TAC has currently adopted universal accessibility and the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) WCAG V2.0 Level AA in the design and development of its website. However, the Commission is currently redeveloping its website in the short and medium term and accessibility has been taken into account during the design process, as part of the providers&rsquo; commitments to the project.

In 2020, a general government deficit of over &euro;18 billion was recorded. This is the equivalent of nearly 9 per cent of modified gross national income, or GNI*, or 5 per cent of GDP. For this year, the Stability Programme Update projected a deficit of another &euro;18 billion. <\/p>  <p>  Against this background, Budget 2021 still allocated &euro;3.1 billion towards housing, the highest level of funding ever committed. Total expenditure in this area has more than doubled since 2016 and is 41 per cent above the previous peak level in 2008. The capital spending on housing for 2021 is 26 per cent higher than the previous year, and almost two and a half times what it was in 2017, demonstrating the massive commitments Government has already made in the area of housing.<\/p>  <p>  While public investment has an obvious role in alleviating housing market pressures, there are also significant non-fiscal constraints. In particular, the public health measures needed to suppress Covid-19 have placed a direct restriction on the construction of new housing. The industry is now facing increased costs and difficulty sourcing building materials as a result of the pandemic, high international demand, and Brexit. There are also skills shortages within the construction sector, which is why the Government is providing significant investment in skills and trades. As acknowledged in the report, simply increasing expenditure will not negate these capacity constraints.<\/p>  <p>  From a broader fiscal perspective, as we move beyond the extraordinary events of the pandemic, it is important to remember that it is neither sustainable nor prudent to run perpetual deficits. This fact is underlined by the European Commission&rsquo;s recent announcement that the General Escape Clause of the EU fiscal rules should not extend beyond 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Government is determined to fulfil its Programme for Government commitments to increase the social housing stock by 50,000 during its term of office. While capital expenditure allocations are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department and I are in regular contact with our counterparts in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the Cabinet Committee on Housing and various other forums. Significant capital investment has been provided to ensure more people have access to quality, affordable housing. The Government will also publish its upcoming Housing for All Strategy later this summer, which will build on our commitments in the Programme for Government. However, we must also be cognisant of other, non-financial constraints on housing development and the need to ensure public investment is made in a sustainable manner.      <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500075#WRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":840,"content":"<p>Question No. 361 answered with Question No. 360.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":841,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500075#WRR02700"},{"type":"question","counter":842,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[31383\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500075#WRR02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the interest penalty for tax warehousing for self-employed persons will be deferred until 2022.","asker":"1467","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":843,"content":"<p>Finance Act 2020 legislated for warehousing of certain liabilities of self-assessed income taxpayers, including the self-employed, whose income has been affected by the restrictions introduced to combat Covid-19.

However taxation in other jurisdictions, in particular in the United States (US) following extensive tax reforms introduced there in 2017, is likely to have applied.<\/p>  <p>  The so-called &ldquo;Double Irish&rdquo; exploited the different definitions of corporate tax residency in Ireland and the United States (US) while taking advantage of certain provisions of US tax law that allowed for a deferral of US taxation. It involved the use of an Irish incorporated company which was not Irish tax resident under Irish corporate tax residence rules and hence not within the charge to Irish corporation tax. In this context, it should be noted that Irish corporate tax residence rules were similar to those in the OECD&rsquo;s Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital. <\/p>  <p>  In the absence of US reforms to address this issue, Ireland changed our corporate tax residence rules in Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 and Finance Act 2014. Thereafter, the US introduced the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. It is my understanding that one of the anti-avoidance measures in that Act imposes a minimum tax rate on US multinational companies. The measure is referred to as &ldquo;GILTI&rdquo;, short for &ldquo;global intangible low-taxed income&rdquo;. It ensures that US multinationals pay tax on the income earned by US companies outside the US from intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The actions taken by the Irish and US governments have therefore eliminated or significantly reduced the tax benefits to multinationals of using this type of deferral structure. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to highlight that reform of the international tax rules has been an ongoing process since 2013. Ireland has very much played its part in reframing these rules for the benefit of business and citizens, and we have proactively and diligently reformed our tax code in line with the new international norms. In this context, a lot has been achieved through the OECD&rsquo;s BEPS process to address aggressive tax planning. We now have far more robust international tax rules and safeguards than existed a decade ago to prevent abuse, arbitrage, base erosion and profit shifting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500075#WRR04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":858,"qnumday":371,"qnumall":"[31576\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500075#WRR04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the Revenue Commissioners view cohabiting couples as two individual single persons even those who have children together given that for the purpose of payments to families, the Department of Social Protection recognise cohabiting couples as a family unit (details supplied).","asker":"1628","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":859,"content":"<p>In situations where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual. Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  <\/p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income. <\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce, in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the difference in tax treatment for married couples is not confined to Income Tax, and is also a feature of other tax heads, such as Capital Acquisitions Tax. Therefore, any changes in the tax treatment could only be considered in the broader context of the tax system and future social and legal policy development more generally, given that the legal status of married couples has wider consequences than from a tax perspective. <\/p>  <p>  The arrangements and associated legislation for the purposes of payments or allowances under the remit of the Department of Social Protection in relation to married couples, civil partners and cohabiting couples are a matter for the Minister for Social Protection and her Department. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500075#WRR04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":860,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500075#WRR04500"},{"type":"question","counter":861,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[31612\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500075#WRR04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the finding from a recent report (details supplied) which states that restricting some of the less well targeted, tax expenditure reliefs and exemptions that apply to taxes such as CGT and CAT could not only contribute to raising significant sums of tax revenue but could also result in a simpler, more efficient tax system; his plans to examine such reliefs in order to put Exchequer funding on a sustainable footing, especially in view of the proposed international changes on corporation taxation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":862,"content":"<p>I welcome the ESRI report entitled &ldquo;Options for raising tax revenue in Ireland,&rdquo; and note their own wording in the report that they &ldquo;do not seek to advocate any particular tax-raising measure,&rdquo; but instead seek &ldquo;to provide evidence for policymakers who are in a position to make these decisions.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  This is the basis on which I and my officials consider such findings, and as such any changes to tax policy are also considered within a wider framework of the fiscal space, impacts on income distribution and other concerns. <\/p>  <p>  With regards to the specifics of Ireland&rsquo;s Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT), I would note that the recent OECD paper entitled &ldquo;Inheritance Taxation in OECD Countries,&rdquo; acknowledged our CAT regime as  the only gift or inheritance tax applied over lifetime transfers, rather than a given time period, in the OECD.  The analysis highlights the advantages of the Irish system, in particular with regard to horizontal equity, by ensuring that those who receive the same amount of wealth pay the same amount of tax.  In this context, it is also important to consider that Ireland&rsquo;s CAT is much less generous with exemption thresholds than many other OECD countries, as CAT exemptions apply on a lifetime basis. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and more specifically the reference in the report to the Revised Entrepreneur Relief, I would refer to the external review by Indecon Consultants published as part of the Budget 2020 documentation.

This definition includes tax expenditures such as tax rebates, tax repayments and reduced tax rates, as well as direct subsidies.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) Fossil Fuel Subsidies 2019 publication estimates total fossil fuel subsidies amounted to &euro;2.4 billion in 2019.   Direct fossil fuel subsidies accounted for 11% of total fossil fuel subsidies in 2019 while indirect subsidies arising from revenue foregone due to tax abatements accounted for 89%.  The CSO estimates that the largest of these reliefs was the exemption from excise and carbon taxes of jet kerosene used for commercial flights, costing &euro;634 million per year, while the lower rate of fuel duty applied to auto-diesel relative to petrol is estimated to amount to &euro;400 million per year.  The ESRI May 2021 Budget Perspectives Paper referenced by the Deputy refers to the possible removal of these reliefs and the potential additional revenue raised.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the exemption on aviation fuel for commercial flights,  the Deputy will be aware that Ireland&rsquo;s excise duty treatment of fuel used for air navigation is based on European law as set out in Directive 2003\/96\/EC on the taxation of energy products and electricity, commonly known as the Energy Tax Directive. Under this Directive, Member States are obliged to exempt certain fuels used for commercial aviation purposes from excise duty. The scope of this exemption must include jet fuel (which is the most commonly used heavy oil in air navigation) and must encompass such fuel used for intra-Community and international air transport purposes.  The Commission is working on a proposal to revise the ETD and it is expected that changes to the current fossil fuel related reliefs and exemptions will be proposed.   <\/p>  <p>  On a national level, it is recognised that gradual removal of fossil fuel subsidies will play an important role in phasing out reliance on fossil fuels in the transition to a low carbon economy.

While some flexibility is needed in the rules to respond to economic circumstances that are genuinely beyond the control of Member States, as evidenced by the application of the General Escape Clause in response to the pandemic, it is equally important to ensure that the rules are enforced consistently. The current rules&rsquo; reliance on unobservable variables such as the output gap, which directly affects the structural balance, also impacts the reliability and communicability of the framework. My Department has previously highlighted this on several occasions. <\/p>  <p>In relation to the Commission&rsquo;s public consultation it is important to note the Commission&rsquo;s intention, as set out in the Communication of March 3rd on the fiscal policy response to the pandemic, to relaunch the public debate on the economic governance framework once economic recovery takes hold. I fully support this position and welcome the planned resumption of the public consultation once economic conditions allow. My officials and I will continue to actively engage in discussions in this area at the European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":887,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS00800"},{"type":"question","counter":888,"qnumday":382,"qnumall":"[30175\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the engagement he has had with both the construction industry and underwriters regarding professional indemnity insurance for construction professions and construction-related professions with particular reference to fire safety concerns and the withdrawal of underwriters from the market; the action he as Chair of the Sub-Group on Insurance Reform or that sub-group itself has taken to address this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":889,"content":"<p>The Government recognises that the Professional Indemnity (PI) insurance market has been hardening in recent years, in Ireland the UK and internationally.

However, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) reports that research from both the United States and Europe suggests that foreign direct investment (FDI) and the decisions of multinationals to locate in Ireland are highly sensitive to rates of corporation tax. Therefore, increasing the corporation tax rate would likely lead to lower levels of economic activity, behavioural changes in the locational decisions of multinational companies and employment in the multinational sector. As a result of the difficulty of predicting and quantifying these impacts, particularly in the current economic climate, it is not possible to accurately or robustly estimate the potential yield from the increases proposed by the Deputy. I would note however that ESRI research in 2011 estimated that <i>reducing<\/i>Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax rate from 40% in 1994 to 12.5% in 2003 added almost 4% to the level of economic output in 2005 and around &euro;2 billion in corporation tax revenues.  <\/p><p>Furthermore, while corporation tax is statutorily levied on the profits of businesses, the ESRI states that researchers have concluded that a large share of the burden is likely to be borne by workers in the form of lower wages.

As the ESRI found that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) predominantly finance their investments in fixed assets, intangible assets and staff through internal funds, raising the rate of corporation tax would hamper their ability to invest and grow. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":895,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS01400"},{"type":"question","counter":896,"qnumday":386,"qnumall":"[31839\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent of the restrictions on credit unions regarding the amount a customer can have on deposit; the purpose of the restrictions; and if this will be permanent.","asker":"1491","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":897,"content":"<p>Credit unions in Ireland are regulated and supervised under the Credit Union Act, 1997 (the 1997 Act) and regulations issued by the Central Bank, which set out the framework for the registration, regulation and operation of credit unions including detailed governance requirements and prudential requirements on items such as reserves, liquidity, investments, member savings and lending.<\/p><p><i>Limits on credit union savings<\/i><\/p><p>The Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 (the 2016 Regulations) set an individual savings limit of &euro;100,000 that applies on a per member basis.

The very low vacancy rates in the areas of greatest demand for housing, particularly in terms of medium term vacancy, indicated that the potential for a vacant property tax to increase housing supply was very limited and could represent a distraction from the need to significantly accelerate the building of new social housing, affordable housing and the facilitation of private sector supply.

Core inflation also increased sharply, up 1.2 per cent on an annual basis.  The increase in the headline rate of inflation in May was driven largely by energy inflation, which grew by almost 12 &frac12; per cent on an annual basis due to base effects from the collapse in oil prices last spring. <\/p>  <p>  The uptick in inflation since the beginning of this year is broadly in line with international price developments. In May, headline HICP in the euro area increased by 2 per cent on an annual basis, while core inflation increased by 0.9 per cent. More generally, in the US and other advanced economies, consumer prices have risen recently partly due to temporary factors including; oil prices, increased global shipping costs and semi-conductor prices.

Strong economic growth had been recorded for a number of years, the labour market was close to full employment, and surpluses had been recorded on the current account and the government budget balance.  <\/p>  <p>  The outbreak of the Covid-19 crisis turned the economy on its head and resulted in a sharp contraction of domestic economic activity last year and into the first quarter this year. My Department projected modified domestic demand growth of 2&frac12; per cent for this year and 7&frac12; per cent for 2022 in the April Stability Programme Update. It is anticipated that as the reopening progresses, the release of pent-up demand financed by the unwinding of historically high household savings will support the recovery. <\/p>  <p>  While the domestic sector suffered a hit last year, the multinational sector has proven resilient, demonstrating the competitiveness of Irish exports in international markets. The outlook for Irish exports in light of strengthening global demand is very positive and Ireland&rsquo;s modified current account, which strips out the effects of globalisation, is projected to remain in surplus in the medium term. This reflects Ireland&rsquo;s continuing competitiveness on the international stage, for both indigenous and multinational exports. Looking to the future, our talented and flexible workforce, our track record as a successful place to do business, and our pro-enterprise environment mean that our economy&rsquo;s long-term fundamentals remain strong.<\/p>  <p>  As the global economy has experienced the shock of the Covid-19 crisis in a reasonably symmetric way, Ireland&rsquo;s economic fundamentals remain healthy and relatively strong in an international context. Unavoidable consequences of the pandemic and the associated necessary policy supports put in place, such as the increases in unemployment and public debt, have been shared international experiences. These imbalances are expected to moderate as the economic recovery takes hold. <\/p>  <p>  The strength and resilience of the Irish economy lies in its openness to international trade and investment. Nonetheless as a small open economy, Ireland is more exposed to external risks, including the international path of the virus, the extent of permanent damage to the global economy, and potential changes to the international tax environment. External risks continue to be monitored closely by my Department. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":928,"content":"<p>Question No. 398 answered with Question No. 78<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Interest Rates","counter":929,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS04400"},{"type":"question","counter":930,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[32081\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which Eurozone countries are likely to be affected by indications to increase interest rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":931,"content":"<p>There has been an extraordinary level of monetary support over the course of the pandemic. This support has included low interest rates, extensive asset purchases, and various refinancing operations, all of which have led to favourable financing conditions.

It has also lowered the burden of debt for eurozone countries, facilitating the substantial fiscal support governments have provided to cushion the impact of the pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  As the economy recovers and economic conditions begin to normalise, the exceptional monetary policy supports in place will need to be gradually withdrawn. However, a sudden and premature tightening of monetary policy could have adverse effects, threatening financial stability, increasing debt service costs and leading to a weaker-than-anticipated recovery. This possibility was one of the key downside risks set out in the Stability Programme Update published by my Department in April. <\/p>  <p>  However, the ECB&rsquo;s position is that the highly accommodative monetary policy continues to be necessary to support the burgeoning economic recovery.

Where mortgage borrowers are in financial distress, lenders must follow the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) which aims to help borrowers address their financial payment difficulties with their lender quickly and effectively and get borrowers back on track with their mortgage obligations. The CCMA indicates that all such arrears or pre-arrears cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his\/her mortgage obligations. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to business customers and SME&rsquo;s that are in financial distress, lenders must follow the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Small and Medium Enterprise Regulations.

The Central Bank has advised that it has engaged with lenders to ensure they have strategies and plans for supporting viable SME borrowers that are experiencing short-term financial difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also emphasised the importance of borrowers engaging proactively with their lender noting that if a borrower is struggling to repay their debts due to COVID-19 or any other reason, the borrower should talk to their lender as soon as possible to find a sustainable solution and to retain access to protections some of which only apply if the borrower engages with their lender.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":947,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS06000"},{"type":"question","counter":948,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[32089\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS06100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when Irish home borrowers can borrow at similar interest rates to that available throughout Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":949,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[32090\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS06200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied that the single market rules apply in relation to interest rates charged throughout the European Union and their applicability to all countries including Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":950,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 407 and 408 together.<\/p>  <p>There have been certain developments to promote the closer integration of banking and credit markets in the EU.  For example, credit institutions authorised in one EU Member State can, with minimal additional requirements, provide banking services in other EU states.  In addition, there have been developments, such as the Mortgage Credit Directive and the Consumer Credit Directive, which seek to promote a more harmonised market for the provision of credit to consumers across the EU.  However, this does not mean there will be a single price for any particular type of credit across the EU.  There are many factors, such as differences in national legal and housing systems, cultural preferences, language, the proximity of lenders to borrowers, which will continue to inhibit the full integration of the market for mortgage and other consumer credit in the EU. More directly, differences in the nature of mortgage and other credit markets, credit and market conditions, mortgage default rates and the funding of mortgage and other credit will also impact on the levels of interest lending rates between and within different EU countries.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the general level of lending interest rates in Ireland are higher than is the case in many other European countries, though it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland.  For example, the interest rates on new mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.8% at end-April 2021.<\/p>  <p>  However, as I have indicated on a number of occasions, Irish mortgage and other loans can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are also generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: <\/p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;<\/p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks;<\/p>  <p>  - different cost-to-income ratios among banks;<\/p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions (however, it is noted that a new entrant has recently entered the residential mortgage market and that it is offering fixed rate mortgages at competitive interest rates). <\/p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to mortgages, the Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing\/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.  Indeed the Central Bank advises that a recent study by it estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remain term. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater price and other competition in the mortgage market, both for new and existing borrowers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500076#WRS06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":951,"content":"<p>Question No. 408 answered with Question No. 407.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":953,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":954,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[32091\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which his Department continues to monitor changes to the availability of credit throughout Europe; the extent to which Irish banks continue to lend to the various sectors of the economy which now requires a particular level of growth in order to offset any negative influences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":955,"content":"<p>The Government recognises that SMEs are vital to the Irish economy.

Given the phased basis of the new import controls which are being applied by the UK, it will take time for these to feed through to overall exporting activity, and to assess any associated economic impact. <\/p>  <p>  In the face of Brexit, the Government has been taking steps to build up the resilience of the economy by developing and expanding our economic and trade relationships, both with our EU partners and with other overseas markets. The Mission Network abroad, in partnership with the State Agencies, are playing an important role in terms of public and economic diplomacy.<\/p>  <p>  This trade shock and associated economic impact will be mitigated somewhat by a positive Foreign Direct Investment shock resulting from a redirection to Ireland of investment from firms looking to relocate within the single market. The nature, scale and complexity of Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector will change in a number of ways, and the sector is becoming broader and more diverse with more firms carrying out a greater range of regulated activities than at any time. The full impact of Brexit for Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector may not materialise for some years. <\/p>  <p>  The Government and various state agencies continue to implement &lsquo;Ireland for Finance&rsquo;, the strategy for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector to 2025&rsquo;, and are working to fully capture any opportunities for inward investment that emerge through promoting Ireland&rsquo;s strengths as a leading financial services centre.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the broader financial services sector, my Department has been working closely with the Central Bank of Ireland and the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), through the Financial Stability Group, and through the Brexit Contact Group, to limit the impact of key identified risks in the Irish financial system. This work and engagement has sought to ensure that the sector is adequately prepared, and that financial services firms and market participants have contingency plans in place to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers, investors and markets as possible. On the basis of its work and engagement across the sector, the Central Bank has been able to assure me that the financial services sector is well prepared and resilient enough to manage the changes associated with Brexit.  My Department, the Central Bank of Ireland and the NTMA will continue to monitor developments and activities in the financial sector in accordance with their respective responsibilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":959,"content":"<p>Question No. 411 answered with Question No. 397.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises","counter":960,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT00900"},{"type":"question","counter":961,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[32094\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to which the reopening of the economy is in line with previous expectations with particular reference to the maximisation of opportunities through small and medium-sized enterprises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":962,"content":"<p>While the reintroduction of restrictions at the end of last year led to a further contraction of the domestic economy in the first quarter of 2021, the decline in activity was not as severe as that seen during the first lockdown last spring. Modified Domestic Demand, which provides the best measure of domestic economic activity, fell by 5 per cent on an annual basis in the first quarter of 2021. This compares with a fall of 15&frac12; per cent in Q2 last year, with both of these &lsquo;covid quarters&rsquo; compared to non-covid quarters. Within this, consumer spending fell by 12 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, which compares to a fall of over 21 per cent during the first lockdown in the second quarter of 2020. Given that the level of stringency in the first quarter of 2021 was in line with that of the first lockdown last year and among the most stringent across advanced economies, these figures point to a weakening in the relationship between stringency and economic activity, and likely reflect adaptation by firms, particularly by small and medium-sized enterprises (SME).<\/p>  <p>  In addition to our economy becoming more resilient, the vaccination programme is also having a positive effect. The number of Covid-19 infections have fallen by more than 90 per cent from the peak in January and the incidence among all age groups has declined. As a result of this progress, the Government began easing restrictions in April with a further relaxation of restrictions in May for sectors incorporating small and medium-sized enterprises in non-essential retail and personal services like hairdressers. <\/p>  <p>  In-line with this easing of restrictions the economy started to recover in the second quarter. Various indicators confirm this recovery including a range of business and consumer confidence indicators, daily card payment data, as well as May&rsquo;s tax receipts. Encouragingly an improvement in the labour market can also be seen from the PUP figures which have fallen from a high of 481,000 in February to 285,000 as of June 7th with further falls expected in the coming weeks. Alongside this recovery, many SME dominated sectors experienced significant declines in PUP numbers. Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail Trade &amp;amp; Repair of Vehicles has fallen by 46 per cent from its peak in February, while over the same period, Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Services are down 24 per cent and Arts, Entertainment &amp;amp; Recreation is down by 26 per cent.<\/p>  <p>  These developments are broadly in-line with my Department&rsquo;s macroeconomic forecasts in the Stability Programme Update, published in April. These forecasts assumed that the vaccine roll-out would ramp-up over the second quarter and accelerate thereafter. Wider vaccine coverage is still expected to allow for a further gradual relaxation of containment measures and a modest pick-up in economic activity, with the recovery gaining momentum from the summer onwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":963,"content":"<p>Question No. 413 answered with Question No. 396.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services Sector","counter":964,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT01300"},{"type":"question","counter":965,"qnumday":414,"qnumall":"[32096\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the degree to which his Department continues to monitor activities in the manufacturing and services sectors and thereby identifying potential strength and weakness and any remedial action as required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":966,"content":"<p>The reintroduction of Covid-19 related restrictions at the end of last year had a significant impact on the domestic economy in the first quarter. While much of the manufacturing sector remained open throughout the quarter, many domestic services activities were largely closed. As a result, the impact of these restrictions across sectors has been uneven. Gross Value Added (GVA) in manufacturing grew by around 13 per cent on a quarterly basis in the first quarter of 2021. In contrast, GVA in contact-intensive service sectors (which includes Distribution, Transport, Hotels and Restaurants and Arts, Entertainment and Other Services) declined by 9 per cent on a quarterly basis, with activity around 27 per cent below the pre-pandemic (Quarter 4-2019) level. <\/p>  <p>  The manufacturing sector has continued to perform strongly in recent months. Overall industrial Production in April remained above pre-pandemic levels. Crucially, production in the mainly indigenous &ldquo;traditional sector&rdquo;, which has a higher domestic value-added and is more labour-intensive than the modern sector of the economy, was also above its pre-pandemic level. Furthermore, the manufacturing PMI rose to the highest level on record in May as demand picked up following the re-opening of the economy, pointing to a further increase in manufacturing over the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Covid-19 pandemic continues to weigh on services activity. The CSO&rsquo;s Monthly Services Index fell by 0.5 per cent on a monthly basis in April, with overall activity around 3&frac12; per cent below the pre-pandemic (January 2020) level. Indeed, with the exception of ICT, the level of activity remained below the January 2020 level in all sectors in April. <\/p>  <p>However, the vaccination programme is now having a positive effect and the number of Covid-19 case numbers have fallen by more than 90 per cent from the peak in January and the incidence among all age groups has declined. As a result, the Government began easing restrictions in early April. This relaxation has recently gained pace allowing the economy to start to recover in the second quarter. In line with this, soft data point to a recovery of services activity with the services PMI reaching its highest level in over five years in May as pent-up demand was released following the initial easing of restrictions. A range of other indicators also confirm that an economic recovery is underway, including business and consumer confidence indicators, daily card payment data, as well as May&rsquo;s tax receipts. Furthermore, the National Economic Recovery Plan published on 1st June sets out how the Government will support the full resumption of economic activity, get people back to work and support those sectors which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":968,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT01700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inflation Rate","counter":967,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT01600"},{"type":"question","counter":968,"qnumday":415,"qnumall":"[32078\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the degree to which inflation has affected the construction sector; the actions needed in response to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":969,"content":"<p>The Construction Sector Group (CSG), established in 2018 and chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, ensures regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector. Its remit includes, but is not limited to, considering opportunities to introduce reforms within the sector that will help in controlling construction price inflation. <\/p>  <p>  To support the work of the CSG, an annual \"Build\" Report was produced by my Department in 2019 and 2020. The purpose of this report is to give a comprehensive overview of the performance and prospects of the Irish construction sector, based on the available official statistics and data. The report aids in monitoring of trends across the sector, ranging from output and investment to employment and cost inflation, so that risks and performance issues can be identified and addressed where necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Inflation measures how much more expensive a set of goods and services becomes over a certain period of time. A number of measures relating to inflation in the Irish construction sector are detailed in the Build Report. The data included in the report is mostly obtained from the Central Statistics Office. <\/p>  <p>  Two major costs for the construction industry are the cost of materials and the cost of wages. <\/p>  <p>  Inflation in the cost of construction materials can be measured through the Wholesale Price Index. As for the wage inflation, this has been measured by monitoring average hourly earnings for the construction sector. <\/p>  <p>  The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for Building and Construction Materials provides a general indication of price trends in the sector. WPI essentially measures the changes in the prices of goods sold and traded in bulk. In April 2021 the WPI for Building and Construction Materials stood at 3.4% on an annual basis. However within this there are certain materials which have seen elevated levels of inflation such as timber and steel.<\/p>  <p>  Average Hourly earnings for the construction sector (includes all employees of construction) increased by 9% between Q1 2020 and Q2 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland Tender Price index reveals that national construction tender prices increased by 1.3% in the second half of 2020, up from 0.9% in the previous 6 months. The results indicate a slight rebound of tender price growth in the construction sector, with national annual inflation now at 2.2% (Jan 2020 to Dec 2020), however it is still significantly less than tender price inflation levels pre-Covid. The Index is the only independent assessment of construction tender prices in Ireland. It is compiled by the Quantity Surveying members of the Society. The Tender Price Index (TPI) is based largely on sentiment returns with actual tender returns included in the calculations. The TPI is for non-residential projects during the period in question. It is based on predominately new build projects with values in excess of &euro; 0.5m and covers all regions of Ireland. The Index relates to average price increases across differing project types and locations.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, while there was elevated construction sector inflation in 2019, construction price inflation has slowed overall in 2020 as a result of Covid-19. Elevated levels of inflation possesses risk for the construction sector and wider economy as a whole by undermining value for money. <\/p>  <p>  There are two primary channels through which inflation in the construction sector can be addressed; by reducing demand through lower levels of investment or by supporting the increase of supply.<\/p>  <p>  Industry is being supported by the Government to expand its capacity with three broad policies: communicating for industry confidence, securing the skills pipeline, and driving innovation. Specific actions include a new apprenticeship action plan, the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, the funding and establishment of the Build Digital Project to drive digital adoption across the built environment sector and work by Enterprise Ireland to assess the potential for a Construction Technology Centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Service","counter":970,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT01900"},{"type":"question","counter":971,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[30494\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500077#WRT02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties that many employees in the Civil Service are having with their employers regarding flexitime while remote working; the measures he plans implementing to address this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The first step in meeting this commitment was in Budget 2021 through the allocation of &euro;20m in anticipated additional carbon tax receipts for the creation of pilot environmental programmes.

It has, however, drawn the attention of the Commission to information that is currently commercially sensitive and should therefore only be shared on a confidential basis.<\/p>  <p>  I will be publishing further details of the Plan once the process of approval by the European Union has concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500078#WRU02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":1041,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500078#WRU02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1042,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[31129\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500078#WRU03000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of the final report as part of the Phoenix Park transport and mobility options study; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":1043,"content":"<p>I wish to confirm that the Phoenix Park Transport and Mobility Options Working Group comprising of officials from the OPW, NTA, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council are in the final stages of analysing submissions, with a view to presenting the post consultation report to Minister O'Donovan for final review later this month.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW and partner agencies were delighted with the level of engagement and the huge volume of submissions received during the public consultation.

There was a high level of interest in this scheme, with over 400 applications received by the closing date of 14 April.  The assessment of applications has now finished and applicants have been notified of the outcome of their applications. LPSS 2021 builds on the successful pilot Live Performance Support Scheme in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences. The 2021 scheme is aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. <\/p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;14m is been made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  <\/p>  <p>  This scheme sees support offered by way of three levels of once-off flat payments;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;50,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;3,000 incurred from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;4,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;50,001- &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;6,000 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 for businesses with VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;7,500 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021<\/p>  <p>  Under the scheme, businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers - whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities - operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector will be eligible to apply.  This scheme is now receiving application following wide consultation with the sector and applications are being received and processed. Further details in relation to this scheme, including guidelines and the application portal can be found on my department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie\/en\/service\/3cc71-music-and-entertainment-business-assistance-scheme\/.<\/p>  <p>  All local authorities have received allocations under the Local Live Performance Programming Scheme sharing an allocation of &euro;5 million for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by all local authorities of performances by local performers.  Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events. <\/p>  <p>  Up to &euro;1 million was allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming and it supported over 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff. With gatherings still restricted, SPF 2021 curated a rich and dynamic programme of events involving hundreds of artists, musicians, performers, creators, and community organisations which was broadcast on the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival TV online channel marking the national day.<\/p>  <p>  Funding allocations for the above schemes will be spent before the end of this year and it is not planned to carry any funding into 2022.

There are opportunities for creativity to be expressed not only through the visual and performing arts but <i>inter alia<\/i>through culture, built and natural heritage, writing and learning languages, through mathematics, sciences and digital technology, and in designing, making and entrepreneurial activities.<\/p><p>In striving to mainstream creativity across public policy therefore, substantial strategic engagement is required on an ongoing basis between the officials in my department delivering the Creative Ireland Programme and their counterparts across relevant government departments.

A foundational part of this framework will be the systems focused regulation of Video Sharing Platform Services required by the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive.<\/p>  <p>  The goal of the regulatory framework for online safety will be to tackle the availability of defined categories of harmful online content through systemic oversight over how regulated online services deliver and moderate the user-generated content on their platforms. This is a risk based approach that is intended to drive towards the best possible outcomes for all users of online services.<\/p>  <p>  While there is an appreciation of the desire for an individual complaints mechanism, there are serious doubts about the effectiveness of a statutory mechanism of this kind in the online safety space. There are a number of reasons for this, including that:<\/p>  <p>- requirements for fair procedures would not facilitate a swift resolution of individual issues, as it would be necessary to engage with the uploader of content as well as the complainant;<\/p>  <p>- the volume of online content, particularly as Ireland will be regulating Video Sharing Platform Services for the whole of the EU population of 450 million people, would overwhelm even the best resourced regulator and divert resources away from regulatory oversight;<\/p>  <p>- referring complaints relating to individual items of content that are potentially criminal in nature to a civil regulator instead of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would not be appropriate; and<\/p>  <p>- it would incentivise regulated online services to refer matters to the regulator rather than to take responsibility for resolving the matter themselves.<\/p>  <p>  In light of this, the Bill provides the Commission with the power to oblige designated online services to have easy to use and effective complaints and appeals mechanisms in place and also the power to audit those mechanisms. This is part of the risk-based framework that will enable the Commission to seek the greatest degree of protection for all users through systemic oversight.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals will always be able to bring issues to the attention of the Commission and this will feed into the Commission's risk assessment and determination of audits and investigations. The Commission will also have the power to order the removal of individual items of content in certain discrete instances. However, this will not amount to a formal individual complaints mechanism. The Commission will also have a duty to promote independent mediation mechanisms and other methods of resolving disputes.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission will also be empowered to set up a systemic complaints scheme to receive complaints from nominated bodies such as expert NGOs about trends in the prevalence of harmful online content and the effectiveness of measures taken by regulated online services to comply with their obligations. This will help to inform the Commission about what the prominent and emerging risks are at any point in time and inform the Commission's approach to making online safety codes, conducting audits of complaints handling and investigating suspected failures of compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500082#WRY05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1311,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500083#WRZ00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1312,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[31738\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500083#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the supports her Department has made available for persons working in the live entertainment sector who despite not being allowed fully return to work will see their pandemic unemployment payment cut which will create additional hardship for those who have already through no fault of their own not being able to work for over a year; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1613","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":1313,"content":"<p>A part of the &euro;50 million suite of measures to assist the live performance sector, &euro;25m has been allocated to Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS 2021) which has now closed for applications.

An Expert Panel was established in 2016 to investigate the matter. It was chaired by Mr Denis McCarthy (former Chief Executive of Waterford Co Co) and it included representatives nominated by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland, and the Institute of Geologists of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Their Report (available on the Departments webiste) was published on 13 June 2017. It concluded, inter alia, that the disintegration of the concrete blocks used in the construction of the affected dwellings in Donegal and Mayo was primarily due to excessive amounts of deleterious materials in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks. The deleterious material in Donegal was primarily muscovite mica and in Mayo it was primarily reactive pyrite. <\/p>  <p>  The panel estimated that the scale of the problem in Donegal as being between 1,200 to 4,800 private dwellings and 541 to 1,000 social housing dwellings. In the case of Mayo, the panel estimates that the minimum potential number of private dwellings likely to be affected is approximately 345 and a total of 17 social housing units across 3 estates are known to be affected.  <\/p>  <p>  Rigorous analysis therefore has already been carried out in relation to the construction of dwellings which are affected by the use of defective concrete blocks, with chapter three of the report specifically relating to building regulations and oversight. <\/p>  <p>  The resulting Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme was informed by the work of the Expert Panel and the current maximum grant amounts payable under the scheme were finalised in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This process also took account of the comprehensive engagement that took place between my Department and both Donegal and Mayo County Councils, who operate and administer the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The grant limits agreed on foot of this engagement ensures that the scheme can be budgeted for with the potential financial liability known at all times and also to ensure that the available budget can benefit the majority of properties and the maximum number of people.  <\/p>  <p>  In the first instance homeowners apply to the local authority seeking confirmation of eligibility for the scheme. As part of this application process, an approved engineers report in accordance with I.S. 465:2018 is required. The report confirms the existence or otherwise of excessive amounts of pyrite or mica in the blockwork which have given rise to defective concrete blocks and is based on a visual inspection, core sampling and laboratory testing which is carried out by the engineer employed by the homeowner. The cost of the report can vary from home to home but the scheme allows for recoupment of 90% of the cost to eligible applicants, subject to a maximum recoupment of &euro;6,300. I understand that feedback from homeowners who have been through the stage 1 process is that the costs allowable for stage 1 are in line with the costs being incurred. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides funding of &euro;20 million to fund the operation of the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme for the counties of Donegal and Mayo. At this stage 433 stage one applications have been submitted and nearly 54% have been approved. <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are independent legal entities whose purchasing activities are governed by public procurment rules.

The HAP rent limits were increased significantly, in the order of 60% in some cases. <\/p>  <p>  Maximum rent limits for the HAP scheme are set out for each housing authority area by the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2017.  The current maximum HAP rent limits are available on the Irish Statute Book website at the following link:<\/p>  <p>www.irishstatutebook.ie\/eli\/2017\/si\/56\/made\/en\/print?q=housing&amp;years=2017  . <\/p>  <p>  Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. It should be noted that it is a matter for the local authority to determine whether the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.  <\/p>  <p>  In considering this issue, I am conscious that increasing the current HAP rent limits could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.<\/p>  <p>  In order to qualify for HAP, a household must first be assessed as eligible for social housing support. Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended. <\/p>  <p>  If a household meets the eligibility and need criteria, it qualifies for the suite of social housing supports, including HAP, and is placed on the housing list to be considered for the allocation of suitable tenancies in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. However, with the exception of the specific payments listed in the Household Means Policy as being disregarded, all income from social insurance and social assistance payments, allowances and benefits, including Working Family Payment is assessable.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500084#WRAA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":1376,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500084#WRAA01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1377,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[30620\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500084#WRAA01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the inspections of houses that are in a contractual agreement with a local authority have been resumed such as in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1378,"content":"<p>The minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019.

The guidance is also a useful reference for service providers working in the sector, highlighting where they can be of greatest assistance to their clients, covering a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence currently in receipt of social housing support and those seeking social housing supports. These include provisions whereby a household may transfer out of their existing tenancy and into a new tenancy agreement with the local authority or they may access an independent tenancy in the private rented sector utilising the various housing supports offered by the State.<\/p>  <p>  Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for social housing support a household must meet all of the eligibility criteria, which primarily relate to income, availability of alternative accommodation and previous rent arrears. <\/p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.  The Policy sets out what income should be assessed as part of net income, what deductions can be made and what income is not assessable for the purpose of a social housing assessment. The Policy also provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  Where a household is deemed to meet the eligibility criteria, only then is its housing need assessed under the criteria in Regulation 23 of the 2011 Regulations, having regard to its current accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  If a household meets the eligibility and need criteria, it qualifies for the suite of social housing supports, including HAP, and is placed on the housing list to be considered for the allocation of suitable tenancies in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and Regulation 22(1) of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, a household is ineligible for social housing support if a member owns alternative accommodation, to the household&rsquo;s current accommodation, that is suitable for the household to live in.  Regulation 22(2) of the 2011 Regulations provides that this ineligibility does not apply where an applicant for social housing support owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced. Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases. The rationale for this exception is that the terms of a formal separation or divorce will provide for the future ownership and occupation of the family home and it will be clear whether the household that has left the family home can return to live there. <\/p>  <p>  In order to provide more flexibility to housing authorities to deal with cases where the ownership of the family home had not yet been finalised, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 amended section 20 of the 2009 Act. Housing authorities may now provide such households with social housing support under the Rental Accommodation Scheme or the Housing Assistance Payment scheme until ownership of the family home is resolved in a formal separation or divorce settlement. <\/p>  <p>  The 2014 Act amendment provides that support in these circumstances will be reviewed by the housing authority at prescribed intervals and the household will not be able to transfer to other forms of social housing support while ownership of the family home remains to be determined. However, where the household ultimately qualifies for the full range of social housing supports, the length of time the household was supported under RAS or HAP will be reckonable for the purposes of determining the household&rsquo;s relative priority for a transfer to local authority social housing. <\/p>  <p>  Decisions on the qualification of specific persons for social housing support and the allocation of that support are a matter solely for the local authority concerned. Each application must be considered on its own merits and the individual circumstances taken into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500084#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":1382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500084#WRAA02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1383,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[30631\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500084#WRAA02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will consider placing a conservation order on the former home of Thomas Clarke at 31 Richmond Avenue, Dublin given that it is a building of national importance.","asker":"1551","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1384,"content":"<p>I am aware of concerns in relation to the matter raised, however, I understand it is currently the subject of legal proceedings and I am therefore precluded from further comment on it.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the safeguarding of protected structures, Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 gives primary responsibility to local authorities to identify and protect architectural heritage by including particular structures on their respective Records of Protected Structures (RPS).

Where a construction product covered by a harmonised standard is being placed on the EU market, the CPR requires the manufacturer to draw up a &lsquo;declaration of performance&rsquo; and affix a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; marking to the product. In order to do so, manufacturers must test and declare the performance of their construction products using a common technical language prescribed in the harmonised standard.<\/p>  <p>In relation to the concrete blocks, the relevant suite of harmonised standard facilitating specification of masonry units is the EN 771 (series).  &lsquo;I.S. EN 771-3:2011+A1:2015&rsquo; deals with aggregate concrete masonry units. In this regard, National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has published additional guidance in the form of &lsquo;S.R. 325:2013+A2:2018\/AC:2019 Recommendations for the design of masonry structures in Ireland to Eurocode 6&rsquo; which sets out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of, inter alia  , EN 771(series) in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>In respect of aggregates for concrete, NSAI has published &lsquo;S.R. 16:2016 Guidance on the use of I.S. EN 12620:2002+A1:2008 - Aggregates for concrete&rsquo; which   outlines the precautions to be taken in the quarry to reduce the risk of harmful impurities in aggregate production, including the requirement for independent third party oversight of factory production control by a Notified Body (a designated body that carries out third-party tasks). <\/p>  <p>  The manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the CPR and in particular for the Declaration of Performance\/CE marking of the construction product he or she is placing on the market, having full knowledge of the raw material (as is legally required by the CPR via the relevant harmonised European Standards) and having regard to the end product&rsquo;s suitability for use in construction works in accordance with the relevant Standard Recommendations published by the NSAI.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst the CPR focuses on the conditions which apply when placing a product on the market, clients, specifiers, designers and builders etc., should:<\/p>  <p>  when drawing up specifications, refer to the harmonised technical specifications and specifically to the requirements of individual characteristics when necessary,<\/p>  <p>  when choosing the products most suitable for their intended use in construction works, review the manufacturer&rsquo;s Declaration of Performance,<\/p>  <p>  check National Annexes or Standard Recommendations published by NSAI, which give guidance on appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of the product in Ireland, and<\/p>  <p>  ensure compliance with the Building Regulations 1997 to 2019, in this regard all works should be carried out using proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.<\/p>  <p>  The NSAI is Ireland&rsquo;s official standards body and is an autonomous body under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment. NSAI is not an enforcement body for the purposes of the marketing rules applicable for construction products.<\/p>  <p>While the CPR came into force and has direct legal application across the entire European Union since 1 July 2013, each Member State is responsible for regulating for its own market surveillance activities in accordance with the specific requirements of the CPR and the broader overarching requirements of Chapter III of Regulation (EU) No. 765\/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339\/9.  <\/p>  <p>Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No.225 of 2013)  , each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas. <\/p>  <p>In addition, the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (Construction Products &ndash; Market Surveillance) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 682 of 2020) appointed Dublin City Council as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the  European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis. Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO) Market Surveillance Unit has recently been established for this purpose. DCC-NBCO may be contacted at: support@nbco.gov.ie.    Building control authorities will liaise with DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise. <\/p>  <p>  Market surveillance activity should enable non-compliant products to be identified and kept or taken off the market with unscrupulous and\/or criminal economic operators prosecuted and penalised for their actions. In this context, it is important to note that the overarching objective of a market surveillance authority is to ensure that compliant products are placed on the market. Where non-compliance is identified, market surveillance activities should be designed to encourage economic operators to take appropriate corrective actions to redress the position within a reasonable period of time. <\/p>  <p>  Market surveillance authorities have significant powers including to obtain access to the place of manufacture or storage, request technical information, select samples of the construction product and carry out evaluations, examination or tests on such samples. Where construction products are placed on the market which do not comply with the requirements set out in the CPR, market surveillance authorities have powers to direct the relevant economic operator to take the necessary corrective actions to bring the product into compliance. Where this does not work, there are further procedures that may result in the product being withdrawn or recalled from the market, its use subject to special conditions, or the products availability on the market being prohibited or restricted.     <\/p>  <p>Pursuant to Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) 765\/2008, Ireland&rsquo;s National market surveillance programme 2021   is published on the website of the European Commission. Section 2.5 provides specific details with the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by DCC-NBCO, which has recently commenced, to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, Regulation (EU) 2019\/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 which establishes an EU wide framework for market surveillance, will come into force in 2021.This strengthens the existing provisions in the Construction Products Regulation (and other Union harmonisation legislation), relating to the compliance of products, the framework for cooperation with organisations representing economic operators or end users, the market surveillance of products and controls on products entering the EU market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500084#WRAA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1399,"content":"<p>Question No. 573 answered with Question No. 572.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services","counter":1400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500084#WRAA03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1401,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[30672\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500084#WRAA03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will address a matter raised in correspondence (details supplied) in relation to water services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1402,"content":"<p>The Deputy refers to the Government's Policy Paper \"Irish Water - Towards a National, Publicly-Owned Regulated, Water Services Utility.

This has been a complex and challenging process for key stakeholders, notably the workers, who include approximately 3,200 local authority water services staff who are subject to service level agreement arrangements with Irish Water as well as a smaller number of staff employed directly by Irish Water and Ervia, together with their trade union representatives, the local government sector, and Ervia\/Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  In setting out its views and expectations in relation to the next phase of the Water Sector Transformation Programme in this way, the Government is enabling stakeholders to engage meaningfully in the change process which will give them the strongest possible say in determining their own future working arrangements.

The property in question must also meet certain eligibility criteria.<\/p>  <p>  To the end of March 2021, 1179 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013.  The 1179 households in the scheme represent 1970 adults and 1699 children who have remained living in their homes and communities.  There are currently 1079 active cases being progressed under the scheme.   <\/p>  <p>At present there are 12 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), 1 private company and 23 lenders participating in the MTR scheme.  The Housing Agency publishes a full range of statistics on the MTR scheme including a status report by lender and by purchaser and is available at the following link: www.housingagency.ie\/housing-information\/mortgage-rent-statistics   <\/p>  <p>  The scheme relies on the lender making the scheme available to the borrower where the lender has deemed their mortgage to be unsustainable under the MARP process and has assessed the borrower as being eligible for the MTR scheme.  Under the MTR scheme, a household with mortgage arrears goes from being a homeowner to becoming a social housing tenant of an AHB or where Home for Life buys the property a social housing tenant of a local authority.  The tenants pay a differential rent based on their income that is designed to be affordable and which is subject to periodic review.  Where a change of circumstances in an individual household occurs, the rent level will be reviewed.  <\/p>  <p>  A review of the MTR scheme in 2017 taking account of capacity within the AHB sector given that sector's role in delivering ambitious targets around new social housing supply, also recommended that alternative funding options, including the off-balance sheet potential of private institutional investment, be explored in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale.  An Expressions of Interest (EOI) Request issued in 2017 inviting parties from the private sector to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model.  The outcome from the EOI process is that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model was announced in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd. as the participant from the private sector.<\/p>  <p>  Under this alternatively funded model, Home for Life purchases properties from lenders subsequent to their voluntary surrender by borrowers that meet the MTR eligibility criteria and then enters into a long-term 25 year lease arrangement with the local authority in whose area the property is situated for a defined term at an agreed rent, thereby enabling the borrower to remain living in their own home under a tenancy agreement with the local authority.  Home for Life is also responsible for managing and maintaining the property on behalf of the local authority in accordance with the lease requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The provision to allow the borrower to buyback the property has been a feature of the MTR scheme since its inception.  A borrower has the option of buying back the property after 5 years or at the discretion of the property owner before the 5 years has expired.  Where an AHB or Home for Life buys the property from the lender at a non-discounted price, the borrower has the option of buying back the property at the open market value on the date of the buyback but the property cannot cost less than what the property owner paid for it.  Alternatively, where the property was purchased from the lender at a discounted price, the borrower may opt to buy back the property at the price the property owner paid for it plus all costs incurred by the property owner on the property including repairs, cost of finance and legal costs.  A clawback will also apply to this option where the borrower sells the property within 20 years of buying back the property.  To date, there had been only 1 case where a borrower has bought back their home.<\/p>  <p>  Regardless of who the property owner is under the MTR scheme, AHB or Home for Life, the local authority is obliged to meet the housing needs of social housing tenants indefinitely and beyond the term of the applicable lease arrangement. <\/p>  <p>  AHBs are an integral part of the MTR scheme and their participation in the scheme has enabled and continues to enable a significant number of borrowers to remain in their homes as social housing tenants.   AHBs, as landlords, are responsible for managing and maintaining the properties they acquire under the MTR scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of an MTR provider from the private sector has facilitated more individuals and families staying in their homes.  Given the sizeable cohort of borrowers still in long-term mortgage arrears, all the MTR providers participating in the scheme are needed in order to meet the demand for the scheme. In all scenarios, my Department and the Housing Agency are focused on meeting the long-term housing needs of the greatest number of households in unsustainable mortgage arrears. <\/p>  <p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to strengthen the Mortgage to Rent Scheme and ensure that it is helping those who need it.   Building on the significant improvements already made to the scheme since 2017, my Department is currently working closely with the Housing Agency and key stakeholders to identify any further improvements required to the scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500085#WRBB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":1438,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500085#WRBB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1439,"qnumday":587,"qnumall":"[30814\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500085#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the local authority decarbonisation zones; and the list of zones selected.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1440,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan sets out an ambitious whole-of-society approach designed to enable Ireland to meet its EU targets of reducing carbon emissions by 51% between 2021 and 2030, and thereafter to achieve a climate neutral economy by 2050.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p><p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. However, with the exception of the specific payments listed in the Household Means Policy as being disregarded, all income from social insurance and social assistance payments, allowances and benefits, including Working Family Payment, is assessable.<\/p><p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and separately, an allowance of 2.5% for each child.<\/p><p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing. <\/p><p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p><p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500085#WRBB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":1464,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500085#WRBB03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1465,"qnumday":596,"qnumall":"[30950\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500085#WRBB03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of unsold affordable homes being used for social housing by local authority; the annual cost of servicing the loans on these properties by each local authority; the cost to date of servicing these loans by local authority; the estimated cost to the Exchequer of these properties; and his plans to assist local authorities meet these debt obligations in tabular form.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1466,"content":"<p>As of Q4 2020, a total of 2,039 unsold affordable units (USAs) have been identified across 19 local authorities and are available for social housing tenants.  <\/p><p>In September 2020, I convened a working group to examine the issues around these units in detail.

The most significant and impactful draining and cutting of the blanket bog  took place during times of crisis namely during &ldquo;The Emergency&rdquo;  of the 1940&rsquo;s and the oil crisis of the 1980&rsquo;s and finally in 1986 an area of intact blanket bog was dug with drains in preparation to cut turf.

Information on the schemes, including those that have been approved in Cork City and County, that have received approval in principle under the Serviced Sites Fund are available at:<\/p><p><i>www.rebuildingireland.ie\/news\/minister-murphy-gives-the-go-ahead-for-ten-local-authority-sites-for-affordable-housing-under-the-serviced-sites-fund\/<\/i>, and <\/p><p><i>www.rebuildingireland.ie\/news\/minister-murphy-approves-funding-of-e84m-to-support-delivery-of-1770-affordable-homes-under-the-ssf\/<\/i>. <\/p><p>My Department continues to engage with local authorities to progress both current and potential projects, with the first SSF project to deliver affordable homes for purchase later this year being the Boherboy project in Cork City. <\/p><p>These homes will come with an initial price of between 10% and 40% below market price, with the discount provided remaining as a fully-repayable equity charge against the property. The scheme is targeted at first-time buyers, with some limited exceptions as outlined in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021. Applications for affordable housing on local authority lands, supported by the Serviced Sites Fund, will be made through the local authorities.<\/p><p>In addition to the affordable homes to be delivered by local authorities, Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, which is aimed at first-time buyers buying a new-build home on private land. It will help first-time buyers secure their own home by providing up to 20% equity support to bridge the gap between the mortgage available to them and the price of the home they want. This would seem to be the specific scheme referred to in the question.  <\/p><p>The Affordable Housing Bill will provide a basis for the establishment of the scheme which it is anticipated will be operated and administered by a newly established a special purpose vehicle (SPV). The Bill also provides that the Minister may agree the terms by which the equity support may be provided in a memorandum of agreement with the SPV covering, inter alia, areas such as purchaser eligibility and financial means, the homes that may be considered eligible under the scheme, and the amount of funding that can be provided.<\/p><p>Determining the price caps for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme requires balancing the accessibility of the scheme for eligible purchasers, mitigating against potential inflationary pressure and ensuring that a range of homes can be supplied across key locations.

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Climate Action Plan 2019, my Department is currently undertaking a review of the solar panel exemptions, and is actively engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as other key stakeholders, with a view to finalising a proposal for draft amending Regulations to reflect, inter alia, technical developments in the sector. One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected on prescribed development - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, to facilitate the generation of renewable energy for self-consumption. Also included in this review are solar panel exemptions for educational and community buildings.<\/p>  <p>  The main outstanding issue that remains to be addressed in the current review is the potential for \"glint and glare\" impacts for aircraft and the need to ensure that they do not result in any real or potential threat to aviation safety. Accordingly, my Department has been engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as the Irish Aviation Authority, in order to find a safe and workable solution in relation to this particular aspect of the review. The Department has begun the tendering process for this project, which will involve the development of aviation safeguarding maps for each airport\/aerodrome in the country, and has received feedback from potential tenderers estimating a timeline of up to 9 months for its completion.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the length of time that it is expected to take to complete the aviation safeguarding maps, my Department has decided to adopt an interim measure which would allow revised regulations to be introduced prior to the completion of these maps, but with defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes for solar installations. My Department has consulted with the Irish Aviation Authority on this matter, and has developed draft interim regulations in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  These draft regulations have now been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001\/42\/EC, and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals, which will include public consultation as part of the process. This process is expected to take between four and five months to complete. <\/p>  <p>  Following the public consultation and consideration of any submissions received, and as required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. <\/p>  <p>  The process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed in Q4 2021. These interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.<\/p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed by Q4 2021. The final supplementary set of regulations will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500086#WRCC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Websites","counter":1503,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500086#WRCC01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1504,"qnumday":609,"qnumall":"[31286\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500086#WRCC01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the way in which his Department and agencies under his remit are meeting the requirement to have a statement on the compliance of their websites and mobile applications with the regulations under the directive 2016\/2102 (EU), as articulated in SI No. 358\/2020 - European Union (Accessibility of Websites and Mobile Applications of Public Sector Bodies) Regulations 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1505,"content":"<p>My Department is actively in the process of adjusting websites to meet the needs of its users.

The scheme is an established part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  The household must be eligible for social housing and the property must meet the appropriate standards for social housing.<\/p><p>To the end of March 2021, 1179 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR scheme since its introduction nationally in 2013.  The 1179 households in the scheme represent 1970 adults and 1699 children who have remained living in their homes and communities.  There are currently 1079 active cases being progressed under the scheme.  <\/p><p>Given the nature of the individual property transaction underpinning MTR, the decision to purchase a property under the MTR scheme is a matter for the MTR provider concerned which can be either an AHB or Home for Life.  I can neither compel a lender to sell a property at a particular price nor compel an AHB or Home for Life to purchase a property at a particular price.  In relation to the specific case raised, I understand that a sale price has yet to be agreed between the lender and Home for Life.<\/p><p>While the Housing Agency as administrators of the scheme on my Department's behalf make every effort to encourage stakeholders to meet their individual timelines set out within the MTR process, cases will arise where agreeing a sale price between a lender and a MTR provider may become protracted.

The Department is currently liasing with Kildare County Council to progress these affordable homes.  <\/p>  <p>  Information on the schemes that have received approval in principle under the Serviced Sites Fund are available at:<\/p>  <p>www.rebuildingireland.ie\/news\/minister-murphy-gives-the-go-ahead-for-ten-local-authority-sites-for-affordable-housing-under-the-serviced-sites-fund\/  , and <\/p>  <p>www.rebuildingireland.ie\/news\/minister-murphy-approves-funding-of-e84m-to-support-delivery-of-1770-affordable-homes-under-the-ssf\/  .<\/p>  <p>  These homes will come with an initial price of between 10% and 40% below market price, with the discount provided remaining as fully-repayable equity charge against the property. The scheme is targeted at first-time buyers, with some limited exceptions as detailed in the Affordable Housing 2021 Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the affordable homes to be delivered through the SSF, Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the forthcoming Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, which is aimed at first-time buyers buying a new-build private home. It will help first-time buyers secure their own home by bridging the gap between the mortgage available to them and the price of the home they want.  Work on the detailed design of the proposed scheme is ongoing and at an advanced stage.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of new-build affordable homes through the measures mentioned above are designed to increase housing supply in general, thereby helping to address the under-supply that currently exists.<\/p>  <p>  Some people, however, may prefer to rent than to buy, making Cost Rental a more appropriate and viable option. Three initial Cost Rental projects are already underway. The first Cost Rental homes in Ireland, 50 two-bedroom apartments at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, will be delivered by the Tuath and Respond Approved Housing Bodies in Quarter 3 2021. Dublin City Council is also progressing a site at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate), and the LDA is collaborating with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on a site at Shanganagh, Shankill.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of Cost Rental housing is also being implemented through the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, allocated &euro;35m in Budget 2021. I have approved in principle the financing, this year, of 390 new homes across eight sites, located in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, and Cork. CREL support and careful cost management has generated initial rents which are at least 25% below comparable open market prices, delivering significantly improved affordability for renters.<\/p>  <p>In addition to the measures in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, the Land Development Agency (LDA) is tasked to work with Government Departments, local authorities, state agencies and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On establishment, the LDA had access to an initial tranche of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. Information on the work of the LDA is available at: www.lda.ie\/  .  <\/p>  <p>  Other affordability measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme, and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.<\/p>  <p>The Help to Buy Scheme may return tax paid in the previous four years to eligible first-time buyers, up to a maximum amount of &euro;30,000, for a new home. Information is available online at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/property\/help-to-buy-incentive\/index.aspx  .<\/p>  <p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. There are no set minimum income limits; however, applicants do need to have sufficient borrowing and repayment capacity and must be capable of repaying the mortgage.

For those who must travel the restrictions and guidance that apply are outlined on the COVID-19 Travel Advice pages on Gov.ie. These are subject to ongoing amendment subject to public health advice.<\/p><p>Currently, those arriving into Ireland from abroad, including those travelling from Great Britain, must complete a COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form, obtain a pre-travel negative RT-PCR test and quarantine on arrival in Ireland in line with the terms listed on Gov.ie. In general, these requirements do not apply to persons who travel from Northern Ireland. However, they do apply to persons who arrive here via Northern Ireland and have been overseas in the 14 days prior to their arrival. Those travelling to Ireland who have been in one of the listed high-risk Designated States in the 14 days before they arrive, must complete mandatory hotel quarantine. Great Britain is not at present on this list.  Those travelling from Great Britain should however arrange a COVID-19 (RT-PCR) test at least 5 days after arrival.<\/p><p>The UK Government and the UK's devolved administrations have established regulations for international travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, individuals whose journey begins in Ireland and who have remained in Ireland, or elsewhere in the Common Travel Area, for 10 days prior to travel, do not require a pre-travel PCR test or evidence of having been vaccinated to travel to any part of the UK. They are also not subject to mandatory quarantine rules once they have entered the UK, but they do remain subject to the local restrictions and guidance in place. While this is current advice, I cannot of course anticipate what rules the UK Government and the UK&rsquo;s devolved administrations will apply at a future date. <\/p><p>Under current Scottish Government regulations, travel between Ireland and Scotland should only take place for listed permitted reasons, for example for work or education. At this time, the Scottish authorities do not require Irish citizens to complete a passenger locator form. For a more detailed understanding of Scottish regulations and to check for changes, those who need to travel should monitor the Scottish Government web pages on &ldquo;Coronavirus (COVID-19): travel and transport&rdquo; or consult with the UK or Scottish authorities directly.<\/p><p>From 19 July, subject to the prevailing public health situation, Ireland will broadly align itself to the EU approach to non-essential travel into the EU from outside the EU\/EEA, including with regard to our policy on travel from Britain to Ireland.  It is expected that the general travel advisory against all non-essential international travel will end and that we will instead advise citizens to travel safely and in accordance with public health guidance and restrictions.  An &lsquo;emergency brake&rsquo; mechanism will be coordinated at EU level to react swiftly to the emergence of variants of concern or variants of interest.  I wish to see travel between Ireland and Britain taking place in a seamless manner as soon as this is feasible and safe. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500087#WRDD06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1612,"qnumday":647,"qnumall":"[30529\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500087#WRDD06200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the representations he has made to countries in which vaccines (details supplied) or other non-EMA approved vaccines have been administered to Irish citizens.","asker":"1488","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1613,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department continues to work closely with our international partners to support the health and welfare of Irish citizens overseas in the context of COVID-19.

This is similar to most other government sites across the European Union. Accessibility to gov.ie is being enhanced by improving the level of plain English used for services on the site. This allows users of all levels to be able to find and understand information as quickly as possible. In addition, the gov.ie team have continuously performed multiple accessibility reviews since the website went live. The gov.ie team has engaged with and continues to engage with an accessibility expert to outline all accessibility requirements. Following the last accessibility audit, 65 issues were identified and action taken to rectify and resolve these issues. In addition, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) have since released updates to the core code of the gov.ie website to improve accessibility. <\/p>  <p>  All other sites managed by OGCIO are currently being moved to a new Content Management System (CMS) which has been built with WCAG compatibility in mind.

In subjects or modules where it is not specifically mentioned the topic of breastfeeding may occur during class conversation and through interactions with students.<\/p>  <p>  For example, from a nutritional aspect the subject of breastfeeding may come up in Post Primary Home Economics when discussing healthy lifestyles and nutritional requirements across all ages. In the Leaving Certificate Applied Childcare\/Community care module on the care of babies and young children, Unit 1 addresses breast and bottle feeding. <\/p>  <p>  From a social aspect, Junior Cycle Home Economics includes Strand Two on exploring the roles and responsibilities of the family while Leaving Certificate Home Economics includes Topic 3.1.6: Family As A Caring Unit. In Leaving Certificate Applied Social Education, the module on Social and Health Education, Unit 2: Relationships &ndash;  the topic may be covered while discussing parenting and the needs that children have at various stages of their development.<\/p>  <p>  Further relevant subjects would be within the SPHE curriculum. Junior Cycle SPHE Strand Two: Minding Myself and Others contains learning outcomes 2.3: describe what promotes a sense of belonging in school, at home and in the wider community and their own role in creating an inclusive environment and 2.4: distinguish between appropriate care giving and receiving. At Leaving Certificate level, SPHE aims to develop health literacy, both for the individual student and for groups. Health literacy is the capacity of individuals to obtain discerningly, interpret and understand health information; this includes the confidence to access health services and the competence to use such information and services in ways that enhance health. Once students&rsquo; health literacy skills are developed, they will be able to seek out relevant knowledge and information using a variety of sources including digital sources.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Department of Health has produced a Breastfeeding Information Pack for Junior Cycle students in Irish Secondary Schools.<\/p>  <p>  The Information Pack was commissioned jointly by the Department of Health and the HSE Population Health Directorate, and developed by researchers from Health Promotion, Training &amp;amp; Support Services and Elm Training under the direction of a multidisciplinary, multisectoral expert advisory committee with representation from the relevant statutory and voluntary health services, SPHE coordinators and teachers from the relevant education sectors. The views and opinions of Junior Cycle students from a diversity of urban and rural schools were also pivotal in the development of the Information Pack.<\/p>  <p>  The rationale for the initiative is contained in Action 42 of &lsquo;Breastfeeding in Ireland: A Five Year Strategic Action Plan&rsquo; (Department of Health and Children, Oct. 2005), which recommended introducing breastfeeding information and promotion to schoolchildren at all levels of education within the context of the SPHE curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  In general, my Department does not have a role in approving, commissioning, sponsoring or endorsing any content in any educational textbook. The current policy within my Department is not to endorse any particular product or publication, including textbooks. There are a small number of exceptions where my Department has procured textbooks or resources in order to fill a need &ndash; for example with Leaving certificate Japanese and Italian. However, as with all textbooks there is no obligation for a school to use these in their delivery of the curriculum. Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at post-primary, determined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the decisions on which textbooks to use in primary and post-primary schools are taken at school level. <\/p>  <p>  The majority of textbooks are commissioned and published by educational publishers, and schools select their books from those available from a number of publishers. The Irish Educational Publishers Association (IEPA) meets with the NCCA in order to discuss the curriculum and to be made aware of any requirements in the curriculum. However the content of any individual textbook is determined by the publisher themselves, and therefore any queries regarding specific content in any particular textbook should be directed to the publisher.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the school is to provide an appropriate education for all its pupils.  A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500090#WRGG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Library Services","counter":1778,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500090#WRGG04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1779,"qnumday":704,"qnumall":"[30517\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500090#WRGG04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on whether access to books and reading is important for young children particularly those who might not have other means to access a wide variety of books; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that in 2009 the Government ceased giving Irish primary schools grants for buying library books; if grants to purchase library books for use by students will be reintroduced to primary schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1780,"content":"<p>My Department has to prioritise provision of funding directly to schools and funding of library services is a matter for my colleague Minister Heather Humphreys.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has responsibility for education and training and is charged with facilitating individuals through learning, to achieve their full potential and contribute to Ireland's social, cultural and economic development.<\/p>  <p>  The Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, launched in 2011, set out a vision for raising standards in our early years, primary and post-primary school settings. The interim review in 2017 highlighted the considerable progress which had been made since the launch of the Strategy in 2011 notably in promoting a high level of literacy for all.  The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2016 results showed that the reading skills of our primary school children, both in the paper based and online assessment, are amongst the best in all European and OECD countries.<\/p>  <p>  The commitments carried out over the lifetime of the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy (2011-2020) has prioritised the enhancement of learners&rsquo; literacy and numeracy skills. Commitments under the Strategy include reforms in initial teacher education, dedicated support for school leaders&rsquo;, teachers&rsquo; professional learning and curriculum reform. Priorities are linked to actions for related policy developments in my Department including the DEIS Plan 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government my Department is tasked with the development of a successor Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Literacy Strategy for all learners in early years, primary and post-primary schools. Development of the strategy will be done in consultation with all education stakeholders and other Government departments and bodies. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Education I am very conscious of the importance of library services and the value of these in the context of the supports available to schools. Responsibility for the support and provision of library services rests with my colleague, Heather Humphreys, TD, Minister for Rural and Community Development<\/p>  <p>  Local libraries currently provide a wide range of resources and activities which support Primary and Post-primary schools in developing children&rsquo;s literacy, numeracy, creativity and communication skills. By building on existing partnerships between schools and libraries, all schools can benefit directly from this ongoing cooperation.<\/p>  <p>  Each library service operates a network of central libraries, branch libraries and smaller part-time branches. Some library services also provide support for schools through mobile libraries or a school library van. Schools can access all of the services for primary schools through the larger branches or a central library. Schools can also access some services through smaller part-time branches.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to book borrowing, class visits and provision of access to reading and curriculum support, libraries provide learners at primary and post-primary with a reading space in the library branch as well as access to electronic and online resources.  Reference resources and research assistance are also available to students and teachers. In addition, libraries also provide students with access to study spaces where practicable.<\/p>  <p>  Libraries also provide ongoing library programmes and initiatives throughout the year and during school holiday periods, including an annual summer activities&rsquo; programme, to support the continuing development of children&rsquo;s literacy and numeracy skills.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 continues the programme of major reinvestment in our primary and post-primary education system.  Building on the initiatives set out in the Programme for Government the budget for the Department of Education is &euro;8.9 billion in 2021, an increase of &euro;410 million or some 5% on 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The Budget includes an additional allocation of &euro;226 million which is being provided to schools to meet costs relating to Covid-19. This allocation represents the balance of the &euro;437 million package approved by Government last July as part of the Roadmap for the Reopening Schools. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, my Department provides a book grant to all recognised primary and post primary schools within the Free Education Scheme in order to provide assistance for the purchase of books.  Under this scheme, the Department provided funding of &euro;17.1 million in 2020 to schools.<\/p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and in order to support the establishment of book rental schemes my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to primary schools.  Circa. 96% of primary schools and 68% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;1 million provided under Budget 2020 was allocated to 102 Primary DEIS schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020\/21 school year. The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents. It will run for the period of one year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to investing in education but I have to invest at a level that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the moment given economic circumstances.

From 11 January 2021, all students, including students currently in fifth year and who are due to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools. Students in fifth year were prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students. <\/p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils\/students in a COVID-19 context.  These are available at www.gov.ie\/backtoschool.<\/p><p>The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools last year and early this year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.  <\/p><p>Extensive guidance and supports have been and continue to be made available by my Department and its support services to support schools to plan for the transition to online and remote learning. Circular 0074\/2020, &lsquo;Communication\/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform&rsquo;, was issued by the Department last year.  In accordance with the circular, it became a requirement for all schools to have in place a communication\/learning platform (while acknowledging that many schools have already put such platforms in place) that supports them to respond in the event of a partial or full school closure in the future, including the facilitation of some use of live or recorded video lessons where practicable.<\/p><p>The circular includes links to a range of materials and supports developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), including information and resources for commonly used platforms for teaching, learning and assessment,  short video tutorials exploring how digital platforms and tools can be used effectively for remote learning purposes and clarity regarding how chosen platforms can be effectively used for assessment and feedback purposes, links to each of which are shown.<\/p><p>Other documents published by my Department include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education<\/i><i>and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers<\/i>.

A number of adjustments were made to the assessment arrangements for the 2021 Leaving Certificate examinations to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by the students who are due to take these examinations.<\/p><p>It is hoped that current fifth year students will be able to complete a full year of in-school tuition when they return to school at the start of the 2021\/22 school year, and will experience no further disruption to their learning as a result of Covid-19.  I am conscious that current fifth year students have also experienced some disruption to their learning and this will be considered in planning for the 2022 Leaving Certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500091#WRHH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1811,"content":"<p>Question No. 715 answered with Question No. 702.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1812,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500091#WRHH01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1813,"qnumday":716,"qnumall":"[30671\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500091#WRHH01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":" the details on the arrangements in relation to the contingency arrangements for a school (details supplied) to be located in interim accommodation at a college site from August 2021 for a maximum of one academic year which were announced on 26 May 2021; the way in which she plans to ensure that the school has their own permanent accommodation within the year outlined; and the contingency plans that are in place if planning permissions are delayed or refused.","asker":"1628","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1814,"content":"<p>The permanent school building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is being delivered under my Department&rsquo;s Design &amp;amp; Build programme.<\/p>  <p>  The new school building project is in architectural planning stage.

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702 and as a result of the programme of pay restoration the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;37,692. This will increase to &euro;38,692 by October 2022 under the current pay agreement, Building Momentum. <\/p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall within three months of the passing of this Act prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo; The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assessed the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011.  The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million of which Education accounts for approximately &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledged that during the financial crisis there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). <\/p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government has supported the gradual negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance). The costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.<\/p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. This agreement is benefitting 18,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provided for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants. I am fully aware that the teacher unions had outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters were given full consideration and under the new pay agreement. <\/p>  <p>  On 10 December 2020, a new public service pay agreement Building Momentum was agreed following formal discussions between DPER and the Public Services Committee of ICTU, with consultation and input from the sectors, including my Department. There is a specific provision in relation to new entrant teacher pay which allows for the skipping of Point 12 of the pay scale, which is a further improvement in pay for new entrant teachers. This measure will resolve in full the remaining salary scale issues pertaining to new entrant teachers. My Department is currently working on the implementation of this and it is anticipated that this will come into effect shortly.<\/p>  <p>  These measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and that continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions can bring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500091#WRHH03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1836,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500091#WRHH03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1837,"qnumday":726,"qnumall":"[30852\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500091#WRHH03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of progress being made with the new school buildings for a school (details supplied).","asker":"1463","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1838,"content":"<p>The project to which the Deputy refers has been devolved for delivery to Donegal Education and Training Board (DETB).<\/p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the project was recently approved to tender stage; DETB will now commence the process of tendering for a contractor.  <\/p><p>Please be assured that DETB is engaging directly with the school authority to keep it informed of progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500091#WRHH03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1840,"qnumday":727,"qnumall":"[30853\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500091#WRHH04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of progress being made with the new school building for a school (details supplied).","asker":"1463","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1841,"content":"<p>The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is included in my Department&rsquo;s Construction Programme which is being delivered under the National Development Plan. <\/p>  <p>  This project is one of the school building projects on my Department&rsquo;s traditional build programme, and is currently at tender stage.

post primary schools at a ratio of 19:1 in the free education system and 23:1 to schools in the fee charging sector.  Each 1 point adjustment to the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level is estimated to cost in the region of &euro;56.5m per annum. <\/p>  <p>  At primary level, the annual staffing schedule determines the allocation of teachers to schools.  For the current school year, it operates on a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher (26:1).  Budget 2021 has implemented a further 1 point reduction for the 2021\/22 school year so that primary schools will be allocated teaching posts on an average basis of 1 classroom teacher for every 25 pupils.  Lower thresholds apply to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools. In addition, there has been a three point reduction in the retention schedule, which will assist schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts.  Each one point adjustment to the primary staffing schedule would cost approximately &euro;14.5m annually.<\/p>  <p>  While each one point adjustment to the primary staffing schedule results in an approximate 300 additional teaching posts,  the number of additional classrooms required would be dependent on the existing accommodation arrangements in the schools due to gain a teaching post.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021061500092#WRJJ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1903,"content":"<p>Question No. 749 answered with Question No. 748.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1904,"content":"<p>Question No. 750 answered with Question No. 748.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1905,"content":"<p>Question No. 751 answered with Question No. 748.<\/p>"}]
