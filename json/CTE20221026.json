All present in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility and protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members who wish to participate remotely need to do so from within the Leinster House complex as they are well aware.  We have received apologies from Deputy Shanahan.<\/p> <p> Our business today is to consider the Data Protection Act 2018 (Section 60(6)) (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Regulations 2022; Data Protection Act 2018 (Section 60(6)) (Competition and Consumer Protection Commission) Regulations 2022; and Data Protection Act 2018 (Section 60(6)) (Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority) Regulations 2022.  The regulations if adopted will provide for the restriction of the rights and obligations provided for in the Data Protection Act 2018 where it is necessary and proportionate to safeguard the statutory functions of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, the Corporate Enforcement Authority, CEA, and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased we have an opportunity to consider these matters further today with the Minister of State with responsibility for trade, promotion, digital and company regulation, Deputy Calleary.  I would also like to welcome from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment Ms Tara Keane, principal officer; and Ms Orla O'Brien, assistant principal.<\/p> <p>  Before we start I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to another person when giving evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name, or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  The opening statement from the Minister of State has been circulated to members.  I invite the Minister of State to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022102600002#A00400","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for facilitating the discussion of the draft statutory instruments today.  I know the committee has a busy work programme so members' time is appreciated.  I am joined by Ms Tara Keane and Ms Orla O'Brien from my Department and I thank them for their work on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I understand a briefing note has been circulated so I will begin by setting out further background to the draft instruments for the three bodies.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Corporate Enforcement Authority and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority each perform important statutory functions which can lead to a range of enforcement activities.  They are a vital part of a robust regulatory framework that is responsive and reflects international best practice to facilitate enterprise and entrepreneurship while also protecting employees, members, creditors and consumers with appropriate safeguards.<\/p> <p>  All three statutory bodies have the power to take civil court proceedings or adopt administrative measures in certain circumstances to enforce the law in the public interest.  In addition, the bodies work closely with each other and other regulatory and enforcement authorities in Ireland and within the EU that have administrative and civil enforcement powers.  The Government is committed to ensuring that each body has the requisite legislative powers and resources to exercise their functions effectively.  Members of the committee are aware of the establishment of the Corporate Enforcement Authority as a stand-alone statutory body in July this year and the enhanced powers introduced for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in the Competition (Amendment) Act 2022.  The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority powers were also enhanced most recently in the Companies (Statutory Audits) Act 2018.<\/p> <p>  When the General Data Protection Regulation was introduced in 2018, it strengthened the rights of individuals in respect of the privacy and fair use of their personal data.  It also introduced a balancing provision under Article 23 to ensure that this did not undermine the statutory functions of public bodies.  Accordingly, section 60 of the Data Protection Act 2018 provides that the statutory instruments we are considering today may be introduced to protect important objectives of general public interest.  Examples of the objectives specified in the Act and included in the draft instruments are avoiding obstructions to any official or legal inquiry; taking any action for the purpose of considering and investigating a complaint made to a regulatory body in respect of persons carrying out a profession or other regulated activity; and preventing, detecting, investigating or prosecuting breaches of the law that are subject to civil or administrative sanctions.  What is being prevented by the regulations, therefore, is the potential for data protection rights to be used as a way of undermining these and other essential functions.  This could be done by way of a data access request or multiple requests seeking the disclosure and possibly amendment or deletion of information that is part of an active investigation or inquiry that therefore fundamentally undermines the processes under way.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the content of the draft regulations, each is composed on the same lines of policy and technical approach.  They were prepared with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and in close consultation with the three bodies.  The regulations respect the right to data protection including the interests of the data subject.  The data subject's rights are only restricted insofar as is necessary and proportionate to protect the functions of the statutory agencies.  First, any restrictions must be considered on a case-by-case basis following an assessment of the relevant circumstances.  Second, safeguards are in place obliging the CCPC, the CEA, and IAASA to notify the data subject and provide reasons for the restriction, unless to do so may prejudice the achievement of a relevant objective.  Third, the data subject must be informed of the right or obligation affected by the restriction, whether the restriction applies in whole or in part, and of the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Commission.  The proposed measures also require the bodies to have in place certain policies and procedures relating to safeguards to prevent abuse or unlawful access or transfer of data and purposes of the processing or categories of processing.  The measures also require that each body ensures that all information provided in relation to these regulations is provided in a clear, concise and accessible manner.<\/p> <p>  In accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act, my Department consulted with the Data Protection Commission and the Minister for Justice on the draft regulations.  Following that consultative process, the Data Protection Commissioner wrote to confirm that the commission has identified no matter which is of significant concern in relation to the proposed regulations.  The Minister for Justice has also acknowledged her agreement with the proposed measures.<\/p><p>The legal instruments are balanced and proportionate and there are strong policy reasons for adopting the restrictions sought.  There is a reasonable expectation that the absence of restrictions to access to personal data will pose a serious risk to the statutory functions of these high-profile bodies.  It is in the public interest that they are able to function effectively and efficiently.  For the purposes of their civil and administrative enforcement functions, it appropriate that they be permitted to avail of the section 60 restrictions.<\/p><p> I recommend to the committee that the statutory instruments are necessary and balanced.

I know the committee did a lot of work on this before I took over this brief with my predecessor, Deputy Troy.<\/p> <p>  As members know, the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Acts 2003 to 2019 to increase the number of personal injury claims resolved by the board without recourse to litigation.  It was clear during the Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il that in the main, the Bill was positively received by Deputies across all parties.  The resounding message from that debate was the need for reform.  The valuable work the board undertakes was mentioned by many Deputies during the Second Stage debate and I agree that this work should in no way be undermined.  The changes proposed by this Bill have been carefully considered in consultation with the board and are aimed at strengthening the current model to resolve a greater number of personal injury claims.  Deputies raised a number of questions during the debate and we engaged with a number of them afterwards.  This includes Deputies O'Reilly, Shanahan and Flaherty, along with Senators Mullen, Crowe and Casey and I thank them for meeting me and engaging with me to tease out those issues further.<\/p> <p>  Arising from those discussions and based on input from the board, pending drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, I intend moving three amendments on Report Stage.  The first amendment is a new section in the Personal Injuries Resolution Board Bill 2022, to provide for an amendment to section 69 of the principal Act to ensure that mediators appointed from a panel are provided the same level of indemnity as mediators who are staff members.  The second amendment will introduce another section to the Bill and provide for a review of the Bill.  The third amendment is a technical amendment to section 23 of the Bill to enable the proper commencement of the Bill.<\/p><p> My intention is to move forward with this legislation swiftly.  The committee has recommended the same.

Today I am joined by three colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Ms Jenny Connors, Dr. Patrick Moran, and Ms Caroline O'Loughlin, alongside colleagues from the Department of Finance.<\/p> <p>  The medium-term expenditure framework, published in the summer economic statement for 2021, outlined the strategy to set core expenditure growth rate at sustainable levels of approximately 5% per annum and to provide for ongoing improvements in public services.  Developments in 2022 have altered the economic landscape significantly.  As part of the this year's summer economic statement, the growth rate for expenditure in 2023 was adjusted upwards.  The Government&rsquo;s objectives for budget 2023 are: to continue to invest in public services and infrastructure through core expenditure without further adding to inflationary pressures; to provide a comprehensive response to the cost-of-living pressures for households, businesses and wider society; and to ensure sufficient resources to respond to external challenges, including Covid-19, Brexit and the Ukrainian humanitarian response.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2023 allocated &euro;90.4 billion in gross voted expenditure for next year.  This is made up of &euro;74.3 billion in core current expenditure for the delivery of public services, &euro;11.6 billion in core capital expenditure as set out in the national development plan, and &euro;4.5 billion in non-core expenditure.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2023 contains a significant response to support households, public and community services and businesses with inflationary pressures.  This includes both once-off and permanent measures, including a &euro;2.2 billion winter cost-of-living package for households with three energy credits for all households and a series of additional social protection and education payments.  In addition, a Christmas bonus will be paid to eligible social protection recipients in 2022.  In recognition of the unprecedented rise in energy bills, Government is also making available &euro;340 million in 2022 to provide further support to public and community services.  The Government is also introducing a &euro;200 million Ukraine emergency response scheme to support businesses.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2023 also includes a number of core permanent spending measures, focusing on cost of living, with an estimated value of &euro;1.3 billion, including a &euro;12 weekly social protection rate increase for working age and pension payments and an increase in the universal subsidy on the national childcare scheme.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 2 of the Budget 2023: Expenditure Report sets out an analysis of the impact of the various cost-of-living, tax and social protection measures.  Households are estimated to record an average gain in weekly disposable equivalised income of 3% as a result of budget 2023, with the overall impact being strongly progressive.  The disposable income of those in the first three income deciles is estimated to increase by an average of 5.2%.  This demonstrates the important role of social protection measures at the lower end of the income distribution.<\/p> <p>  I shall turn now to budget day publications.  Budget 2023 saw the development and publication of key budgetary documentation such as Budget 2023: Expenditure Report.  This document sets out the public expenditure strategy, expenditure allocations by Vote and the Estimates for public services.  This year the report included detail regarding cost-of-living measures and non-core funding required to respond to external shocks.  A series of additional analytical papers were also published this year, including Budget 2023: Forecasting Live Register Recipients and Expenditure, and a paper on the use of carbon tax funds.  In addition to these publications, The Budget in Brief: A Citizen's Guide to Budget 2023 was published.  This provides a high level overview of the budget decisions in a clear and accessible format.<\/p> <p>  It is useful to consider the range of budgetary documents alongside the budgetary reform initiatives as part of a whole-of-year budgeting process.  These initiatives place an emphasis on broadening the approach to how public expenditure is appraised, implemented and reviewed across Departments.  This is also alongside examining the impact of public expenditure among different cohorts of society and on the different types of objectives we want to achieve.  It is with this more complete type of understanding that policymakers can work towards the achievement of value for money in the context of the entire budgetary process and enhance the impact of these policies and programmes.

This process began in earnest with the National Economic Dialogue 2022 on 20 June in Dublin Castle, where participants debated a wide range of challenges facing the economy at this time.  This was followed by the publication of the summer economic statement, which set out the Government&rsquo;s fiscal strategy and the parameters for the subsequent budget.  As the committee will recall, the Government set out a medium-term budgetary strategy in last year&rsquo;s summer economic statement outlining a plan for keeping the public finances on a sustainable trajectory while allowing for reductions in personal taxation and continuing to invest in public services.<\/p> <p>  For this year, in the context of the changed economic environment, the Government departed temporarily from the parameters set out in the medium-term plan.  To deliver a cost-of-living budget, the Government doubled the size of the planned tax package and increased public expenditure.  The intention is that this will be a one-time departure in recognition of the exceptional circumstances we find ourselves in.<\/p> <p>  The process for budget 2023 took place in a uniquely abbreviated timeframe.  In response to the pressing challenges facing the economy arising from the cost-of-living issue, the Government decided it was appropriate to bring forward the budget by two weeks from its usual date in early October.  Following the summer economic statement, the tax strategy group set out policy options for consideration by Government across a range of tax policy areas as well as PRSI.  The tax strategy group met on 12 July and the group's papers were published on 10 August.<\/p> <p>  The next staging post in the budget documentation was the publication of the White Paper on receipts and expenditure, which sets out a no-policy-change baseline estimate of the fiscal position for this year and next.  In line with standard practice, this is published the Friday immediately preceding the budget to take account of the latest economic and fiscal data and to provide figures that are as accurate as possible.  Accordingly, the White Paper this year was published on Friday, 23 September.<\/p> <p>  The documentation published as part of budget 2023 is comprehensive and aims to provide as much information as possible to the Oireachtas and the public.  The core documentation published by the Department of Finance includes the Budget 2023: Tax Policy Changes document, which sets out the detail on budget tax changes across all heads, Budget 2023: Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which contains revised macroeconomic and fiscal projections out to 2025, and this year the Department also published a new document, Beyond GDP: Quality of Life Assessment.  This included a distributional analysis of the impact of the tax and welfare changes that were announced as well as further analysis from a well-being, equality and green budgeting perspective to complement the more traditional macro fiscal analysis.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the key headline points of budget 2023.  The total budget package for next year is &euro;6.9 billion, consisting of around &euro;1.1 billion in new taxation measures and &euro;5.8 billion in public expenditure.  In addition to this, there was a once-off package of cost-of-living supports to be introduced this year at a cost of &euro;4.1 billion.  This brings the total budgetary package across the two years to &euro;11 billion.  This is consistent with a general government surplus this year of &euro;1 billion, or 0.4% of modified national income, GNI*.  For next year, the surplus is projected to increase to about &euro;6.2 billion, or 2.2% of GNI*.  However, as the committee will be aware, the very positive headline figures are heavily skewed by windfall corporation tax receipts.  The Government has frequently warned that this windfall revenue, while in many respects welcome, cannot be relied upon and must not be used to fund permanent expenditure commitments.  That being the case, budget 2023 incorporates a new metric, the underlying general government balance, GGB, or GGB*, which sets out the fiscal position if these windfall receipts were excluded.<\/p><p>This metric suggests that removing excess corporate tax would lead to a significant deficit this year in the region of &euro;8 billion.  For next year we would face a deficit of about &euro;3.8 billion.<\/p><p> In recognition of this vulnerability, the Government has decided to commit part of this excess to the national reserve fund.  A transfer of &euro;2 billion will be made this year, rising to &euro;4 billion next year.  This will enable the Government to take advantage of windfall corporate tax receipts by rebuilding fiscal buffers and providing resources that can be drawn down to meet future challenges while ensuring we do not allow unreliable tax revenue to fund ongoing permanent spending measures.<\/p><p> Budget 2023 was framed in recognition of the urgent challenges the economy faces, both through an expanded budget package and an accelerated timeline.  It takes action to address the cost-of-living issue while outlining a credible pathway for rebuilding our fiscal buffers for the future.  My colleagues and I are happy to try to address any issues the committee would like to raise.  As members will appreciate, the budget covers a wide range of areas within the Department and it would not have been practical to bring all the lead officials to cover them today.  As such, if there are specific issues outside of our remits, we are happy to get our colleagues to follow up afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cassidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as teacht os comhair an choiste.  We all appreciate there is a lot in the budget but my questions will not be that specific so the witnesses will be more than able to answer them.<\/p> <p>  I want to mention one of the issues I had when trying to interpret the budget, and I am sure others had the same issue.  I do not come from the same background as the witnesses so sometimes it can be difficult when reading the terminology that can be used because it is not always consistent.  There were different categorisations in budget 2023, which created some problems.  There is core, non-core, temporary, once-off, allocated and unallocated funding and spending.  Some of them are established terms but some are not as established and sometimes they can be used interchangeably and, as we felt, inconsistently.  I do not have a question on that; I just wanted to comment on it.  I checked the public financial procedures document for guidance, but that handbook is some years out of date and some of the terms are not defined at all.  We want as many people as possible to be able to read the budget if they so wish, although I am not sure how many people would sit down to do so, but it assumes a strong level of insider knowledge and you must be part of the furniture of the process to read it.  It is important to note that and look at it so that others like me can read the budget more easily.<\/p> <p>  Most of my questions are for the officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but I have a quick question for Mr. Cassidy on the GGB and the windfall corporation tax element.  Will he explain what exactly are categorised as windfall tax receipts over ordinary corporation tax receipts?

One of the things that comes up a lot at the moment is the issue of having capital carryover.  There is a massive issue with housing targets and there can be delays to other infrastructure.  We know a lot of it is to do with construction sector capacity.  In 2018, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform established the construction sector group that comprised multiple Departments, State bodies and construction sector industry partners and participants.  Several important documents have been published on how we could transition to modern methods of construction.  I also sit on the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, and today we had the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, before us and we touched on modern methods of construction in terms of productivity, turnaround time and environmental performance.  It seems to me the progress in that has been a bit slow.  Is there anything being done to speed that up?  If that is not something somebody here can cover, that is no problem and I can move on to my next question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#D00600","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>We do not have colleagues from the capital section here but I can answer generally.  The national development plan, NDP, was published back in 2021.  It sets out &euro;165 billion in expenditure out to 2030 and a number of reforms are also set out in that document, of which the Deputy may be aware.  One of those was to set up a Project Ireland 2040 delivery board which oversees the delivery of the NDP.  Two major reforms within that were the introduction of independent external reviews of projects in excess of &euro;100 million at two decision points in the project life cycle.  We also have a major projects advisory group set up in our Department to review those business cases.  That is looking to strengthen the process we go through for large projects, but a number of issues have been highlighted around the significant underspending in capital expenditure, and the Deputy has alluded to some of them.  There were ongoing supply chain issues and delays, there was some progress in the contracts due to Covid and then there were challenges in the labour supply.  If the question is spending-specific, we can get the Deputy more detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Callaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>It is specifically on using modern methods of construction to build.

I will follow up on that.<\/p> <p>  If we are looking at different subsidies like the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, to a certain extent, we see they will exceed &euro;1 billion this year.  We have spoken to the Parliamentary Budget Office, which we deal with quite a lot in this committee, about the sustainability of the model because it has led to the State funding two fifths of private rental tenancies and how many people have called that into question.  Does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have any major concerns that this is unsustainable and a poor use of scarce resources?  I was elected as a councillor in 2014 and since then I have been dealing with people on housing and I have never seen it quite as bad as it is.  I want to ask about the sustainability of relying on the likes of HAP.  I know the answer will probably be that we have Housing for All and we will have all the houses from that, but it seems to be slow off the mark and I am not seeing it coming on stream in Galway.

At this stage, many people would be quite concerned about the amount of money that is being spent on that.  I will take Ms Callaghan's point in that regard, however.<\/p> <p>  There are two matters I wish to address.  Ms Callaghan mentioned in her opening statement the issue of one-off payments as part of the cost-of-living package.  I wondered about the likes of those payments that are recurring in nature.  One thing I have not really fully understood since being here is the Christmas bonus, which is recurring but is seen as a surprise every year.  I have pointed out that this has been a recurring measure since 2014 but it is classified as a once-off payment.  Obviously, I understand that gives flexibility in that it can be withdrawn if there is a crisis.  What is the Department's view of continuing it is a once-off payment rather than realising it is recurring?  It is just kind of announced as something on budget day when everybody really knows it is a recurring payment.  I would also argue that it speaks to short-term solutions being used for more longer-term problems.  The general inadequacies of the social welfare system are these kinds of one-off payments that are really recurring things.  We rely on them to have something to announce on budget day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#E00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for that question.

I take the Deputy's point that we have paid the Christmas bonus for the last number of years, but it is not always a 100% Christmas bonus.  There are decisions to be taken around that and it is dependent on the fiscal position in year.  In terms of making the announcement this year into next year, we cannot then pull back on that so we need to make sure it is fiscally possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jenny Connors"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>How much is it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#E00400","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>It is &euro;300 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Jenny Connors"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Okay, so it is just to have that wiggle room then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#E00600","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>It is &euro;300 million for a 100% Christmas bonus, just to be clear, which was not always the case.

I will ask a question about that in a minute.<\/p><p>On the overall view of the budget, however, it was suggested that the overall impact of the budget is &quot;strongly progressive&quot;.  In a contribution to us last week, a representative of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, stated that when we disregard the one-off measures:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe effect of permanent 2023 policy measures to inflation-proofed policies for 2020 gives an indication of the more medium-term challenges facing households and policy-makers.  Compared with indexing tax and welfare policies in line with inflation since 2020, budget 2023 leaves households worse off on average. <\/blockquote> <p>I understand the ESRI is saying that if we strip out the once-off measures, people are left worse off.  It also said that pensioners and lone parents are &quot;likely to experience average income losses&quot; and that the increase in the cut-off rate for the standard rate of tax was going to favour higher-income households.  This would challenge the view put forward here that it is &quot;strongly progressive&quot;.  I am curious as to how the Departments would respond to the ESRI's assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#E00900","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I will perhaps lead off and then other people might want to come in.  We published, and have done for a couple of years, a distributional analysis of the budget.  This one was contained what we have been referring to as the third budget document, that is, the quality of life or Beyond GDP document.  This is what our distributional analysis shows.  We separated the 2022 measures from the 2023 measures.  There might have been a temptation to lump them one on top of the other because it looks bigger, but it is affecting people's incomes in different years.  It would be a bit disingenuous if that was done and, therefore, we separated 2022 from 2023.  Looking at the 2022 measures, we see the largest increases in income to the first three deciles, which are, on average, a 4.5% increase compared to 1.4% for deciles four to ten.  Then, it is similar for the 2023 measures but the increase for the first three deciles is even larger at 5.2%.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy stated, the ESRI analysis does say that with the once-off measures, lower-income households will be better off in inflation-adjusted terms.  It is important to clarify that our analysis is not inflation adjusted.  It is in nominal terms whereas the ESRI's analysis is inflation adjusted.  Neither is wrong; they are just asking different questions.  We would argue that ours is less complex and simpler, but perhaps more communicable, because it shows people the change to their income before and after the budget purely as a result of the budgetary measures.  The ESRI shows the change compared to a hypothetical inflation-adjusted scenario for 2023, or a multi-annual one to which the Deputy referred.  Obviously, one of the key assumptions in the inflation-adjusted scenario is the inflation projection.  If the inflation projection or the number is different then it will completely change the results of the analysis.  That is not to say it is not legitimate.  It is, but it is just doing a different thing to what we do, which is looking at it on a purely nominal basis.  Doing that inflation-adjusted analysis for the next year is dependent on the projection.  Doing it on a current year basis for 2022 is really difficult.  That is why the ESRI actually goes back to 2020, rebuilds 2021 and then compares it across 2022 - all the measures across the year - to a hypothetical rebuilt 2021 population, so it is even more complex.<\/p> <p>  On the point about excluding the one-off measures, I am not really convinced of why the one-off measures are excluded.  That is real money that is going to people and going into their income.  The one-off measures are very significant.  The reason why the budget utilised those one-off measures is because of the broader environment in which the budget was framed, which was extreme unprecedented uncertainty, most obviously in the case of inflation.  To be fair to the ESRI, I watched last week's session and Dr. Karina Doorley said the use of the one-off measures was a good solution in the face of the level of uncertainty in which the budget was framed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt McGann"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Is it fair to say, though, taking into account the projected level of inflation, particularly because a lot of the once-off measures will have an impact shortly, that, as we head into next year, after the bump people will get from the one-off measures, the ESRI's assessment will be correct, that is, that people will see income losses and that certain groups, particularly vulnerable ones, will be worse off, notwithstanding the fact that the ESRI says exactly what has been said here, that is, that initial-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#F00100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I do not think it is totally accurate to say that because what the ESRI said is that the welfare increases in 2022 and 2023, together with the one-off measures, are large enough to leave the lowest income households better off, on average, than they would have been had welfare payment rates risen in line with inflation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt McGann"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I accept the point about the ESRI's comments but, overall, it was quite positive about the Government's response cushioning the lowest deciles.

In our response we stripped out the once-offs and redid the analysis for next year and the welfare package for 2023 was found to be progressive.  For the lowest decile, we found that there would be a gain of about 3.7%, down to about 2.9% for the third decile.  However, I take the point made about that landing in people's pockets.

The point which the Opposition makes and which the Government sort of acknowledges is that we would be better off phasing out and moving away from those schemes and that if we had our own housing stock, we would be able to start to reduce reliance on the HAP, RAS and leasing payments.

Within those, we are trying to bring greater transparency to what is happening on an underlying basis, as Mr. McGann talked about earlier, in respect of GGB*, GNI*, etc.  We take these concerns on board.  We are always trying to improve upon transparency and get that balance right.  It is a wide audience, which includes the public, Deputies, the media and academics.  However, as I say, when one looks at some of the boxes and tables within the economic fiscal outlook, they are very much designed to walk people through some of the very technical issues facing the economy at the moment.

The amount of money involved in the budget can be overwhelming.  When you read documents and reports, you get confused.  I am concerned when Revenue bring forward a set of figures that are different from the Department's set of figures and are working from a different base.  There needs to be common approach to how reporting is done, be it from Revenue or somewhere else.<\/p> <p>  To pick up on Deputy Boyd Barrett's point about the breakdown of particular spends, when the witnesses say we are spending so much on housing and there is a top-line figure, underneath that a breakdown is there before budget day.  I presume it is not the case that they are picking a figure and try to match figures to it afterwards.  It is there beforehand.  There is a scientific proposition regarding this.  It is important that as a budgetary oversight committee, we see more of how things are done.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the capital cost under-runs last year and the year before and how they are accounted for, do they just go back into the pot and we start afresh the following year?  In the past couple of years, we have underspends.  We might have overspends given inflation.  How does the Department track that going through the year or going through the process?  For example, in the area of housing, does it get a quarterly report from every local authority setting out what they spent?  Does it get reports from any Department regarding how money is being spent?  Is it being tracked or does the Department wait until the end of the year when the all the receipts are in?  How is that done and how is that accounted for?  If there is a programme of works to be done and there is expenditure to go with it, if the expenditure is not coming up to what it should be in the projections, obviously the programme has fallen behind and perhaps corrective action could be taken during the course of the year rather than leaving it and finding out it has fallen short.  I do not know how that can be done.  <\/p> <p>  When Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy was here last week, he spoke about how a &euro;20 increase for those on a fixed income should have been a baseline, as opposed to an increase of &euro;12.50.  The &euro;20 increase was to meet inflation.  He said this was a missed opportunity.  What is the Department's attitude towards the linking of social welfare payments and inflation, setting a baseline and working from there so that every year, the increases will be in line with inflation to keep living standards level with inflation as opposed to people falling behind?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#H00300","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I will deal with the question on capital.

The &euro;12 was taken in that context - that it is not just a rate increase that was provided.

This was discussed at the committee in February.  As Ms Connors said, it is not simple.   It can quite complex.  The first question concerns whether you are indexing to wages or to inflation.  Indexing to wages looks more natural when you are thinking about the tax system because if wages are moving up, people are moving up into higher brackets.  Indexing to wages allows people on social welfare to maintain parity with people with paid income whereas indexing to prices allows them to maintain their purchasing power.  Even if you index to wages, it is a question of what is the appropriate metric to use.  The ESRI uses compensation of employees but this is like a wage bill for the entire economy.  That has numbers in it.  It is impacted by the number of people at work, which is not necessarily the same thing as people's rate of pay - weekly earnings that have hours or hourly earnings.  There is still the question of whether you are using projections or a figure from the previous year.  If you are using projections, obviously they can be higher or lower if you over-compensate and the figures come in lower.<\/p><p>I believe a suggestion was made at the committee that it could be retracted the following year by giving a lower amount to balance it out, which, from a political economy perspective, might not be as easy as in theory.  There are also data revisions.  Considerable Irish data are linked to a metric but there can be revisions to the data.<\/p><p> The wider consideration is about flexibility.  The great trade-off is that you lose flexibility in your budgetary policy setting every year.  It might mean the Government of the day has less room to target resources to a particular area to which it wishes to target resources, because this automatic indexation has been locked in.  A relevant example is in the UK where it has had the triple lock on pensions.  A commitment was made that pensions were to rise by whichever was the highest of wages, inflation or - I cannot remember - a hard-wired 2.5% or 3%.  However, the UK has had to walk back from that, and not just because of the considerable volatility of inflation.  Even before the invasion of Ukraine, it had problems with the triple lock because the nature of how employment fell during Covid meant people at the bottom of the income distribution or lower earners more prominently fell out of work.  Arithmetically, that pushed up average wages.  More people who lost work were average earners and the average wage growth became quite large because of a compositional arithmetic issue.  That can be the problem with tying yourself to a specific metric.<\/p><p> It has implications for people's legitimate expectations as well because one of the benefits of automatic indexation is that people have some certainty about what will happen next year.  People were told they have a triple lock which, by its nature, sounds guaranteed but it has not been deliverable due to unexpected circumstances or volatility and inflation and the UK has had to walk back from that.  There are benefits such as certainty but it can be complex.  That should be part of the consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt McGann","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Is there a conflict between increasing social welfare and the lower income workers who feel they would be better off not working because student grants and such like would be easier to get?

We are already up at approximately &euro;14 billion for the year to date and are likely to see record returns again this year.  The Department has done significant work in this area to look at the overall volatility associated with some of those receipts.  We are very mindful of it and that is exactly why the new statistic is being developed as part of the budget this year, GGB*, which I am sure the Deputy has seen.  Mr. McGann's team led a paper to look at that very specific issue to identify excess receipts and build a new statistic of what public finances look like on an underlying basis when some of those windfall receipts are taken away.  We are forecasting a surplus this year of approximately &euro;1 billion.

On the Deputy's specific question, the other point to bear in mind is the extraordinary level of increases in corporation tax receipts we have seen, which have gone from less than &euro;5 billion 2014 to heading above &euro;21 billion this year.  I think the receipts were at &euro;12 billion in 2020.  It has been &euro;12 billion to &euro;15 billion to &euro;21 billion in two years.<\/p> <p>  The other point is the concentration risk.  Half of that is coming from just ten large payers.  We do not know who those payers are, as that is Revenue confidentiality.  However, Revenue identifies that it is not the same ten every year.  We know it changes slightly.  It is a huge concentration risk.  Because corporation tax receipts are now almost 25% of total receipts, that means one in eight of total tax receipts is coming from those ten large payers.  That is not factoring in the income tax that is also associated with those multinationals.<\/p> <p>  On identifying it, that is in firm specifics and we are into confidentiality issues because it is such a small number of firms.  That is why we took a more statistical approach in the paper we did in September.  We can send it on to the committee or I can go through in boring detail how we estimated windfall.  Essentially, the truth is that nobody can definitively say what the quantum of structural or potentially at-risk receipts is, which everybody acknowledges.  We took a suite-of-models approach.  We looked about five or six different ways at the potential windfall and we took the mid-range of those five or six different models.  Based on that, we estimated that from last year&rsquo;s receipts, the windfall could be in the region of &euro;4 billion to &euro;6 billion.  For this year, we are talking about &euro;9 billion and next year &euro;10 billion of receipts that are potentially transient or volatile.  This is where we then remove that new figure and take it out of the budget balance.  Everybody is thrilled to get a new acronym, GGB*, under which, if you take out those windfall receipts, instead of a surplus, we have an &euro;8 billion deficit.  Of course it is great to get these receipts and they are not unwelcome.  However, we have to be cognisant that there are not potential vulnerabilities building up within the public finances.  As I alluded to earlier, that is what happened in the financial crisis, where we had a huge reliance on the property-related receipts.  We lost one third of our tax revenues in two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt McGann"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>We are regularly warned about dependence on or possible flight of the multinational corporations.  Of course, we need to recognise one thing.  First, it is good to have them there and it is a good sign of our economy that they remain and want to remain here.  They will all be hit by international events at present and we need to take that into account.  Things do not go on forever.  We need also to be looking at possible other avenues of revenue we can rely on in the future, not in any way to overlook or minimise the contribution being made by the corporate sector at present, but to recognise we should not depend entirely on it as we did in the case of the construction sector at the time of the crash.  However, that was not the only reason for the collapse at that time.<\/p> <p>  The question always remains that we must have a budgeted balance.  We must spend in a way that is in the national interest, not to live today and let somebody else pick up the tab tomorrow.  It is very responsible of us to recognise that at some stage in the future we might well be asked to take cuts, perhaps as bad as before - I do not know.  That depends on the effect of the war in Ukraine and what happens as a result.  However, the fact is we need to use carefully the funds we have.  We need to ensure we are prudent in our spending and do not borrow to spend.  We had to do it in some circumstances in recent years, but it is to be hoped we will not have to do it anymore.  We should save for unforeseen events as we go along.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  I heard politicians in the House stating repeatedly that we did not need to save and did not need a rainy day fund, that it is raining now so we should spend it now.  That is fine and it sounds good.  However, it will lead to a disaster if we repeat the mistakes of that particular era.  There are always the flowery speeches politicians make and I am sure I make them myself, though I try not to.  The flowery bit might not relevant but the exaggeration might well be.  The point is we need to realise we have to be careful in our dealings in this area and these fragile times in which we live.  We should not try to expect to enter the economy and fund it deliberately to keep people afloat and then do the same the next year and the year following.  That can only be done with the new resources.  It may well have political consequences for those who are in the driving seat at the time, but the fact remains the Government cannot buy its way out of difficulties all of the time.  Anywhere that has happened in the past, it has gone awry.  Look at a place such as Venezuela, which has lots of resources, and the situation it is in now.  We need to be very careful and sound in our economics, recognising and reading the future carefully and taking measures that do not get involved in creating or extending inflation.  We have to pay for our own running costs, as it were.  We have to pay for our own economy insofar as we can, except in extreme emergency.<\/p> <p>  We have to tell the people as we go along that there are easier ways to do it and we can live less frugally and gain more.  That is fine and I have heard all of that before.  I do not want to go apologising to economists all over again about all of the things they said and I said about them in the past.  We need to keep a close, cold and hard eye on reality as we move forward carefully. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#K00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for that.

It was important from a public finances point of view because it gave us the platform and foundation on which we could then support the broader economy through the various measures that were put forward at that time.  Again, because the public finances were in order, the Government had the confidence of the markets behind it.  We still have the confidence of the markets, but that can turn very quickly.  As we have seen elsewhere, that can turn very quickly if a government is not managing those public finances in a coherent and sustainable fashion.  That is ultimately what the Government strategy was about, when you look at we were trying to do at the time of the summer economic statement, SES, in particular, last year.  We had to get that balance right between continued investment in the productive capacity of the economy and putting the public finances on a sustainable trajectory at the same time to prepare the economy to ensure the markets did not turn on us and we were in a stronger position to respond to these types of challenges that we have been facing.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, as the Deputy has seen, they are becoming more and more frequent.

We can provide detail on the individual programmes of work but, in general, all those pieces of work take the same sort of trajectory.  The idea is we want to align expenditure with the outputs we want to achieve and then try to track the changes in those outcomes over time so that we are confident we are using resources and getting the most value for money out of them in making progress.<\/p> <p>  Two streams of work are going on in respect of the well-being budget.  One is looking at the overall national picture and the national well-being indicators that are published on the Central Statistics Office, CSO, website.  We are gathering data on how the country is faring over time as regards those types of outcomes.  We also track expenditure across all the Departments that is targeted at effecting those outcomes.  At present, as the Deputy knows, the budget tells us what Departments got what in the allocation.  We are engaging in a piece of work that will involve tagging all expenditures across all the different Departments to see how much is being spent on each of those wellness areas, including mental and physical health, safety and everything else.  That is the well-being bit.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, with green budgeting, we want to be able to track Ireland's performance as regards how we are faring and to be able to tie that back into how much of the country's resources we are allocating into each of those areas and make that link more explicit.  The benefit of doing that is threefold.  It tends to produce better prioritisation and agenda-setting discussions within Departments.  It also feeds into the whole embedding of evidence into policymaking and the formulation of policy but also how we evaluate it afterwards to make sure we have met policy goals.  Finally, many of the climate change and well-being targets do not live in one Department alone but are across many different Departments.  This sort of performance budgeting framework allows better strategic alignment across Departments that are all working towards the same goal.<\/p> <p>  As I said, if there is any specific information the Deputy wants on any of those programmes, we would be happy to tell her about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#L01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Moran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#L01800","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I do not see anybody raising their hand to come back in.

It is about generally pursuing, for want of a better word, sensible macro fiscal policy, and we have seen in the UK what can happen when you do not, as Mr. Cassidy alluded to earlier.  The problem with market discipline is that it is not linear or uniform.  It can go away and the markets do not seem interested in you, and then it comes back very suddenly and very heavy.  Especially for a small country, that can be really brutal.  We know from our own history that we went into the financial crisis with 25% of debt to GDP, but even the Latvians and Lithuanians, who did not have the kind of financial crisis we had, went in with debt in the 30% or 40% range and got priced out of the market.

This is a simple amendment relating specifically to the board make-up of RT&Eacute;.  When TG4 was established as the all-Irish broadcaster, it was put into law that 100% of the board must be competent in Irish.  RT&Eacute; was established as a bilingual national broadcaster, yet there remain no requirements in place for Irish competency in RT&Eacute;.  RT&Eacute; has obligations to broadcast and provide services in Irish as well as English, and it is clear from the reports from An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga that RT&Eacute; has failed in this regard and failed to fulfil obligations to the Irish language.<\/p><p>Aside from Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta only a tiny fraction of what RT&Eacute; broadcasts is in Irish.  In a 2017 report, An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga said it was less than 1%.  I appreciate things may have improved slightly since 2017 but they have not improved to the degree they need to.  Where content is produced in Irish, reporters are paid less than their counterparts doing the same work in English.  All of this points to RT&Eacute; failing to take seriously its obligation to the Irish language and its obligations as a bilingual broadcaster.  In any other bilingual state it would be expected that the board would at least have a competency in both languages of that state.  That does not exist here.<\/p><p>This amendment would also ensure Irish is an essential requirement for half the membership of the RT&Eacute; board.  They would have to be able to use, speak and communicate in both English and Irish.  It is almost insulting to say we could not find competent people to sit on the board of RT&Eacute;.  Almost 40% of the country has some level of Irish.  It would be very insulting to say we could not find talented, experienced and skilled people who are competent in the Irish language to take up a position on that.  By not ensuring the board is competent in Irish, we are in turn failing to ensure the Irish language itself and the Irish-speaking community are understood and represented at board meetings.  There is a risk of the same problems that have happened in the past reoccurring in future.  I again refer to the 2017 report.  RT&Eacute; stands for Raidi&oacute; Teilif&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann and not the Irish television station.  Those who use the Irish language on a daily basis have a very realistic expectation we ensure that, at the very top of that organisation, there are people at board level who are competent and able to communicate effectively in the Irish language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#B00900","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the amendment.

This is not just deeply hurtful and exclusionary to the people of those Six Counties, whether they are Irish citizens or not, who want to enjoy and participate in RT&Eacute; services and the momentous occasions the same people South of the Border have the opportunity to do.

Acquisition of rights to sporting events are a commercial matter between a rights-holder or sports body and broadcasters.  These are very often allocated on an exclusive territorial basis and, as such, it is not possible to legislate for and compel RT&Eacute; to make such events available.  Examples of such events might include the World Cup or the Olympics.<\/p> <p>  I understand the frustration of viewers in Northern Ireland when certain events may not be shown on RT&Eacute; in Northern Ireland given the distribution of rights to those events.

RT&Eacute; shall ensure that no worker is paid more for the same amount and form of work to produce content in the English language as a worker is paid to produce content in the Irish language.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>The amendment pertains to what many see as a particularly gross and offensive situation that has been allowed to develop.  In many ways it meets the definition of &quot;discrimination&quot;.  Workers at Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta are being paid up to 25% less than their counterparts in English at RT&Eacute; Radio for the same work.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  I understand that the committee has tried to raise this matter directly with RT&Eacute; but has yet to receive any form of a proposed solution.  It is quite disgraceful that despite this specific injustice having been raised, no solution or offer of a solution has come.  Deputy Munster raised the matter back in January when RT&Eacute; was undertaking a review into different pay grades and representatives from RT&Eacute; said they would not examine the difference in pay based on working in Irish or English.  It is frankly appalling that this has been allowed drag on.  It is a basic matter of workers' rights and the equality of workers who work in Irish, which in reality often involves more work than those operating through the English language.  Irish language reporters may have to translate items or prepare and support interviewees with little Irish, while competing with an English language service that often has more traction, investment and resources.  Effectively, the Irish language reporters are doing more work than their English language counterparts but are getting less pay.  This sends a stark message to those who would like to work through the Irish language that they will be valued less and that Irish is not seen as a skill but as a burden.  All Irish language workers could do their work through English as well, meaning that they are more skilled than their counterparts.  Instead of being rewarded for that additional skill and the additional work, they are penalised for it.  If we are serious about attracting young people into careers that involve the Irish language, this fundamental issue needs to be addressed and resolved.  Regardless of what language a journalist is working in, the quality of their work should determine their rate of pay.  There should be nothing controversial about the amendment.  It is a basic workers' rights issue and it is one we have an opportunity to fix.  We have an opportunity to make sure this does not happen to anybody else working in this area, be it in the Irish language or English.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#D00600","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":303,"content":"<p>This amendment would introduce obligations regarding the rates of pay for RT&Eacute; employees.

The amendments also empower the commission to make rules requiring interactive guides to support such prominence.  The amendments seek to empower the Irish speakers using these guides and to ensure they have their right to engage with interactive guides in their own language respected in law.  Interactive guides like TV guides and iPlayer catalogues - the Minister mentioned Sky, Virgin and so on - are there to make life easier.  People can see what is on and pick what they want to watch, but for Irish speakers the only option is in a different language.  There is a compellability factor there that we really should consider.<\/p><p>The commission, as the new regulator that ensures public service content is given prominence on these guides, should have the power to make rules as to what prominence is needed in the public interest, particularly when it comes to the Irish language.  Our media is dominated by English.  The vast majority of programmes on our televisions and of what we hear on the radio is in English.  We need to strike a balance in that regard.  We need almost to rebalance that to give Irish prominence for Irish-speaking communities in order that when we click onto our TV guide or a catalogue of shows, the option to receive it in Irish or in English is available.  Every one of us in this room has that option already when it comes to accessing our emails.  We can access our Oireachtas emails in Irish or in English.  The technology is there to do that.  The vast majority of us may opt for one language, but the potential for the other is there.  As a country, we are committed to ensuring that people use and learn Irish in order that it becomes part of our daily lives, and the media serve a vital role in that regard.  We all remember back to our secondary school days, when, if we were learning a foreign language, we were often shown a programme with subtitles in French, for example, as well as the audio being in French.  If we could move towards that scenario for Irish, it would go some way to assisting those seeking to learn it and those who are in school to encourage them to become more fluent in the language.  Amendments Nos. 98 and 99 would empower the commission to make rules as to how Irish-language content should be prominent on those interactive guides.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 100 is slightly different because it deals with the devices.  If it is okay to mention one television brand by name, with Philips TVs, in the menu one can choose to set up the television in Irish, so the technology is available.  What we need to ensure is that the use of that technology is encouraged among the other providers of televisions.  That could greatly help learners.  It also creates an environment in which Irish becomes immersive and a language in its own right that people use day to day because it is then almost constantly in their world.  I understand that an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh had proposed other amendments around subtitling and audio descriptions being included in both languages.  I saw that as a very positive step, and I say that as somebody who has very little Irish and is busy learning at the moment.  Having more exposure to Irish in various forums assists immensely with that.  It also assists those who are currently Irish speakers and who may have disabilities.

I will tell the commission to deal with this as a matter of priority but it is also about dealing with it on an EU-wide basis.  In May, the European Commission launched a new European strategy for a Better Internet for Kids.  The strategy is built on three pillars - child protection in the online environment; digital empowerment; and active participation.  Under the child protection pillar, there is a strong focus on providing age-appropriate online experiences, which the amendment is trying to address, including through age verification and age-appropriate design.  In this regard, the Commission commits to facilitating a comprehensive code of conduct on age-appropriate design by 2024 using the provisions of the DSA, which provides that such codes of conduct may be co-regulatory instruments.  The Commission has indicated that the code could provide for age verification for accessing certain online content.  To facilitate age verification, the Commission has committed to work with member states and EU standardisation to strengthen effective age verification methods.  This would be most effective if it was done on a Europe-wide basis and that is why we need to wait.  There is a pilot as well called euCONSENT.<\/p><p>I think I have mentioned the pilot to the Deputy previously during Question Time or at the committee.

Policy regarding employment rights is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and is more appropriately dealt with in employment legislation.  The amendment is also straying into matters which may be more appropriate to the functions of the Workplace Relations Commission.  In particular, section 11(1)(d) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 provides that the WRC shall \"conduct reviews of, and monitor developments as respects, workplace relations\".  I would be wary of any provision that might have the effect of duplicating the work of the WRC.  I understand the intention of the amendment.  The protection of workers' rights is an important consideration in all sectors, including the sectors which are regulated by the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I also acknowledge the concerns raised by Deputies regarding working conditions in the technology sector.  Last year, the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment heard evidence from trade unions, experts and content moderators regarding their working conditions.  The evidence pointed to issues regarding the pay and conditions of content moderators and some of the dangers inherent in the practice of hiring employees through outsourcing firms.  One of the witnesses, a former content moderator, set out the very difficult nature of the work involved, as Deputy Mythen noted, and in particular the kinds of distressing content that she was required to view as part of the role. <\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste also addressed the committee and stressed the duty of care that employers have towards employees to create a safe working environment.  He also indicated to the Chair of the committee that he had written to a particular technology company about the terms and conditions of content moderators and indicated that it would be on the agenda when he spoke to the company again. <\/p> <p>  It is important to stress that the protection of workers&rsquo; rights is not a core function of my Department or its agencies.  It is important that our employment rights framework, which is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, places consistent rules and obligations on employers in all sectors of the economy.<\/p> <p>  Moving responsibility for workers&rsquo; rights to sectoral regulators would dilute the enforcement of the overarching framework and potentially lead to an inconsistent approach between sectors.  In that regard, the role of an coimisi&uacute;n, as an independent regulatory body, is ultimately to enforce new and updated regulatory frameworks for content regulation across broadcasting, video-on-demand and designated online services.  It is not intended to regulate employment relations or assess working conditions. <\/p> <p>  As a general principle, in considering any amendments to expand the functions of an coimisi&uacute;n I am very conscious of not unduly expanding the scope of an coimisi&uacute;n into other areas of policy, with the effect that its core functions, which I have just outlined, might suffer or that it might duplicate the functions of other bodies in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#G01700","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":372,"content":"<p>We are asking for a code to be produced.

It would create a dual effect of not only protecting young and vulnerable Irish speakers, in particular, from online abuse, but also doing away with the excuse from wealthy companies that benefit from our generous tax regime that they cannot host Irish language content or advertisements because they do not have the resources to ensure the content meets their own standards.<\/p><p>This is a case of large corporations choosing to censor advertisements and other content in the Irish language over free speech and language rights of Irish speakers.  That should not be allowed in a bilingual state trying to promote Irish.<\/p><p>If the content is inappropriate or contrary to the host's code of conduct, one should ban it but one should not ban it simply because it is in the Irish language and the host does not have the moderators to ensure that it meets its standards.<\/p><p>We live in an online world.  Most people's social life has some form of other language included in it.  It is shameful to see that being denied to Irish speakers.  The amendment would ensure that comes to a halt.  I reiterate the irony of that one particular company that promotes an online translation service not being in a position to moderate its own content in the Irish language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#H00500","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":378,"content":"<p>The amendment has two purposes.

There is also a very real difficulty around the exit procedures from some subscription services.  I cannot be the only person in this room who remembers the premium ringtones from the 1990s and the horror that ensued when trying to cancel those subscriptions.  That triggered legislation in other jurisdictions which we benefited from, thankfully.  However, it is still an issue.  It was actually highlighted on RT&Eacute;'s &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot; show a number of months ago as an issue.  Whether it is an online subscription or a subscription to an app, the issues remain the same.  On the face of it, these monthly fees and charges can be quite minimal so they almost slip past people's attention when they appear on their bank statements, but they do have an overall and cumulative damaging impact on people's finances.  That is why protections are needed.<\/p><p>What we are proposing is to replicate section 17602 of the Business and Professions Code of the State of California.  It would ensure people receive an adequate warning of an impending fee increase, and it would also make it easier to cancel a subscription online with the press of a button.  The principle is that it should, in fact, be as easy to unsubscribe as it is to subscribe in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#K01900","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the amendment.

This amendment will add existing offences from the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 relating to online flashing to the schedule of offence-specific harmful online content in the Bill.  This amendment will enable the online safety commissioner to make binding online safety codes that will apply to designated online service providers that will require those providers to take measures to tackle online flashing.  Without this amendment, online safety codes could not specifically refer to this type of harmful content online and an coimisi&uacute;n would not be able to require online service providers to tackle it in terms of how they deal with complaints, how they deliver content and in terms of risk and impact assessments.  These codes will apply to online services designated by an coimisi&uacute;n on the basis of risk assessments and may include social media services, messaging services and videoconferencing services.  It will remain the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate allegations of criminal behaviour.

I share Deputy Munster's concern particularly because of the arena we are speaking about.  It is not face to face but virtual, which has connotations.  I will give a very simple example.  A message delivered face to face is often interpreted differently than it would be if delivered by text.

The regulatory framework provided within this Bill is strong and well-intentioned.  However, I have an issue with the specific language under Chapter 5, section 139ZT of the Bill regarding a notice to end contravention, which outlines a criminal liability for senior managers and directors of companies where they fail to intervene in removing harmful online content.  I believe Digital Business Ireland has written to all of us on this specific language issue.  This section of the Bill provides that a senior manager or director can be held liable for any offence proven to be committed by &quot;any neglect&quot; rather than &quot;wilful neglect&quot; of their duties.  This has the potential for some very severe prosecutions for what potentially could be an unintentional error.  As a result of this offence, a director or senior manager would be liable for fines of up to &euro;500,000 or ten years in prison.  I put forward that the term &quot;any neglect&quot; in this section of the Bill should be replaced by &quot;wilful neglect&quot;, which would refer to negligence on the part of a senior manager or director that is deemed to be intentional or reckless and reflects a &quot;couldn't care less&quot; attitude.  The use of &quot;wilful&quot; versus &quot;any&quot; neglect in this section underlines the seriousness and strengthens the nature of the offence committed.<\/p><p>Looking at case law and other legislation addressing crimes of a serious nature such as this, we will not see the term, &quot;any neglect&quot;, used in place of &quot;wilful neglect&quot;.  The Minister might clarify if that is the case.  For example, wilful neglect is the standard applied in respect of corruption offences under the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018.  It is also there in the context of aiding and abetting of certain fraud offences under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Act 2021, and in references to certain money laundering or terrorist financing offences under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, to name but a few.  By inserting &quot;any&quot; instead of &quot;wilful&quot; neglect into this important legislation we are therefore moving away from Irish law.  We should question why this departure is taking place in this instance.<\/p><p>There is a distinct difference between the two phrases.  While there is a lack of specific Irish case law that underlines this distinction, the UK Court of Appeal distinguished &quot;any neglect&quot; from &quot;wilful neglect&quot;, stating that wilful neglect requires the defendant to be aware of the breach and still turn a blind eye.  On the other hand, &quot;any neglect&quot; could relate to an entirely inadvertent error on the part of a director or senior manager.  This distinction was also noted by the Law Reform Commission of Ireland in chapter 9 of its report, Regulatory Powers and Corporate Offences.  Significantly, the Law Commission for England and Wales in a similar paper, Criminal Liability in Regulatory Contexts, also concluded that the &quot;any neglect&quot; standard should never be used for serious criminal offences.<\/p><p>It is also important to emphasise that this offence will place a category one offence in the Bill, which is one of the most serious offences contained within it.  Individuals should not be exposed to such offences due to &quot;any neglect&quot; on their part, rather, deliberate or wilful neglect must take place.<\/p><p>I am conscious that I would like to see future-proofing of the Bill, especially for online social media companies.  For example, Meta is now building what it describes as the metaverse, a concept many of us cannot even understand.  If we strengthen this Bill to ensure that the phrase &quot;any neglect&quot; rather than &quot;wilful neglect&quot; is in it, we could tie up our courts for years with philosophical debates about what constitutes neglect rather than wilful intent.  I want to create a scenario where there is not a get-out-of-jail free card for social media companies that would have volumes of lawyers behind them debating the philosophical concept of &quot;any&quot;.  Let us strengthen the Bill by including intent.  If a social media company and its directors, for example, become aware of an issue, they have to enforce and act upon it.  However, we are talking about this Bill being with us for the next ten, 20 or 50 years, potentially.  We do not know what these technologies look like, but we know what intent looks like.  That is why I want to remove &quot;any&quot; and include &quot;wilful&quot;.  Somebody should be held accountable by the courts for an act they are responsible for but as we move to future technologies we are not aware of, we cannot legislate for that yet.  That is why intent must be placed in the Act.  I would love to hear the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#N03700","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":736,"content":"<p>As the Deputy said, this amendment seeks to replace the words &ldquo;any neglect&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;the consent or connivance of, or to have been attributable to any neglect&rdquo; in the provisions for senior management liability, where a provider of a designated online service commits an offence for failing to comply with a notice to end a contravention.<\/p> <p>  I understand that some industry stakeholders have raised concerns that the liability standard of &ldquo;any neglect&rdquo; is too low and have sought to replace it with &ldquo;wilful neglect&rdquo;.  I cannot accept this amendment for a number of reasons.  It is important to note that the senior management liability provisions in the Bill can only be triggered as part of the following series of steps: an authorised officer investigation has been carried out; coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n has determined that a contravention is occurring; the findings of an coimisi&uacute;n have been confirmed by a court; an coimisi&uacute;n has determined that a contravention is still occurring and has issued a notice to the provider of the designated online service to end the contravention; the provider of the designated online service has failed to comply with the notice and is being prosecuted for the offence by the Director of Public Prosecutions; and the Director of Public Prosecutions, independently to an coimisi&uacute;n, seeks to prosecute a director or senior manager under the secondary liability provision.  In this context, I think &ldquo;any neglect&rdquo; is appropriate.  It was provided for in this way in light of, on the one hand, the extensive financial sanctioning powers in the Bill and, on the other, the need to provide a particular balance in a Bill that deals with media, user-generated content and fundamental rights such as freedom of expression.<\/p> <p>  For context, I understand, and the Deputy raised this matter in his contribution, there are almost 1,500 references to the same liability standard in Irish law so this is not unique.  In this Bill, in fact, the circumstances provided for wherein senior management liability may be triggered are quite narrow.  Recent examples of its usage include the sanctions on Russia in light of its illegal invasion of Ukraine, building regulations, protected disclosure legislation, food safety regulations, domestic violence law and childcare laws.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referenced the UK's Law Commission report, but Ireland's Law Reform Commission report, Regulatory Powers and Corporate Offences, stated that this specific form of secondary liability \"does not necessarily result in undue harshness to a defendant, particularly where in a corporate setting the processes and procedures required to meet the standard of negligence are within the peculiar knowledge of the senior managers and comparable agents\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#N03800","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":737,"content":"<p>Okay.

If we have directors of these companies here, I would like to believe we could have Irish directors on their boards.  What is to stop them just relocating elsewhere?  I still believe intent has to be at the source of any law we create.  If somebody is made aware of wrongdoing, they have to respond.

The Bill as published would have restricted the scheme to community sound broadcasters.  This scheme has been under consideration for some time, and I understand may have originated when Deputy Naughten was Minister, a fact I want to acknowledge today.  The scheme formed part of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019 introduced in the Oireachtas by the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, and was subsequently incorporated into this Bill.  Amendment No. 293 inserts a definition of &ldquo;local sound broadcaster&rdquo; in order to give effect to the intention to extend the scheme to local broadcasters.  In practice, the definition of &quot;local&quot; includes any contract for a sound broadcasting service in an area consisting of a part of the State.  Accordingly, I emphasise that the use of term local includes holders of multi-county and regional sound broadcasting licences.  These amendments will ensure that local broadcasters can avail of grant funding to provide training or professional development for persons employed by, or providing services to, the broadcaster in relation to promoting good professional journalistic practices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#O07900","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":816,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":817,"content":"<p>Section 48, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":818,"content":"<p>Section 49 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":819,"content":"<p>SECTION 50<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":820,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 294:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 127, to delete lines 3 to 9 and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo; &ldquo;<b>155A<\/b>.

This is a simple amendment that asks that Irish language journalists are borne in mind when these schemes are being developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#P01500","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":831,"content":"<p>May I reply?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#P01600","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":832,"content":"<p>Of course the Minister can reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#P01700","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":833,"content":"<p>As I said, as part the new schemes we are developing, I have directed my officials to ensure that part of the funding is ring-fenced for journalism in the Irish language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#P01800","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":834,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":835,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 295:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 127, line 5, after &ldquo;to&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;local sound broadcasters and&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#P02000","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":836,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":837,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 296:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 127, line 7, after &ldquo;in&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;local and&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#P02200","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":838,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":839,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 297 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":840,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 298:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 127, line 12, after &ldquo;by&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;local sound broadcasters and&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#P02600","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":841,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":842,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos 299 to 301, inclusive, not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":843,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 302:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 127, line 16, after &ldquo;require a&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;local sound broadcaster or&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#P03400","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":844,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 303:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 127, line 25, after &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;local sound broadcasters and&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#P03600","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":846,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":847,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 304 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":848,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 305:<\/p> <p>  In page 127, line 29, after &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;local or&rdquo;. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#P04000","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":849,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":850,"content":"<p>Section 50, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":851,"content":"<p>Sections 51 and 52 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":852,"content":"<p>SECTION 53<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":853,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 306:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 129, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;<b>Irish Cultural Works<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>159AA<\/b>.

It is important to note that when we talk about supporting Irish music and Irish films, and when we talk about the role of RT&Eacute; or TG4 as public broadcasters having a role in supporting Irish culture, we do so at present with no clear definition of what counts as Irish music or Irish film.  Irish cultural works would be defined in terms of music under the music, artist, performance and lyrics, MAPL, criteria used in Canada for Canadian works.  This means works where the music or lyrics are written by an Irish resident, is performed by an artist resident in Ireland or is recorded in Ireland, regardless of who wrote or performed the music.  This status would be certified by the Arts Council.<\/p><p>In terms of cinema and audiovisual works, an Irish cultural work would be one where at least one of the producers or co-producers is established in Ireland, where the screenplay or script is written by an Irish resident, where at least half the screen time features Irish performers or participants, where the performance is recorded in Ireland or where the Irish language or Irish sign language feature prominently.  They are broad conditions but would provide clarity as to what is meant by an Irish cultural work when certain bodies are expected to support Irish cultural works.  We would also task an coimisi&uacute;n with including a duty towards Irish cultural works when granting licences to television and radio broadcasters.<\/p><p> In subsection (5) we would require an coimisi&uacute;n to produce a report every five years examining the breakdown of use of Irish cultural works to track progress effectively.  An coimisi&uacute;n would also examine options and make recommendations on what sort of content requirements or investment obligations should be used to support Irish cultural works in line with the commitment to cultural diversity under the AVMSD. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#P04500","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":855,"content":"<p>We all strongly support measures to support the works of Irish artists and the creation of Irish art.

This year, I launched the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, which will support 2,000 artists over three years.<\/p> <p>  However, the proposed amendment appears to be contrary to European Union law.  The proposed criteria for Irish cultural works offered in the amendment includes residence on the island of Ireland and supervision or control by producers on the island of Ireland.

There is a potentially large outstanding catalogue of musical and audiovisual works that would be considered as Irish cultural works under the proposed amendment.

In the event of a rejection of a work for authentication by the council, there would also be a need for an appeals process.

It is the norm in other EU countries to require a percentage of catalogues on streaming sites, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, to be in their national language.  This helps to support domestic industries in line with EU commitments to cultural diversity.  It also helps to protect their national language community against the encroaching dominance of English language productions.  I am sure at some point all of us have watched a very dark Nordic programme and enjoyed it immensely.<\/p><p>Ireland is a special case in this regard.  English is the dominant language here and our market is flooded with films and shows from Britain and America.  This makes it difficult for Irish productions to compete or gain a foothold at home.  However, we understand that setting percentage requirements for English language productions would not combat this.  At a time when we have a national language, Irish, which is spoken by 40% of the population according to the 2016 census, we also have a special duty to restore that language nationally and to ensure Gaeltacht communities are not further pushed into speaking English, which we see happening day by day, and in their viewing of television or streaming services.  Requiring a small percentage of content to be in the Irish language and for prominence to be given to such content on screening sites with viewers and subscribers in Ireland, in the way that there is different content in France or Italy, would go a long way to grow the language and encourage use beyond what it has achieved so far.<\/p><p>We have seen worldwide phenomena when shows in languages other than English break through globally on streaming platforms such as &quot;Squid Game&quot; from South Korea or &quot;Borgen&quot;, which was in Danish.  It adds to the self-respect and prestige of these languages internationally for both the speakers and learners at home and abroad.  We know that Irish language content can be, and is, produced to the highest quality.  An array of award winning and internationally acclaimed films in Irish have hit our screens in recent years.<\/p><p>We could develop and build on that quite effectively through investment from streaming sites, not to mention the exposure to our diaspora but to our young people in Ireland for whom these platforms are their main way of accessing shows and films.  We are proposing a modest 5% by 2030, which will give ample time to achieve that percentage either through production investment or purchasing works in Irish, all of which benefit the sector and the workers here.  That would be increased to 10% by 2035.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 308 deals with ensuring Irish language works are prominent in these online catalogues, highlighted on someone's home page and through the algorithms the online streaming services utilise.  This is about normalising Irish and encouraging and celebrating the language.  It is about empowering people through those new and emerging technologies.  We have all changed how we consume our television watching and can engage with the language at our own pace.

The European Commission has published guidelines for member states regarding the method of calculating the share of European works in the catalogue of a video-on-demand service.  Under section 159B(3) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, it will be for an coimisi&uacute;n to make rules to determine whether video-on-demand services meet the European works quota.  I expect it will be heavily informed by the guidance of the European Commission in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that some member states have provided for a minimum quota for native language works in catalogues of video-on-demand services.  For example, I understand that the legal instrument providing for the European works requirement in France, published last summer, included a requirement that 40% of works should be in the French language, subject to agreement between individual services and the French audiovisual regulator.<\/p> <p>  In the Irish context such a requirement is complicated by two factors.  First, there is a relatively small catalogue of audiovisual works in the Irish language as a percentage of all audiovisual works in other languages.  We are attempting to address this through increased funding for TG4 and initiatives such as Cine4, which, of course, funded the beautiful \"An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in\", but there is still much work to be done.  I understand that the amendment sets out to partially address this by pushing out the imposition of a quota to 2031 and 2036, respectively.  However, there remains the risk that a perverse effect of the amendment would be to force video-on-demand services to provide a relatively smaller catalogue to meet the 5% and 10% quotas.  This would not be to the benefit of audiences.<\/p> <p>  The second factor is the number of video-on-demand services that will be regulated in Ireland.  Under the country-of-origin principle, those services established in Ireland would be regulated in Ireland for the entire EU.  As drafted, the amendment would require those services to adopt the Irish language requirements for their catalogues.  While this may have the potential, in the longer run, to be of the benefit to Irish audiences, it would not necessarily be in the interest of audiences in other member states.  I cannot accept the amendment for that reason.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 308 seeks to require an coimisi&uacute;n, in making rules for the promotion of European works, to have regard to \"the prominence of Irish language works in view of the national aim of restoring the Irish language as a spoken language and language of media nationwide\".  Given that I cannot accept amendment No. 307, I also cannot accept this amendment, which is consequential to amendment No. 307.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#Q00600","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":860,"content":"<p>I will withdraw and resubmit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#Q00700","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":861,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":862,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 308 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":863,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 309 to 314, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#R00100","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 309:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 131, line 38, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall, as soon as practicable after the establishment day&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>These amendments are fairly straightforward.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 309 states, &quot;In page 131, line 38, to delete &quot;may&quot; and substitute &quot;shall, as soon as practicable after the establishment day&quot;.&quot;  That is to ensure that the content levy is definitely introduced and that its introduction is swift.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 310 seeks &quot;to delete 'media service providers' and substitute 'producers of European Works'&quot;.

As the committee will be aware, Article 13.2 of the AVMSD provides an explicit legal basis for member states to levy media service providers that are under their jurisdiction or that are not under their jurisdiction but are targeting audiences in their territories for the purpose of funding European works.  I have opted to take the opportunity offered by Article 13.2 of the directive to provide for the imposition of a content production levy on media service providers to fund content production schemes to support the production of European works.<\/p> <p>  There was a lengthy debate on Committee Stage in the Seanad on both the content production levy and the scheme provisions of the Bill.  I committed then to return to consider a number of matters on the D&aacute;il debate on the Bill.  In particular, I committed to examine whether express provision could be made to ensure that development activities could be funded through a scheme; to examine whether a certain minimum proportion of funds paid out under a scheme could be ring-fenced for \"independent production companies\"; and to examine whether provision could be made in respect of the allocation of rights ownership between independent production companies and media service providers.  The Deputies have raised those three issues in their amendments and I intend to address them on Report Stage.  In addition, as I indicated during the debate in the Seanad, I expect that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n and Screen Ireland will work closely together with a view to maximising the potential of content production schemes.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the detail of the Deputies' amendments, amendment No. 309 seeks to require coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to impose a content production levy as soon as is practicable after establishment day.  As I have said previously, it would not be prudent or advisable to impose a levy until a comprehensive study has been undertaken into the incidence, design and prospective revenue of any content production levy.  That will allow coimisi&uacute;n na mean to identify any unintended consequences that may arise from the levy and to outline clearly whether and how the incidence of the levy will ultimately fall on audiences and consumers of audiovisual media services.  Given the many additional questions about the content production levy that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will need to answer, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  I understand that amendment No. 310 seeks to address a drafting error in the Bill, as published.  It is an intention of the Bill that a content production scheme should be open to all prospective producers of European works.  This error came to the attention of my officials shortly after the Bill was published and it was intended to address the issue when other Government amendments to the content production scheme were brought forward.  Accordingly, while I do not intend to accept the Deputies' amendment today, I will table a Report Stage amendment to correct the error.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the intention of amendment No. 311 is to ensure that funds provided under a content production scheme may be used to support \"development\" activities relating to a production.  At present, section 159F(2)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, specifies a number of development activities that can be supported under a scheme.  My preferred approach would be to amend that paragraph to provide absolute clarity that all stages of the development of an audiovisual programme may be funded under a scheme.  I cannot, then, accept this amendment but will seek to clarify further on Report Stage that a content production scheme may include funding for development activities.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 312 sets out additional detail in respect of the nature of programmes that could be funded under a scheme.  It is unnecessary to specify that a content production scheme may fund feature films, animation, drama and documentaries.  Section 159F(2) provides that a scheme may fund the production of audiovisual programmes, which captures all types of audiovisual content, including drama, films, animation and factual programmes.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 312 also provides that a content production scheme would specifically support works that relate to the works of Irish creative talent.  As I noted during Report Stage in the Seanad, the outstanding and defining quality of such works would appear to be that they are produced by, or involve the work of, Irish citizens.  This carries the implication that those of Irish nationality would be given preference in any funding provided through a content production scheme.  This would appear to be contrary to EU law as it would, on the face of it, place Irish citizens at an advantage over citizens or residents of other member states as regards a content production scheme and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 313 seeks to amend a description of the kinds of audiovisual programmes that may be funded under a scheme by qualifying a reference to the experiences of the people of the island of Ireland such that it refers to \"storytelling\" experiences.  The relevant paragraph of the Bill is intended to encompass experiences in the most expansive sense to facilitate the funding of the widest array of content.  The effect of the proposed amendment would be to restrict the types of content that could be funded and, therefore, I do not intend to accept it.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 314 seeks to require that 80% of the funding under a content production scheme would be ring-fenced for \"independent production companies\" and to provide for the prescription of a fair and equitable balance in rights ownership.  Although I do not intend to accept the amendment, I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage to provide for the ring-fencing of a certain proportion of funding for independent production companies.

The idea is that providers of these services, such as streaming platforms llike Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, will be required to ensure part of their revenue is invested directly into European works, Irish cultural works and works in the Irish language.  France recently reached an agreement with providers in this regard, namely, the DDADUE, which will see tens of millions of euro of new investment result in cultural output in French and job creation opportunities in the process.  Such rules implemented in this State would provide &euro;10 million of investment from one streaming site alone.<\/p><p>We are not setting out with restrictive vision as to how such a model could be implemented in Ireland as we do not believe that we are the experts.  We are instead asking that the commission meet with the stakeholders and produce a report within a year outlining options that the Department produces legislation within another six months of that with a view to implementing investor obligations.  As we have spoken of at length this afternoon, we often hear of things we cannot do due to EU law.  However, this is an example of what we can do under EU law.  It is something that could deliver quite incredible results if we were to do so.  There should not be any delay in seeking benefits for the industry, performers and audience that are enjoyed by other countries.  At the very least, we should be asking for that report to be made available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#S00100","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":871,"content":"<p>The purpose of this amendment is to require coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to carry out research on the introduction of investment obligations on media service providers operating in the State.  The amendment also provides that the Minister shall present draft legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas outlining proposals for the introduction of investment obligations for audiovisual media service providers not later than six months following publication of the report.<\/p> <p>  Before addressing the substance of the proposed amendment, I wish to note that it was determined that a content production levy was the most appropriate approach in the Irish context.  As with the existing sound and vision scheme administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the model envisaged in the Bill would allow producers to compete for funding on a transparent and competitive basis in line with objective criteria.  This would not be the case with investment obligations, where decisions on the nature of content to be funded would sit with the company subject to the investment obligation.  Furthermore, it is not possible under EU law to introduce an investment obligation based on a specific production location within Europe.  Our approach in respect of the content production levy already ensures a minimum of 25% of funds raised must be allocated to the production of Irish language content.  It is also worth noting that any investment obligation would have to be for the production of European works and not necessarily Irish content.  Many major EU-based providers targeting Ireland would likely already fulfil that requirement through their existing investments, so there may not be a substantial net benefit to Ireland from such a measure.<\/p> <p>  I do not propose to accept this amendment as I am of the view that section 7 of the Broadcasting Act as inserted by section 7 of this Bill will contain appropriate provisions to enable an coimisi&uacute;n to carry out research in relation to this matter.  I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to section 7(5)(d), which enables the commission to conduct strategic reviews on a number of matters including the funding of sector.  I also note that the Minister will have the power under this provision to direct an coimisi&uacute;n to carry out research on any matter connected to its functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#S00200","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":872,"content":"<p>I have one supplementary question on that issue.

I also thank members for their general support for the Bill during pre-legislative scrutiny and on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  As members are aware, this is a long and technical Bill.  As well as transposing the enforcement and security provisions of the European electronic communications code, the Bill provides the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, with a new civil enforcement regime and an updated criminal enforcement procedure for the electronic communications sector.  The Bill give the enforcement of the electronic communication security measures a legislative basis.  It also provides for additional consumer protections and makes a number of amendments to the Communications Regulation Act 2002.  The Bill represents the biggest update to the regulation of the electronic communications sector since ComReg's establishment in 2002.  It will provide ComReg with the tools it needs to effectively regulate the sector today, and it will bring its powers further in line with comparable regulators in the State and elsewhere in Europe.  In doing so, it will fulfil a programme for Government commitment.<\/p> <p>  I indicated on Second Stage that I would bring forward an amendment in relation to the Digital Hub Development Agency Act 2003 that would confer a function on the board to dispose of its land and property assets on foot of a directive by the Minister pursuant to the 2003 Act.  I am also bringing forward a number of amendments that are focused on the security of electronic communications networks, specifically dealing with the issue of high-risk vendors, HRVs.  These amendments will set out how a risk assessment will be conducted in alignment with the principles of the EU 5G security toolbox.  Recognising the functions exercised by certain Departments and agencies in respect of national security, the risk assessment will be conducted in consultation with relevant stakeholders across government.  The amendment will also set out how HRVs will be designated, and will provide for ministerial notices to restrict or ban designated vendors on networks as a whole or on specific parts of networks.  ComReg should be tasked with the supervision and enforcement of orders relating to HRVs.  Similar legislation has been implemented in 19 EU member states, with a further five indicating that they are at an advanced stage of preparation.  Likewise, the UK enacted similar provisions recently.<\/p> <p>  I also mentioned on Second Stage the possibility that the Government will bring forward a short amendment to the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 in order to provide for payments to be made to or via An Post, particularly in the context of the provision of support to postmasters.  This amendment is the subject of ongoing engagement with the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p> <p>  Two other short amendments will be brought forward in relation to the alternative dispute resolution, ADR, process outlined in the Bill.  The first is a minor amendment that will broaden the scope of disputes that can be subject to ADR to align with current practice and to better reflect the text of the code.  The second will adjust the scope of the code of practice for complaints to align it with the scope for ADR.  <\/p> <p>  Aside from some further examination and possible modification of the definitions and structure of the Bill as a result of these amendments, some consideration has also been given to whether further amendments are required to the appeals provisions found in Parts 2 and 3.  Legal advice is being sought on this matter.  As these amendments require further development, I put the committee on notice that I hope to bring them forward on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Government amendments put forward today, I will give more explanation for the reasons behind each of them when we reach them.  That concludes my opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022102600002#B01100","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":922,"content":"<p>We will now move to our consideration of the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022102600002#B01200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":923,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":924,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 cannot be moved as it requires a motion of instruction to committee.

In terms of appalling vistas, a judge once dismissed the whole idea of an appalling vista.  He was a very good judge, one of the better ones on the Bench in England and Wales at the time.  Unfortunately, the appalling vista came to pass, so they do happen.  The idea is not to provide powers that enable them to happen.  I see one of the officials finds this entertaining, but I have concerns about the amount of power that this measure gives, not to the Irish security services but to foreign security services.  In Ireland, we have a national security service that barely operates.  We do not have a large international security apparatus.  Some states that do are present in Ireland.  When it suits us, we like to think we are the 51st state of one such state and when it does not suit us, we like to portray the polar opposite.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is very much not a stooge for the American, Chinese or Russian embassies, but there is a possibility that, down the line, there will be Ministers who may be stooges for other powers.  Business and money come into this in a very big way.  A very high-profile trade stand-off is taking place between China and the United States on the development of computer components.  Is it beyond the realms of possibility that national security apparatuses are used, abused and manipulated to further the financial interests of a state?  I believe it is not beyond the realms of possibility.  It is quite likely that that would happen, in particular in western economies when we find ourselves with no resources whatsoever or in a time of a shortage of resources.  The United States less so because the dollar is the fiat currency and the US is not in decline in the way that Europe is.  I am digressing, however.<\/p> <p>  I am saying that there is a strong possibility for abuse.  What the Minister of State is saying is that an order can be made by him or his successors.  The legal person could be Jimmy Browne or an international corporation but let us not pretend that a criminal sanction against a corporation is less of a criminal sanction than one against an individual, unless of course we think corporations are not entitled to fair procedures and natural justice.

That would indicate that this Bill is very broad in its scope and has significant capability to impact upon competition.  We have built a success story internationally around being a place with fair competition, access to the courts and, above all else, transparency.

It contains many very novel propositions.

Who would be in a position to give that information to the Minister of State other than An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I find it difficult to know what information An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or, indeed, any part of our national security apparatus would have on the state of play of semiconductor manufacture in China or how much it is or is not suffering as a result of American measures.  Surely, the only ones who could tell the Minister of State that would be the American security apparatus.  Perhaps the Chinese might want to volunteer that they are actually suffering from this, although I doubt it.  They might want to volunteer that information, however.<\/p> <p>  This whole idea that people will not have the definition and whether it endangers national security is not just about the information itself, but the source of that information.  My concern is for the information the Minister of State might receive, although maybe not him personally because he might have a very critical mind.  There is always the danger that successors will be less inquisitive and critical.  The Minister of State might get lots of information from the American, Chinese, Russian or Israeli Embassies, for example, which might suggest that a vendor's components are sloppy or that a vendor will not be in a position to provide enough of them.  The Minister of State might decide to label somebody a high-risk vendor on the basis of that information.  The vendor then appeals that and goes to the High Court, where the Minister of State says he cannot give the vendor the information he received.  That is not because of what that information is.<\/p><p>It is no particular threat to the security of this State what the state of play of the semi-conductor manufacturing sector in China is.  Rather, a Minister will say that he or she cannot share the information because he or she got it from the British Embassy, the US Embassy or wherever as part of an exchange of information in which confidentiality was assured.  The Minister could give the information to the judge but could not give it to the vendor.  The idea is that we will differentiate between what is and is not national security, yet all of the information the Government is going to rely on is going to come from external sources.  Let us be real, in that we do not have a sufficiently large international intelligence service.  Most of the espionage networks operating in this country are not here because they are worried about what the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, plans to do with the Army any time soon.  They are here to figure out what companies are doing.  A great deal of espionage is based around companies and competition, including competition between states.  There is a distinct possibility that someone in the Minister of State's shoes could in future fall prey to that and make decisions that could not be challenged in an open court.  It is unusual for High Court sittings to be held in private, although they are held in private in family law cases.

These provisions will provide that extant decisions relating to ComReg's current alternative dispute resolution process continue as appropriate under the new regime and that disputes that are pending at the time of the new provisions coming into operation are preserved.  To do this, amendments Nos. 17 and 18 will insert a new definition of &quot;Universal Service Regulations&quot; into the interpretations section relating to Part 4 of the Bill.  Section 39, inserted by amendment No. 19, will ensure that a dispute that is before ComReg or an independent person nominated by ComReg under regulation No. 27 can continue as if those regulations had not been repealed.<\/p><p>While the Bill will make worthy amendments to the current regime, it is also important to provide explicit transitional provisions to address extant disputes that are currently with ComReg, or an independent person, for resolution under that regulation to ensure no consumer's dispute inadvertently fell in the transition between the old dispute resolution regime and the new alternative dispute resolution regime established by the Bill.<\/p><p> A new section 40 inserted by amendment No. 20 will ensure that a measure enforced pursuant to regulation No. 27 can continue in force under Part 4.  Under regulation No. 27, ComReg took a number of measures to better implement the regime, including specifying requirements concerning operators' codes of practice for complaint handling and specifying the procedures for dispute resolution, as any measure taken by ComReg requires consideration, consultation with stakeholders and finalisation.  If these measures were allowed to lapse, it would take considerable time for replacement measures to be put in place.  This would, in turn, delay the effectiveness of the regime for consumers.  At present, without this transitional provision, there could be a potential query over whether these measures remain extant under the new regime established by the Bill after the universal service regulation has been repealed by the 2022 regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022102600002#H05300","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":1177,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1178,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 18:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 23, after line 35, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo; &ldquo;Universal Services Regulations&rdquo; means the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and Users&rsquo; Rights) Regulations 2011 (S.I.
