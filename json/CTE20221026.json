I will focus for the next few minutes on where we have come from and where we are today with regard to Lough Funshinagh.<\/p> <p>  Lough Funshinagh, as Mr. Fallon said, was and is classified as a turlough and is referred to as Ireland's disappearing lake.  Its sudden disappearance can take as little as two days and can happen every four or five years.  The last disappearances of the lough were in 1986 and 1996.  Surface catchment contributes to the inflow of the lake.  The lake measures about 38.8 sq. km and, until the time it expanded due to flooding, had a maximum coverage of 600 acres, increasing to more than 1,300 acres in 2021, so it is twice the size it was.  It is also a special area of conservation.<\/p> <p>  I will take the committee down through the years, particularly from 2016 to 2021 because that is when the flooding really started, and it has not reduced to any great extent since.  In 2016 the lough reached a record high.  The first home was under threat, with 6,000 sandbags trying to keep a foot of water at bay.  Two pumps, one pumping 50,000 gallons of water an hour, were manned 24-7 by volunteers working four-hour shifts.<\/p><p>In 2016, the previous high water record set in 1995 was surpassed by about 1.2 m and a huge earth bund containing about 2,000 tonnes of earth was erected in Ballagh, which is one of the affected villages, in an effort to withhold water and prevent flooding.  Despite an exceptionally dry winter in 2016-17 water levels remained significantly high and remained above normal levels.  This is turn results in a higher base when moving forward into each successive year.  Public roads were raised at that time by 1.2 m in places and the building of flood defences continued unabated.<\/p><p> I will move on to 2018 when the then Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, proposed a pipe be installed to bring the excess water to the Shannon.  The Lough Funshinagh flood relief scoping study commenced in October of that year.  However, in 2019 there was a lot of frustration because the scoping study was quite slow, but it came to fruition after approximately ten months.  The report suggested that a pipe to Lough Funshinagh was possible.<\/p><p> I refer members to slides 5 and 6 to see photographs of the flooding when it started in 2016.  Farmyards began to be encroached by water.  Two hay sheds are shown in the photographs.  On slide 6 members will see a farmyard completely covered with water.  The public road in front of the gate is also completely covered and it was not operational for quite a few months.  The public road to an entire village had to be closed off and another access and exit route identified.  In 2020, there was heavy rainfall.  Calls persisted for an overflow pipe all summer.  Lough Funshinagh was then 2 m higher than in August 2019 and from an observational perspective - I do not unfortunately have any hard data - there was devastation of the local flora, fauna and the habitat that was once the hallmark of Lough Funshinagh.  It was no longer recognisable.  Pumps and sandbags replaced what were once beautiful landscaped gardens in the village of Ballagh.  Slide 8 shows photographs of pumps in front of the houses, sandbags, etc.<\/p><p> I will move on to the village on the other side of Lough Funshinagh.  Members will see two photographs of the entrance to a farmyard in lower Lisphelim on slide 9.  The farmyard and the entrance to the farmyard are completely covered with water.  Hay sheds were gutted with water.  I ask members to observe the difference between the two photographs.  In one the water is perfectly clear.  After a while it goes completely muddy.  Imagine that going into your farmyard.  This gentleman's house is beside and to the left of the shed and the septic tank was also flooding.  The public road along lower Lisphelim was completely cut off as members will see from the next photographs which show two roads completely covered by the over-swelling lough.<\/p><p> In winter 2021, waters were rising daily and edging closer and closer to the homes and farmyards.  More pumps were activated to try to keep the water at bay and were at full force outside some of the homes in Ballagh.  This was the situation in January with three months of rain still expected.  The roads had been raised by a further metre.  They were going up each year, reaching a rise of two metres - or 6.6 ft which I understand more - notably in Ballagh and the village of Lisphelim.  The CEO of Roscommon County Council called on the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, OPW, to provide funding for an overflow pipe to prevent worsening floods and flood damage and to remove excess water.  Needless to say there were truly heartbreaking scenes in Ballagh at the time.<\/p><p> In the spring of 2021, Lough Funshinagh was at the highest level ever recorded, measuring at least 3 m above the highest average winter level.  By that time one house had been destroyed by flooding and pumps prevented three further homes from flooding.  An order was signed in June by the CEO of the county council for flood relief measures to commence immediately under the Local Authorities (Works) Act 1949.  In August, legal action was taken by Friends of the Irish Environment, FIE, and the council vowed to defend the project in court at that stage.  FIE however successfully applied to the High Court to have plans for an overflow pipe quashed.  Locals appealed to FIE to drop the case.  The project was withdrawn by the council amidst much fear in the local communities.<\/p><p> In October, the CEO of the county council signed a new order under the Emergency Powers Act to remove excess water from Lough Funshinagh.  In December, a further legal challenge to the councils relief plans was brought by FIE in court on 21 December seeking an injunction to stop the works.  FIE secured that injunction preventing any further construction works taking place until the matter was fully determined by the courts.  However, at the court hearing in March the judge upheld the injunction pending a full judicial review.  However, the county council did not have the means to proceed with the judicial review.  The decision and its outcome and conclusion left everyone in the villages devastated.<\/p><p> It is important I run through the slide about 2022.  The county council called on the Government to cover the significant legal bill and wrote to ask that four issues be considered.  It called on the Government to cover the significant legal bill facing the council following the High Court action by FIE; called on the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, to intervene on behalf of the council to progress the stalled work and any future emergency plans; requested that the Government repeal the lake's designation as a turlough and as an EU habitat site, arguing the lake no longer fits the characteristics of a turlough; and requested that the planning regulation be amended and clarity given on the Local Authorities (Works) Act to allow works to be conducted to save the homes by the lake in the future.  It argued that these classifications, along with formal guidance, would help the council respond to future emergency works and urged the Government to progress reform of judicial reviews and legal costs.<\/p><p> On the next few slides, members will see more houses that were flooded by the water as recently as a couple of years ago.  It is important to focus on slide 16.  Members will see the same house in three different situations.  The first photograph shows it as it was many years ago prior to 2016.  The second photograph was taken after it had been invaded by water although the water had dried.  In the last photograph members will see a house that was saved from Lough Funshinagh flooding in 2016 but is now in the process of demolition.  The digger was supposed to arrive last week to finish the process.  The local community had gathered in support of the owners, the O'Meara family, but were left standing in the rain looking at what was a home for many years and now does not have a roof or windows.  Floors have been removed and the rain, wind and the day were battering the shell.  At the back of what was once a beautiful home are the remnants of family living and a massive earth embankment built in the hope of protection from the flooding.  Alas this was not to be.  A basic human right surely, is the right to have a home, to be able to live in a home, to not be forced out of one's home due to flooding that could have been prevented.  We hope not to see any more unnecessary evictions or relocations.  This is not what the community wants.  This is the first demolition and we hope it will be the last.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>That was a very disturbing presentation and those last three photographs, as Ms Murray said, show a lovely family home completely destroyed by flooding with water coming into the house.

I am from the townland of Ballagh where my family has lived for several generations.  I would like to talk about the impact of Lough Funshinagh flooding on the farming community living around the lake.  I propose to deal with the issue from two points of view.  They are the financial implications and the humanitarian impact.  The farming community has suffered significant financial losses, in agricultural production losses and agricultural policy payments.  I will give an example of production losses from my own case.  With a reduction of <i>circa<\/i>30 acres for the entirety of the past six years, I have had to reduce my stock from 12 suckler cows to four and my breeding ewe flock from 50 to 26.  In addition, access to my remaining land has become problematic.  In February 2021, for example, my vet was able to access my farmyard for my annual herd test on Tuesday but when he returned to read the results on the following Friday, he could only access it on foot.  I am sure members will appreciate that such access issues cause serious difficulties and stress in times of animal husbandry emergencies, both for farmer and animal.  Another example of access issues is the case of another farmer who is located less than 1 km from a land parcel who is forced to make a round trip of 30 km to access his land due to roads being flooded.<br\/><br\/>An example of loss of agricultural policy payments relates to one farmer who had a penalty of &euro;4,500 in 2017.<\/p><p>For the next five years, he was forced to lease premiums at 50% of their value, resulting in a cumulative loss of &euro;11,250.  The total loss was therefore &euro;15,750, excluding production losses.  <\/p><p> On the humanitarian impact, the impact of the flooding was and is the cause of much turmoil in the lives of the affected community.  For weeks and months on end, people were and are afraid to leave their homes other than for necessary trips such as shopping, lest pumps malfunctioned or weather conditions changed and caused flooding.  In my own case in 2021, we went to Roscommon town only to find that on our return, in the space of less than three hours, due to a moderate increase in wind speed that resulted in increased waves, the waters had overrun the road and we could not access our home with our groceries.  Thankfully, we never required the services of an ambulance or emergency services.<\/p><p> At this point, I wish to acknowledge the efforts made by Roscommon County Council at all times to assist the community in whatever way it could.  I could continue to relay many stories of people who were distraught by reason of the impact on them.  However, in deference to the people involved, I do not wish to go into any detail.  Please let me assure the committee that I have heard and seen some harrowing evidence of the mental and psychological trauma endured.  With the onset of winter and the flood levels already rising again even as we speak, the distress and anxiety continues for the community.  We are continually at the mercy of the weather.  One home has gone with the solution already two thirds complete.  Are we to endure the loss of further homes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tommy Kearney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I will let the four Roscommon representatives speak, if that is okay with Deputy Carthy.

A public meeting was held earlier this year and hundreds attended.  It showed the impact on communities all across Rahara, Ballagh and Lisfelim.  Many communities are under threat with this and families have just been pulled apart, as Mr. Kearney also noted.<\/p> <p>  Many public representatives were at that public meeting, at which we listened.  Action is what the committee here wants to see.  It was good that we were able to hold a meeting last July with the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan.  There is a further progress update the Minister of State has committed to on 10 November.  I look forward to being able to hear the updates with our other public representatives here and the witnesses.  <\/p> <p>  From my understanding, there is engagement between OPW officials and Roscommon County Council on the ground regarding the current activities there.  The community at large is obviously seeing the rising water levels at the moment.  Can Councillor Fallon give any detail on the rising water levels at present, perhaps over the past week or so?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kearney is a farmer and this is the agriculture committee.

On her direct question about the rise in the waters, perhaps for the benefit of those who are not that close to the lake, I might give what I would call the base level of the lake as it should be at the month of October.  Normally, it would be 63.5 m above sea level on an Ordnance Survey map.  In 2016, it was 66.8 m, in 2017 it was 65.7 m, in 2018 was 65.75 m, in 2019 it was 66 m , in 2020 it was 67 m, in 2021 it was 67 m and in 2022 it was 66 m.  The bottom line is that the turlough has never emptied and is now on balance 3 m higher going into each winter than it should have been before 2015.  Just to give the Senator a measure of how fast it can change, the turlough has the capacity to go down at about 3 in. or 75 mm a week in very dry weather but in the last week, it has risen by 100 mm.  It can rise much faster than it goes down.  It is very worrying that it is rising just now at the rate it is rising, because land is waterlogged across our part of the country as well.<\/p> <p>  I will make the point that this is as serious from an environmental point of view as it is from economic and family hardship points of view.  Everything in the lake is dead; nothing is alive.  To give an example of how serious the death of the lake it is, there were 200 acres of reed beds, which are most sturdy and hard and hard-killed.  They all have died because of the permanent water in the lake, which is not allowing anything to happen.  All birds have left, including whooper swans.  We had a lovely flock of eaglets that came about ten years ago.  They rested in the trees on the islands.  The islands are flooded, the trees dead and they have left as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Laurence Fallon"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>It is no longer a functioning special area of conservation, SAC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#C00500","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>It is not.

They cannot be flourishing now because where they were growing is under 2 m of water.<\/p> <p>  We want to register our disappointment at the lack of any support coming from those who were protecting the SAC before this.  They have done no assessment on the damage done.  They were the people who were in charge of ensuring that we, as farmers, looked after the turlough and the SAC.  They were there as the representatives of the Government and as the representatives of the EU, who designated it as an SAC.  Since the flood came, they have disappeared.  I would think it is at least accepted that the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, should have done a study to see what is in the lake seven years after the first crisis developed.  It has not done that and it is an abdication of responsibility.  If the EU was to see what has happened to our turlough, it would immediately question whether we have the equivalent of another Derrybrien or not.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Kearney gave the Senator information about how we are penalised as farmers, rightly so, because we overstated the land we had due to the flooding.

We know the story.  I sincerely thank the witnesses.  Both the Chairman and I have discussed this numerous times in our offices.  I acknowledge Deputy Kerrane for speaking to me and ringing me about it on numerous occasions.  Deputy Fitzmaurice, who is on this committee, while I am not, has raised it on numerous occasions, as has Deputy Naughten.  I acknowledge the support of Senator Boyhan in the Seanad.  He is a Dublin-based man but he is very much involved in the agricultural scene.  He has always supported this in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  We do not need more reports.  We need action.  It is frightening when one realises that, six or seven years ago, many houses were 2 km from the floods and now the floods are 200 m or 300 m away.  I pride myself on horticulture.  Every bit of flora and fauna in the region has been destroyed, including bird life and tree life.  Even fish have washed up onto the grassland and died, as Councillor Fallon knows, because of the excessive levels of water.  It is really important for a clear statement to come from this forum.  This is not environmental change in Lough Funshinagh and Rahara.  It is a problem with a blockage in the system.  I am getting a bit annoyed with some people nationally saying this is to do with environmental change.  We all know there are environmental issues and change, but that is not why people in Rahara are suffering so badly.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  I do not care who answers them.  We know that one house is gone.  The level of sadness and upset among the community has been extraordinary to watch.  In the witnesses' opinion, if the water keeps rising, how many more houses will be seriously threatened in the coming weeks and months?<\/p> <p>  We have to look at a compensation package because payments have been cut back due to flooding.  Has the committee talked to the Department about getting involved in the hardship scheme, for example?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kearney talked about having cut back his herd already.  He is cutting back further the herd he has been looking after for years.  Will that be a real challenge for him if this is not solved in the short term?<\/p> <p>  The Government has made commitments to provide money but we have no plan.  You cannot eat dinner if there is no knife or fork to eat it with.  Talking about having the money there and how it will be financed is no good when we do not have a plan.  I know it is up to us and the Department.  I do not think the Parks and Wildlife Service and others have done enough in this regard.  The witnesses are right in saying they will have to step up to the mark further, as we will have to as well.<\/p> <p>  Will the witnesses answer those questions?  I will not come back in for now.

Regarding how many houses will or will not be affected, we have to understand this is a basin of water surrounded by hills.  It is quite high up, about 32 ft above the level of the Shannon.  It is not low ground, but high ground surrounded by hills.  The only way this lake can ever rectify itself without a pipe being put in, if we continue to get the predicted rainfalls, is that it will eventually double in size and eventually flow into the Shannon itself, but by then it could have consumed up to ten houses and seven farmyards.  There is no natural way out other than through the swallow holes, which do not have the capacity.  The pipe is 70% ready.  All we are asking is for a small quantity of water to be removed to reduce the level of the lake to the Ordnance Survey Ireland line of 66 mOD.  After that, we are convinced that the turlough will rectify itself except on very rare occasions when the flood rises.  The turlough has got out of kilter.  It is like trying to fill the bath with the same amount of water every day, but it is half full when starting.  It will simply overflow.  There is no other way to describe it.<\/p> <p>  Our problem is that the legal system is so stacked against us that we cannot address this.  Our county council went to the OPW, using the Local Authority (Works) Act 1949.  It is on the Statute Book and has been amended to refer the habitats directive, Directive 92\/42\/EEC, yet when it went to the courts, it was found to be null and void.  The same issue arose when it tried to use emergency powers.  Families were using pumps to keep the water away from them.  If the pumps stopped for two hours, there would be 3 ft of water in their houses.  The judge, who I have no issue with because I am sure judges are always right, said this is not an emergency under EU law.  We appear to have two laws, one from the EU and one from Ireland.  The laws to protect the special areas of conservation, SAC, are stopping us from doing what is right for the SAC.  Individual rights are gone.  There seems to be no way around it at this stage.  Everybody needs to come together to find a solution to this issue.  This is not just about Lough Funshinagh.  There will be another issue and another issue.<\/p> <p>  The bottom line is our legal system has become vague because of the transposition of EU legislation.  When it is vague and unclear, the simplest thing for people in the legal profession to do is to say \"no\", because it is too risky to say anything else.  We are suffering because of the lack of clarity in the Local Authority (Works) Act 1949 or the emergency powers legislation that came much later.  That has failed us twice despite that we thought, in good faith, we were doing the right thing because we were using Irish legislation.  Mr. Kearney might address farmer compensation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Laurence Fallon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>No effort, or very little, has been made by anybody on the committee to seek compensation.

I hope this situation under discussion will be resolved long before that, barring, to be blunt about it, and we have to be honest as politicians, some of these self-interest parties that have no clue and that do not live in those areas deciding to keep going to the courts.  That is a risk.  There is no point in saying it is not.<\/p><p>The other question relates to the lands that farmers have lost.  Mr. Kearney said he is not interested in being looked at in this respect, but if someone is affected by something, then no more than in Shass Mountain in Leitrim where there was a bog slide, there is a <i>force majeure<\/i>measure to help the farming community.  Perhaps the witnesses could engage with us on the committee on that with respect to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is a sad story to hear of someone who has 12 cows, which is not a great many cows, to be honest, and it is the average farm in the west of Ireland, having to go down to four cows.  It was not their fault.  It was what happened with the situation there.<\/p><p>Pumps were taken away recently but our understanding, having talked to the OPW, and I am sure the other Deputies and Senators have talked to the OPW, is that it is going to be on standby.  If there is a problem, it is willing to help.  However, we as a committee have to be honest.  While everyone will be talking to all the different bodies and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine needs to get involved, at the end of the day it will involve the OPW and Roscommon County Council through the system they have to go through.  As Councillor Fallon has pointed out quite rightly, it will happen in other places.  It happened last week in Connemara where Galway County Council was once again stopped through the same rigmarole and BS that goes on in blocking jobs from being done where more problems are happening.  We have seen the housing situation.  We are hearing every day in this forum that everyone has the right to housing.  These people have their houses and they are being driven out of them, to be quite blunt about it.  That is a damnable situation when you have your own house that you have paid for.  I will not harp on.<\/p><p>Will the Chair accept the proposal that this committee do as I suggested?  It is important there is engagement between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the OPW.  We need all the bodies going together to ensure this pipe is finished.  A few weeks will finish this pipe.  I have said at the meetings that while they have to go through the different hoops and loops and stuff to make sure, what the people in that area need is to see action phase by phase.

Pumps have been taken out but they will be restored and they are running on standby close by.

It is very clear there is a huge human impact in this regard in terms of homeowners, farmers and agricultural practice.  We have heard that in the evidence here today.  I wish to pick up on something at the end of the presentation given by Ms Murray and the comment Councillor Fallon made.  On her very last slide, in the top right-hand corner of the photograph, looking at the gable of the house, the biodiversity impact of this can be seen in terms of what used to be trees at the back of that particular house.  The biodiversity in that area has been completely wiped out as a result of this.  What the community is looking for is that the turlough would go back to its normal natural winter flood level, nothing more and nothing less.<\/p> <p>  The big question is where we go from here.  We need to see action on foot of this presentation.  Roscommon County Council set out the situation very clearly last May and the steps that needed to be taken.  It wrote directly to the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, who has taken the matter up with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, because he stated that many of the policy and legislative matters are the responsibility of that Department.  Earlier this month I raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Donovan, through a parliamentary question.  He said he is still waiting for engagement from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on it.  On 13 October, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, came back and said the Department was liaising with the OPW but there was no question of legislative change.  That did not arise in this regard.  Therefore we are back to this game of tennis.  The OPW is referring it to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which in turn is referring it back to the OPW.  In the meantime the water is getting closer and closer to the families and farms involved.  We need to progress this and move it on.<\/p><p>Deputy Fitzmaurice and I and five other colleagues have signed a motion that we have laid before the D&aacute;il.  It seeks the establishment of a cross-departmental, cross-agency task force to address the emergency climate adaptation measures to protect homes across this country.  It is this community we are talking about today, but we already saw last week in Galway, Cork and locations here in Dublin that this issue is going to arrive at someone else's door again and we must get ahead of it.  In fairness, when I put this specific proposal to the Taoiseach today in the House, he committed to examining it and to engaging with the Ministers in this regard.<\/p><p> What we need now is a recommendation from this committee to establish a national task force to take on this role and to set as the first item on its agenda using the community around Lough Funshinagh as the test case in this context.  The progress we make concerning this issue can then be replicated in every other community around the country.  I am asking, therefore, this committee to take on board the motion on flooding risks at Lough Funshinagh, which is on the D&aacute;il Order Paper, adopt it and lay it before both Houses.  Both Houses could then progress this measure through engagement with both Ministers.  I say this because unless we have a co-ordinated approach on this matter, we will be passing it back and forth, as has been the case up to now.  I hope I can get a seconder and the support of the committee for my proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#E01200","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Has the secretariat taken note of it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#F00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I will forward the wording to the secretariat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#F00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I presume there is no objection to this proposal from anyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#F00400","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I second it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#F00500","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I call the other representative from the constituency, Deputy Kerrane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#F00600","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  Mr. Kearney put it better than any of us could when he said people just want to live in their homes.  This is really the top and the bottom of the issue.  It is a small ask in this day and age, but, unfortunately, this is the request.  This is all that is being looked for.  All of us local representatives have been on the ground at Lough Funshinagh.  It is important to again record that the area has been completely destroyed.  The trees look like they have been burnt alive.  The whole area has been destroyed.  This is what is there and this is what is left.  We are now coming into another winter and this issue has gone on for far too long.<\/p> <p>  It has been said many times today that the only solution is to reduce the water levels.  This is the only solution and this is where we must get to from now to then.  We must get to that point as fast as possible.  The NPWS has been adamant, certainly in replies we have received in respect of questions we have put to it through the Oireachtas and the European Commission, that it has engaged.  It is important for it to be put on the record what engagement the NPWS has had with the community and with the people living in the area specifically.<\/p> <p>  Equally, when the Minister of State came before county council members, and it was several months ago that he spoke in the chamber of Roscommon County Council, he was adamant at that point that this would have to be a cross-departmental response, that there would have to be engagement and that there was a role for almost every Department.  What Deputy Naughten just said about the level of engagement, therefore, is worrying.  It does not seem to be where it needs to be.  We must see movement on this aspect.<\/p> <p>  It has been said that the people living in the area are not interested in compensation.  I can understand that because it is their home and where they live.  People have lived there for generations.  They should not have to go.  This is the point.  Nobody should have to go.  Regarding the supports given, however, in the context of this being the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, have supports been provided to farmers by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  Have any financial supports been provided?  Turning to the Department of Social Protection, has it provided any supports?  I refer to aspects such as damage caused to houses up to now or whatever such funding might be needed for.  Have financial supports been provided by either Department?<\/p> <p>  I am not a member of this committee, but I am here today because typically, in many cases, all politicians do not agree.  In our constituency, however, there is support and we are standing with the witnesses.  I wish this issue could be solved, that we could do more and that this could have been solved yesterday.  I reiterate that the witnesses have our full support.  I hope we can arrive at a solution and that we do not see a recurrence of what we have seen happening for years.  I hope this problem is solved once and for all.  It will only be solved by reducing the water levels, continuing the work that has been started and getting this done.  We must put people before anything else.  They are number one and we must put people first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#F00700","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kerrane.

Earlier, I thanked the people from the constituency for their work.  I also thank Deputy Kerrane for her work, because she has been available at all times.  We appreciate this greatly.  The Deputy asked a question about an engagement with the NPWS.  There may have been engagement, but that consisted of a visit and a look at what was there.  There was no disagreement regarding the damage done.  I had occasion to meet some of the people involved at the National Ploughing Championships recently.  I got a clear view.  A perspective will be arrived at when a report is received from somebody else.  My clear view is that the NPWS should be assessing the damages that have been done now.  Equally, as the custodians and policers of the SAC on behalf of the EU, it should be proposing a solution to restore the SAC.  It is fine to say it will be dedesignated, and this may be something that will happen down the road.  Most people around the turlough, however, do not necessarily want it to be dedesignated.  We want it to be restored.  The engagement, therefore, has been very minimal and there needs to be much more.<\/p> <p>  The only financial supports we have received, and we appreciate them greatly, was in the context of having our roads raised and having unlimited access to pumps to keep water out of houses.  Other than that, though, there has been no funding.  Farmers have faced a significant cost in the loss of single farm payments.  As far as I am aware, and as a farmer who has lost some payments, we are being treated the same as every other single farm payment applicant.  If a mistake is found, then we pay the price.  The mistake we have is that the turlough has not receded to a level low enough to allow us to have the land available.<\/p> <p>  To clarify one point, at no stage have we any desire to lower the level of the lake below its natural high level.  I will go one step further and say that the pipe that we planned to install was never going to have the capacity to lower the lake below the perimeter of the SAC.  The lake is now much bigger than the SAC because it has expanded onto the farmland around it.  Our pipe was not going to affect the SAC in any way because it was only, at best, going to lower the water level to that of the perimeter boundary of the SAC.

It has wide implications.  The members will be aware that I have raised this issue and used the Lough Funshinagh farmers as an example.  This is precisely the type of situation for which the <i>force majeure<\/i>provision is included in the Common Agricultural Policy.  To me, it is an absolute scandal that farmers have been penalised because of an act of nature, or whatever we might want to call it, beyond their control.  We should be repeating our call for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, to intervene and to restore all the payments lost in respect of this situation.<\/p><p>The second issue I wish to raise is that this issue, if it were to be replicated in other instances, has the potential to undermine the entire designation system at an EU level.  What we have here a designation of an SAC which was put in place to protect the environment and biodiversity and to support communities to protect biodiversity and the environment in their areas.<\/p><p>This designation is now ensuring the very act of trying to save people's homes is challengeable in the courts to such a point that everybody loses, that is, the communities lose, the local economy and wider society lose and the environment loses.

Maybe Councillor Fallon or someone else can elaborate on that.  It is crucial the authorities are prepared and that we have confidence that each of them, be it the local authority, the OPW or the Department, are equipped and have the capacity to deal with the steps it has been decided they need to get through.<\/p><p> I regret local residents have had to come before an Oireachtas committee.  The local residents and community are the people who have suffered as a result of this but they were in no way at fault.  The reason we have local authorities, the OPW and Departments is to ensure people themselves do not have to come before the Oireachtas or anywhere else to make a case to save their homes, livelihoods and lands.

I also thank Deputy Danny Healy-Rae for his contribution.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Carthy raised a most important question, namely, are we confident the authorities can do the job.  It is the greatest challenge we have.  I speak now maybe as much as a county councillor as a farmer in the area.  The council was very confident it could do the job 12 months ago.  That is why it started the work.  It was an emergency and a crisis.  We have the Article 49 legislation, we had the chief executive's emergency powers and we were confident we could do it.  I am not as confident now as I was then because our legislation can be called into question so easily.  There were a couple of things that caused that to happen.  The first was there has not been enough assessment of the Irish legislation with respect to how it has been impacted by European legislation.  The second and probably more alarming point is we have a court system that allows people from any part of Ireland to take an action against a local authority for the work it is doing and because of the way costs are set, it will cost them very little.  Every time the council loses its case it pays its own costs and those of the parties taking the action.  Every time it wins its case it does not get its compensation because it is deemed the smaller party does not have the capacity to pay.  It is allowing people to create an industry out of going to court and that is why things are not happening here.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for having us.  Deputy Carthy mentioned the assessment being done.  Very little work has started on that assessment.  On 24 May the council wrote to the authorities seeking immediate action.  We only got a cover letter back then saying they are looking into this.  We as a group are concerned the pace is too slow and that the weather will catch up with us and we will lose more houses.  I appeal to all present to ensure we have a team effort using all the Departments involved, the local authority, the OPW and the NPWS to do the full environmental assessment as quickly as possible and proceed with replacing the pipe.  This is not a significant engineering feat.  It is the simplest job we could do.  It is a matter of digging a hole and putting in a pipe with a sluice gate on it that will not affect the natural high level of the turlough.  For that reason it should not be impossible but because of legal challenge and maybe the lack of a co-ordinated approach we have not made the progress we deserve and time is not on our side.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure if any other members of the group want to say anything else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Laurence Fallon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":66,"content":"<p>No, Mr. Fallon has wrapped it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#G01100","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Chairman, I wish to clarify something.

I acknowledge the Chairperson's continued support of Macra along with the recognition that as a sector there needs to be significant change in order to address the crisis that exists concerning generational renewal across Irish farms.<\/p> <p>  In addition to looking at the future of farming in Ireland, it behoves us to look at where farming fits into Irish society, and more specifically, Irish rural society.  When speaking in the Seanad in September the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, referred to local businesses as \"the beating heart of rural Ireland\".  Macra is in agreement with the sentiment that rural Ireland as a living, breathing entity only exists through the economic activity that is generated there.  This economic activity is generated through many enterprises.  However, as agriculture generates &euro;15 billion each year Macra believes it must truly be the heartbeat of rural Ireland.  I do not think any members of this Oireachtas joint committee would disagree with that statement.  Agriculture has always been at the centre of rural Ireland and we hope it will always continue to reside at the centre.  To be blunt about it, if there is no agriculture then there is no real rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In order for any enterprise to be sustainable, there needs to be a continual influx of new blood into the industry.  In our industry, where only 5% of farmers are aged under 35 years, it is safe to call the situation a crisis.  If we continue as we are farmers will be an extinct species in a short time.  Any industry with an age profile similar to Irish agriculture can by any measure be classed as one in danger of extinction.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae told this committee last week that while it was once a privilege to be left landed, it is now seen by many as a curse.  We are glad to state on behalf of our members that this is not the case for Macra; being given access to land to hold in trust for the next generation is still an honour, albeit one fraught with difficulty.<\/p> <p>  We have the best-educated agricultural workforce in the EU.  This has been provided by our excellent third-level institutions.  This education is backed up by the time many of our aspiring young farmers spend abroad to experience how farming operates in other jurisdictions.<\/p><p> Before we continue on to what is required to support young farmers to enter and remain in the industry, it is perhaps timely to look at what rural Ireland would look like without farming.  Please be in no doubt, this is a realistic proposition as the age profile of our farmers has been continually increasing over the years.  If this continues unabated, we will experience what the church has experienced in recent years in its demise.  The lack of supports for young entrant farmers is tantamount to actively restricting access for new entrants to the industry.  If we continue on this path, we will in effect clear the land.  The land will go back to being unproductive.  Allowing land to go fallow will increase our risk of food insecurity and not ensure that food is produced in the most sustainable way possible.<\/p><p> As a sector, it is evident that we have many challenges to overcome over the coming decade and beyond.  The role of highly educated, highly motivated and forward-thinking young farmers will undoubtedly be crucial in tackling these challenges and ensuring the future sustainability of our sector.  With the number of farmers under the age of 35 currently at less than 5%, fundamental change and targeted supports are required to address the decreasing numbers of farmers under the age of 35.  A mere 20 years ago the percentage of farmers under 35 stood at 13%.  Bearing this in mind, can we really justify continuing with more of the same to address the issue of generational renewal?  Based on 2016 figures, 30% of farmers who are head of the holding are over the age of 65.  This figure significantly increases when we look at those in more disadvantaged areas, especially those on uplands and peat soils.  In the sectors predominately practised on these farms, a higher average age was observed.  The percentage of specialised farmers with a high age profile was 41%.  Cattle farms accounted for 39% compared to an average of only 15% in the dairy sector according to Teagasc national farm survey data.  These figures have also shown sharp increases, particularly in cattle farming, rising from 27% in 2013 to 36% in 2017.  The agrifood sector is one of Ireland's most important indigenous manufacturing sectors, accounting for employment of 167,500 people.  It includes 700 drinks firms and we export food and agricultural products to more than 160 countries worldwide.<\/p><p> Food Vision 2030 was launched by the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, in 2021 with the ambition that Ireland will become a leader in sustainable food systems, SFS, over the next decade.  It was stated that this would deliver many benefits for the agrifood sector, Irish society and the environment.  In demonstrating the Irish agrifood sector meets the highest standards, it was hoped the economic, environmental, and social pillars of the strategy would provide future competitive advantage for the sector.<\/p><p> Four missions were outlined under Food Vision 2030.  Mission 1 was to create a climate smart and environmentally sustainable agricultural sector; mission 2 was to create viable and resilient primary producers with enhanced well-being; mission 3 was to produce food that is safe, nutritious and appealing, trusted and valued at home and abroad; and mission 4 was to create an innovative, competitive and resilient agrifood sector, driven by innovation at its heart.<\/p><p> For many years, Macra na Feirme has identified several barriers to entering farming.  We have consistently highlighted that these barriers prevent access to farming for many young people.  The main areas we focused on have continually been barriers around access to land; access to affordable unsecured finance; support and knowledge transfer; the creation of a good lifestyle; financial security and earning capacity; an ever-changing policy environment; lack of investment for capital development; and supporting multiple generations from the on-farm business.  Addressing the barriers is no quick fix.  Land access remains a huge challenge for young people.  Greater support for the land mobility service is required and greater security is needed for older farmers to step back from farming and remain financially secure.  With land prices increasing at rates not seen for decades, significant investment is needed to support young people to become competitive in the sector.<\/p><p> Affordable finance is the second major barrier that exists for young people entering farming.  The need to invest in infrastructure, livestock and management tools on-farm is extensive and expensive.  Many young people who have a limited track record with financial institutions find it very difficult to access finance.  Therefore, a specific low-cost finance option specifically tailored for young farmers must be established to facilitate the option for finance.  For many years, Macra has outlined a succession scheme which we have detailed and which we feel aptly fits the needs of older farmers in terms of their financial security and couples support for young farmers who are taking over the farming process.  The scheme addresses the worries that older farmers have around financial security should they step back from farming.  Moreover, with additional support for young farmers it also allows these young people to secure a living while also having a lifestyle that is comparable with their peers.  It would also allay fears that the farm business will not be able to support multiple generations, which is a major barrier to land transfer and entry.  The sector must provide pathways for young people to enter into it.  It cannot be the case that the only viable route to farming is via your parents or a blood relative who is a landowner.  It is comparable with saying to young people they can only become a mechanic if their parents own a garage.  Limiting access to a small number of young people will do little to ensure the long-term viability and growth of rural areas and the communities which depend on them.<\/p><p> Many opportunities exist in agriculture and Macra is a strong proponent of those opportunities.  We need to take advantage of them with flexible tailored support and with sound policy that delivers for the future.  Some of the opportunities that exist include meeting the ambitions of the environmental agreements and targets set out under many Bills, including addressing the age gap that is currently on farms.  The ambition and willingness of young farmers to take over new, smart, friendly and precision agriculture practices is one we feel must be adopted.  Young farmers are more likely to adopt new technologies, while older farmers are more likely to be slow to take them up.  We have outlined within our submission much of the supporting evidence and research conducted in recent years and decades to highlight the issues and to show that young farmers, backed up by peer-reviewed science, are more likely and more willing to take up new technological advancements on farms.<\/p><p> Diversification is a buzz word that is mentioned consistently by many Government politicians as the way forward for Irish agriculture.  Macra agrees with this.  However, merely saying that it is needed will not result in any changes on the ground.  What is needed is targeted investment in the areas that can offer income for farmers, while also having an environmental and societal benefit.  The areas where Macra sees huge opportunity but a lack of investment and creation of pathways include on-farm energy production; anaerobic digestion; agri-tourism; production of energy crops; high nitrogen use efficiency system farm models; and organic farming models driven by market demand.  In order to realise these opportunities, we need a complete rethink of policy.  The constant push for reduction of production and restriction without the inclusion of efficiency is a policy fundamentally flawed.  Where there is opportunity in the sector, there is no point in slowly closing the doors.<\/p><p> Generational renewal is the largest threat to agriculture.  The figures speak for themselves.  Unless we continuously develop generational renewal, the future for agriculture in Ireland is non-existent.  There is one school of thought that generational renewal should be a function of the free market.  This would be the easiest and simplest solution.  However, if we look at the current land market and the exceedingly high prices being paid for the purchase of land, it cannot be the case that young farmers are expected to compete with established peers who operate within the market.  Macra is calling for supports for young farmers looking to enter the industry.  These include but are not limited to some of the points we outlined above with regard to access to land and finance, knowledge transfer, support through learning and technological investment.<\/p><p> Finally, as Irish farmers we feel we have a unique role to play in meeting the climate change challenge.  However, it must be done in a fair and balanced way.  Dealing with climate change provides an opportunity for young farmers who will adopt the practices and the best solutions science has to offer.  Irish dairy and beef output is extremely efficient from a carbon footprint perspective.  Irish milk has one of the lowest footprints in the EU, while Irish beef has the fifth lowest.  Despite this, many would lead us to believe the carbon efficiency of expanding milk production in Ireland has been displaced by approximately 4 million tonnes of carbon, which would have been emitted by an equivalent dairy production outside Ireland.  As young farmers we have an ambition and target to engage in the practices that are needed from an environmental point of view and to adopt the practices that will lead to higher economic returns but will also be beneficial to the environment, which we have detailed.<\/p><p> The future of agriculture in this State is in a perilous condition, with the age profile of farmers continually increasing and the proportion of young farmers entering the industry on the wane.  Urgent remedial action is needed to continue.  It must be a whole-of-policy approach, must be cross-governmental and must be a science-based approach to developing a future for young farmers.<\/p><p> In all future policy aspects, Macra requests and foresees that any policy development be impact assessed for its overarching effect on generational renewal.

There are approximately 1,300 to 1,400 long-term leases each year at present, which is significant when we consider the number of farms in the country.  The percentage of land going into long-term leases is significant and growing.  Do the representatives have any access to land?  They talked about the farm, the price land made and the fact that land has increased in price fairly rapidly over the past 12 to 18 months.

From a long-term lease point of view, tax incentives have been beneficial to the release of land and making land available to the market, which is something we welcomed as a land transfer tool that would give people access to land.  However, as the Chair rightly said, we have had instances in recent years, and it continues, where the price of leasing land for long-term lease has become a barrier not only to young farmers but for particular sectors and enterprises within agriculture.  If that is compounded with young people in those enterprises who are not able to compete, it becomes an even bigger issue.<\/p> <p>  If we look to those on the Continent and some of the measures they use to address land leasing and access to land - I include some examples from France and Austria - when a parcel of land becomes available or is offered to the market for lease, in a number of member states, it is offered to a cohort of young farmers first.

It is worked on the basis that the national average will be lower than where there are pressure zones, whether we want to call those rent pressure zones, or lease pressure zones in an agricultural context.  That is comparable with what they are for.  They are offered access to land at a lower rate in a first refusal-type system.<\/p> <p>  There is also support through tax rebates for those young farmers who are leasing land to allow them to claim back something on the cost of the leasing of the land.  This creates preferential access for young farmers, if we want to call it that.  On the other side of things, it also has tax rebate or tax implications for young farmers to avail of through the course of their farming of the land.  It is a double benefit for them.

It is probably the biggest and hardest question to answer.  We have a few solutions.  As has been outlined in respect of long-term leasing, which is very beneficial, and trying to target it towards the younger farmer, one of the solutions we came up with recently at our agricultural affairs committee is the development of a succession plan that will benefit both the farmer exiting farming and the young farmer coming in.  We put forward a proposal that the exiting farmer would be rewarded financially somehow for leasing the farm to a farmer under the age of 35.  In exchange, the farmer under the age of 35 would then have to implement a suite of environmental measures to allow us to get on the right pathway to hitting our environmental targets.  The committee is well aware of what those targets are.  They include grassland management, soil fertility, high genetic merit cows, and better management of slurry and manures, all of which add up very significantly.  For example, having cows that have a &euro;100 economic breeding index, EBI, versus cows that have a &euro;200 EBI means a 10% difference in a farmer's carbon footprint.<\/p> <p>  It is more likely a young farmer would adopt these measures but if-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Hanrahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>The banding might not agree with that but go on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#K00600","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Maybe not, but if it was part of an agreement that had to be implemented-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Hanrahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Mr. Hanrahan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#K00800","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>That is fine.  It is about having a discussion and encouraging that.  It is a carrot as opposed to a stick approach.  There would be a massive uptake if the leaser, or the older farmer leasing out his or her land, had security.  That farmer would have security that the lease would work out.  The young farmer would take it on with a guarantee that he or she would implement these measures.  It is hitting two birds with the one stone.  All that would be asked for in exchange would be greater incentives for the young farmer in terms of installation aid and access to unsecured finance at a reasonable rate and a reasonable amount, given what would be required in a lot of these cases.  Many of the farms coming up for lease are not exactly top-class farms.  We have to do things rights, especially when it comes to hitting environmental targets.  Slurry storage is one of the major issues.  In the case of many of these farms, they might not exactly be compliant but the young farmer could come in and sort that out.

Our land mobility service would be there to help and assist with this process and allow the young farmer to put together proper business proposals to give the bank, landowner and all parties involved the confidence that this would work out.

On numerous occasions, we have had discussions on various plans to limit the use of land, most recently, the proposals to limit the availability of land.  As was said, the future of rural Ireland hinges on what happens today and what message is given to the sector of today.  The plans for nature restoration spring to mind and there are more.

Our comment on impact assessments comes off the fact that we would like all these measures to show what impact this will have on all those things, including land mobility, land availability, production and the opportunities it will create for young people to get into the sector.  Right now, from where we sit and from our perspective as Macra na Feirme and young farmer representatives, that is not something that is taken into consideration.  We should take it from a young farmer's point of view right now.  Even looking at the past ten days, we were lucky enough to be sitting in this committee room this night last week speaking about the EU nature restoration regulation.  I was in Brussels yesterday where the industrial bills regulation is something being talked about at EU level.  The pesticides regulation is also being discussed.  We also had a recommendation from the food vision group the day before yesterday, which referenced reduction and taking land away from being available to anybody working in breeding livestock in order to use it as productive land.<\/p><p>Land is the most limiting resource that any farming enterprise has in terms of its ability to grow.  Our reservations here are that all of these policies, regulations and Bills are coming forward without a detailed assessment on what impact they will have on the people who will have to implement them on the ground.  We have an environmental assessment that, in the context of the EU nature restoration Bill or of the Green Deal, refers to meeting the targets in biodiversity and refers to the targets on water quality which are all important and ample measures we should be supporting, but it says nothing about what the future of the sector will be in ten or 20 years.  There is a constant narrative that CAP funding will sort out all of these issues.  If CAP funding will sort out all of these issues that are being mentioned, a euro is all that will be signed to any single scheme to delivery anything because every time we hear about anything being dealt with at a European level or here, it is CAP funding that will sort that out for us.  That is a limited and declining budget if one looks at inflation and the cost of production.<\/p><p> What needs to be done is the impact assessment, if one follows the line of the environmental assessment, and that creates a template for investment in how it is achieved.  We have seen it under the ambition under CAP where one of the key objectives was generation renewal.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine invested the very same supports here as it has done since 2014 and we are expecting a different outcome.  Einstein, to my recollection, had a fair theory on what that will achieve.<\/p><p> We have ambition here under the food vision group about creating viable producers with enhanced well-being.  I would like to know when we will start dealing with the viable producers.  Are we to deal with it at the end when every other policy is drawn up, when every other instrument is designed and when the opportunity is no longer there?<\/p><p> Unless I have missed something, I will hand over to Mr. Hanrahan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin Browne for his question.  It was good of the Deputy to mention the nature restoration plan.  I suppose the first point is that one cannot manage what one does not measure.

How do we know what the impact of these potential carbon sinks will be, not to mind the impact they will have on the land around them, the land one takes away, and the impact assessment on the rural economy and the rural population?  The impact is endless, in terms of the damaging effect it will have.  First of all, we need proper accuracy in terms of the measurement of carbon sequestration.<\/p> <p>  Farmers have no problem whatsoever in implementing carbon sequestration measures as long as they are done in an appropriate manner and not a broad-stroke-of-a-pen fashion.

It is not accounted for in our inventory either, but we know that.  We have other issues around that.

Our firm belief is that they should be mandatory.  If we were sitting in the committee that was dealing with the future of the health sector and somebody came in to present and say that 5% of our nurses on the floors attending accident and emergency departments were under the age of 35 and 30% of them were over the age of 65, I am fairly confident that we would be calling that a crisis and saying that everything needs to be done to encourage as many people and as many nurses as possible to take up the jobs to bring the sector into line with the other relatable sectors.  If one looks at the average working population across the sectors, including teachers, doctors and nurses, between 25% and 30% of the average working population is under 35.  We are at 5% and the numbers have decreased in the past decade.  Why would it not make sense to make that mandatory, if one will be relying on these people to produce food to feed the world in the future?  We will need a farmer in the morning and the evening, and at lunchtime, no matter what happens.  It should be mandatory.<\/p> <p>  In terms of engagement, we have had loads of engagement on what should be done for the sector going forward from an environmental point of view.  I have sat on forums nearly every day of the week in this role in the past two years, and my predecessor did similarly.  In terms of action and delivering on what we are suggesting needs to be implemented to drive this change, we just do not see it.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned the CAP supports earlier.  It is the same level of investment that we had from the previous CAP.  We are the only member state that has not used installation aid or business start-up, whatever one wants to call it, as a measure to support young people to access farming and we achieved the minimum allocation for young farmer supports under Pillar I.  When one translates that to an Irish context, we have the tax reliefs, obviously, for the leasing of land and stock relief which are very welcome, but we now find ourselves in a situation where the state aid rules are becoming a limiting factor.  The state aid rules state that one can claim up to a maximum of &euro;70,000 over a lifetime under those tax reliefs, which are agricultural tax reliefs such as consolidation relief, stock relief measures and young farmer relief measures.  We are finding now with the way the value of land is going, the prices of stock, etc., that our farmers are likely to reach that threshold and surpass it as time goes on.  That limit is something which needs to be looked at as well.<\/p> <p>  From a Government point of view here in Ireland, there are schemes in other EU member states where they are investing specific supports targeted at young farmers around business start-up grant-aid support, such as we would have in business start-up outside of farming.  They are investing in technological development around environmental and strategic actions as well.  We do not see that investment here.  We see that the access to finance is the single biggest barrier.  There was mention of creating an attractive lifestyle.  Many of the farms that young people take over have had a certain level of investment over the past 30 years and if one puts oneself in that young person's shoes, one does not want to be out at 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. when one's peers have had their feet up since 5 p.m.  People need some capital investment to make life easier and to be able to invest in technology so that they are not drudging at 11 p.m. or midnight. and their lifestyle is a bit easier.  Then it becomes more attractive for them to stay in farming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>If one takes the reduction measures which have been suggested to us in terms of reducing cow numbers by 100,000 cows and a stocking rate of two cows per hectare, a tip of the iceberg of impact assessment would be that there would be 50,000 hectares out of circulation.

Mr. Hanrahan and I have had the privilege of sitting in the food vision dairy group for the past nine months, which has gone through the systems the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which is the reporting body for this, has.  Our understanding of it, and forgive me if I do not have all the exact details, is that there are three different tiers on which carbon is accounted for in reporting.  Tier 1 is the international panels.  They are standard models, which are based on their findings.  Tier 2 is based on some country-specific figures, some of which statistics we are operating on currently.  Tier 3 systems are the most detailed.  This tier is specific to the country and the system that is operational.  In Ireland, if compared with what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, does, which takes in the total mixed rations systems in large sheds on the Continent and across the world, that is probably not comparable to the grass-based production system we have in Ireland.  The ongoing methane research in Teagasc would suggest we are currently overestimating that in the region of about 10% or 12%.  The sequestration from mineral soils is also being understated, according to the latest research, which has to be peer reviewed and so forth.  On peatlands the amount of emissions is being overstated by a large amount.  All of those cumulatively, when added to a farm, are going to make a huge difference from the book figure being emitted from each farm.  That is our understanding of it.  We do understand we have a number of years to go through before that comes into effect in the inventory itself.  We have also been told this will be backdated on the inventory.  The inventory is worked off 1990 figures.  If these figures change, based on new evidence and research, those figures will be backdated on a percentage basis as far as 1990.  If we are saying that today we are overestimating it by 2 megatonnes, we are working off the system we have.  Tomorrow we will be working off a new accounting system that reflects this latest research.  The difference will not be today versus yesterday.  The difference will be today versus 1990, and having that incrementally backdated over the years.

The overarching aspect of that is that because all of the funds in previous rounds have been fully drawn down it is, as the Deputy rightly says, a competitive space to access that funding.  The young farmers have found themselves competing with older, more mature businesses which is quite difficult.  The ring-fencing of a specific amount of funds within that budget or the establishment of a specific budget for young farmers or young business owners is something we would support as well.  Some of our young business owners in rural communities have also said that access to finance is an issue.  We have no issue with whichever one it is.  The key issue is that it is ring-fenced for them, that it is at low interest and that they have access to it.

From the reports I read, it was a lot of locals bidding against each other.  They were not members of Macra na Feirme.  Maybe they were once but not anymore.  What we are looking for is to take a proportion of whatever fund comes out next and ring-fence it.  It does not matter if it a separate portion or part of the existing portion.  It simply needs to be ring-fenced for young farmers and young businesses.  The established businesses have the economic weight to outbid every young entrant and literally soak up all the land and soak up all the resources.  We are also looking at bringing more women into farming.  We would also suggest that there should be a proportion of funding ring-fenced for young women as well, to level the playing field as much as we can.  The methodology is not that important.

I am struck by the opening statement of the witness where the limited availability of land is mentioned.  The statement also addressed that some schemes for moving land from productive use to other uses would limit that even further.  Is it not fair to say that it is not that agricultural land is becoming non-agricultural land for the most part?  It is that existing farms are getting bigger.  That poses a very big question that we need to tackle.  Going back to the earlier point of the future of the family farm model, lots of countries are currently producing the same, if not more, food than they were 50 years ago but the number of farmers that are involved are a tiny fraction of what they were 50 years ago.

It has increased through improved efficiencies and practices on farms.  The output of a beef or a dairy farm now, per hectare, which is the standard unit as it was 40 years ago, is a lot higher based on the efficiencies, developments in research, better management and so forth that is ongoing on farms.  That is a positive.  Looking at the environmental side of things, the carbon footprint of those products is decreasing per unit all the time.  A person goes into a shop and picks up a pound of butter or a kilo of beef, that is what they are eating.  They are not eating the entire animal, the total emissions.  They are eating that kilo of beef or drinking that litre of milk.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the maximum size of a farm, we have farmers who are farming on 10 ha, 20 ha, 40 ha and 100 ha but they are still family farms.<\/p><p>The family farm model is something we have to protect.  Three or four generations can sustain a livelihood on that farm and we are saying we have to limit it to a scale that will not allow for different generations to exist on a farm.  I hope that in ten years' time three generations will be actively farming on my farm.  My father and I are currently there and I hope it could sustain three generations in the future.  For that to work, the farm has to grow to sustain those people on the farm.  I am not saying it has to get to an industrial scale like in Saudi Arabia or in America as that is not the model we have.  The scale that supports the family farm is three generations and in some circumstances it is four.  That is the reality across the country.  The question is around how we ensure the scale of farming rewards those farmers on the different size farms and across the different enterprises.  We were in front of this committee before the break in the summertime speaking about unfair trading practices in the market and trying to ensure an economic return for farmers.  Those salient points still stand.  The price farmers are receiving for their products must be commensurate with the cost of production and must return a reward for them.  We have been very strong in our advocacy for that.  If a point and a value can be created within the chain so that a farmer receives just reward for what he or she is doing, it will create an income for him or her. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#N01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>This is a valuable debate because there are contradictions in probably what we all say.  Mr. Keane quite rightly made the case that farming should not be restricted to the sons and daughters of existing farmers if it is to have a future.  Every sector needs new people coming in.  He spoke quite rightly about the fact that there are three and four generations being supported by individual farms.  I also represent farmers where the farm is not supporting a single generation and that needs to be noted.<\/p> <p>  Then there is the issue referenced by Mr. Keane very early on in his opening statement.  The phrase he used was that farmers were not subject to fluctuations that occur in the international commodities market.  I wish that was the case.  This is one of the big issues we are going to have to deal with.  Even though we produce more food than we need, because of our current model and the fact we are restricted in the type of product we are producing, or the lack of diversity within our overall system, we are importing lots of feed which could be produced in Ireland.  It would require some farmers who are producing one thing at the minute to move and shift.  I note that when Mr. Keane spoke about diversification, and he referenced quite a number of potentials areas of diversification which I support in every case, there were very few which related to other types of food production.  I refer to the list of areas he mentioned such as on-farm energy reduction, anaerobic digestion, agritourism, energy crops, and organic farming.  Everyone remembers the mixed farming model of the Irish farm where there were some crops, a few cattle, possibly a few sheep, chickens in the back and all the rest.  It is a fairy tale and we are not going back to that.  Is Macra na Feirme of the view that there needs to be more of a mixed element on individual farms, if for no other reason than to protect farmers from the fluctuations that can occur in one particular market or another?  I will leave that as my final question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#O00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>It is not a simple one to answer but we will do our best.  The policy at an Irish level drove agriculture to where we are now.  We had huge diversification 25 years ago and had industries in sugar beet and larger sectors in tillage and so forth.  Policy drove specialisation and improvement and efficiencies, which returned and yielded for many farmers, but it reduced the variety operating on the farm.  Our diversification models, which were referenced by the Deputy, speak to what diversification looks like from a policy and Government point of view.  Diversification in terms of what we produce on a farm is a completely different story and is outlined in our opening statement as referring to opportunities outside of the standard farming practices be it tillage, dairy, beef, poultry or pigs.  To bring that point back to where we started, where is the investment in those and where are we creating the opportunities for the sector to move forward?  There was a question or a response in the D&aacute;il Chamber during the week about accessing a biomethane fund at a European level for which we did not apply.  I think we were one of two member states which did not apply for this.  If committee members put themselves in our shoes they would hear diversification being spoken about by Government representatives but the investment not following what we are saying.  If we are saying this is something we need to do, the funds need to follow and the investment needs to create the opportunity.  There is a &euro;3 million fund this year for a pilot scheme for research into anaerobic digestion.  Anaerobic digestion has been operating in Europe for 30 years.  How much more research do we need to see on whether the technology is going to work or not in Ireland?  We need investment for it to be implemented.<\/p> <p>   Regarding on-farm diversification, the security of supply for our basics, whether that is feed for livestock, forage, or necessary requirements in terms of what we import, is important.  If we can supply and grow these in Ireland, all the better.  That is something we should be driving forward and which Macra na Feirme would support.  If it creates more opportunity, all the better.  It has to be our model going forward.<\/p> <p>  As stated by some, there is no requirement for us to produce food but at the same time we should be looking at food production from a global food systems approach and not just in an individual country.  Each country and area of the world should be producing food that is suitable for its climate and which it is able to grow in its climate.  We are blessed in this country by what we can grow in our climate.  Expecting us to grow avocados or to be able to grow sunflowers is not something that can be done.  We can grow diversification on-farm and it is something we support.  The alternative source incomes which we mentioned here in connection to diversification will require investment.  Mr. Hanrahan will come in on this briefly.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>The first thing we could do, and what Macra na Feirme continues to do, is promote integration between farms.  Getting the systems to work together would be the first step and then farmers could diversify into different sectors within their own farms quite easily.  We have many policies and incentives on how to do that and on integrating land between dairy, beef, and tillage farmers, which we have put forward in submissions.  It could be very easily done and be very workable.  As Mr. Keane pointed out, we require investment for implementation and that is it.  When we have investment and implementation, the next generation will allow diversification.  Going back one step, ticking the boxes was mentioned.  Young farmers actually want to tick more boxes in order to get more.  The most important thing for us to outline here is that we are very much willing to work with what needs to be done and will tick more boxes for a little bit in return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Hanrahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee again.  They are probably here more often than some Deputies and Senators and it is good to have them back.  I always greatly appreciate their contributions.  They give an interesting perspective on farming that is somewhat at odds with some of the other farmer representation bodies and it is very good to hear it, particularly in relation to young farmers.  It is laudable what they are looking for in trying to control the cost of leasing and land transfers.  There are probably some Members of this House on the extreme left who will be very taken with their proposals but ultimately we live in a free market society and that is something that is going to be very hard to control.  The witnesses have to appreciate that on any sides of these transactions, there are two people; one who wants to get his optimum price and another we need to facilitate and help get into farming.  The statistics mention 30% of farmers in 2016 being over 65.  They are all obviously over 70 now and make up one third of all farmers in the country.<\/p><p>As we get closer to 70 ourselves, we like to think these farmers are very active but at the same time, you would have to wonder how productive those farmers are.  Looking at what Mr. Keane has presented, there are obviously some nuances.  There is no issue in dairy, whereas it is really pronounced in sheep and cattle.  Obviously, the SBCI offers an opportunity.  As I have been listening to the witnesses, I think what we need is a regionalised approach or a scheme concentrating on those areas such as peatlands and some of the lands most adversely affected.  The likes of Kilkenny does not need any incentives to get more people to farm, but the likes of Longford and Leitrim definitely do.  That is where we need it.  If we look at what Macra na Feirme wants to do in terms of integration and diversification, there is no lack of ambition.  Of the 5% of the farmers who are under 35, none of them are full-time farmers.  I would imagine most of them have an off-farm income, which brings in significantly more money than the farm and I am sure their wives would be indignant if they said they were going to go farming full-time.  At the same time, it is critically important we protect the family farm and I admire what they are trying to do.

In some localised areas we have seen tax incentives and investment savings offered for people to move into certain areas that have become depopulated, if that is what you want to call it, in order that these people support the local school and GAA club - or the local soccer club or whatever its equivalent on the Continent might be.  We have seen those type of schemes work in general to encourage people to repopulate areas.  I do not see why there could not be a tailored support for those areas where the age profile is higher and it would also mean there would be more inward investment in those rural communities because more young people would move in and children would be in school and so forth.  I do not see there being an issue there.  It is something we would have to think more about in terms of how something could be designed for the implementation of it.  The overarching point on a national perspective is we need to start with a suite of measures that work at a national level and then look at regional measures to be made in coherence with that or running alongside it, which will be sometimes be sector-specific.  In some areas, there is one predominant sector.  It could be beef or sheep that are predominant enterprises in certain areas.  What can we do to address the challenges for young people?

Our European partners through the European Council of Young Farmers, CEJA, could have, on a specialised beef or a dairy farm, three of four sources of income coming onto that farm.  This income could come from supplying an anaerobic digester, solar panels feeding the grid, the creation of wind energy and from their main - if you want to call it that - enterprise of beef or dairy farming.  That is what integration looks like to us.  The anaerobic digester is an opportunity for farmers to be able to get an alternative source of income.  As far back as 2010, none of three of us were involved in Macra na Feirme at that stage so we cannot take any credit for it.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Deputy Fitzmaurice was.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#P00700","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>He was doing the green certificate at that stage.<\/p> <p>  We had a proposal in around anaerobic digestion and its integration into agriculture and agrifood systems so we have been a long-proponent of it; particularly in areas where farming can be challenging or a large amount of farms that are either vulnerable or unenviable as classified by national farm survey.  This offers them an opportunity to be able to supply into these facilities.  The realisation must also dawn and what we have seen on the Continent, is that for one of these digesters to work efficiently and effectively and to have a value for the owner as well as for the farmer, there is no point in leaving a field go at the end of August and not cutting it again until the following June.  It is not getting the raw materials and energy that will give a good value and return from it.  On the Continent they are feeding whole crops, the likes of grain, maize, high-quality silage and grass into the digesters as well as digestate, slurry and other materials.

There is a very interesting last paragraph in their opening statement, where they say the <i>status quo<\/i>is not an option.  That kind of sums it up in one phrase.  It is a really fair line.  In many ways, there is a conflict between the young active farmer who is working the land at the moment and the potentially older farmer and where he is regarding the circle.  The contribution from the representatives is very valuable and it is important we take it on board.  I appreciate issues did not go their way, particularly in the last CAP.  That has to be acknowledged. <\/p><p>The stamp duty issue is one I continuously go back to.  Stamp duty relief for the head of the farm holding kicks in while the farmer is below 35 years of age.  This is no reflection on our parents but there is a cohort of people who will transfer the land on the last day of a person being 34 years of age.  Receiving their family landholding at the age of 35 is a major impediment to the young farming community getting involved at an active age.  I realise there is an income issue here.

It is a difficult one to answer.  From our perspective, the arbitrary figure of 35 is probably reflective of some of the age categories who are farming.  We are young farmers and, as has been commented on, we have the ambition to change the world in this document and what we want, rightly, to see happen.  We also have to be cognisant of the people who have gone before us and that we have inherited a system of agriculture that, when compared with the rest of the world, means we are very fortunate to be where we are.  From speaking to older farmers, one of the biggest impediments is financial security, and that is the number one issue that comes back.  What am I going to have if I give up the farm now and my son or daughter takes over?  We recognise that 35 or 34 years, 11 months and 30 days can be the deadline people are aiming for, but addressing the problem at source is probably a better way of going about it than changing the arbitrary figure.  In reality, someone could still be 55 and their son or daughter 30.  Fifty-five is a very young age for people to be thinking about retiring.  There should be a pathway for succession and partnerships, and we recognise partnerships are there.<\/p> <p>  The solution is providing a succession scheme that offers a realistic income for older farmers to step back and has supports for a young person to come forward.  We will send on to the committee the succession scheme we recently proposed to a number of the Food Vision groups.  I apologise for not attaching it to the end of the document.  That scheme includes a recognition of a farmer's working time of about 40 hours a week, a payment at minimum wage, and the incentives we have spoken about for younger farmers around investment support, TAMS and low-cost finance through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  Those are measures young farmers can use to start off.  There is a double side - support for the older and younger farmers.  That is the best approach.  There is also the benefit of experience still being at play on the farm.  We think we know it all as young farmers, that we are brilliant and fair play to us, but the reality is we lack life experience and the experience of changes in the environment and changes as time goes on.  On that benefit of experience, I know from my own experience that having the ear of my dad at home to listen to and get advice from can be valuable for making mistakes and so forth.  That is something we cannot discount either.  Older farmers still have a huge role to play, and simply writing them off is not fair either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Land access is the key issue in many farming circles.

The word \"sustain\" has been hijacked by many people and it is being used incorrectly.  Sustainable, from our perspective, means it is capable of regenerating itself.  That is why the family farm is so important, as Deputy Carthy mentioned.  If we go towards massive industrial-sized agriculture like in Saudi Arabia, the US and South America, we are reducing the number of people working on farms because of the economies of scale.  It will be about extracting the most production out of the most land and, with respect, to hell with everything else.<\/p> <p>  We come at this from a societal perspective.

If we were to leave farming as it is going and continue to exclude young farmers from coming into the industry, we are not far away from 30% aged over 70 at this stage and we are four years away from that becoming 30% over 75.  I know 70 is the new 60 and 60 the new 50 etc., but there has to be reason to this.

Where that needs to start is at the kitchen table.

We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee today to contribute to discussions it is having with stakeholders as part of its pre-legislative scrutiny of the veterinary medicinal products, medicated feed and fertilisers regulation Bill 2022.  Veterinary Ireland is the representative body for the veterinary profession in Ireland.  There are approximately 1,000 private veterinary practitioners, PVPs, engaged in farm animal veterinary practice who play a key role in the Irish agrifood industry.<\/p><p>Veterinary practitioners are the gatekeepers of animal health and animal welfare and, more pertinently, act as the gatekeepers in the supply of prescription only medicines, POMs.  This committee has heard sales of antimicrobial intramammary products through co-ops, merchants and pharmacies have fallen by a catastrophic 90% since January 2022 as a result of the cessation of Schedule 8 of the Animal Remedies Regulations 2007, which have been repealed.  Veterinary Ireland has access to the distribution data and will correct the record and outline the benefit that has been realised primarily to farmers but also to human health.<br\/><br\/>Since January 2022, the prescribing of intramammary antimicrobials has reduced by 25.3% and the prescribing of lactating cow intramammary antimicrobials has reduced by 6.5%.  This not only represents a prudent reduction in antibiotics but represents a saving to Irish farmers of approximately &euro;3.4 million in the first nine months of 2022.  The sales of intramammary antibiotics containing highest priority critically important antibiotics, HPCIAs, have reduced massively.  Cephaguard DC is down 73% and Cobactan LC is down 77%.  The sales of critically important antibiotics in injectable form, for example, Marbocyl, have also seen a collapse anecdotally.  Antiparasitic medicinal products have been designated as POM in Europe since 2007.  Ireland availed of a derogation from 2007 to 2019 to allow these products to be sold over the counter under the licensed merchant, LM, category.  The dispensing of these products is done by responsible persons, RPs, who are required to take a short level 6 course in handling, storage and dispensing of these products.  This category of product has never been prescribed in Ireland.  Any farmer or animal owner can purchase his or her product of choice over the counter in a store, pharmacy, or online shop.<br\/><br\/>The issue of antiparasitic resistance is a worldwide phenomenon and is both a public health issue and a serious issue for the agrifood industry in Ireland.  Farming livestock on grazing systems is only possible where parasitic disease can be managed effectively.  A study by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in 2016 outlined that 56% of worming interventions in sheep were not effective.  Kelleher <i>et al<\/i>in 2017 found extremely high levels of resistance to all groups of wormers in cattle.  The <i>Veterinary Record<\/i>recently published a report about a case of high mortality on a dairy farm in Wales where adult cows died due to inability to treat lungworm infections due to resistance.  In order to address the issue of resistance we must ensure the right product is given to the right animals at the right time; that refugia is maintained through selective, targeted treatments; and that parasite control becomes a planned farm-specific procedure.  The gateway to this outcome is through proper, scientific, farm-specific veterinary advice from the farmer's vet where a client practice patient relationship, CPPR, is in existence.  This advice must be ongoing and monitored, take account of farm specific issues such as epidemiology, pharmacology, the clinical picture, stocking densities, buying policy and local factors.  Once the farmer has a prescription for when to treat, what animals to treat and with what active ingredient, the farmer can fill the prescription from any legitimate channel in Ireland or across the EU.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has proposed the national veterinary prescription system, NVPS, one of the aims of which is to make it as easy as possible for farmers to fill their prescriptions at their outlet of choice.  Veterinary Ireland believes this development increases competition rather than diminishes it.  Veterinary medicine is a restricted profession governed by the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.  Only a registered veterinary practitioner can perform acts of veterinary medicine and it is illegal for others to do so.  This is not anti-competitive.  It is the law.  Acts of veterinary medicine are very few in reality and include: diagnosis of disease and advising on disease control; prescribing veterinary medicinal products; performing surgery on animals, with certain named exemptions; and veterinary certification.<br\/><br\/>The down side of being in this seemingly privileged position is that PVPs must adhere to the rules of the Veterinary Council of Ireland, VCI, and their code of professional conduct.  Failure to do so may result in a fitness to practice investigation which is the equivalent of High Court proceedings.  Defending oneself in a fitness to practice investigation is particularly onerous both mentally and financially with very few having the resources to avail of their constitutional right to appeal as it is through the High Court.  Only vets are subject to VCI rules.  Any other actors in the field cannot be held to account by VCI.  The thrust of this legislation is that all the responsibility rests with the prescribing vet.<br\/><br\/>The majority of antiparasitic medicinal products were classified as LM and therefore have never been prescribed in Ireland.  The NVPS was born out of a desire to fulfil two requirements of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, namely, to comply with the obligation under Article 57 on member states to collect data on the use of antimicrobial products per species; to satisfy co-ops, merchants, and pharmacists that veterinary prescriptions would be readily available; and to allow seamless dispensing to farmers and essentially level the playing field for dispensing.  The NVPS as proposed brings many more significant benefits to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, including providing evidence for improving national animal health and welfare policies; maintaining a competitive veterinary medicinal product, VMP, dispensing market; providing digital capability for distance selling; improving regulatory oversight of VMP usage and supply; and increasing international confidence in Irish food production.  There is no requirement to write prescriptions electronically in Regulation 2019\/6 or Regulation 2019\/4.  The obligation is on the member state to collect macro sales data and usage data at farm level.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, by way of derogation, has unilaterally decided to collect prescription data as a proxy for usage data.  It has decided to put the NVPS into primary legislation to force PVPs to either use it or retire from practice as opposed to the normal method of consultation and agreement with Veterinary Ireland to ensure the system was fit for use and to ensure unwarranted collection of data was not placing an undue burden on already stretched PVPs.  PVPs need assurances on how this data will be used, who might be able to access this data and that further additional requirements will not be thrust upon PVPs annually as was the case with the animal health computer system, AHCS.<br\/><br\/>Veterinary Ireland and the veterinary profession are proud of the key role PVPs play in the agrifood industry.  Veterinary Ireland believes that PVPs will rise to the challenges posed by the implementation of the regulation in order to protect human health; animal health and welfare; the efficacy of veterinary medicinal products; and the reputation of the Irish agrifood industry.  We ask this committee to ensure the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine engages with Veterinary Ireland to ensure a smooth and agreed integration of NVPS into veterinary practices that minimises the impact on the running of veterinary practices; enables PVPs to provide the clinical services required by the agrifood industry; and reduces the use of veterinary medicinal products prudently in compliance with the regulation.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chair.

Originally in the discussion with the antiparasitic resistance stakeholder group and the Veterinary Council of Ireland, we advocated that 12 months was too long for a prescription, which is universally accepted.  Something cannot be prescribed safely or ethically for 364 days' time.  The compromise that the council and the Department came up with was \"up to\" 12 months prescription as was highlighted at this committee last week or the week before.  The code of professional conduct states up to 12 months, but the onus is on us to justify anything we prescribe.  The proposed legislation also states up to 12 months.  In reality what we are talking about here with antiparasitic products specifically is that when a farmer and a PVP get together, such as in the parasite control targeted advisory service on animal health, TASAH, which is ongoing, they will come up with a general plan of what they will do to minimise use, to use more targeted treatments and maintain refugia which is the key element in reducing resistance on farms.  Outside of that, there is ongoing contact, both formal and informal.  Where farmers are working with their vets, there is ongoing contact.  You may have a plan but you will often get a phone call from someone asking, \"What will I do now or will I do it now?\" or saying, \"I have the fecal egg count results or the cattle are not thriving\" or asking, \"Should I bring in a sample as there is evidence of diarrhea?\"  That goes on all the time.  That is the way it will work in practice.  The up to 12 months timeframe was probably included to satisfy other stakeholders rather than the reality of what will happen on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Geraghty"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Yes but surely the objective of the Bill to reduce the use of products-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#S00400","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>The objective of the regulation is absolutely to reduce the use of products and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Geraghty"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>A 12 month prescription of a foolscap page of the products a farmer might want over 12 months does not make sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022102600002#S00600","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":175,"content":"<p>No vet that is answerable to the Veterinary Council could write a prescription of a foolscap page of products for a farmer and expect to defend it.

Dealing with cattle is slightly different from dealing with sheep.  For example, with sheep we maintain refugia by leaving a group of the animals undosed.  With cattle it is more about ensuring the pasture has a broad mix of worms and we are able to kill some of the worms on the pastures.  That means delaying the dose until the right time.<\/p> <p>  As to the Deputy's question as to who is best-placed to determine when that is, there is no doubt that many local factors are at play.

The difficulty is that we in this State did not do that when the British put in place the system whereby responsible persons are prescribing.  I have heard nothing to suggest that was anything other than either an oversight on the part of the Department or a belief within the Department that the role carried out by the responsible persons in pharmacists, licensed merchants, co-operatives and in veterinary practices was akin to prescribing.

People who do not know the sector are surprised to learn that vets prescribe and dispense, often in the exact same location at the same time.  It would not be tolerated in human health on an ongoing basis.  A number of discussions have centred on the notion of decoupling which takes place in other European countries where the vet is akin to the doctor and people would go elsewhere, as a way of avoiding further antiparasitic and antimicrobial resistance.  What is Mr. Geraghty's view on that and does he have concerns that a rouge or incompetent vet would be incentivised to potentially over-prescribe because they are also selling the product they are prescribing?  Every sector will have people of that nature.

Since January we have had full control of intramammary prescriptions and the opposite has been the case.  The vast majority of vets take their ethical duties and responsibilities to the Veterinary Council very seriously because there is a serious penalty.  If one ends up in front of the Veterinary Council, one is talking about four years of High Court proceedings.  It is a legal matter and we have helped and supported people during that process but the reality is that if it goes against them, an ordinary family business cannot go to the High Court for an appeal, which seems wrong because everyone is entitled to appeal.<\/p> <p>  The number of complaints against vets in Ireland is tiny.  The number of complaints against vets involved in farm animal practice are in single digits every year.  We do not have many rogue vets, so I will put that one out of the way.<\/p> <p>  On prescribing and dispensing, no one ever asked us whether we did or did not want it.  It was assumed that we did not want it.  There is a large number of vets in the country who do not carry a lot of stock but a certain number do.  If one takes it there are 450 to 500 people with licensed merchants licences, they are the practices that are interested in carrying stock.  That is out of 750, so there are another 300 who do not carry much stock or just carry what they need to treat animals.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that if it was decoupled in the morning, there would be a number of issues that would affect other actors in the field and, to be honest, I do not think it ever got to us because other people slammed it down first.  I am talking about end-users.  There is a bank holiday weekend coming up and if was I go to a cow on a Friday night and prescribe something, the farmer would be waiting until Tuesday morning to fill the prescription in a decoupled situation.<\/p><p>We are not talking about antiparasitics.  If you decouple, you decouple.  End users might not like that system.  As far as vets are concerned, we do not believe it will make that much difference because what is happening at the moment, unlike the human system, is that in many cases the prescription fee is included in the bit of margin on the product and all you end up with in a decoupled situation is getting charged double.  You are going to get a prescription fee on one side and a margin on the dispenser&rsquo;s side.<\/p><p> The human system in Ireland is a very expensive system.  An unconscionable amount of money goes into it.  As vets we would say we probably provide a better service on farms than those same farmers might get from their GPs.

I know the committee has a busy work programme so members' time is appreciated.  I am joined by Ms Tara Keane and Ms Orla O'Brien from my Department and I thank them for their work on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I understand a briefing note has been circulated so I will begin by setting out further background to the draft instruments for the three bodies.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Corporate Enforcement Authority and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority each perform important statutory functions which can lead to a range of enforcement activities.  They are a vital part of a robust regulatory framework that is responsive and reflects international best practice to facilitate enterprise and entrepreneurship while also protecting employees, members, creditors and consumers with appropriate safeguards.<\/p> <p>  All three statutory bodies have the power to take civil court proceedings or adopt administrative measures in certain circumstances to enforce the law in the public interest.  In addition, the bodies work closely with each other and other regulatory and enforcement authorities in Ireland and within the EU that have administrative and civil enforcement powers.  The Government is committed to ensuring that each body has the requisite legislative powers and resources to exercise their functions effectively.  Members of the committee are aware of the establishment of the Corporate Enforcement Authority as a stand-alone statutory body in July this year and the enhanced powers introduced for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in the Competition (Amendment) Act 2022.  The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority powers were also enhanced most recently in the Companies (Statutory Audits) Act 2018.<\/p> <p>  When the General Data Protection Regulation was introduced in 2018, it strengthened the rights of individuals in respect of the privacy and fair use of their personal data.  It also introduced a balancing provision under Article 23 to ensure that this did not undermine the statutory functions of public bodies.  Accordingly, section 60 of the Data Protection Act 2018 provides that the statutory instruments we are considering today may be introduced to protect important objectives of general public interest.  Examples of the objectives specified in the Act and included in the draft instruments are avoiding obstructions to any official or legal inquiry; taking any action for the purpose of considering and investigating a complaint made to a regulatory body in respect of persons carrying out a profession or other regulated activity; and preventing, detecting, investigating or prosecuting breaches of the law that are subject to civil or administrative sanctions.  What is being prevented by the regulations, therefore, is the potential for data protection rights to be used as a way of undermining these and other essential functions.  This could be done by way of a data access request or multiple requests seeking the disclosure and possibly amendment or deletion of information that is part of an active investigation or inquiry that therefore fundamentally undermines the processes under way.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the content of the draft regulations, each is composed on the same lines of policy and technical approach.  They were prepared with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and in close consultation with the three bodies.  The regulations respect the right to data protection including the interests of the data subject.  The data subject's rights are only restricted insofar as is necessary and proportionate to protect the functions of the statutory agencies.  First, any restrictions must be considered on a case-by-case basis following an assessment of the relevant circumstances.  Second, safeguards are in place obliging the CCPC, the CEA, and IAASA to notify the data subject and provide reasons for the restriction, unless to do so may prejudice the achievement of a relevant objective.  Third, the data subject must be informed of the right or obligation affected by the restriction, whether the restriction applies in whole or in part, and of the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Commission.  The proposed measures also require the bodies to have in place certain policies and procedures relating to safeguards to prevent abuse or unlawful access or transfer of data and purposes of the processing or categories of processing.  The measures also require that each body ensures that all information provided in relation to these regulations is provided in a clear, concise and accessible manner.<\/p> <p>  In accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act, my Department consulted with the Data Protection Commission and the Minister for Justice on the draft regulations.  Following that consultative process, the Data Protection Commissioner wrote to confirm that the commission has identified no matter which is of significant concern in relation to the proposed regulations.  The Minister for Justice has also acknowledged her agreement with the proposed measures.<\/p><p>The legal instruments are balanced and proportionate and there are strong policy reasons for adopting the restrictions sought.  There is a reasonable expectation that the absence of restrictions to access to personal data will pose a serious risk to the statutory functions of these high-profile bodies.  It is in the public interest that they are able to function effectively and efficiently.  For the purposes of their civil and administrative enforcement functions, it appropriate that they be permitted to avail of the section 60 restrictions.<\/p><p> I recommend to the committee that the statutory instruments are necessary and balanced.

I know the committee did a lot of work on this before I took over this brief with my predecessor, Deputy Troy.<\/p> <p>  As members know, the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Acts 2003 to 2019 to increase the number of personal injury claims resolved by the board without recourse to litigation.  It was clear during the Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il that in the main, the Bill was positively received by Deputies across all parties.  The resounding message from that debate was the need for reform.  The valuable work the board undertakes was mentioned by many Deputies during the Second Stage debate and I agree that this work should in no way be undermined.  The changes proposed by this Bill have been carefully considered in consultation with the board and are aimed at strengthening the current model to resolve a greater number of personal injury claims.  Deputies raised a number of questions during the debate and we engaged with a number of them afterwards.  This includes Deputies O'Reilly, Shanahan and Flaherty, along with Senators Mullen, Crowe and Casey and I thank them for meeting me and engaging with me to tease out those issues further.<\/p> <p>  Arising from those discussions and based on input from the board, pending drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, I intend moving three amendments on Report Stage.  The first amendment is a new section in the Personal Injuries Resolution Board Bill 2022, to provide for an amendment to section 69 of the principal Act to ensure that mediators appointed from a panel are provided the same level of indemnity as mediators who are staff members.  The second amendment will introduce another section to the Bill and provide for a review of the Bill.  The third amendment is a technical amendment to section 23 of the Bill to enable the proper commencement of the Bill.<\/p><p> My intention is to move forward with this legislation swiftly.

However, if evidence is being given remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, witnesses may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present may.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.

Today I am joined by three colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Ms Jenny Connors, Dr. Patrick Moran, and Ms Caroline O'Loughlin, alongside colleagues from the Department of Finance.<\/p> <p>  The medium-term expenditure framework, published in the summer economic statement for 2021, outlined the strategy to set core expenditure growth rate at sustainable levels of approximately 5% per annum and to provide for ongoing improvements in public services.  Developments in 2022 have altered the economic landscape significantly.  As part of the this year's summer economic statement, the growth rate for expenditure in 2023 was adjusted upwards.  The Government&rsquo;s objectives for budget 2023 are: to continue to invest in public services and infrastructure through core expenditure without further adding to inflationary pressures; to provide a comprehensive response to the cost-of-living pressures for households, businesses and wider society; and to ensure sufficient resources to respond to external challenges, including Covid-19, Brexit and the Ukrainian humanitarian response.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2023 allocated &euro;90.4 billion in gross voted expenditure for next year.  This is made up of &euro;74.3 billion in core current expenditure for the delivery of public services, &euro;11.6 billion in core capital expenditure as set out in the national development plan, and &euro;4.5 billion in non-core expenditure.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2023 contains a significant response to support households, public and community services and businesses with inflationary pressures.  This includes both once-off and permanent measures, including a &euro;2.2 billion winter cost-of-living package for households with three energy credits for all households and a series of additional social protection and education payments.  In addition, a Christmas bonus will be paid to eligible social protection recipients in 2022.  In recognition of the unprecedented rise in energy bills, Government is also making available &euro;340 million in 2022 to provide further support to public and community services.  The Government is also introducing a &euro;200 million Ukraine emergency response scheme to support businesses.<\/p> <p>  Budget 2023 also includes a number of core permanent spending measures, focusing on cost of living, with an estimated value of &euro;1.3 billion, including a &euro;12 weekly social protection rate increase for working age and pension payments and an increase in the universal subsidy on the national childcare scheme.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 2 of the Budget 2023: Expenditure Report sets out an analysis of the impact of the various cost-of-living, tax and social protection measures.  Households are estimated to record an average gain in weekly disposable equivalised income of 3% as a result of budget 2023, with the overall impact being strongly progressive.  The disposable income of those in the first three income deciles is estimated to increase by an average of 5.2%.  This demonstrates the important role of social protection measures at the lower end of the income distribution.<\/p> <p>  I shall turn now to budget day publications.  Budget 2023 saw the development and publication of key budgetary documentation such as Budget 2023: Expenditure Report.  This document sets out the public expenditure strategy, expenditure allocations by Vote and the Estimates for public services.  This year the report included detail regarding cost-of-living measures and non-core funding required to respond to external shocks.  A series of additional analytical papers were also published this year, including Budget 2023: Forecasting Live Register Recipients and Expenditure, and a paper on the use of carbon tax funds.  In addition to these publications, The Budget in Brief: A Citizen's Guide to Budget 2023 was published.  This provides a high level overview of the budget decisions in a clear and accessible format.<\/p> <p>  It is useful to consider the range of budgetary documents alongside the budgetary reform initiatives as part of a whole-of-year budgeting process.  These initiatives place an emphasis on broadening the approach to how public expenditure is appraised, implemented and reviewed across Departments.  This is also alongside examining the impact of public expenditure among different cohorts of society and on the different types of objectives we want to achieve.  It is with this more complete type of understanding that policymakers can work towards the achievement of value for money in the context of the entire budgetary process and enhance the impact of these policies and programmes.  The range of budgetary reform initiatives include the public spending code, the national development plan, performance budgeting, equality budgeting, green budgeting, well-being budgeting and the spending review process.<\/p> <p>  A range of papers and strategies are produced throughout the calendar year, including the public service performance report, which was published in May, the National Economic Dialogue 2022 held in June, the summer economic statement and mid-year expenditure reports published in July, the spending review papers, which are generally published in two tranches in August and in September, the budgetary publications which I have previously referred to, and the Revised Estimates Volume in December.  This demonstrates the breadth of information feeding into the preparation of the budget and the ongoing management of public expenditure in a planned, balanced, and evidence-informed manner.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it and I look forward to answering members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Callaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Callaghan.

This process began in earnest with the National Economic Dialogue 2022 on 20 June in Dublin Castle, where participants debated a wide range of challenges facing the economy at this time.  This was followed by the publication of the summer economic statement, which set out the Government&rsquo;s fiscal strategy and the parameters for the subsequent budget.  As the committee will recall, the Government set out a medium-term budgetary strategy in last year&rsquo;s summer economic statement outlining a plan for keeping the public finances on a sustainable trajectory while allowing for reductions in personal taxation and continuing to invest in public services.<\/p> <p>  For this year, in the context of the changed economic environment, the Government departed temporarily from the parameters set out in the medium-term plan.  To deliver a cost-of-living budget, the Government doubled the size of the planned tax package and increased public expenditure.  The intention is that this will be a one-time departure in recognition of the exceptional circumstances we find ourselves in.<\/p> <p>  The process for budget 2023 took place in a uniquely abbreviated timeframe.  In response to the pressing challenges facing the economy arising from the cost-of-living issue, the Government decided it was appropriate to bring forward the budget by two weeks from its usual date in early October.  Following the summer economic statement, the tax strategy group set out policy options for consideration by Government across a range of tax policy areas as well as PRSI.  The tax strategy group met on 12 July and the group's papers were published on 10 August.<\/p> <p>  The next staging post in the budget documentation was the publication of the White Paper on receipts and expenditure, which sets out a no-policy-change baseline estimate of the fiscal position for this year and next.  In line with standard practice, this is published the Friday immediately preceding the budget to take account of the latest economic and fiscal data and to provide figures that are as accurate as possible.  Accordingly, the White Paper this year was published on Friday, 23 September.<\/p> <p>  The documentation published as part of budget 2023 is comprehensive and aims to provide as much information as possible to the Oireachtas and the public.  The core documentation published by the Department of Finance includes the Budget 2023: Tax Policy Changes document, which sets out the detail on budget tax changes across all heads, Budget 2023: Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which contains revised macroeconomic and fiscal projections out to 2025, and this year the Department also published a new document, Beyond GDP: Quality of Life Assessment.  This included a distributional analysis of the impact of the tax and welfare changes that were announced as well as further analysis from a well-being, equality and green budgeting perspective to complement the more traditional macro fiscal analysis.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the key headline points of budget 2023.  The total budget package for next year is &euro;6.9 billion, consisting of around &euro;1.1 billion in new taxation measures and &euro;5.8 billion in public expenditure.  In addition to this, there was a once-off package of cost-of-living supports to be introduced this year at a cost of &euro;4.1 billion.  This brings the total budgetary package across the two years to &euro;11 billion.  This is consistent with a general government surplus this year of &euro;1 billion, or 0.4% of modified national income, GNI*.  For next year, the surplus is projected to increase to about &euro;6.2 billion, or 2.2% of GNI*.  However, as the committee will be aware, the very positive headline figures are heavily skewed by windfall corporation tax receipts.  The Government has frequently warned that this windfall revenue, while in many respects welcome, cannot be relied upon and must not be used to fund permanent expenditure commitments.  That being the case, budget 2023 incorporates a new metric, the underlying general government balance, GGB, or GGB*, which sets out the fiscal position if these windfall receipts were excluded.<\/p><p>This metric suggests that removing excess corporate tax would lead to a significant deficit this year in the region of &euro;8 billion.  For next year we would face a deficit of about &euro;3.8 billion.<\/p><p> In recognition of this vulnerability, the Government has decided to commit part of this excess to the national reserve fund.  A transfer of &euro;2 billion will be made this year, rising to &euro;4 billion next year.  This will enable the Government to take advantage of windfall corporate tax receipts by rebuilding fiscal buffers and providing resources that can be drawn down to meet future challenges while ensuring we do not allow unreliable tax revenue to fund ongoing permanent spending measures.<\/p><p> Budget 2023 was framed in recognition of the urgent challenges the economy faces, both through an expanded budget package and an accelerated timeline.  It takes action to address the cost-of-living issue while outlining a credible pathway for rebuilding our fiscal buffers for the future.  My colleagues and I are happy to try to address any issues the committee would like to raise.  As members will appreciate, the budget covers a wide range of areas within the Department and it would not have been practical to bring all the lead officials to cover them today.  As such, if there are specific issues outside of our remits, we are happy to get our colleagues to follow up afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cassidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as teacht os comhair an choiste.  We all appreciate there is a lot in the budget but my questions will not be that specific so the witnesses will be more than able to answer them.<\/p> <p>  I want to mention one of the issues I had when trying to interpret the budget, and I am sure others had the same issue.  I do not come from the same background as the witnesses so sometimes it can be difficult when reading the terminology that can be used because it is not always consistent.  There were different categorisations in budget 2023, which created some problems.  There is core, non-core, temporary, once-off, allocated and unallocated funding and spending.  Some of them are established terms but some are not as established and sometimes they can be used interchangeably and, as we felt, inconsistently.  I do not have a question on that; I just wanted to comment on it.  I checked the public financial procedures document for guidance, but that handbook is some years out of date and some of the terms are not defined at all.  We want as many people as possible to be able to read the budget if they so wish, although I am not sure how many people would sit down to do so, but it assumes a strong level of insider knowledge and you must be part of the furniture of the process to read it.  It is important to note that and look at it so that others like me can read the budget more easily.<\/p> <p>  Most of my questions are for the officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but I have a quick question for Mr. Cassidy on the GGB and the windfall corporation tax element.

One of the things that comes up a lot at the moment is the issue of having capital carryover.  There is a massive issue with housing targets and there can be delays to other infrastructure.  We know a lot of it is to do with construction sector capacity.  In 2018, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform established the construction sector group that comprised multiple Departments, State bodies and construction sector industry partners and participants.  Several important documents have been published on how we could transition to modern methods of construction.  I also sit on the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, and today we had the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, before us and we touched on modern methods of construction in terms of productivity, turnaround time and environmental performance.  It seems to me the progress in that has been a bit slow.  Is there anything being done to speed that up?  If that is not something somebody here can cover, that is no problem and I can move on to my next question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#D00600","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":347,"content":"<p>We do not have colleagues from the capital section here but I can answer generally.  The national development plan, NDP, was published back in 2021.  It sets out &euro;165 billion in expenditure out to 2030 and a number of reforms are also set out in that document, of which the Deputy may be aware.  One of those was to set up a Project Ireland 2040 delivery board which oversees the delivery of the NDP.  Two major reforms within that were the introduction of independent external reviews of projects in excess of &euro;100 million at two decision points in the project life cycle.  We also have a major projects advisory group set up in our Department to review those business cases.  That is looking to strengthen the process we go through for large projects, but a number of issues have been highlighted around the significant underspending in capital expenditure, and the Deputy has alluded to some of them.  There were ongoing supply chain issues and delays, there was some progress in the contracts due to Covid and then there were challenges in the labour supply.

Ms Callaghan mentioned in her opening statement the issue of one-off payments as part of the cost-of-living package.  I wondered about the likes of those payments that are recurring in nature.  One thing I have not really fully understood since being here is the Christmas bonus, which is recurring but is seen as a surprise every year.  I have pointed out that this has been a recurring measure since 2014 but it is classified as a once-off payment.  Obviously, I understand that gives flexibility in that it can be withdrawn if there is a crisis.  What is the Department's view of continuing it is a once-off payment rather than realising it is recurring?  It is just kind of announced as something on budget day when everybody really knows it is a recurring payment.  I would also argue that it speaks to short-term solutions being used for more longer-term problems.  The general inadequacies of the social welfare system are these kinds of one-off payments that are really recurring things.

There are decisions to be taken around that and it is dependent on the fiscal position in year.

I will ask a question about that in a minute.<\/p><p>On the overall view of the budget, however, it was suggested that the overall impact of the budget is &quot;strongly progressive&quot;.  In a contribution to us last week, a representative of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, stated that when we disregard the one-off measures:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe effect of permanent 2023 policy measures to inflation-proofed policies for 2020 gives an indication of the more medium-term challenges facing households and policy-makers.  Compared with indexing tax and welfare policies in line with inflation since 2020, budget 2023 leaves households worse off on average. <\/blockquote> <p>I understand the ESRI is saying that if we strip out the once-off measures, people are left worse off.  It also said that pensioners and lone parents are &quot;likely to experience average income losses&quot; and that the increase in the cut-off rate for the standard rate of tax was going to favour higher-income households.  This would challenge the view put forward here that it is &quot;strongly progressive&quot;.  I am curious as to how the Departments would respond to the ESRI's assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#E00900","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I will perhaps lead off and then other people might want to come in.  We published, and have done for a couple of years, a distributional analysis of the budget.  This one was contained what we have been referring to as the third budget document, that is, the quality of life or Beyond GDP document.  This is what our distributional analysis shows.  We separated the 2022 measures from the 2023 measures.  There might have been a temptation to lump them one on top of the other because it looks bigger, but it is affecting people's incomes in different years.  It would be a bit disingenuous if that was done and, therefore, we separated 2022 from 2023.  Looking at the 2022 measures, we see the largest increases in income to the first three deciles, which are, on average, a 4.5% increase compared to 1.4% for deciles four to ten.  Then, it is similar for the 2023 measures but the increase for the first three deciles is even larger at 5.2%.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy stated, the ESRI analysis does say that with the once-off measures, lower-income households will be better off in inflation-adjusted terms.  It is important to clarify that our analysis is not inflation adjusted.  It is in nominal terms whereas the ESRI's analysis is inflation adjusted.  Neither is wrong; they are just asking different questions.  We would argue that ours is less complex and simpler, but perhaps more communicable, because it shows people the change to their income before and after the budget purely as a result of the budgetary measures.  The ESRI shows the change compared to a hypothetical inflation-adjusted scenario for 2023, or a multi-annual one to which the Deputy referred.  Obviously, one of the key assumptions in the inflation-adjusted scenario is the inflation projection.  If the inflation projection or the number is different then it will completely change the results of the analysis.  That is not to say it is not legitimate.  It is, but it is just doing a different thing to what we do, which is looking at it on a purely nominal basis.  Doing that inflation-adjusted analysis for the next year is dependent on the projection.  Doing it on a current year basis for 2022 is really difficult.  That is why the ESRI actually goes back to 2020, rebuilds 2021 and then compares it across 2022 - all the measures across the year - to a hypothetical rebuilt 2021 population, so it is even more complex.<\/p> <p>  On the point about excluding the one-off measures, I am not really convinced of why the one-off measures are excluded.  That is real money that is going to people and going into their income.  The one-off measures are very significant.  The reason why the budget utilised those one-off measures is because of the broader environment in which the budget was framed, which was extreme unprecedented uncertainty, most obviously in the case of inflation.  To be fair to the ESRI, I watched last week's session and Dr. Karina Doorley said the use of the one-off measures was a good solution in the face of the level of uncertainty in which the budget was framed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt McGann"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Is it fair to say, though, taking into account the projected level of inflation, particularly because a lot of the once-off measures will have an impact shortly, that, as we head into next year, after the bump people will get from the one-off measures, the ESRI's assessment will be correct, that is, that people will see income losses and that certain groups, particularly vulnerable ones, will be worse off, notwithstanding the fact that the ESRI says exactly what has been said here, that is, that initial-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#F00100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I do not think it is totally accurate to say that because what the ESRI said is that the welfare increases in 2022 and 2023, together with the one-off measures, are large enough to leave the lowest income households better off, on average, than they would have been had welfare payment rates risen in line with inflation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt McGann"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I accept the point about the ESRI's comments but, overall, it was quite positive about the Government's response cushioning the lowest deciles.

In our response we stripped out the once-offs and redid the analysis for next year and the welfare package for 2023 was found to be progressive.  For the lowest decile, we found that there would be a gain of about 3.7%, down to about 2.9% for the third decile.  However, I take the point made about that landing in people's pockets.

The point which the Opposition makes and which the Government sort of acknowledges is that we would be better off phasing out and moving away from those schemes and that if we had our own housing stock, we would be able to start to reduce reliance on the HAP, RAS and leasing payments.

I think it identifies &euro;7.7 billion of tax expenditures as the ones it looked at, the large ones, the significant ones or whatever, but it does not include intra-group transactions.  I am curious about that because in the Revenue tables, intra-group transactions are by far and away the biggest, by multiples of all the others.

We are always trying to improve upon transparency and get that balance right.  It is a wide audience, which includes the public, Deputies, the media and academics.  However, as I say, when one looks at some of the boxes and tables within the economic fiscal outlook, they are very much designed to walk people through some of the very technical issues facing the economy at the moment.

The amount of money involved in the budget can be overwhelming.  When you read documents and reports, you get confused.  I am concerned when Revenue bring forward a set of figures that are different from the Department's set of figures and are working from a different base.  There needs to be common approach to how reporting is done, be it from Revenue or somewhere else.<\/p> <p>  To pick up on Deputy Boyd Barrett's point about the breakdown of particular spends, when the witnesses say we are spending so much on housing and there is a top-line figure, underneath that a breakdown is there before budget day.  I presume it is not the case that they are picking a figure and try to match figures to it afterwards.  It is there beforehand.  There is a scientific proposition regarding this.  It is important that as a budgetary oversight committee, we see more of how things are done.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the capital cost under-runs last year and the year before and how they are accounted for, do they just go back into the pot and we start afresh the following year?  In the past couple of years, we have underspends.  We might have overspends given inflation.  How does the Department track that going through the year or going through the process?  For example, in the area of housing, does it get a quarterly report from every local authority setting out what they spent?  Does it get reports from any Department regarding how money is being spent?  Is it being tracked or does the Department wait until the end of the year when the all the receipts are in?  How is that done and how is that accounted for?  If there is a programme of works to be done and there is expenditure to go with it, if the expenditure is not coming up to what it should be in the projections, obviously the programme has fallen behind and perhaps corrective action could be taken during the course of the year rather than leaving it and finding out it has fallen short.  I do not know how that can be done.  <\/p> <p>  When Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy was here last week, he spoke about how a &euro;20 increase for those on a fixed income should have been a baseline, as opposed to an increase of &euro;12.50.  The &euro;20 increase was to meet inflation.  He said this was a missed opportunity.

This must also be taken in the context of the budget parameters that were provided and with spend across other areas of public expenditure.  The &euro;12 was taken in that context - that it is not just a rate increase that was provided.

This was discussed at the committee in February.  As Ms Connors said, it is not simple.   It can quite complex.  The first question concerns whether you are indexing to wages or to inflation.  Indexing to wages looks more natural when you are thinking about the tax system because if wages are moving up, people are moving up into higher brackets.  Indexing to wages allows people on social welfare to maintain parity with people with paid income whereas indexing to prices allows them to maintain their purchasing power.  Even if you index to wages, it is a question of what is the appropriate metric to use.  The ESRI uses compensation of employees but this is like a wage bill for the entire economy.  That has numbers in it.  It is impacted by the number of people at work, which is not necessarily the same thing as people's rate of pay - weekly earnings that have hours or hourly earnings.  There is still the question of whether you are using projections or a figure from the previous year.  If you are using projections, obviously they can be higher or lower if you over-compensate and the figures come in lower.<\/p><p>I believe a suggestion was made at the committee that it could be retracted the following year by giving a lower amount to balance it out, which, from a political economy perspective, might not be as easy as in theory.  There are also data revisions.  Considerable Irish data are linked to a metric but there can be revisions to the data.<\/p><p> The wider consideration is about flexibility.  The great trade-off is that you lose flexibility in your budgetary policy setting every year.  It might mean the Government of the day has less room to target resources to a particular area to which it wishes to target resources, because this automatic indexation has been locked in.  A relevant example is in the UK where it has had the triple lock on pensions.  A commitment was made that pensions were to rise by whichever was the highest of wages, inflation or - I cannot remember - a hard-wired 2.5% or 3%.  However, the UK has had to walk back from that, and not just because of the considerable volatility of inflation.  Even before the invasion of Ukraine, it had problems with the triple lock because the nature of how employment fell during Covid meant people at the bottom of the income distribution or lower earners more prominently fell out of work.  Arithmetically, that pushed up average wages.  More people who lost work were average earners and the average wage growth became quite large because of a compositional arithmetic issue.  That can be the problem with tying yourself to a specific metric.<\/p><p> It has implications for people's legitimate expectations as well because one of the benefits of automatic indexation is that people have some certainty about what will happen next year.  People were told they have a triple lock which, by its nature, sounds guaranteed but it has not been deliverable due to unexpected circumstances or volatility and inflation and the UK has had to walk back from that.  There are benefits such as certainty but it can be complex.  That should be part of the consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt McGann","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Is there a conflict between increasing social welfare and the lower income workers who feel they would be better off not working because student grants and such like would be easier to get?

How do the Departments monitor or do analysis on that?

It might take considerable time to answer but I ask for the representatives' thoughts on it.  Do the Departments analyse or monitor whether work is paying?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#J00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":416,"content":"<p>We obviously do analysis on replacement rates as well as the distributional analysis to inform the budget.

The policy area is for the Departments of Social Protection and Health but it is something we look at ourselves.  We carry out that analysis through the spending review process.  A good example of that was probably through Covid and some of the work that was done around the work incentives with the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.

The Department has done significant work in this area to look at the overall volatility associated with some of those receipts.

Mr. McGann's team led a paper to look at that very specific issue to identify excess receipts and build a new statistic of what public finances look like on an underlying basis when some of those windfall receipts are taken away.  We are forecasting a surplus this year of approximately &euro;1 billion.

On the Deputy's specific question, the other point to bear in mind is the extraordinary level of increases in corporation tax receipts we have seen, which have gone from less than &euro;5 billion 2014 to heading above &euro;21 billion this year.  I think the receipts were at &euro;12 billion in 2020.  It has been &euro;12 billion to &euro;15 billion to &euro;21 billion in two years.<\/p> <p>  The other point is the concentration risk.  Half of that is coming from just ten large payers.  We do not know who those payers are, as that is Revenue confidentiality.  However, Revenue identifies that it is not the same ten every year.  We know it changes slightly.  It is a huge concentration risk.  Because corporation tax receipts are now almost 25% of total receipts, that means one in eight of total tax receipts is coming from those ten large payers.  That is not factoring in the income tax that is also associated with those multinationals.<\/p> <p>  On identifying it, that is in firm specifics and we are into confidentiality issues because it is such a small number of firms.  That is why we took a more statistical approach in the paper we did in September.  We can send it on to the committee or I can go through in boring detail how we estimated windfall.  Essentially, the truth is that nobody can definitively say what the quantum of structural or potentially at-risk receipts is, which everybody acknowledges.  We took a suite-of-models approach.  We looked about five or six different ways at the potential windfall and we took the mid-range of those five or six different models.  Based on that, we estimated that from last year&rsquo;s receipts, the windfall could be in the region of &euro;4 billion to &euro;6 billion.  For this year, we are talking about &euro;9 billion and next year &euro;10 billion of receipts that are potentially transient or volatile.  This is where we then remove that new figure and take it out of the budget balance.  Everybody is thrilled to get a new acronym, GGB*, under which, if you take out those windfall receipts, instead of a surplus, we have an &euro;8 billion deficit.  Of course it is great to get these receipts and they are not unwelcome.  However, we have to be cognisant that there are not potential vulnerabilities building up within the public finances.  As I alluded to earlier, that is what happened in the financial crisis, where we had a huge reliance on the property-related receipts.  We lost one third of our tax revenues in two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt McGann"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":425,"content":"<p>We are regularly warned about dependence on or possible flight of the multinational corporations.  Of course, we need to recognise one thing.  First, it is good to have them there and it is a good sign of our economy that they remain and want to remain here.  They will all be hit by international events at present and we need to take that into account.  Things do not go on forever.  We need also to be looking at possible other avenues of revenue we can rely on in the future, not in any way to overlook or minimise the contribution being made by the corporate sector at present, but to recognise we should not depend entirely on it as we did in the case of the construction sector at the time of the crash.  However, that was not the only reason for the collapse at that time.<\/p> <p>  The question always remains that we must have a budgeted balance.  We must spend in a way that is in the national interest, not to live today and let somebody else pick up the tab tomorrow.  It is very responsible of us to recognise that at some stage in the future we might well be asked to take cuts, perhaps as bad as before - I do not know.  That depends on the effect of the war in Ukraine and what happens as a result.  However, the fact is we need to use carefully the funds we have.  We need to ensure we are prudent in our spending and do not borrow to spend.  We had to do it in some circumstances in recent years, but it is to be hoped we will not have to do it anymore.  We should save for unforeseen events as we go along.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  I heard politicians in the House stating repeatedly that we did not need to save and did not need a rainy day fund, that it is raining now so we should spend it now.  That is fine and it sounds good.  However, it will lead to a disaster if we repeat the mistakes of that particular era.  There are always the flowery speeches politicians make and I am sure I make them myself, though I try not to.  The flowery bit might not relevant but the exaggeration might well be.  The point is we need to realise we have to be careful in our dealings in this area and these fragile times in which we live.  We should not try to expect to enter the economy and fund it deliberately to keep people afloat and then do the same the next year and the year following.  That can only be done with the new resources.  It may well have political consequences for those who are in the driving seat at the time, but the fact remains the Government cannot buy its way out of difficulties all of the time.  Anywhere that has happened in the past, it has gone awry.  Look at a place such as Venezuela, which has lots of resources, and the situation it is in now.  We need to be very careful and sound in our economics, recognising and reading the future carefully and taking measures that do not get involved in creating or extending inflation.  We have to pay for our own running costs, as it were.  We have to pay for our own economy insofar as we can, except in extreme emergency.<\/p> <p>  We have to tell the people as we go along that there are easier ways to do it and we can live less frugally and gain more.  That is fine and I have heard all of that before.  I do not want to go apologising to economists all over again about all of the things they said and I said about them in the past.  We need to keep a close, cold and hard eye on reality as we move forward carefully. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#K00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for that.

We would identify with so much of what he said.  In particular, if we are looking for examples, just before we moved into the Covid period, we registered a surplus of about &euro;2 billion or so.  Why was that important?  It was important from a public finances point of view because it gave us the platform and foundation on which we could then support the broader economy through the various measures that were put forward at that time.  Again, because the public finances were in order, the Government had the confidence of the markets behind it.  We still have the confidence of the markets, but that can turn very quickly.  As we have seen elsewhere, that can turn very quickly if a government is not managing those public finances in a coherent and sustainable fashion.  That is ultimately what the Government strategy was about, when you look at we were trying to do at the time of the summer economic statement, SES, in particular, last year.  We had to get that balance right between continued investment in the productive capacity of the economy and putting the public finances on a sustainable trajectory at the same time to prepare the economy to ensure the markets did not turn on us and we were in a stronger position to respond to these types of challenges that we have been facing.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, as the Deputy has seen, they are becoming more and more frequent.

We can provide detail on the individual programmes of work but, in general, all those pieces of work take the same sort of trajectory.  The idea is we want to align expenditure with the outputs we want to achieve and then try to track the changes in those outcomes over time so that we are confident we are using resources and getting the most value for money out of them in making progress.<\/p> <p>  Two streams of work are going on in respect of the well-being budget.  One is looking at the overall national picture and the national well-being indicators that are published on the Central Statistics Office, CSO, website.  We are gathering data on how the country is faring over time as regards those types of outcomes.  We also track expenditure across all the Departments that is targeted at effecting those outcomes.  At present, as the Deputy knows, the budget tells us what Departments got what in the allocation.  We are engaging in a piece of work that will involve tagging all expenditures across all the different Departments to see how much is being spent on each of those wellness areas, including mental and physical health, safety and everything else.  That is the well-being bit.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, with green budgeting, we want to be able to track Ireland's performance as regards how we are faring and to be able to tie that back into how much of the country's resources we are allocating into each of those areas and make that link more explicit.  The benefit of doing that is threefold.  It tends to produce better prioritisation and agenda-setting discussions within Departments.  It also feeds into the whole embedding of evidence into policymaking and the formulation of policy but also how we evaluate it afterwards to make sure we have met policy goals.  Finally, many of the climate change and well-being targets do not live in one Department alone but are across many different Departments.  This sort of performance budgeting framework allows better strategic alignment across Departments that are all working towards the same goal.<\/p> <p>  As I said, if there is any specific information the Deputy wants on any of those programmes, we would be happy to tell her about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#L01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Moran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022102600002#L01800","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I do not see anybody raising their hand to come back in.

There will probably be no meaningful reduction in the cost of living between now and the next budget we put together.  By focusing so much on once-off payments we have not bridged that gap or at least we will have a wider gap to bridge the next time around and indexation would perhaps have been part of the answer to that.

On the indexation of pensions, not to make life difficult to pensioners but they are one of the cohorts who are best protected by our social welfare and it seems slightly ironic they are the ones who are now going to get indexation.

There are a couple of things.  First, we go through a very rigorous process in the run-up to the budget allocations.

You could look at public expenditure as three different elements.  Public sector pay is a big element of how we deliver services, and that has obviously been dealt with in the context of the new extension of the Building Momentum pay deal.

Obviously, they are kept under review throughout the year, and I alluded to the fiscal monitor and the ongoing reporting that is in place.  We are absolutely alive to those issues.

By bringing our debt levels down, we build our fiscal buffers and the markets take cognisance of that.  It is about generally pursuing, for want of a better word, sensible macro fiscal policy, and we have seen in the UK what can happen when you do not, as Mr. Cassidy alluded to earlier.  The problem with market discipline is that it is not linear or uniform.  It can go away and the markets do not seem interested in you, and then it comes back very suddenly and very heavy.  Especially for a small country, that can be really brutal.  We know from our own history that we went into the financial crisis with 25% of debt to GDP, but even the Latvians and Lithuanians, who did not have the kind of financial crisis we had, went in with debt in the 30% or 40% range and got priced out of the market.  One does not have to hold Latvian or Lithuanian debt.  A fund manager needs to hold French debt, UK debt and US treasuries, but not particularly debt from small countries.

For the thousands of families across Ireland enduring life in unstable structures that are impossible to heat and are riddled with damp, black mould and dangerous electrics, the concrete levy adds insult to injury.  It is clear from the statements of representatives of the CIF that the concrete levy will be passed on directly to consumers.  The cruel irony is that affected homeowners, the victims of this scandal, who are already burdened and paying in every physical and psychological way possible with onerous financial burdens and the loss of a cherished home, are now being told to take another hit.<\/p> <p>  In a letter dated 10 February 2022 to Mr. Michael Doherty of the Mica Action Group, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, stated the scheme was a like for like remediation grant.  Such a statement is contradictory.  It conveniently glosses over that the fact that the scheme only allows for a very basic build to pre-2008 regulations and, therefore, immediately excludes all houses built after 2007 or those built to a higher specification.  It does not include foundations, flooring beyond a certain amount of tiling in kitchens and bathroom, retaining walls or bison slabs.  In addition, pre-2008 materials such as insulation, boiler systems and electrical wiring cannot be sourced, so modern equivalents have to be used.  All of that applies even before construction inflation is mentioned.<\/p> <p>  The latest SCSI figures reported that costs to rebuild a house nationally had risen by 21%, while in the north west rebuild costs rose by 26% and between 18% and 20% in the west.  Quantity surveyors report witnessing a 30% increase in the cost of concrete in the past year.  The reality for most affected homeowners before they lay a single block, is that they are looking at a shortfall of tens of thousands of euros between the scheme allowance and the real costs of rebuilding their home.<\/p> <p>  Pensioners, people near retirement, those on low incomes or having undergone serious injury or illness cannot borrow.  Parents trying to get children through college are now being forced into an either-or situation.  Young families are being saddled with yet another layer of debt and this is all going on while we are in a cost-of-living crisis.  Affected homeowners, forced to rebuild their homes through no fault of their own are caught in a storm of financial hell.<\/p> <p>  To some, an additional &euro;2,000 on the costs of a house may not seem that onerous, but for people already trying to find &euro;30,000, &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000, an additional &euro;2,000 which they do not have, pushes the prospect of rebuilding their homes further out of reach.  Please remember that those affected are also taxpayers.  They will contribute to the multi-billion cost of this crisis, as well as pay on an individual basis to restore their houses.<\/p> <p>  Let us get back to why this levy is needed in the first place.  The levy is needed because, whether by design, negligence or ignorance, manufacturers were allowed to pump defective concrete products unhindered into the Irish market for years on end.  The multi-billion euro cost is directly proportionate to the level of failure of the now disgraced regime of self-regulation.  Even the name, the mica concrete levy, has insidious undertones.  It implies to taxpayers that those who have the mica homes are somehow responsible for the extra-cost burden on those trying to buy or build a home.  A more appropriate name would be \"the failure of effective governance of the concrete industry levy.\"<\/p> <p>  The gaping omission from the blanket levy is accountability.  It does not pursue or target manufacturers which are known to be culpable but instead reinforces a message of no consequences to producers which have obviously breached regulations.  The concrete levy says to the industry that it can violate regulations, wreck and endanger people&rsquo;s lives, be the cause of a multi-billion euro cost to the taxpayer and there are no consequences.<\/p> <p>  The same companies, known to have supplied defective concrete products, are still turning a multi-million or even multi-billion euro profit and are operating unhindered and unchallenged in the market today.  The levy will not touch them.  Even worse, as the Joint Committee on Housing Local Government and Heritage heard from an industry professional in June 2022, it is believed defective concrete products are still entering the market.  Given where we are, how can this be possible?<\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, recently said he was disappointed there had not been any prosecutions in relation to the defective concrete.  If the T&aacute;naiste is disappointed, can the committee imagine how those who have had their lives shattered by this scandal are feeling?  Try stressed, incensed and exasperated.  Yet, we still wait on the long-promised appointment of a senior counsel to investigate how best to pursue the offenders.  Until the Government grasps the nettle and overhauls the broken regime of self-regulation with an effective form of governance, taxpayers will continue to be asked to a sign a blank cheque to remedy the violations of an industry without accountability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022102600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lisa Hone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":552,"content":"<p>On behalf of the CIF, I thank the Chair, Deputies and Senators for the opportunity to meet them to address this important issue which will have major implications for the delivery of housing and general construction projects.<\/p> <p>  Since the publication of the Finance Bill 2022, the CIF acknowledges that the 10% levy has now been reduced to 5%.  We also understand that pre-cast products have been excluded from the Bill although it remains to be seen how that will work in practice.  Despite these changes, CIF expresses concern about the serious risk to Housing for All, the National Development Plan 2021-2030 and to general commercial construction activity.<\/p> <p>  The CIF has written to the Minister on the matter and submitted an accompanying policy document outlining the rationale for these concerns, many of which still apply.  The CIF is calling for an urgent regulatory and economic impact assessment to be carried out as a first step before the levy is introduced.  Given the exceptional inflationary environment, the CIF also recommends that its introduction be deferred for up to two years to allow the necessary time for the above review to be undertaken and for the industry to make the appropriate provisions.  The industry has been subjected to supply-chain and material cost increases not seen in 40 years.  The introduction of this levy, the application of which still remains unclear, appears poorly timed.  The most recent wholesale index for construction materials is available on the Central Statistics Office, CSO, website where the extent of recent inflation on construction materials can be seen.  The general construction and house-building sector requires time to recover from these supply-chain disruptions and material cost increases.  The CIF has repeatedly highlighted the damage that has been done to industry balance sheets and cash flow.  Many projects that have been tendered now carry an additional cost risk as these legislative changes will not be compensated under public works contracts.  Therefore businesses that have no responsibility for the defects will be expected to fund the levy from their resources.  This is simply unfair and damaging to an already financially stressed industry.<\/p><p>The levy is a blunt instrument which is not targeting those responsible for defects.  The first-time buyer and the public and private client will ultimately pay the costs of this and the potential budgetary revenue from the measure is unlikely to be achieved due to its wider consequences.  This is a quality control issue for the suppliers of raw materials and manufacturers.  For example, the quarries supply raw materials to the concrete product manufacturers which are then processed and supplied to the industry.  The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act is in place to ensure that goods placed n the market are of merchantable quality, that is, that they work for the intended purpose for which they were produced.  Contractors, developers and home builders should have confidence that manufacturers and suppliers comply with the law and that Government is enforcing the law in conjunction with its own certification and standards regime.  How can a civil engineering contractor building a BusConnects corridor be held responsible for the supply of defective concrete blocks?  The levy is likely to inflate costs for first-time buyers and on projects like commercial offices, foreign direct investment, and transport, all cost inputs will have to be passed on.  If it is not passed on finance for development would not be forthcoming and contractors would suffer financial stress.  All of which would have major negative consequences for the delivery of Housing for All and the national development plan.  The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, is asking the Government to strongly consider the following significant downside risks of the levy and their impact on its viability as a revenue generating solution to support any redress scheme.<br\/><br\/>It will have a negative effect on the affordability of housing and lead to the likely pausing of further developments.  Currently all input cost increases are difficult to recover in the house building sector as the consumer, and in particular the first-time buyer, is limited in their ability to borrow more to fund cost increases.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, has said before, and the committee will hear from it shortly, that the 10% levy will lead to cost increases of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;4,000 per house.  Even at 5% this could result in a &euro;2,000 increase.  The market is now at its limits in terms of ability of a householder to increase the price point to the consumer.  This will impact significantly on viability and project assessment in 2023 and it comes on the back of interest rate rises, costs associated with new building regulations, and planning and local authority development charges.  Even timber frame construction requires an outer leaf of blocks and concrete bases, concrete footpaths, retaining walls, boundary walls, culverts and manholes, etc.  An estimated 2,000 blocks are required for timber framed homes.  <br\/><br\/>The levy, alongside the significant price volatility of concrete, is creating uncertainty for public and private clients and contractors.  The rising energy costs are likely to lead to further cost increases for concrete in the coming months.  This is putting many projects in jeopardy.  The uncertainty means that contractors are unable to tender projects.  It is likely that the levy will lead to substantial cost increases for<i>in situ <\/i>concrete, blocks and mortar, and foundation piles.  These products are used across projects in residential, commercial and civil engineering construction.  The levy will lead to significant uplift of the cost of these project costs.  The majority of contractors are earning margins between just 1% and 3%.  The uplifts could represent up to 25% of a contractor's margin thereby seriously undermining their funding capability and the viability of development.  For those unfortunate enough to be in contract, they will be required to absorb it on top of all the other inflationary costs that they have had to absorb over the last three years.It is not sustainable and could put contractors out of business or terminate projects.<br\/><br\/>The CIF is making a number of recommendations regarding the application of the levy.  First, an urgent regulatory and economic impact assessment should be carried out as a first step.  Second, given the exceptional inflationary environment, the levy's introduction should be deferred for up to two years to allow the above review to be undertaken and the industry to make appropriate provisions for it.  Third, those responsible for the defects in the manufacturing process should be held responsible under measures that are targeted and surgical.  Other methods such as statutory inspection standards, certification and licensing should be considered as these could help protect future homeowners and clients.  Fourth, we also recommend that the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act be strengthened for manufacturers and suppliers into the industry with the introduction of mandatory inspections by local authorities or National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, officials.  Finally, the industry needs a national product testing centre to ensure independent testing of construction products supplied into the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022102600002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Parlon.

The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland welcomes the opportunity to share our insights on the proposed concrete block levy with the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  As the leading professional body for chartered surveying professionals working in the public interest our members work across the built environment, in both the public and private sectors, providing real-time independent evidence of the current inflationary costs and the impact of increased construction costs.<\/p> <p>  The value of construction output is estimated to be &euro;29 billion in 2022 according to Ernest &amp;amp; Young Economics, with employment levels in construction expected to continue to grow beyond levels of 150,000 people.  Demand remains high across many sectors, though many projects remain challenged by increasing construction costs.  With regard to residential construction, the Central Bank estimated that 24,500 new homes will be delivered this year, which is well short of the 33,000 needed annually to meet demand as outlined in Housing for All.  To make up the annual deficits in supply from previous years, new housing output will need to steadily increase up to 45,000 units per annum by the end of the decade if housing targets are to be achieved in the lifetime of the plan.<\/p> <p>  The negative impact of Brexit and the cost on housing delivery over the last couple of years has been compounded by the tragic conflict in Ukraine and its impact on energy costs.  While the sector and the industry has successfully overcome the challenges of the current high construction cost inflation to deliver almost 70,000 homes during this period, there is significant concern that the current increasing costs are pushing planned developments out of viability. <\/p> <p>  The national SCSI tender price index is running at 14% inflation for commercial construction to July 2022 and the largest contributor to tender inflation over the past 12 months is material price inflation.  All building materials experienced some degree of inflation.  Rising energy costs have had a significant impact on energy-intensive materials such as steel, aluminium, copper, concrete and cement, facades and curtain walling, which have been affected the most.  Many companies are also grappling with increased inflation generally and increased operational costs, including labour costs.<\/p> <p>  Given the shortage of construction workers, spiralling construction costs and rising interest rates it is vital that the Government does everything possible to drive down construction costs and the SCSI has made a number of recommendations on how this could be achieved, most recently in our submission to Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage on 24 May, which is appended to our submission.  The cost of housing delivery is split between soft costs and hard costs.  The hard costs are the bricks and mortar element of development, which account for 48% of the overall delivery cost.  The other 52% of costs are soft costs, such as levies, margin, VAT, finance costs, connection costs and charges, etc.<\/p> <p>  The construction sector has witnessed sustained high material price volatility in the past 18 months and since September 2021 the price of concrete has increased by approximately 37%.  The highly energy-intensive production process associated with concrete is a driver of concrete price increases.  Therefore, the future price of concrete is linked to energy and fuel prices, which are currently difficult for market experts to forecast.  The SCSI will monitor the impact on prices of cement and other construction materials closely in the coming months.<\/p> <p>  The construction sector is functioning with huge uncertainty about the pipeline of construction projects as viability remains so challenged.  We have numerous anecdotal examples of housing projects being paused or are being cancelled outright.  It is the long-standing view of the society to tackle rising costs of construction.  Every facet of the input costs of residential development needs to be reduced.  While several initiatives already under way to address the blockages to housing delivery and these are to be commended, such as planning reform, these are longer term and what is required now is urgent action to address construction cost inflation.<\/p> <p>  Contrary to the need to drive down construction costs, the concrete levy announced in budget 2023 directly increases building costs.  While we understand that Government intends to seek a contribution from relevant stakeholders to the cost of remediating defective homes, however in a period of hyperinflation the introduction of a levy on concrete will further challenge the viability and affordability of construction projects, including new homes, and the construction sector in general.  Housing delivery is intrinsically linked to viability and increasing construction costs that threaten viability can result in projects being paused or even cancelled.  The SCSI estimated that the initial concrete levy announcement, as part of budget 2023 would add approximately &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 to the overall delivery costs of an average block built three bed semi-detached house, the most common house type in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The levy has now since been revised to 5% and precast concrete elements have been removed.<\/p><p>However, there is still limited detail as to how the levy will be applied.  The table attached to our submission is an approximation of costs based on the information available at the time.  We estimate the cost of a three bedroom semi-detached house with a 5% levy will increase by approximately &euro;1,200 per unit.  A three bedroom semi-detached house with timber frame construction will increase by approximately &euro;700 per unit.  More important is the impact this levy will have on the construction sector for other building projects across the country.  A large regeneration project with a mixed scheme of offices and retail over a single level basement in Munster will have an increased capital cost of around &euro;350,000.  The cost increase for apartment developments ranging from 160 to 275 units with or without a basement will be somewhere in the region of &euro;400 to &euro;700 per unit.<\/p><p> The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, has long called for an independent assessment of new and existing regulatory and compliance measures.  With regard to a three bedroom semi-detached, a key recommendation of the SCSI real cost of new housing delivery reports in 2016 and 2020, was for a full independent cost-benefit analysis to be carried out ahead of any new regulatory and statutory measures that will impact on the overall delivery costs of new housing.  One of the recommendations from the expert group that prepared the defects in apartments report earlier this year highlighted that the concept of an industry levy requires careful policy, legal and public scrutiny and should be considered as part of an option particularly in the context of other similar industry levies under consideration.  The expert group further stated that Government Departments and agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners, have been working to identify and evaluate a range of options with regard to such a levy.  It is envisaged that the views of relevant stakeholders will be sought before a final decision on the proposed levy is made.<\/p><p> It is imperative that where any changes are likely to increase the cost of construction there should be engagement with the sector beforehand.  The SCSI recommends that consultation commences with the industry to discuss workable solutions to meet the Government's stated objectives while ensuring delivery of much-needed homes in the public interest.  We are happy to provide any further information or clarifications that may be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022102600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin James","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":557,"content":"<p>We will now turn to members.

At the moment homeowners are left in limbo and an information vacuum.  It is cruel what is happening to them.  We have homeowners in unsafe and unhealthy homes that in any other circumstances would be and should be absolutely condemned.

It is a PR exercise on behalf of Government to try to persuade the public that it is doing something.  The public is aware of this failure to govern the concrete industry and the enormous impact it has had on homeowners all around the country.  We have homes in Donegal, Clare, Mayo and now Wexford.  It is everywhere.  It is not just a few bad apples.  This is a systematic failure within the concrete industry across the country.  This seems to be no more than a smokescreen from Government to persuade the public it is doing something and holding companies that violated regulations to account, but this will not touch them.

The only place I can see where he has added to the cost is very clear.  We can measure it and it has been measured professionally by the Institute of Chartered Surveyors and it is in the cost of housing and building.  Not in 40 years have we had such unprecedented cost increases.  For the Government to add to that, for whatever reason, just does not make any sense.  One of the things that keeps jumping out at me is that when you are looking at the cost of housing the soft costs amount to just 52%.  The hard costs, the bricks and the mortar and the work that the builder who we represent is less than half the total cost of the house.  Obviously, the site has to be bought.  I was just looking at a planning application in the west of Ireland.

Therefore, in trying to look at the impact of where we will be in September and what the true cost will be at the market, plus the fact the industry is already on notice that concrete will potentially increase again given energy increases, to call a figure at a moment in time is a bit like the conversation we had with mica earlier - it is a freeze frame.

Unfortunately, whether it is the one-off house, in the case of the mica, or large-scale, high-density residential or commercial projects, the contractors will look to pass on those costs.

We have had two price increases for concrete from September to the early part of this year, and we are already on notice that there are further concrete costs coming in terms of energy for cement, and now we are looking at an additional 5%.

Is this going to be set for an indefinite amount of time to create a pot of money to contribute to the rebuilding of houses?  We also have to take into consideration that we talk about the construction industry with regard to the quarries and house builders building one-off homes.  Our industry is much bigger than that, when it comes to looking at who we rely on in terms of tier one, tier two and tier three contractors.  They are servicing not only the residential industry but the foreign direct investment market, data centres, large tech and pharma companies coming into the market.  They have had absolutely no involvement in this whatsoever.  When you look at the house building companies under the umbrella of the construction sector, it is the targetting of who and who is left.  We all understand that insurance has expired and contractors are no longer in play.  However, when you look at the solution to create a revenue, the 10% or 5% as we know from the Minister is &euro;30 million per year.

The message was that these mica homes would cost the taxpayer.  At the time it felt like it was a tactic to try to divide the country into those who were affected and those who were not to ask why those who were not affected should have to pay.  I return to the root cause because that is what it is about.  It is not the affected homeowners who are costing the taxpayer; it is the failure of regulation and the lack of governance and accountability.  As I said in my statement, there is nothing in place to deter this happening again.  There are no consequences for the offenders and the governance has not changed.  On building regulations, there was a Building Control (Amendment) Regulation in 2014 and that has amended the way building projects are supervised and governed but that does not affect products like a concrete product from a quarry; it is irrelevant.  There is the same situation today that existed when the defective products were produced, and on we go.<\/p> <p>  It is no exaggeration when I say that taxpayers are being asked to sign a blank cheque because the Government is not acknowledging the root cause of this issue.  There is no appetite to chase the offenders or to amend the governance.  There needs to be independent regulation.  There are many industries that operate in this country that have independent regulation.  This is so serious; it is about the fundamentals of the State.  Housing is one of the fundamentals of the State and if it goes wrong it is a catastrophe.  We are living with a catastrophe.  How can a Government sit back morally and allow this to continue, knowing that this devastation will land on future homeowners?  As an affected homeowner and speaking for every affected homeowner I know, they would not wish this on anybody.  We want to escape this scourge but we also want to make sure that nobody else in this country ever has to go through what we have been through.

I want to talk about the costs and the question of who pays.  I will start with mica.  I agree 100% with the points that have been raised by Ms Hone.  The mica homeowners are entitled to every penny that will be paid to them under this scheme and then some because the scheme falls significantly short of fully covering the costs.  The figure we have for now is &euro;2.7 billion.  Then there is a bill for pyrite and then there will be the bill for the defective apartments.  Nobody is in a position to say what the final figure will be but between mica and pyrite, even before the full bill for the apartment defects is finalised, it will be well over the &euro;5 billion mark.<\/p> <p>  The question arises of who pays for that.  We are being told that the 5% contribution will amount to &euro;32 million.  Let us suppose that not a penny of that &euro;32 million is passed on to homeowners and it is entirely paid for from the industry, which will not happen.  That would mean &euro;32 million would come from the industry and presumably the bulk of the rest would come from the taxpayer.  When we talk about the taxpayer we are overwhelmingly talking about the PAYE taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  My question for Mr. Parlon is as follows.  What does he think is a fair division for covering the costs of that &euro;5 billion plus bill between the construction industry; the suppliers of the blocks; the banks, which are part of the mix; the insurance industry, which is part of the mix; and the PAYE taxpayers?  It looks like a maximum of &euro;32 million will come from the industry and approximately &euro;5 billion will come from the taxpayer, which no one would agree is a fair division of the costs.  What would the Construction Industry Federation think would be a fair division of the costs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022102600002#H00600","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":611,"content":"<p>Deputy Mac Lochlainn said that this cost will be spread over a long number of years but it is still a substantial cost.  The construction industry is a major taxpayer as well and will be contributing.  One of the figures I used earlier that has been backed up by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland is that half of the actual cost is a non-building cost and that a large part of it is taxed.  We could take the VAT alone, and I know there is some interest again in looking at that.  Say we build 25,000 houses this year - and hopefully we will build a few thousand extra - those 25,000 houses at &euro;40,000 per house amount to &euro;1 billion that goes directly into the Exchequer.  The Minister for Finance, when he announced his budget, announced the spending of &euro;11 billion.  He largely had that largesse because of corporation taxes being paid.  The economy is going well and the industry will be paying our part.  Already the construction industry has been a major contributor to the economy.  If you take the metric that we employ more than 150,000 workers directly, all of them pay their full PAYE, PRSI and so on, and that is effectively paid by the construction employers around the country.  The construction industry is an important one to the Exchequer and we are making our contribution.<\/p> <p>  It goes back, as Ms Hone said, to the root cause, which is that individuals were found wanting.  They did not produce the proper product.  Whether you were an individual house builder, a small contractor or whoever, you bought defective blocks while believing them to be good quality so you will end up with a problem.  Generally manufacturers have insurance or a bond to cover such an eventuality but I am not sure if that has ever been exposed.  For anyone seeking a mortgage, such as a first-time buyer, the scrutiny and all the conditions that attach to the house are massive.  The banks are very careful that they will not mortgage a house that may not be built to the full standards.  Ms Hone or Deputy Doherty talked about the number of mortgages that are outstanding and still being paid by them.  There are a whole lot of people to blame but the industry will be making a massive contribution in doing what it is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022102600002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I listened carefully to Ms Hone's comments and she shone a light on the role of the individual companies that supplied the defective blocks.<\/p><p>She also pinpointed what she colourfully and correctly described as the disgraced regime of self-regulation.

Those houses are all there to the good.<\/p> <p>  I am no geologist but mica is a naturally occurring substance.  Perhaps the manufacturers were not aware of its presence.  I am not sure about that but whoever was producing any material would have had an obligation that it would be fit for purpose.  Clearly, these particular blocks are defective concrete blocks that caused the problem and that is the root cause of it.  I can understand why people would be inclined to say the industry should pay.  Of course, somebody should pay.  Eventually, it will be every taxpayer in the country who will pay.  However, if one points at those in the industry, they will say they were very careful about where they bought blocks and from whom they bought their concrete and that ultimately, they trust them and if there were to be a problem, they would be able to go back after them and so on.  One might be going back after a small project that went wrong but going back with a bill for a couple of billion euro is a different category.

Can they could advise what impact they feel that may have on the delivery of public works?  That is my initial question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022102600002#J03300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1666738800,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I will take that.  My response was that the industry would seek to recover the costs.  We have the discretionary framework with regard to inflation in costs. That is live and up and running.  The process is still in the testing period but it is welcomed by the industry.  Contractors will certainly be seeking recovery through that framework on public contracts.  I would be concerned if those costs were not recoverable, whether in total or in part.  We have had a lot of discussion here today on the particular issue of mica and individual houses.  To some degree, we are looking at that issue through the small lens of a figure somewhere north of &euro;2,000, depending on the particular house.  My concern is about larger-scale projects, such as high-density residential projects, in which a lot of concrete is used.  In some of these projects that involve basements, upwards of 25,000 or 30,000 cu. m might be used at &euro;100 per cubic metre, which will now come with an additional cost of 5% along with two increases in September.  It is a substantial increase and there are further increases to come.  My concern is that, for the individual contractor who is under contract and trying to cover the existing increases, this further increase could have a significant impact.  If those costs are recoverable through the public purse, it is ultimately the public purse paying, which raises an issue with regard to expenditure under the capital expenditure programme and the national development programme.  We know that, in this inflationary market, some public projects are already being assessed for viability, which will affect whether they will go ahead or not.  A lot of procuring authorities are holding back on tendering projects for that very reason.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022102600002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":647,"content":"<p>As we do not have that much time, I will ask Mr. Kelly about something else.

Modern methods of construction will speed up the construction process but it is about scalability and economies of scale.  Unfortunately, until there is enough adoption of that, off-site construction will come at a premium.  The question is, who pays the premium?  From the client perspective, if modern methods of construction are built into the project from the outset and the cost is encompassed at that stage, these methods can be embraced.  However, if you are expecting contractors to reverse-engineer modern methods of construction into a traditional-build process, there is a premium involved and somebody has to pay it.  Unfortunately, it does not always work out to be viable.  It is about early adoption and scalability.

We are struggling to make a lot of projects viable.  From a personal perspective, I know of contractors who have entered into contracts in the public sector and who can no longer honour their obligations and have had to walk away because of the inflationary increases they have incurred.  This causes problems for the public sector client in question.  There are different scenarios for the public sector and private sector markets.  There is probably more flexibility in negotiations in the private sector to help the contractor.  Although there are measures to deal with inflation in the public procurement rules and regulations, it is a matter of a discretionary discussion between the contractor and the public sector client in the event of disputes over increased costs.  We have yet to see whether those discretionary discussions will turn into a conflict if a contractor incurs costs and makes a claim that the client is unwilling or unable to pay.  That is one issue in respect of the market.<\/p> <p>  On the levy, there are two issues to consider, namely, how to fix the problem immediately and accountability.  As regards the &euro;30 million per annum we have talked about and what it will generate in comparison to the potential &euro;5 billion exposure, the priority is to get moving.  A plan needs to be put in place to prioritise and accelerate this process and to then retrospectively look at how the contributions will build up over time and contribute to the overall cost.  The sliding scale of &euro;30 million per annum will not make a massive contribution to moving forward, particularly with the mica homeowners.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022102600002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin James"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":651,"content":"<p>My final question is for the mica group.

If contractors bring materials to site prematurely, there is a mechanism and agreement with the client as to whether we pay them in advance or not, or pay them for material stored on-site.  There is a debate around - and the CIF can vouch for this - when the main contractor goes to the subcontractor and the manufacturer.  It is whether the characteristics of the site allow you to bring the stuff on-site early or not and you agree a price with the contractor at the outset.  If the contractor does not agree a price at the outset and decides after six months or a year on-site to negotiate a price, he may win or lose.

Unfortunately, under domestic construction, there is an opt-out clause so much domestic construction does not have to be carried out under the building control amendment regulations.  That means the duties of the client do not come into play so the appointment of the contractor, the responsibilities, the assigned certifier and the process of inspecting through the building process do not exist.

I know a little bit about the subject because I was involved in the beginning when pyrite became obvious.  I was involved, along with others, in the construction of the blocks of houses and in the removal of blocks of houses about 30 years ago where there were structural defects covered by insurance, Home Build or its predecessor.  There was no difficulty about it.  What Ms Hone has said is true.  The problem was identified and, within six months, resolved.  Houses were remedied in a major way, taking the roof off and the whole thing down to the foundation.  They were able to be rebuilt and no hassle about it.  All was covered.

My first suggestion would be a fund into which the contributors would include, for instance, the insurance companies and the construction industry, local authorities, engineers including Engineers Ireland, and everybody who was involved in construction, acquisition of materials and the building of a house in any part of the country, whether a scheme or a single house.  In saying that, I acknowledge the number of quite small builders who were dutiful and who went about it their own way and resolved the problems at their own expense.  But they had insurance to cover themselves.  We know that.  But there were other cases where the insurance companies ran away from their responsibilities.  Once that was allowed to happen the first time it became the order of the day.  That was it.  I suggest a fund as a solution.  It could be a profit-making fund over a period but in order to correct the problem that exists now, something must be done.  Otherwise we will still be here talking about the same thing in ten years because we are trying to catch up.<br \/><br \/>I have not mentioned all the people who could be involved.  As I said, I was involved in the construction of a couple of hundred houses in that period through a co-op.  We enforced the strictest measures to apply at all times.  Thankfully, none of those houses was affected.  The architects, engineers and all involved had to pass the original test.  For those who say that this could continue forever and they are still doing it, there is a very simple way to find out - you do a test, a concrete test or a cube test and all the other tests.  If you visit a place once, then that is it.  They do not supply any more.  If there is defective product there, in order to ensure that the State does not have to continue remedying something forever over which it had adequate control in the first place, then we have to do that. <br \/><br \/>There are individual householders in Donegal, the west coast and all over the country, including Kildare, who were looking at a serious defect in their property and nobody was willing to resolve the problem so the State moved in.  The State should not have moved in, that is the problem.  The system should have been able to correct itself at that time.  If it had done so by enforcing rules and regulations that were effective straight away then we would not have an ongoing problem and it is the ongoing problem that I want to try to deal with.  I know that what people here are saying is true but I do not like to hear people say that this will be going on for many years and implying that there are guys down the track we do not know about yet who will come on stream in the future and it will be worse than we have seen so far.  <br \/><br \/>Apart from the fund to deal with the existing situation, I am suggesting that we set in place sufficient and rigorous impositions now that prevent this from happening on an ongoing basis.  We need to stop it, full stop.  Ms Hone is absolutely right about that.  I know the construction industry are responsible people and I have always recognised that.  They have always stood up to it. The fact is, everyone ran away from this.  Everyone was going to be responsible for a start and then nobody wanted to be responsible.<br \/><br \/>Finally, on the apartments, it is a disgrace that people who were ill prepared for it found themselves having to buy a house or apartment that five or ten years later has major defects.  They are structural defects for which somebody is responsible and if those people do not have to pony up and contribute in some shape or form then this will continue.  It is carte blanche for everyone to get involved.  Why does everyone not get involved?  Because the State will eventually pick up the bill and that way they are guaranteed.  They are not guaranteed and they should not be guaranteed.  There is a simple way to deal with that as Ms Hone said - bring the horse to water.  If the horse does not want to drink then the water is taken away.  Simple as that.  We have to do something really serious and responsible about it.  We need to end it now for existing faults and future potential faults.  I grew up in the local authority under an engineer which I am sure the representatives from the construction industry will remember, John Carrick.  He had a very rigid policy in relation to construction with cube tests, testing the material and the construction of a roof, for instance.  If it did not comply with regulations then it was a case of &quot;Sorry&quot; and it came down again.  You could say you cannot afford that but you will have to afford more if you do not address it.  It is a question of facing reality.  We have kicked this around for the last number of years and have avoided dealing with it straight-on as we should.  If we do not do it now, then in ten years we will still be trying to catch up and it will never be resolved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":667,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.

I want to say to Ms Hone that it is refreshing to have someone before us who tells it as it is and who demands the type of action that the Government and the politicians who make up that Government should take.  I hope that this morning's hearings were listened to and that her voice, along with the constructive contribution made by the four people beside her, all men, will be heard loud and clear.  On apportioning blame, as a country we have watched illegal quarries operate for decades and did nothing and are doing nothing about it.  The challenge in this is for those in national Government, local government, health and safety, the EPA, building controls and the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, to take their jobs seriously and go to these quarries and do the job that they are paid to do; that is not happening.  As we sit here in this room, I know that in Kilkenny and Laois there is significant quarrying going on that is absolutely illegal.  It has been reported and highlighted in the D&aacute;il.  I brought one issue to the direct attention of the Green Party in the person of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and not only did he not reply but nobody that had any authority in relation to the issue replied.<\/p> <p>  In her contribution, Ms Hone mentioned the appointment of a senior counsel.  That will happen when it happens when they go through the motions of procurement and so on but that is only a step.  The real drudge will happen after that.  It will be a case of \"On this hand; on that hand\" and then at the end it will probably be on no one's hand but the Government and those who make it up.<\/p><p>They know full well what has to be done.  The big question is, as in many other areas, whether they are ready and prepared to take on the vested interests.  That is the question.  Are they ready to arrest somebody for doing something wrong or are they not?  If there is any evidence required to do that sort of extreme thinking and extreme action, I am sure there are many people who can bring forward that evidence or direct them to a quarry that is breaking the law and which forces local authorities to take them to court, spending taxpayers' money that was hard earned in the first place, and playing ducks and drakes with the system itself.  Cowboys, the lot of them.<\/p><p> I say to all of the witnesses here who represent the industry and who are associated with the industry that I know how far all of you have come in recognising regulation, recognising best practice, and doing the best you can.  It is time for the Government to take the lead on this and to root out those who simply should not be in the business.  Not only are they causing this mayhem and havoc for people, they are also creating environmental disasters.  They are disasters.<\/p><p> I thank the representatives for coming in and I commend them on their contribution.  It is up to us now to try to make some sort of difference as we deal with this.  Those who are central to the cause of it, however, are the ones who should be paying.  I do not believe in taking money out of profits because, one way or the other, it goes back to the person at the end of the line, who will pay one way or the other.  Those who are wrong on this should be made to pay, as much as they can be identified and made to pay, but the Government certainly, and local government in particular, have a long way to go to impress me in terms of the policing of the regulations and the preventing of illegal activities in quarries.  There is one such quarry in Kilkenny, which I will not mention, although I have mentioned it in the House.  That is the reality and that is our job of work to do.<\/p><p> I will suspend this part of the meeting for two minutes while we change over.

The defective concrete products levy also falls under my remit.  I am joined by my colleagues Pat McColgan and Leona Cantillon from the Department of Finance.  My colleague Jackie O&rsquo;Callaghan is also in attendance on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, and she will be able to respond to questions regarding the legislation underpinning the levy.  We are also joined today by my colleague from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Se&aacute;n Armstrong, who is head of the residential construction cost and innovation unit in that Department.  He will be able to respond to questions on the impact on costs of the defective concrete products levy.<\/p><p> The starting point for the development of the levy was a Government decision in November 2021.  At that time, it was decided that a levy on the construction industry would be put in place to raise in the region of &euro;80 million a year, which would go some way to offset the costs of the defective concrete blocks redress scheme.  The Government decided that it was to be developed throughout 2022, introduced in the Finance Bill and would to apply from 2023.  The Department of Finance engaged with the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Environment, Climate and Communications and Enterprise, Trade and Employment when considering how to design a levy that would deliver on the Government's decision.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland and Enterprise Ireland were also engaged with when the levy was being designed.<\/p><p> As the members will be aware, the levy was announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech on 27 September last.  He announced that the levy would apply at a rate of 10% and come into effect from 3 April 2023.  On budget day, the Department also published the Budget 2023: Tax Policy Changes document, which, among other things, sets out the 17 EU standards to which the levy was intended to apply at that time.  Subsequently, in light of feedback received from the concrete industry, the broader construction industry and others, the Minister for Finance decided to make several changes to the levy.  These are set out in the Finance Bill, which was published on Thursday, 20 October last.  The Bill sets out how the levy will operate and the much reduced range of products in respect of which it will apply.  The levy will now apply at a rate of 5% from 1 September 2023.  It will apply only to concrete that is ready to pour and to concrete blocks manufactured in accordance with two EU standards.  All precast concrete standards are now excluded from the scope of the levy.<\/p><p> The levy will apply to certain construction products within the scope of the construction products regulation.  The regulation lays down harmonised rules for the marketing of construction products in the EU.  The construction products regulation also provides a common technical language to assess the performance of construction products via harmonised European standards.<\/p><p> Concrete that is ready to pour, which is also known as ready-mix concrete, does not fall within the scope of the construction products regulation.  However, it is defined in Part 4 of Schedule 3 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 and is subject to a reduced VAT rate of 13.5%.  Therefore, the product is well understood by Irish industry and is readily identifiable for the purpose of the new levy.<\/p><p> The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage commissioned a cost assessment analysis report to help identify the likely impact of the levy on construction costs.  This is a bottom-up scientific analysis carried out by an independent construction economics cost consultant.  The report also includes analysis undertaken by quantity surveyors in the housing advisory unit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  This report is a cost assessment based on the 10% levy on concrete products for typical dwellings.  The report has been published in advance of the Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill.  It sets out that the percentage increase in construction and development costs was estimated to be approximately 0.4% to 0.9% for a typical semi-detached dwelling and 0.3% to 0.4% for a typical apartment.  As this analysis was based on the levy as announced on budget day and the rate of the levy, as published in the Finance Bill 2022, has been reduced, the costings can be reduced by approximately 50% to determine the impact of the new design of the defective concrete products levy on the cost of concrete products.  Therefore, the levy will now result in an increase in construction costs while taking account of variables of between &euro;400 to &euro;800 for a typical three-bed semi-detached house and between &euro;375 to &euro;550 per apartment in a typical six-floor apartment block with a basement car park.  The percentage increase in construction and development costs of the levy currently is estimated to be approximately 0.2% to 0.45% for a typical semi-detached dwelling and 0.15% to 0.2% for a typical apartment.<\/p><p> In order to determine the revenue raised by the levy the Department of Finance used statistics provided by the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  The CSO series entitled Irish Industrial Production by Sector was utilised to estimate the revenue that would be raised by the levy.  This series is based on an annual survey of the value and volume of products manufactured by industrial enterprises in Ireland and sold during the reference year.  The survey covers all industrial enterprises comprising three or more persons that are wholly or primarily engaged in industrial production and industrial services in the mining, quarrying and manufacturing industries.  The survey contains returns for the production of pouring concrete, concrete blocks and prefabricated concrete.  The levy, as set out in the Finance Bill at a rate of 5% and encompassing pouring concrete and concrete blocks, will result in an additional &euro;32 million in revenue accruing to the State in a full year of operation.<\/p><p> My colleagues and I can answer any technical questions on the development of the levy.  As members will be aware, the Minister will be able to speak about the policy dimensions of the levy on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, which is due to take place shortly.  I hope that this overview of the levy will assist in framing the discussion at this meeting.  I reiterate that we are happy to engage with any questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022102600002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Timmy Hennessy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":678,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hennessy.

Regarding broader considerations on environmental policy, we looked at EU policy about embodied carbon in concrete and at what work is ongoing at EU level.  The levy was defined with reference by EU standards.  We understand that work is ongoing in the EU to define concrete with reference to its embodied carbon, which would establish its environmental credentials.  That work is not yet completed so it is not yet possible, from looking at individual concrete products, to scope out things based on a new definition of embodied carbon, because one is not yet available for the standards used in construction products regulation.

This is a simple amendment relating specifically to the board make-up of RT&Eacute;.  When TG4 was established as the all-Irish broadcaster, it was put into law that 100% of the board must be competent in Irish.  RT&Eacute; was established as a bilingual national broadcaster, yet there remain no requirements in place for Irish competency in RT&Eacute;.  RT&Eacute; has obligations to broadcast and provide services in Irish as well as English, and it is clear from the reports from An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga that RT&Eacute; has failed in this regard and failed to fulfil obligations to the Irish language.<\/p><p>Aside from Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta only a tiny fraction of what RT&Eacute; broadcasts is in Irish.  In a 2017 report, An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga said it was less than 1%.  I appreciate things may have improved slightly since 2017 but they have not improved to the degree they need to.  Where content is produced in Irish, reporters are paid less than their counterparts doing the same work in English.  All of this points to RT&Eacute; failing to take seriously its obligation to the Irish language and its obligations as a bilingual broadcaster.  In any other bilingual state it would be expected that the board would at least have a competency in both languages of that state.  That does not exist here.<\/p><p>This amendment would also ensure Irish is an essential requirement for half the membership of the RT&Eacute; board.  They would have to be able to use, speak and communicate in both English and Irish.  It is almost insulting to say we could not find competent people to sit on the board of RT&Eacute;.  Almost 40% of the country has some level of Irish.  It would be very insulting to say we could not find talented, experienced and skilled people who are competent in the Irish language to take up a position on that.  By not ensuring the board is competent in Irish, we are in turn failing to ensure the Irish language itself and the Irish-speaking community are understood and represented at board meetings.  There is a risk of the same problems that have happened in the past reoccurring in future.  I again refer to the 2017 report.  RT&Eacute; stands for Raidi&oacute; Teilif&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann and not the Irish television station.  Those who use the Irish language on a daily basis have a very realistic expectation we ensure that, at the very top of that organisation, there are people at board level who are competent and able to communicate effectively in the Irish language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#B00900","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":916,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the amendment.

As with amendment No. 86, I cannot accept amendment No. 87 as it simply repeats a change to the 2009 Act made by the Bill, in this case in section 33.<\/p> <p>  The other element of this amendment seeks to change the requirement on RT&Eacute; to make available a national television and sound broadcasting service to the whole community on the island of Ireland &ldquo;as far as is reasonably practicable&rdquo; to a requirement to make it available &ldquo;in full&rdquo;.  This would not be appropriate as it would legally oblige RT&Eacute; to obtain a set of circumstances where it does not reasonably have the means to ensure those circumstances would always be in place, particularly as RT&Eacute; is not a State body in both jurisdictions on this island.  As with amendment No. 86, this amendment would have the effect, for instance, of obliging broadcasts to make available sports events both within and outside the jurisdiction of the State.  Acquisition of rights to sporting events are a commercial matter between a rights-holder or sports body and broadcasters.

RT&Eacute; shall ensure that no worker is paid more for the same amount and form of work to produce content in the English language as a worker is paid to produce content in the Irish language.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>The amendment pertains to what many see as a particularly gross and offensive situation that has been allowed to develop.  In many ways it meets the definition of &quot;discrimination&quot;.  Workers at Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta are being paid up to 25% less than their counterparts in English at RT&Eacute; Radio for the same work.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  I understand that the committee has tried to raise this matter directly with RT&Eacute; but has yet to receive any form of a proposed solution.  It is quite disgraceful that despite this specific injustice having been raised, no solution or offer of a solution has come.  Deputy Munster raised the matter back in January when RT&Eacute; was undertaking a review into different pay grades and representatives from RT&Eacute; said they would not examine the difference in pay based on working in Irish or English.  It is frankly appalling that this has been allowed drag on.  It is a basic matter of workers' rights and the equality of workers who work in Irish, which in reality often involves more work than those operating through the English language.  Irish language reporters may have to translate items or prepare and support interviewees with little Irish, while competing with an English language service that often has more traction, investment and resources.  Effectively, the Irish language reporters are doing more work than their English language counterparts but are getting less pay.  This sends a stark message to those who would like to work through the Irish language that they will be valued less and that Irish is not seen as a skill but as a burden.  All Irish language workers could do their work through English as well, meaning that they are more skilled than their counterparts.  Instead of being rewarded for that additional skill and the additional work, they are penalised for it.  If we are serious about attracting young people into careers that involve the Irish language, this fundamental issue needs to be addressed and resolved.  Regardless of what language a journalist is working in, the quality of their work should determine their rate of pay.  There should be nothing controversial about the amendment.  It is a basic workers' rights issue and it is one we have an opportunity to fix.  We have an opportunity to make sure this does not happen to anybody else working in this area, be it in the Irish language or English.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#D00600","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":944,"content":"<p>This amendment would introduce obligations regarding the rates of pay for RT&Eacute; employees.

The amendments also empower the commission to make rules requiring interactive guides to support such prominence.  The amendments seek to empower the Irish speakers using these guides and to ensure they have their right to engage with interactive guides in their own language respected in law.  Interactive guides like TV guides and iPlayer catalogues - the Minister mentioned Sky, Virgin and so on - are there to make life easier.  People can see what is on and pick what they want to watch, but for Irish speakers the only option is in a different language.  There is a compellability factor there that we really should consider.<\/p><p>The commission, as the new regulator that ensures public service content is given prominence on these guides, should have the power to make rules as to what prominence is needed in the public interest, particularly when it comes to the Irish language.  Our media is dominated by English.  The vast majority of programmes on our televisions and of what we hear on the radio is in English.  We need to strike a balance in that regard.  We need almost to rebalance that to give Irish prominence for Irish-speaking communities in order that when we click onto our TV guide or a catalogue of shows, the option to receive it in Irish or in English is available.  Every one of us in this room has that option already when it comes to accessing our emails.  We can access our Oireachtas emails in Irish or in English.  The technology is there to do that.  The vast majority of us may opt for one language, but the potential for the other is there.  As a country, we are committed to ensuring that people use and learn Irish in order that it becomes part of our daily lives, and the media serve a vital role in that regard.  We all remember back to our secondary school days, when, if we were learning a foreign language, we were often shown a programme with subtitles in French, for example, as well as the audio being in French.  If we could move towards that scenario for Irish, it would go some way to assisting those seeking to learn it and those who are in school to encourage them to become more fluent in the language.  Amendments Nos. 98 and 99 would empower the commission to make rules as to how Irish-language content should be prominent on those interactive guides.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 100 is slightly different because it deals with the devices.  If it is okay to mention one television brand by name, with Philips TVs, in the menu one can choose to set up the television in Irish, so the technology is available.  What we need to ensure is that the use of that technology is encouraged among the other providers of televisions.  That could greatly help learners.  It also creates an environment in which Irish becomes immersive and a language in its own right that people use day to day because it is then almost constantly in their world.  I understand that an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh had proposed other amendments around subtitling and audio descriptions being included in both languages.  I saw that as a very positive step, and I say that as somebody who has very little Irish and is busy learning at the moment.  Having more exposure to Irish in various forums assists immensely with that.  It also assists those who are currently Irish speakers and who may have disabilities.  For those who may be visually impaired, to have the Irish in an audio description would ensure that their right as members of the Irish-speaking community is respected and upheld.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to take these amendments on board, see their value and recognise that the technology for this to become normal in our world is already in use.  When we go to set up our televisions we can choose which language we want to set them up in.  Irish should be one of those languages.  I ask the Minister to recognise the value of these amendments to those who are members of an Irish-speaking community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#E01600","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":975,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 98 and 99 are intended to ensure that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n provide for the prominence of Irish-language programming and services in any rules made by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n under section 128C of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill.<\/p> <p>  As I indicated earlier, public service programmes and public service media services include, by virtue of the definitions set out in section 128A of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, RT&Eacute; and TG4.

I will tell the commission to deal with this as a matter of priority but it is also about dealing with it on an EU-wide basis.  In May, the European Commission launched a new European strategy for a Better Internet for Kids.  The strategy is built on three pillars - child protection in the online environment; digital empowerment; and active participation.  Under the child protection pillar, there is a strong focus on providing age-appropriate online experiences, which the amendment is trying to address, including through age verification and age-appropriate design.  In this regard, the Commission commits to facilitating a comprehensive code of conduct on age-appropriate design by 2024 using the provisions of the DSA, which provides that such codes of conduct may be co-regulatory instruments.  The Commission has indicated that the code could provide for age verification for accessing certain online content.  To facilitate age verification, the Commission has committed to work with member states and EU standardisation to strengthen effective age verification methods.  This would be most effective if it was done on a Europe-wide basis and that is why we need to wait.  There is a pilot as well called euCONSENT.<\/p><p>I think I have mentioned the pilot to the Deputy previously during Question Time or at the committee.

Last year, the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment heard evidence from trade unions, experts and content moderators regarding their working conditions.  The evidence pointed to issues regarding the pay and conditions of content moderators and some of the dangers inherent in the practice of hiring employees through outsourcing firms.  One of the witnesses, a former content moderator, set out the very difficult nature of the work involved, as Deputy Mythen noted, and in particular the kinds of distressing content that she was required to view as part of the role. <\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste also addressed the committee and stressed the duty of care that employers have towards employees to create a safe working environment.  He also indicated to the Chair of the committee that he had written to a particular technology company about the terms and conditions of content moderators and indicated that it would be on the agenda when he spoke to the company again. <\/p> <p>  It is important to stress that the protection of workers&rsquo; rights is not a core function of my Department or its agencies.  It is important that our employment rights framework, which is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, places consistent rules and obligations on employers in all sectors of the economy.<\/p> <p>  Moving responsibility for workers&rsquo; rights to sectoral regulators would dilute the enforcement of the overarching framework and potentially lead to an inconsistent approach between sectors.  In that regard, the role of an coimisi&uacute;n, as an independent regulatory body, is ultimately to enforce new and updated regulatory frameworks for content regulation across broadcasting, video-on-demand and designated online services.  It is not intended to regulate employment relations or assess working conditions. <\/p> <p>  As a general principle, in considering any amendments to expand the functions of an coimisi&uacute;n I am very conscious of not unduly expanding the scope of an coimisi&uacute;n into other areas of policy, with the effect that its core functions, which I have just outlined, might suffer or that it might duplicate the functions of other bodies in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#G01700","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>We are asking for a code to be produced.

There is also a very real difficulty around the exit procedures from some subscription services.  I cannot be the only person in this room who remembers the premium ringtones from the 1990s and the horror that ensued when trying to cancel those subscriptions.  That triggered legislation in other jurisdictions which we benefited from, thankfully.  However, it is still an issue.  It was actually highlighted on RT&Eacute;'s &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot; show a number of months ago as an issue.  Whether it is an online subscription or a subscription to an app, the issues remain the same.  On the face of it, these monthly fees and charges can be quite minimal so they almost slip past people's attention when they appear on their bank statements, but they do have an overall and cumulative damaging impact on people's finances.  That is why protections are needed.<\/p><p>What we are proposing is to replicate section 17602 of the Business and Professions Code of the State of California.  It would ensure people receive an adequate warning of an impending fee increase, and it would also make it easier to cancel a subscription online with the press of a button.  The principle is that it should, in fact, be as easy to unsubscribe as it is to subscribe in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#K01900","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1120,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the amendment.

The regulatory framework provided within this Bill is strong and well-intentioned.  However, I have an issue with the specific language under Chapter 5, section 139ZT of the Bill regarding a notice to end contravention, which outlines a criminal liability for senior managers and directors of companies where they fail to intervene in removing harmful online content.  I believe Digital Business Ireland has written to all of us on this specific language issue.  This section of the Bill provides that a senior manager or director can be held liable for any offence proven to be committed by &quot;any neglect&quot; rather than &quot;wilful neglect&quot; of their duties.  This has the potential for some very severe prosecutions for what potentially could be an unintentional error.  As a result of this offence, a director or senior manager would be liable for fines of up to &euro;500,000 or ten years in prison.  I put forward that the term &quot;any neglect&quot; in this section of the Bill should be replaced by &quot;wilful neglect&quot;, which would refer to negligence on the part of a senior manager or director that is deemed to be intentional or reckless and reflects a &quot;couldn't care less&quot; attitude.  The use of &quot;wilful&quot; versus &quot;any&quot; neglect in this section underlines the seriousness and strengthens the nature of the offence committed.<\/p><p>Looking at case law and other legislation addressing crimes of a serious nature such as this, we will not see the term, &quot;any neglect&quot;, used in place of &quot;wilful neglect&quot;.  The Minister might clarify if that is the case.  For example, wilful neglect is the standard applied in respect of corruption offences under the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018.  It is also there in the context of aiding and abetting of certain fraud offences under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Act 2021, and in references to certain money laundering or terrorist financing offences under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, to name but a few.  By inserting &quot;any&quot; instead of &quot;wilful&quot; neglect into this important legislation we are therefore moving away from Irish law.  We should question why this departure is taking place in this instance.<\/p><p>There is a distinct difference between the two phrases.  While there is a lack of specific Irish case law that underlines this distinction, the UK Court of Appeal distinguished &quot;any neglect&quot; from &quot;wilful neglect&quot;, stating that wilful neglect requires the defendant to be aware of the breach and still turn a blind eye.  On the other hand, &quot;any neglect&quot; could relate to an entirely inadvertent error on the part of a director or senior manager.  This distinction was also noted by the Law Reform Commission of Ireland in chapter 9 of its report, Regulatory Powers and Corporate Offences.  Significantly, the Law Commission for England and Wales in a similar paper, Criminal Liability in Regulatory Contexts, also concluded that the &quot;any neglect&quot; standard should never be used for serious criminal offences.<\/p><p>It is also important to emphasise that this offence will place a category one offence in the Bill, which is one of the most serious offences contained within it.  Individuals should not be exposed to such offences due to &quot;any neglect&quot; on their part, rather, deliberate or wilful neglect must take place.<\/p><p>I am conscious that I would like to see future-proofing of the Bill, especially for online social media companies.  For example, Meta is now building what it describes as the metaverse, a concept many of us cannot even understand.  If we strengthen this Bill to ensure that the phrase &quot;any neglect&quot; rather than &quot;wilful neglect&quot; is in it, we could tie up our courts for years with philosophical debates about what constitutes neglect rather than wilful intent.  I want to create a scenario where there is not a get-out-of-jail free card for social media companies that would have volumes of lawyers behind them debating the philosophical concept of &quot;any&quot;.  Let us strengthen the Bill by including intent.  If a social media company and its directors, for example, become aware of an issue, they have to enforce and act upon it.  However, we are talking about this Bill being with us for the next ten, 20 or 50 years, potentially.  We do not know what these technologies look like, but we know what intent looks like.  That is why I want to remove &quot;any&quot; and include &quot;wilful&quot;.  Somebody should be held accountable by the courts for an act they are responsible for but as we move to future technologies we are not aware of, we cannot legislate for that yet.  That is why intent must be placed in the Act.  I would love to hear the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#N03700","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1377,"content":"<p>As the Deputy said, this amendment seeks to replace the words &ldquo;any neglect&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;the consent or connivance of, or to have been attributable to any neglect&rdquo; in the provisions for senior management liability, where a provider of a designated online service commits an offence for failing to comply with a notice to end a contravention.<\/p> <p>  I understand that some industry stakeholders have raised concerns that the liability standard of &ldquo;any neglect&rdquo; is too low and have sought to replace it with &ldquo;wilful neglect&rdquo;.  I cannot accept this amendment for a number of reasons.  It is important to note that the senior management liability provisions in the Bill can only be triggered as part of the following series of steps: an authorised officer investigation has been carried out; coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n has determined that a contravention is occurring; the findings of an coimisi&uacute;n have been confirmed by a court; an coimisi&uacute;n has determined that a contravention is still occurring and has issued a notice to the provider of the designated online service to end the contravention; the provider of the designated online service has failed to comply with the notice and is being prosecuted for the offence by the Director of Public Prosecutions; and the Director of Public Prosecutions, independently to an coimisi&uacute;n, seeks to prosecute a director or senior manager under the secondary liability provision.  In this context, I think &ldquo;any neglect&rdquo; is appropriate.  It was provided for in this way in light of, on the one hand, the extensive financial sanctioning powers in the Bill and, on the other, the need to provide a particular balance in a Bill that deals with media, user-generated content and fundamental rights such as freedom of expression.<\/p> <p>  For context, I understand, and the Deputy raised this matter in his contribution, there are almost 1,500 references to the same liability standard in Irish law so this is not unique.  In this Bill, in fact, the circumstances provided for wherein senior management liability may be triggered are quite narrow.  Recent examples of its usage include the sanctions on Russia in light of its illegal invasion of Ukraine, building regulations, protected disclosure legislation, food safety regulations, domestic violence law and childcare laws.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referenced the UK's Law Commission report, but Ireland's Law Reform Commission report, Regulatory Powers and Corporate Offences, stated that this specific form of secondary liability \"does not necessarily result in undue harshness to a defendant, particularly where in a corporate setting the processes and procedures required to meet the standard of negligence are within the peculiar knowledge of the senior managers and comparable agents\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#N03800","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1378,"content":"<p>Okay.

If we have directors of these companies here, I would like to believe we could have Irish directors on their boards.  What is to stop them just relocating elsewhere?  I still believe intent has to be at the source of any law we create.  If somebody is made aware of wrongdoing, they have to respond.

The Bill as published would have restricted the scheme to community sound broadcasters.  This scheme has been under consideration for some time, and I understand may have originated when Deputy Naughten was Minister, a fact I want to acknowledge today.  The scheme formed part of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019 introduced in the Oireachtas by the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, and was subsequently incorporated into this Bill.  Amendment No. 293 inserts a definition of &ldquo;local sound broadcaster&rdquo; in order to give effect to the intention to extend the scheme to local broadcasters.

It is important to note that when we talk about supporting Irish music and Irish films, and when we talk about the role of RT&Eacute; or TG4 as public broadcasters having a role in supporting Irish culture, we do so at present with no clear definition of what counts as Irish music or Irish film.  Irish cultural works would be defined in terms of music under the music, artist, performance and lyrics, MAPL, criteria used in Canada for Canadian works.  This means works where the music or lyrics are written by an Irish resident, is performed by an artist resident in Ireland or is recorded in Ireland, regardless of who wrote or performed the music.  This status would be certified by the Arts Council.<\/p><p>In terms of cinema and audiovisual works, an Irish cultural work would be one where at least one of the producers or co-producers is established in Ireland, where the screenplay or script is written by an Irish resident, where at least half the screen time features Irish performers or participants, where the performance is recorded in Ireland or where the Irish language or Irish sign language feature prominently.  They are broad conditions but would provide clarity as to what is meant by an Irish cultural work when certain bodies are expected to support Irish cultural works.  We would also task an coimisi&uacute;n with including a duty towards Irish cultural works when granting licences to television and radio broadcasters.<\/p><p> In subsection (5) we would require an coimisi&uacute;n to produce a report every five years examining the breakdown of use of Irish cultural works to track progress effectively.  An coimisi&uacute;n would also examine options and make recommendations on what sort of content requirements or investment obligations should be used to support Irish cultural works in line with the commitment to cultural diversity under the AVMSD. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#P04500","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1496,"content":"<p>We all strongly support measures to support the works of Irish artists and the creation of Irish art.

This year, I launched the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, which will support 2,000 artists over three years.<\/p> <p>  However, the proposed amendment appears to be contrary to European Union law.  The proposed criteria for Irish cultural works offered in the amendment includes residence on the island of Ireland and supervision or control by producers on the island of Ireland.

It is the norm in other EU countries to require a percentage of catalogues on streaming sites, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, to be in their national language.  This helps to support domestic industries in line with EU commitments to cultural diversity.  It also helps to protect their national language community against the encroaching dominance of English language productions.  I am sure at some point all of us have watched a very dark Nordic programme and enjoyed it immensely.<\/p><p>Ireland is a special case in this regard.  English is the dominant language here and our market is flooded with films and shows from Britain and America.  This makes it difficult for Irish productions to compete or gain a foothold at home.  However, we understand that setting percentage requirements for English language productions would not combat this.  At a time when we have a national language, Irish, which is spoken by 40% of the population according to the 2016 census, we also have a special duty to restore that language nationally and to ensure Gaeltacht communities are not further pushed into speaking English, which we see happening day by day, and in their viewing of television or streaming services.  Requiring a small percentage of content to be in the Irish language and for prominence to be given to such content on screening sites with viewers and subscribers in Ireland, in the way that there is different content in France or Italy, would go a long way to grow the language and encourage use beyond what it has achieved so far.<\/p><p>We have seen worldwide phenomena when shows in languages other than English break through globally on streaming platforms such as &quot;Squid Game&quot; from South Korea or &quot;Borgen&quot;, which was in Danish.  It adds to the self-respect and prestige of these languages internationally for both the speakers and learners at home and abroad.  We know that Irish language content can be, and is, produced to the highest quality.  An array of award winning and internationally acclaimed films in Irish have hit our screens in recent years.<\/p><p>We could develop and build on that quite effectively through investment from streaming sites, not to mention the exposure to our diaspora but to our young people in Ireland for whom these platforms are their main way of accessing shows and films.  We are proposing a modest 5% by 2030, which will give ample time to achieve that percentage either through production investment or purchasing works in Irish, all of which benefit the sector and the workers here.  That would be increased to 10% by 2035.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 308 deals with ensuring Irish language works are prominent in these online catalogues, highlighted on someone's home page and through the algorithms the online streaming services utilise.  This is about normalising Irish and encouraging and celebrating the language.  It is about empowering people through those new and emerging technologies.  We have all changed how we consume our television watching and can engage with the language at our own pace.

The European Commission has published guidelines for member states regarding the method of calculating the share of European works in the catalogue of a video-on-demand service.  Under section 159B(3) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, it will be for an coimisi&uacute;n to make rules to determine whether video-on-demand services meet the European works quota.  I expect it will be heavily informed by the guidance of the European Commission in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that some member states have provided for a minimum quota for native language works in catalogues of video-on-demand services.  For example, I understand that the legal instrument providing for the European works requirement in France, published last summer, included a requirement that 40% of works should be in the French language, subject to agreement between individual services and the French audiovisual regulator.<\/p> <p>  In the Irish context such a requirement is complicated by two factors.  First, there is a relatively small catalogue of audiovisual works in the Irish language as a percentage of all audiovisual works in other languages.  We are attempting to address this through increased funding for TG4 and initiatives such as Cine4, which, of course, funded the beautiful \"An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in\", but there is still much work to be done.  I understand that the amendment sets out to partially address this by pushing out the imposition of a quota to 2031 and 2036, respectively.  However, there remains the risk that a perverse effect of the amendment would be to force video-on-demand services to provide a relatively smaller catalogue to meet the 5% and 10% quotas.  This would not be to the benefit of audiences.<\/p> <p>  The second factor is the number of video-on-demand services that will be regulated in Ireland.  Under the country-of-origin principle, those services established in Ireland would be regulated in Ireland for the entire EU.  As drafted, the amendment would require those services to adopt the Irish language requirements for their catalogues.

Those categories should be specifically referred to because they are specifically referred to in the provisions for the BAI sound and vision fund and the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The reason for the inclusion of the words &quot;supporting the work of Irish creative talent&quot; is that that is one of the four public service aims of the media as defined in the terms of reference of the Future of Media Commission and accepted by the commission in its report.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 314 relates to the funding of independent production companies and the amount that will be forthcoming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#R00200","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1506,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their amendments, which seek to amend the provisions of the Bill relating to the content production levy and schemes.  As the committee will be aware, Article 13.2 of the AVMSD provides an explicit legal basis for member states to levy media service providers that are under their jurisdiction or that are not under their jurisdiction but are targeting audiences in their territories for the purpose of funding European works.  I have opted to take the opportunity offered by Article 13.2 of the directive to provide for the imposition of a content production levy on media service providers to fund content production schemes to support the production of European works.<\/p> <p>  There was a lengthy debate on Committee Stage in the Seanad on both the content production levy and the scheme provisions of the Bill.  I committed then to return to consider a number of matters on the D&aacute;il debate on the Bill.  In particular, I committed to examine whether express provision could be made to ensure that development activities could be funded through a scheme; to examine whether a certain minimum proportion of funds paid out under a scheme could be ring-fenced for \"independent production companies\"; and to examine whether provision could be made in respect of the allocation of rights ownership between independent production companies and media service providers.  The Deputies have raised those three issues in their amendments and I intend to address them on Report Stage.  In addition, as I indicated during the debate in the Seanad, I expect that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n and Screen Ireland will work closely together with a view to maximising the potential of content production schemes.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the detail of the Deputies' amendments, amendment No. 309 seeks to require coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to impose a content production levy as soon as is practicable after establishment day.  As I have said previously, it would not be prudent or advisable to impose a levy until a comprehensive study has been undertaken into the incidence, design and prospective revenue of any content production levy.  That will allow coimisi&uacute;n na mean to identify any unintended consequences that may arise from the levy and to outline clearly whether and how the incidence of the levy will ultimately fall on audiences and consumers of audiovisual media services.  Given the many additional questions about the content production levy that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will need to answer, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  I understand that amendment No. 310 seeks to address a drafting error in the Bill, as published.  It is an intention of the Bill that a content production scheme should be open to all prospective producers of European works.  This error came to the attention of my officials shortly after the Bill was published and it was intended to address the issue when other Government amendments to the content production scheme were brought forward.  Accordingly, while I do not intend to accept the Deputies' amendment today, I will table a Report Stage amendment to correct the error.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the intention of amendment No. 311 is to ensure that funds provided under a content production scheme may be used to support \"development\" activities relating to a production.  At present, section 159F(2)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, specifies a number of development activities that can be supported under a scheme.  My preferred approach would be to amend that paragraph to provide absolute clarity that all stages of the development of an audiovisual programme may be funded under a scheme.  I cannot, then, accept this amendment but will seek to clarify further on Report Stage that a content production scheme may include funding for development activities.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 312 sets out additional detail in respect of the nature of programmes that could be funded under a scheme.  It is unnecessary to specify that a content production scheme may fund feature films, animation, drama and documentaries.  Section 159F(2) provides that a scheme may fund the production of audiovisual programmes, which captures all types of audiovisual content, including drama, films, animation and factual programmes.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 312 also provides that a content production scheme would specifically support works that relate to the works of Irish creative talent.  As I noted during Report Stage in the Seanad, the outstanding and defining quality of such works would appear to be that they are produced by, or involve the work of, Irish citizens.  This carries the implication that those of Irish nationality would be given preference in any funding provided through a content production scheme.  This would appear to be contrary to EU law as it would, on the face of it, place Irish citizens at an advantage over citizens or residents of other member states as regards a content production scheme and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 313 seeks to amend a description of the kinds of audiovisual programmes that may be funded under a scheme by qualifying a reference to the experiences of the people of the island of Ireland such that it refers to \"storytelling\" experiences.  The relevant paragraph of the Bill is intended to encompass experiences in the most expansive sense to facilitate the funding of the widest array of content.  The effect of the proposed amendment would be to restrict the types of content that could be funded and, therefore, I do not intend to accept it.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 314 seeks to require that 80% of the funding under a content production scheme would be ring-fenced for \"independent production companies\" and to provide for the prescription of a fair and equitable balance in rights ownership.  Although I do not intend to accept the amendment, I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage to provide for the ring-fencing of a certain proportion of funding for independent production companies.  I am also examining the question of providing that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n could make a certain allocation of rights ownership a requirement for receipt of funding under the scheme.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Deputies for their engagement and their amendments.  Our positions on a number of the matters discussed are quite close.  I look forward to tabling amendments to address those issues on Report Stage and to the debate that will ensue then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#R00300","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1507,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Munster wish to press or to withdraw the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#R00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1508,"content":"<p>I will withdraw it, reserving the right to resubmit it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#R00500","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":1509,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":1510,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 310 to 314, inclusive, not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1511,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 315:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 135, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:  \t<b>&ldquo;Obligation for Investment<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>159HA.<\/b>(1) The Commission, following consultation with audiovisual media service providers, audiovisual and screen production companies established in Ireland, workers and businesses engaged in audiovisual production, Screen Ireland, RT&Eacute;, Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge, Foras na Gaeilge, and the public, and no later than one year following its establishment, shall prepare and publish a report examining the possibilities and suggesting recommendations for introducing direct obligations on audiovisual media service providers operating in this State, in line with the Audiovisual Media Services Directive and following the example set by policies in other Member States of the European Union, with regard to the potential impacts of such obligations on audiovisual production, consumers, workers, businesses, media service providers, and the promotion of the Irish language and Irish cultural works.<br \/><br \/>(2) The report outlined in subsection (1) shall consider in particular the potential for&mdash; <blockquote> \t(a) requiring investment directly in the production or co-production of European works partly or wholly on the island of Ireland, works of Irish cultural expression, and works in the Irish language,<br \/><br \/>(b) requiring direct investment in the acquisition of rights for European works, particularly works of Irish cultural expression and works in the Irish language,<br \/><br \/>(c) regulating the release window for audiovisual works in the State to require a higher direct investment in audiovisual production as a condition for a shorter delay between theatrical release and the right to transmit on audiovisual platforms,<br \/><br \/>(d) any combination of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c). <\/blockquote>(3) The report shall be laid before the Minister, Screen Ireland, both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Joint Oireachtas Committee upon publication for consideration.<br \/><br \/>(4) The Minister, following consultation with the Minister of Finance and no later than six months following the publication of the report outlined in subsection (1) shall present draft legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas outlining proposals for the introduction of investment obligations for audiovisual media service providers.&rdquo;.    <\/blockquote> <p>Similar to amendment No. 307, this is something that is already done in other EU member states under EU law, specifically under the audiovisual and media services directive.  The idea is that providers of these services, such as streaming platforms llike Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, will be required to ensure part of their revenue is invested directly into European works, Irish cultural works and works in the Irish language.  France recently reached an agreement with providers in this regard, namely, the DDADUE, which will see tens of millions of euro of new investment result in cultural output in French and job creation opportunities in the process.  Such rules implemented in this State would provide &euro;10 million of investment from one streaming site alone.<\/p><p>We are not setting out with restrictive vision as to how such a model could be implemented in Ireland as we do not believe that we are the experts.  We are instead asking that the commission meet with the stakeholders and produce a report within a year outlining options that the Department produces legislation within another six months of that with a view to implementing investor obligations.  As we have spoken of at length this afternoon, we often hear of things we cannot do due to EU law.  However, this is an example of what we can do under EU law.  It is something that could deliver quite incredible results if we were to do so.  There should not be any delay in seeking benefits for the industry, performers and audience that are enjoyed by other countries.  At the very least, we should be asking for that report to be made available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#S00100","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1512,"content":"<p>The purpose of this amendment is to require coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to carry out research on the introduction of investment obligations on media service providers operating in the State.  The amendment also provides that the Minister shall present draft legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas outlining proposals for the introduction of investment obligations for audiovisual media service providers not later than six months following publication of the report.<\/p> <p>  Before addressing the substance of the proposed amendment, I wish to note that it was determined that a content production levy was the most appropriate approach in the Irish context.  As with the existing sound and vision scheme administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the model envisaged in the Bill would allow producers to compete for funding on a transparent and competitive basis in line with objective criteria.  This would not be the case with investment obligations, where decisions on the nature of content to be funded would sit with the company subject to the investment obligation.  Furthermore, it is not possible under EU law to introduce an investment obligation based on a specific production location within Europe.  Our approach in respect of the content production levy already ensures a minimum of 25% of funds raised must be allocated to the production of Irish language content.  It is also worth noting that any investment obligation would have to be for the production of European works and not necessarily Irish content.  Many major EU-based providers targeting Ireland would likely already fulfil that requirement through their existing investments, so there may not be a substantial net benefit to Ireland from such a measure.<\/p> <p>  I do not propose to accept this amendment as I am of the view that section 7 of the Broadcasting Act as inserted by section 7 of this Bill will contain appropriate provisions to enable an coimisi&uacute;n to carry out research in relation to this matter.  I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to section 7(5)(d), which enables the commission to conduct strategic reviews on a number of matters including the funding of sector.  I also note that the Minister will have the power under this provision to direct an coimisi&uacute;n to carry out research on any matter connected to its functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#S00200","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1513,"content":"<p>I have one supplementary question on that issue.

The committee needs to be furnished with an explanatory memorandum to consider that.  From where is the impetus for that change coming?  How is it being considered?

I also thank members for their general support for the Bill during pre-legislative scrutiny and on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  As members are aware, this is a long and technical Bill.  As well as transposing the enforcement and security provisions of the European electronic communications code, the Bill provides the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, with a new civil enforcement regime and an updated criminal enforcement procedure for the electronic communications sector.  The Bill give the enforcement of the electronic communication security measures a legislative basis.  It also provides for additional consumer protections and makes a number of amendments to the Communications Regulation Act 2002.  The Bill represents the biggest update to the regulation of the electronic communications sector since ComReg's establishment in 2002.  It will provide ComReg with the tools it needs to effectively regulate the sector today, and it will bring its powers further in line with comparable regulators in the State and elsewhere in Europe.  In doing so, it will fulfil a programme for Government commitment.<\/p> <p>  I indicated on Second Stage that I would bring forward an amendment in relation to the Digital Hub Development Agency Act 2003 that would confer a function on the board to dispose of its land and property assets on foot of a directive by the Minister pursuant to the 2003 Act.  I am also bringing forward a number of amendments that are focused on the security of electronic communications networks, specifically dealing with the issue of high-risk vendors, HRVs.  These amendments will set out how a risk assessment will be conducted in alignment with the principles of the EU 5G security toolbox.  Recognising the functions exercised by certain Departments and agencies in respect of national security, the risk assessment will be conducted in consultation with relevant stakeholders across government.  The amendment will also set out how HRVs will be designated, and will provide for ministerial notices to restrict or ban designated vendors on networks as a whole or on specific parts of networks.  ComReg should be tasked with the supervision and enforcement of orders relating to HRVs.  Similar legislation has been implemented in 19 EU member states, with a further five indicating that they are at an advanced stage of preparation.  Likewise, the UK enacted similar provisions recently.<\/p> <p>  I also mentioned on Second Stage the possibility that the Government will bring forward a short amendment to the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 in order to provide for payments to be made to or via An Post, particularly in the context of the provision of support to postmasters.  This amendment is the subject of ongoing engagement with the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p> <p>  Two other short amendments will be brought forward in relation to the alternative dispute resolution, ADR, process outlined in the Bill.  The first is a minor amendment that will broaden the scope of disputes that can be subject to ADR to align with current practice and to better reflect the text of the code.  The second will adjust the scope of the code of practice for complaints to align it with the scope for ADR.  <\/p> <p>  Aside from some further examination and possible modification of the definitions and structure of the Bill as a result of these amendments, some consideration has also been given to whether further amendments are required to the appeals provisions found in Parts 2 and 3.  Legal advice is being sought on this matter.  As these amendments require further development, I put the committee on notice that I hope to bring them forward on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Government amendments put forward today, I will give more explanation for the reasons behind each of them when we reach them.  That concludes my opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022102600002#B01100","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1563,"content":"<p>We will now move to our consideration of the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022102600002#B01200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":1564,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1565,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 cannot be moved as it requires a motion of instruction to committee.

The Minister can take information he or she is given into account and give that information to the court to justify a decision but that information is unavailable for the other side to test.

A failure to adhere to this notice has criminal consequences.  If I am accused of something, I have the right to test the information that supports the accusation.  The Minister of State is saying that information given to the High Court will not be provided to the other party to the appeal.  If we are seeking to subvert the interference of nefarious states in communications in this State, the way to do it is not to adopt facets of their criminal justice systems.  I will use a word that is bandied about but it is positively Kafkaesque that a Minister will give information to a High Court judge to justify a decision but the other side will be unable to test that information, call it a complete load of codswallop and explain why that is the case.  The other side will never even see that information.  A High Court judge is supposed to act independently of a Minister.  We have separation of powers in this State, which has been pretty well respected since the its foundation.  A judge is supposed to look at the information but cannot hear the opinion of the other side.  In fact, a judge cannot even tell the other side that he or she has the information.  The other side cannot even test the Minister's opinion and assertion that the relevant information goes to matters of security.

The State will say it is uncomfortable with such a vendor's equipment being used in its critical infrastructure networks.  The information provided will not always be suitable for publication.

In terms of appalling vistas, a judge once dismissed the whole idea of an appalling vista.  He was a very good judge, one of the better ones on the Bench in England and Wales at the time.  Unfortunately, the appalling vista came to pass, so they do happen.  The idea is not to provide powers that enable them to happen.  I see one of the officials finds this entertaining, but I have concerns about the amount of power that this measure gives, not to the Irish security services but to foreign security services.  In Ireland, we have a national security service that barely operates.  We do not have a large international security apparatus.  Some states that do are present in Ireland.  When it suits us, we like to think we are the 51st state of one such state and when it does not suit us, we like to portray the polar opposite.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is very much not a stooge for the American, Chinese or Russian embassies, but there is a possibility that, down the line, there will be Ministers who may be stooges for other powers.  Business and money come into this in a very big way.  A very high-profile trade stand-off is taking place between China and the United States on the development of computer components.  Is it beyond the realms of possibility that national security apparatuses are used, abused and manipulated to further the financial interests of a state?  I believe it is not beyond the realms of possibility.  It is quite likely that that would happen, in particular in western economies when we find ourselves with no resources whatsoever or in a time of a shortage of resources.  The United States less so because the dollar is the fiat currency and the US is not in decline in the way that Europe is.  I am digressing, however.<\/p> <p>  I am saying that there is a strong possibility for abuse.  What the Minister of State is saying is that an order can be made by him or his successors.  The legal person could be Jimmy Browne or an international corporation but let us not pretend that a criminal sanction against a corporation is less of a criminal sanction than one against an individual, unless of course we think corporations are not entitled to fair procedures and natural justice.

Who would be in a position to give that information to the Minister of State other than An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I find it difficult to know what information An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or, indeed, any part of our national security apparatus would have on the state of play of semiconductor manufacture in China or how much it is or is not suffering as a result of American measures.  Surely, the only ones who could tell the Minister of State that would be the American security apparatus.  Perhaps the Chinese might want to volunteer that they are actually suffering from this, although I doubt it.  They might want to volunteer that information, however.<\/p> <p>  This whole idea that people will not have the definition and whether it endangers national security is not just about the information itself, but the source of that information.  My concern is for the information the Minister of State might receive, although maybe not him personally because he might have a very critical mind.  There is always the danger that successors will be less inquisitive and critical.  The Minister of State might get lots of information from the American, Chinese, Russian or Israeli Embassies, for example, which might suggest that a vendor's components are sloppy or that a vendor will not be in a position to provide enough of them.  The Minister of State might decide to label somebody a high-risk vendor on the basis of that information.  The vendor then appeals that and goes to the High Court, where the Minister of State says he cannot give the vendor the information he received.  That is not because of what that information is.<\/p><p>It is no particular threat to the security of this State what the state of play of the semi-conductor manufacturing sector in China is.  Rather, a Minister will say that he or she cannot share the information because he or she got it from the British Embassy, the US Embassy or wherever as part of an exchange of information in which confidentiality was assured.  The Minister could give the information to the judge but could not give it to the vendor.  The idea is that we will differentiate between what is and is not national security, yet all of the information the Government is going to rely on is going to come from external sources.  Let us be real, in that we do not have a sufficiently large international intelligence service.  Most of the espionage networks operating in this country are not here because they are worried about what the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, plans to do with the Army any time soon.  They are here to figure out what companies are doing.  A great deal of espionage is based around companies and competition, including competition between states.  There is a distinct possibility that someone in the Minister of State's shoes could in future fall prey to that and make decisions that could not be challenged in an open court.  It is unusual for High Court sittings to be held in private, although they are held in private in family law cases.  For all of the flaws in the process, a case to convict someone of terrorist offences, even terrorist offences in the Middle East, is open and transparent. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022102600002#G02600","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":1766,"content":"<p>The Minister can use information from third-party sources.

These provisions will provide that extant decisions relating to ComReg's current alternative dispute resolution process continue as appropriate under the new regime and that disputes that are pending at the time of the new provisions coming into operation are preserved.  To do this, amendments Nos. 17 and 18 will insert a new definition of &quot;Universal Service Regulations&quot; into the interpretations section relating to Part 4 of the Bill.  Section 39, inserted by amendment No. 19, will ensure that a dispute that is before ComReg or an independent person nominated by ComReg under regulation No. 27 can continue as if those regulations had not been repealed.<\/p><p>While the Bill will make worthy amendments to the current regime, it is also important to provide explicit transitional provisions to address extant disputes that are currently with ComReg, or an independent person, for resolution under that regulation to ensure no consumer's dispute inadvertently fell in the transition between the old dispute resolution regime and the new alternative dispute resolution regime established by the Bill.<\/p><p> A new section 40 inserted by amendment No. 20 will ensure that a measure enforced pursuant to regulation No. 27 can continue in force under Part 4.  Under regulation No. 27, ComReg took a number of measures to better implement the regime, including specifying requirements concerning operators' codes of practice for complaint handling and specifying the procedures for dispute resolution, as any measure taken by ComReg requires consideration, consultation with stakeholders and finalisation.
