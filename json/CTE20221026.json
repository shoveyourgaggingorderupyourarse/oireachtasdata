I know the committee did a lot of work on this before I took over this brief with my predecessor, Deputy Troy.<\/p> <p>  As members know, the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Acts 2003 to 2019 to increase the number of personal injury claims resolved by the board without recourse to litigation.  It was clear during the Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il that in the main, the Bill was positively received by Deputies across all parties.  The resounding message from that debate was the need for reform.  The valuable work the board undertakes was mentioned by many Deputies during the Second Stage debate and I agree that this work should in no way be undermined.  The changes proposed by this Bill have been carefully considered in consultation with the board and are aimed at strengthening the current model to resolve a greater number of personal injury claims.  Deputies raised a number of questions during the debate and we engaged with a number of them afterwards.  This includes Deputies O'Reilly, Shanahan and Flaherty, along with Senators Mullen, Crowe and Casey and I thank them for meeting me and engaging with me to tease out those issues further.<\/p> <p>  Arising from those discussions and based on input from the board, pending drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, I intend moving three amendments on Report Stage.  The first amendment is a new section in the Personal Injuries Resolution Board Bill 2022, to provide for an amendment to section 69 of the principal Act to ensure that mediators appointed from a panel are provided the same level of indemnity as mediators who are staff members.  The second amendment will introduce another section to the Bill and provide for a review of the Bill.  The third amendment is a technical amendment to section 23 of the Bill to enable the proper commencement of the Bill.<\/p><p> My intention is to move forward with this legislation swiftly.  The committee has recommended the same.  The sooner we can extend the remit of the board, the sooner more claims can be settled within a faster and more cost-efficient process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022102600002#A00500","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I will be tabling an amendment on Report Stage relating to a review process.

This is a simple amendment relating specifically to the board make-up of RT&Eacute;.  When TG4 was established as the all-Irish broadcaster, it was put into law that 100% of the board must be competent in Irish.  RT&Eacute; was established as a bilingual national broadcaster, yet there remain no requirements in place for Irish competency in RT&Eacute;.  RT&Eacute; has obligations to broadcast and provide services in Irish as well as English, and it is clear from the reports from An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga that RT&Eacute; has failed in this regard and failed to fulfil obligations to the Irish language.<\/p><p>Aside from Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta only a tiny fraction of what RT&Eacute; broadcasts is in Irish.  In a 2017 report, An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga said it was less than 1%.  I appreciate things may have improved slightly since 2017 but they have not improved to the degree they need to.  Where content is produced in Irish, reporters are paid less than their counterparts doing the same work in English.  All of this points to RT&Eacute; failing to take seriously its obligation to the Irish language and its obligations as a bilingual broadcaster.  In any other bilingual state it would be expected that the board would at least have a competency in both languages of that state.  That does not exist here.<\/p><p>This amendment would also ensure Irish is an essential requirement for half the membership of the RT&Eacute; board.  They would have to be able to use, speak and communicate in both English and Irish.  It is almost insulting to say we could not find competent people to sit on the board of RT&Eacute;.  Almost 40% of the country has some level of Irish.  It would be very insulting to say we could not find talented, experienced and skilled people who are competent in the Irish language to take up a position on that.  By not ensuring the board is competent in Irish, we are in turn failing to ensure the Irish language itself and the Irish-speaking community are understood and represented at board meetings.  There is a risk of the same problems that have happened in the past reoccurring in future.  I again refer to the 2017 report.  RT&Eacute; stands for Raidi&oacute; Teilif&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann and not the Irish television station.  Those who use the Irish language on a daily basis have a very realistic expectation we ensure that, at the very top of that organisation, there are people at board level who are competent and able to communicate effectively in the Irish language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#B00900","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the amendment.

As with amendment No. 86, I cannot accept amendment No. 87 as it simply repeats a change to the 2009 Act made by the Bill, in this case in section 33.<\/p> <p>  The other element of this amendment seeks to change the requirement on RT&Eacute; to make available a national television and sound broadcasting service to the whole community on the island of Ireland &ldquo;as far as is reasonably practicable&rdquo; to a requirement to make it available &ldquo;in full&rdquo;.  This would not be appropriate as it would legally oblige RT&Eacute; to obtain a set of circumstances where it does not reasonably have the means to ensure those circumstances would always be in place, particularly as RT&Eacute; is not a State body in both jurisdictions on this island.  As with amendment No. 86, this amendment would have the effect, for instance, of obliging broadcasts to make available sports events both within and outside the jurisdiction of the State.  Acquisition of rights to sporting events are a commercial matter between a rights-holder or sports body and broadcasters.  These are very often allocated on an exclusive territorial basis and, as such, it is not possible to legislate for and compel RT&Eacute; to make such events available.  Examples of such events might include the World Cup or the Olympics.<\/p> <p>  I understand the frustration of viewers in Northern Ireland when certain events may not be shown on RT&Eacute; in Northern Ireland given the distribution of rights to those events.  However, I am advised this amendment would not make a difference to the current position.  Were this amendment to be interpreted as compelling RT&Eacute; to acquire rights to sporting events, such as the Olympics, on an all-island basis, there could be significant unintended consequences in terms of the amount of additional expenditure that would need to be incurred by RT&Eacute;.  For example, were a rights-holder aware that RT&Eacute; is compelled by legislation to make events available on an all-island basis, it may seek to charge a premium, given it would know that RT&Eacute; would have to acquire the rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#C00400","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I have a query for the Minister in relation to what she said.

RT&Eacute; shall ensure that no worker is paid more for the same amount and form of work to produce content in the English language as a worker is paid to produce content in the Irish language.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>The amendment pertains to what many see as a particularly gross and offensive situation that has been allowed to develop.  In many ways it meets the definition of &quot;discrimination&quot;.  Workers at Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta are being paid up to 25% less than their counterparts in English at RT&Eacute; Radio for the same work.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  I understand that the committee has tried to raise this matter directly with RT&Eacute; but has yet to receive any form of a proposed solution.  It is quite disgraceful that despite this specific injustice having been raised, no solution or offer of a solution has come.  Deputy Munster raised the matter back in January when RT&Eacute; was undertaking a review into different pay grades and representatives from RT&Eacute; said they would not examine the difference in pay based on working in Irish or English.  It is frankly appalling that this has been allowed drag on.  It is a basic matter of workers' rights and the equality of workers who work in Irish, which in reality often involves more work than those operating through the English language.  Irish language reporters may have to translate items or prepare and support interviewees with little Irish, while competing with an English language service that often has more traction, investment and resources.  Effectively, the Irish language reporters are doing more work than their English language counterparts but are getting less pay.  This sends a stark message to those who would like to work through the Irish language that they will be valued less and that Irish is not seen as a skill but as a burden.  All Irish language workers could do their work through English as well, meaning that they are more skilled than their counterparts.  Instead of being rewarded for that additional skill and the additional work, they are penalised for it.  If we are serious about attracting young people into careers that involve the Irish language, this fundamental issue needs to be addressed and resolved.  Regardless of what language a journalist is working in, the quality of their work should determine their rate of pay.  There should be nothing controversial about the amendment.  It is a basic workers' rights issue and it is one we have an opportunity to fix.  We have an opportunity to make sure this does not happen to anybody else working in this area, be it in the Irish language or English.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#D00600","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>This amendment would introduce obligations regarding the rates of pay for RT&Eacute; employees.

There is a compellability factor there that we really should consider.<\/p><p>The commission, as the new regulator that ensures public service content is given prominence on these guides, should have the power to make rules as to what prominence is needed in the public interest, particularly when it comes to the Irish language.  Our media is dominated by English.  The vast majority of programmes on our televisions and of what we hear on the radio is in English.  We need to strike a balance in that regard.  We need almost to rebalance that to give Irish prominence for Irish-speaking communities in order that when we click onto our TV guide or a catalogue of shows, the option to receive it in Irish or in English is available.  Every one of us in this room has that option already when it comes to accessing our emails.  We can access our Oireachtas emails in Irish or in English.  The technology is there to do that.  The vast majority of us may opt for one language, but the potential for the other is there.  As a country, we are committed to ensuring that people use and learn Irish in order that it becomes part of our daily lives, and the media serve a vital role in that regard.  We all remember back to our secondary school days, when, if we were learning a foreign language, we were often shown a programme with subtitles in French, for example, as well as the audio being in French.  If we could move towards that scenario for Irish, it would go some way to assisting those seeking to learn it and those who are in school to encourage them to become more fluent in the language.  Amendments Nos. 98 and 99 would empower the commission to make rules as to how Irish-language content should be prominent on those interactive guides.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 100 is slightly different because it deals with the devices.  If it is okay to mention one television brand by name, with Philips TVs, in the menu one can choose to set up the television in Irish, so the technology is available.  What we need to ensure is that the use of that technology is encouraged among the other providers of televisions.  That could greatly help learners.  It also creates an environment in which Irish becomes immersive and a language in its own right that people use day to day because it is then almost constantly in their world.  I understand that an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh had proposed other amendments around subtitling and audio descriptions being included in both languages.  I saw that as a very positive step, and I say that as somebody who has very little Irish and is busy learning at the moment.  Having more exposure to Irish in various forums assists immensely with that.  It also assists those who are currently Irish speakers and who may have disabilities.  For those who may be visually impaired, to have the Irish in an audio description would ensure that their right as members of the Irish-speaking community is respected and upheld.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to take these amendments on board, see their value and recognise that the technology for this to become normal in our world is already in use.  When we go to set up our televisions we can choose which language we want to set them up in.  Irish should be one of those languages.  I ask the Minister to recognise the value of these amendments to those who are members of an Irish-speaking community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#E01600","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 98 and 99 are intended to ensure that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n provide for the prominence of Irish-language programming and services in any rules made by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n under section 128C of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill.<\/p> <p>  As I indicated earlier, public service programmes and public service media services include, by virtue of the definitions set out in section 128A of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, RT&Eacute; and TG4.

I will tell the commission to deal with this as a matter of priority but it is also about dealing with it on an EU-wide basis.  In May, the European Commission launched a new European strategy for a Better Internet for Kids.  The strategy is built on three pillars - child protection in the online environment; digital empowerment; and active participation.  Under the child protection pillar, there is a strong focus on providing age-appropriate online experiences, which the amendment is trying to address, including through age verification and age-appropriate design.  In this regard, the Commission commits to facilitating a comprehensive code of conduct on age-appropriate design by 2024 using the provisions of the DSA, which provides that such codes of conduct may be co-regulatory instruments.  The Commission has indicated that the code could provide for age verification for accessing certain online content.  To facilitate age verification, the Commission has committed to work with member states and EU standardisation to strengthen effective age verification methods.  This would be most effective if it was done on a Europe-wide basis and that is why we need to wait.  There is a pilot as well called euCONSENT.<\/p><p>I think I have mentioned the pilot to the Deputy previously during Question Time or at the committee.

Policy regarding employment rights is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and is more appropriately dealt with in employment legislation.  The amendment is also straying into matters which may be more appropriate to the functions of the Workplace Relations Commission.  In particular, section 11(1)(d) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 provides that the WRC shall \"conduct reviews of, and monitor developments as respects, workplace relations\".  I would be wary of any provision that might have the effect of duplicating the work of the WRC.  I understand the intention of the amendment.  The protection of workers' rights is an important consideration in all sectors, including the sectors which are regulated by the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I also acknowledge the concerns raised by Deputies regarding working conditions in the technology sector.  Last year, the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment heard evidence from trade unions, experts and content moderators regarding their working conditions.  The evidence pointed to issues regarding the pay and conditions of content moderators and some of the dangers inherent in the practice of hiring employees through outsourcing firms.  One of the witnesses, a former content moderator, set out the very difficult nature of the work involved, as Deputy Mythen noted, and in particular the kinds of distressing content that she was required to view as part of the role. <\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste also addressed the committee and stressed the duty of care that employers have towards employees to create a safe working environment.  He also indicated to the Chair of the committee that he had written to a particular technology company about the terms and conditions of content moderators and indicated that it would be on the agenda when he spoke to the company again. <\/p> <p>  It is important to stress that the protection of workers&rsquo; rights is not a core function of my Department or its agencies.  It is important that our employment rights framework, which is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, places consistent rules and obligations on employers in all sectors of the economy.<\/p> <p>  Moving responsibility for workers&rsquo; rights to sectoral regulators would dilute the enforcement of the overarching framework and potentially lead to an inconsistent approach between sectors.  In that regard, the role of an coimisi&uacute;n, as an independent regulatory body, is ultimately to enforce new and updated regulatory frameworks for content regulation across broadcasting, video-on-demand and designated online services.  It is not intended to regulate employment relations or assess working conditions. <\/p> <p>  As a general principle, in considering any amendments to expand the functions of an coimisi&uacute;n I am very conscious of not unduly expanding the scope of an coimisi&uacute;n into other areas of policy, with the effect that its core functions, which I have just outlined, might suffer or that it might duplicate the functions of other bodies in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#G01700","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>We are asking for a code to be produced.

There is also a very real difficulty around the exit procedures from some subscription services.  I cannot be the only person in this room who remembers the premium ringtones from the 1990s and the horror that ensued when trying to cancel those subscriptions.  That triggered legislation in other jurisdictions which we benefited from, thankfully.  However, it is still an issue.  It was actually highlighted on RT&Eacute;'s &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot; show a number of months ago as an issue.  Whether it is an online subscription or a subscription to an app, the issues remain the same.  On the face of it, these monthly fees and charges can be quite minimal so they almost slip past people's attention when they appear on their bank statements, but they do have an overall and cumulative damaging impact on people's finances.  That is why protections are needed.<\/p><p>What we are proposing is to replicate section 17602 of the Business and Professions Code of the State of California.  It would ensure people receive an adequate warning of an impending fee increase, and it would also make it easier to cancel a subscription online with the press of a button.  The principle is that it should, in fact, be as easy to unsubscribe as it is to subscribe in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#K01900","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the amendment.

The regulatory framework provided within this Bill is strong and well-intentioned.  However, I have an issue with the specific language under Chapter 5, section 139ZT of the Bill regarding a notice to end contravention, which outlines a criminal liability for senior managers and directors of companies where they fail to intervene in removing harmful online content.  I believe Digital Business Ireland has written to all of us on this specific language issue.  This section of the Bill provides that a senior manager or director can be held liable for any offence proven to be committed by &quot;any neglect&quot; rather than &quot;wilful neglect&quot; of their duties.  This has the potential for some very severe prosecutions for what potentially could be an unintentional error.  As a result of this offence, a director or senior manager would be liable for fines of up to &euro;500,000 or ten years in prison.  I put forward that the term &quot;any neglect&quot; in this section of the Bill should be replaced by &quot;wilful neglect&quot;, which would refer to negligence on the part of a senior manager or director that is deemed to be intentional or reckless and reflects a &quot;couldn't care less&quot; attitude.  The use of &quot;wilful&quot; versus &quot;any&quot; neglect in this section underlines the seriousness and strengthens the nature of the offence committed.<\/p><p>Looking at case law and other legislation addressing crimes of a serious nature such as this, we will not see the term, &quot;any neglect&quot;, used in place of &quot;wilful neglect&quot;.  The Minister might clarify if that is the case.  For example, wilful neglect is the standard applied in respect of corruption offences under the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018.  It is also there in the context of aiding and abetting of certain fraud offences under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) Act 2021, and in references to certain money laundering or terrorist financing offences under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, to name but a few.  By inserting &quot;any&quot; instead of &quot;wilful&quot; neglect into this important legislation we are therefore moving away from Irish law.  We should question why this departure is taking place in this instance.<\/p><p>There is a distinct difference between the two phrases.  While there is a lack of specific Irish case law that underlines this distinction, the UK Court of Appeal distinguished &quot;any neglect&quot; from &quot;wilful neglect&quot;, stating that wilful neglect requires the defendant to be aware of the breach and still turn a blind eye.  On the other hand, &quot;any neglect&quot; could relate to an entirely inadvertent error on the part of a director or senior manager.  This distinction was also noted by the Law Reform Commission of Ireland in chapter 9 of its report, Regulatory Powers and Corporate Offences.  Significantly, the Law Commission for England and Wales in a similar paper, Criminal Liability in Regulatory Contexts, also concluded that the &quot;any neglect&quot; standard should never be used for serious criminal offences.<\/p><p>It is also important to emphasise that this offence will place a category one offence in the Bill, which is one of the most serious offences contained within it.  Individuals should not be exposed to such offences due to &quot;any neglect&quot; on their part, rather, deliberate or wilful neglect must take place.<\/p><p>I am conscious that I would like to see future-proofing of the Bill, especially for online social media companies.  For example, Meta is now building what it describes as the metaverse, a concept many of us cannot even understand.  If we strengthen this Bill to ensure that the phrase &quot;any neglect&quot; rather than &quot;wilful neglect&quot; is in it, we could tie up our courts for years with philosophical debates about what constitutes neglect rather than wilful intent.  I want to create a scenario where there is not a get-out-of-jail free card for social media companies that would have volumes of lawyers behind them debating the philosophical concept of &quot;any&quot;.  Let us strengthen the Bill by including intent.  If a social media company and its directors, for example, become aware of an issue, they have to enforce and act upon it.  However, we are talking about this Bill being with us for the next ten, 20 or 50 years, potentially.  We do not know what these technologies look like, but we know what intent looks like.  That is why I want to remove &quot;any&quot; and include &quot;wilful&quot;.  Somebody should be held accountable by the courts for an act they are responsible for but as we move to future technologies we are not aware of, we cannot legislate for that yet.  That is why intent must be placed in the Act.  I would love to hear the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#N03700","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>As the Deputy said, this amendment seeks to replace the words &ldquo;any neglect&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;the consent or connivance of, or to have been attributable to any neglect&rdquo; in the provisions for senior management liability, where a provider of a designated online service commits an offence for failing to comply with a notice to end a contravention.<\/p> <p>  I understand that some industry stakeholders have raised concerns that the liability standard of &ldquo;any neglect&rdquo; is too low and have sought to replace it with &ldquo;wilful neglect&rdquo;.  I cannot accept this amendment for a number of reasons.  It is important to note that the senior management liability provisions in the Bill can only be triggered as part of the following series of steps: an authorised officer investigation has been carried out; coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n has determined that a contravention is occurring; the findings of an coimisi&uacute;n have been confirmed by a court; an coimisi&uacute;n has determined that a contravention is still occurring and has issued a notice to the provider of the designated online service to end the contravention; the provider of the designated online service has failed to comply with the notice and is being prosecuted for the offence by the Director of Public Prosecutions; and the Director of Public Prosecutions, independently to an coimisi&uacute;n, seeks to prosecute a director or senior manager under the secondary liability provision.  In this context, I think &ldquo;any neglect&rdquo; is appropriate.  It was provided for in this way in light of, on the one hand, the extensive financial sanctioning powers in the Bill and, on the other, the need to provide a particular balance in a Bill that deals with media, user-generated content and fundamental rights such as freedom of expression.<\/p> <p>  For context, I understand, and the Deputy raised this matter in his contribution, there are almost 1,500 references to the same liability standard in Irish law so this is not unique.  In this Bill, in fact, the circumstances provided for wherein senior management liability may be triggered are quite narrow.  Recent examples of its usage include the sanctions on Russia in light of its illegal invasion of Ukraine, building regulations, protected disclosure legislation, food safety regulations, domestic violence law and childcare laws.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referenced the UK's Law Commission report, but Ireland's Law Reform Commission report, Regulatory Powers and Corporate Offences, stated that this specific form of secondary liability \"does not necessarily result in undue harshness to a defendant, particularly where in a corporate setting the processes and procedures required to meet the standard of negligence are within the peculiar knowledge of the senior managers and comparable agents\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#N03800","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Okay.

If we have directors of these companies here, I would like to believe we could have Irish directors on their boards.  What is to stop them just relocating elsewhere?  I still believe intent has to be at the source of any law we create.  If somebody is made aware of wrongdoing, they have to respond.

The Bill as published would have restricted the scheme to community sound broadcasters.  This scheme has been under consideration for some time, and I understand may have originated when Deputy Naughten was Minister, a fact I want to acknowledge today.  The scheme formed part of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019 introduced in the Oireachtas by the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, and was subsequently incorporated into this Bill.  Amendment No. 293 inserts a definition of &ldquo;local sound broadcaster&rdquo; in order to give effect to the intention to extend the scheme to local broadcasters.  In practice, the definition of &quot;local&quot; includes any contract for a sound broadcasting service in an area consisting of a part of the State.

It is important to note that when we talk about supporting Irish music and Irish films, and when we talk about the role of RT&Eacute; or TG4 as public broadcasters having a role in supporting Irish culture, we do so at present with no clear definition of what counts as Irish music or Irish film.  Irish cultural works would be defined in terms of music under the music, artist, performance and lyrics, MAPL, criteria used in Canada for Canadian works.  This means works where the music or lyrics are written by an Irish resident, is performed by an artist resident in Ireland or is recorded in Ireland, regardless of who wrote or performed the music.  This status would be certified by the Arts Council.<\/p><p>In terms of cinema and audiovisual works, an Irish cultural work would be one where at least one of the producers or co-producers is established in Ireland, where the screenplay or script is written by an Irish resident, where at least half the screen time features Irish performers or participants, where the performance is recorded in Ireland or where the Irish language or Irish sign language feature prominently.  They are broad conditions but would provide clarity as to what is meant by an Irish cultural work when certain bodies are expected to support Irish cultural works.  We would also task an coimisi&uacute;n with including a duty towards Irish cultural works when granting licences to television and radio broadcasters.<\/p><p> In subsection (5) we would require an coimisi&uacute;n to produce a report every five years examining the breakdown of use of Irish cultural works to track progress effectively.  An coimisi&uacute;n would also examine options and make recommendations on what sort of content requirements or investment obligations should be used to support Irish cultural works in line with the commitment to cultural diversity under the AVMSD. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#P04500","speaker":"1495","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":625,"content":"<p>We all strongly support measures to support the works of Irish artists and the creation of Irish art.

This year, I launched the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, which will support 2,000 artists over three years.<\/p> <p>  However, the proposed amendment appears to be contrary to European Union law.  The proposed criteria for Irish cultural works offered in the amendment includes residence on the island of Ireland and supervision or control by producers on the island of Ireland.

It is the norm in other EU countries to require a percentage of catalogues on streaming sites, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, to be in their national language.  This helps to support domestic industries in line with EU commitments to cultural diversity.  It also helps to protect their national language community against the encroaching dominance of English language productions.  I am sure at some point all of us have watched a very dark Nordic programme and enjoyed it immensely.<\/p><p>Ireland is a special case in this regard.  English is the dominant language here and our market is flooded with films and shows from Britain and America.  This makes it difficult for Irish productions to compete or gain a foothold at home.  However, we understand that setting percentage requirements for English language productions would not combat this.  At a time when we have a national language, Irish, which is spoken by 40% of the population according to the 2016 census, we also have a special duty to restore that language nationally and to ensure Gaeltacht communities are not further pushed into speaking English, which we see happening day by day, and in their viewing of television or streaming services.  Requiring a small percentage of content to be in the Irish language and for prominence to be given to such content on screening sites with viewers and subscribers in Ireland, in the way that there is different content in France or Italy, would go a long way to grow the language and encourage use beyond what it has achieved so far.<\/p><p>We have seen worldwide phenomena when shows in languages other than English break through globally on streaming platforms such as &quot;Squid Game&quot; from South Korea or &quot;Borgen&quot;, which was in Danish.  It adds to the self-respect and prestige of these languages internationally for both the speakers and learners at home and abroad.  We know that Irish language content can be, and is, produced to the highest quality.  An array of award winning and internationally acclaimed films in Irish have hit our screens in recent years.<\/p><p>We could develop and build on that quite effectively through investment from streaming sites, not to mention the exposure to our diaspora but to our young people in Ireland for whom these platforms are their main way of accessing shows and films.  We are proposing a modest 5% by 2030, which will give ample time to achieve that percentage either through production investment or purchasing works in Irish, all of which benefit the sector and the workers here.  That would be increased to 10% by 2035.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 308 deals with ensuring Irish language works are prominent in these online catalogues, highlighted on someone's home page and through the algorithms the online streaming services utilise.  This is about normalising Irish and encouraging and celebrating the language.  It is about empowering people through those new and emerging technologies.  We have all changed how we consume our television watching and can engage with the language at our own pace.

The European Commission has published guidelines for member states regarding the method of calculating the share of European works in the catalogue of a video-on-demand service.  Under section 159B(3) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, it will be for an coimisi&uacute;n to make rules to determine whether video-on-demand services meet the European works quota.  I expect it will be heavily informed by the guidance of the European Commission in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that some member states have provided for a minimum quota for native language works in catalogues of video-on-demand services.  For example, I understand that the legal instrument providing for the European works requirement in France, published last summer, included a requirement that 40% of works should be in the French language, subject to agreement between individual services and the French audiovisual regulator.<\/p> <p>  In the Irish context such a requirement is complicated by two factors.  First, there is a relatively small catalogue of audiovisual works in the Irish language as a percentage of all audiovisual works in other languages.  We are attempting to address this through increased funding for TG4 and initiatives such as Cine4, which, of course, funded the beautiful \"An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in\", but there is still much work to be done.  I understand that the amendment sets out to partially address this by pushing out the imposition of a quota to 2031 and 2036, respectively.  However, there remains the risk that a perverse effect of the amendment would be to force video-on-demand services to provide a relatively smaller catalogue to meet the 5% and 10% quotas.  This would not be to the benefit of audiences.<\/p> <p>  The second factor is the number of video-on-demand services that will be regulated in Ireland.  Under the country-of-origin principle, those services established in Ireland would be regulated in Ireland for the entire EU.  As drafted, the amendment would require those services to adopt the Irish language requirements for their catalogues.

Those categories should be specifically referred to because they are specifically referred to in the provisions for the BAI sound and vision fund and the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The reason for the inclusion of the words &quot;supporting the work of Irish creative talent&quot; is that that is one of the four public service aims of the media as defined in the terms of reference of the Future of Media Commission and accepted by the commission in its report.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 314 relates to the funding of independent production companies and the amount that will be forthcoming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#R00200","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their amendments, which seek to amend the provisions of the Bill relating to the content production levy and schemes.  As the committee will be aware, Article 13.2 of the AVMSD provides an explicit legal basis for member states to levy media service providers that are under their jurisdiction or that are not under their jurisdiction but are targeting audiences in their territories for the purpose of funding European works.  I have opted to take the opportunity offered by Article 13.2 of the directive to provide for the imposition of a content production levy on media service providers to fund content production schemes to support the production of European works.<\/p> <p>  There was a lengthy debate on Committee Stage in the Seanad on both the content production levy and the scheme provisions of the Bill.  I committed then to return to consider a number of matters on the D&aacute;il debate on the Bill.  In particular, I committed to examine whether express provision could be made to ensure that development activities could be funded through a scheme; to examine whether a certain minimum proportion of funds paid out under a scheme could be ring-fenced for \"independent production companies\"; and to examine whether provision could be made in respect of the allocation of rights ownership between independent production companies and media service providers.  The Deputies have raised those three issues in their amendments and I intend to address them on Report Stage.  In addition, as I indicated during the debate in the Seanad, I expect that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n and Screen Ireland will work closely together with a view to maximising the potential of content production schemes.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the detail of the Deputies' amendments, amendment No. 309 seeks to require coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to impose a content production levy as soon as is practicable after establishment day.  As I have said previously, it would not be prudent or advisable to impose a levy until a comprehensive study has been undertaken into the incidence, design and prospective revenue of any content production levy.  That will allow coimisi&uacute;n na mean to identify any unintended consequences that may arise from the levy and to outline clearly whether and how the incidence of the levy will ultimately fall on audiences and consumers of audiovisual media services.  Given the many additional questions about the content production levy that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will need to answer, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  I understand that amendment No. 310 seeks to address a drafting error in the Bill, as published.  It is an intention of the Bill that a content production scheme should be open to all prospective producers of European works.  This error came to the attention of my officials shortly after the Bill was published and it was intended to address the issue when other Government amendments to the content production scheme were brought forward.  Accordingly, while I do not intend to accept the Deputies' amendment today, I will table a Report Stage amendment to correct the error.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the intention of amendment No. 311 is to ensure that funds provided under a content production scheme may be used to support \"development\" activities relating to a production.  At present, section 159F(2)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, specifies a number of development activities that can be supported under a scheme.  My preferred approach would be to amend that paragraph to provide absolute clarity that all stages of the development of an audiovisual programme may be funded under a scheme.  I cannot, then, accept this amendment but will seek to clarify further on Report Stage that a content production scheme may include funding for development activities.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 312 sets out additional detail in respect of the nature of programmes that could be funded under a scheme.  It is unnecessary to specify that a content production scheme may fund feature films, animation, drama and documentaries.  Section 159F(2) provides that a scheme may fund the production of audiovisual programmes, which captures all types of audiovisual content, including drama, films, animation and factual programmes.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 312 also provides that a content production scheme would specifically support works that relate to the works of Irish creative talent.  As I noted during Report Stage in the Seanad, the outstanding and defining quality of such works would appear to be that they are produced by, or involve the work of, Irish citizens.  This carries the implication that those of Irish nationality would be given preference in any funding provided through a content production scheme.  This would appear to be contrary to EU law as it would, on the face of it, place Irish citizens at an advantage over citizens or residents of other member states as regards a content production scheme and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 313 seeks to amend a description of the kinds of audiovisual programmes that may be funded under a scheme by qualifying a reference to the experiences of the people of the island of Ireland such that it refers to \"storytelling\" experiences.  The relevant paragraph of the Bill is intended to encompass experiences in the most expansive sense to facilitate the funding of the widest array of content.  The effect of the proposed amendment would be to restrict the types of content that could be funded and, therefore, I do not intend to accept it.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 314 seeks to require that 80% of the funding under a content production scheme would be ring-fenced for \"independent production companies\" and to provide for the prescription of a fair and equitable balance in rights ownership.  Although I do not intend to accept the amendment, I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage to provide for the ring-fencing of a certain proportion of funding for independent production companies.  I am also examining the question of providing that coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n could make a certain allocation of rights ownership a requirement for receipt of funding under the scheme.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Deputies for their engagement and their amendments.  Our positions on a number of the matters discussed are quite close.  I look forward to tabling amendments to address those issues on Report Stage and to the debate that will ensue then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#R00300","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Munster wish to press or to withdraw the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#R00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I will withdraw it, reserving the right to resubmit it on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#R00500","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":638,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":639,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 310 to 314, inclusive, not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 315:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 135, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:  \t<b>&ldquo;Obligation for Investment<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>159HA.<\/b>(1) The Commission, following consultation with audiovisual media service providers, audiovisual and screen production companies established in Ireland, workers and businesses engaged in audiovisual production, Screen Ireland, RT&Eacute;, Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge, Foras na Gaeilge, and the public, and no later than one year following its establishment, shall prepare and publish a report examining the possibilities and suggesting recommendations for introducing direct obligations on audiovisual media service providers operating in this State, in line with the Audiovisual Media Services Directive and following the example set by policies in other Member States of the European Union, with regard to the potential impacts of such obligations on audiovisual production, consumers, workers, businesses, media service providers, and the promotion of the Irish language and Irish cultural works.<br \/><br \/>(2) The report outlined in subsection (1) shall consider in particular the potential for&mdash; <blockquote> \t(a) requiring investment directly in the production or co-production of European works partly or wholly on the island of Ireland, works of Irish cultural expression, and works in the Irish language,<br \/><br \/>(b) requiring direct investment in the acquisition of rights for European works, particularly works of Irish cultural expression and works in the Irish language,<br \/><br \/>(c) regulating the release window for audiovisual works in the State to require a higher direct investment in audiovisual production as a condition for a shorter delay between theatrical release and the right to transmit on audiovisual platforms,<br \/><br \/>(d) any combination of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c). <\/blockquote>(3) The report shall be laid before the Minister, Screen Ireland, both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Joint Oireachtas Committee upon publication for consideration.<br \/><br \/>(4) The Minister, following consultation with the Minister of Finance and no later than six months following the publication of the report outlined in subsection (1) shall present draft legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas outlining proposals for the introduction of investment obligations for audiovisual media service providers.&rdquo;.    <\/blockquote> <p>Similar to amendment No. 307, this is something that is already done in other EU member states under EU law, specifically under the audiovisual and media services directive.  The idea is that providers of these services, such as streaming platforms llike Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, will be required to ensure part of their revenue is invested directly into European works, Irish cultural works and works in the Irish language.  France recently reached an agreement with providers in this regard, namely, the DDADUE, which will see tens of millions of euro of new investment result in cultural output in French and job creation opportunities in the process.  Such rules implemented in this State would provide &euro;10 million of investment from one streaming site alone.<\/p><p>We are not setting out with restrictive vision as to how such a model could be implemented in Ireland as we do not believe that we are the experts.  We are instead asking that the commission meet with the stakeholders and produce a report within a year outlining options that the Department produces legislation within another six months of that with a view to implementing investor obligations.  As we have spoken of at length this afternoon, we often hear of things we cannot do due to EU law.  However, this is an example of what we can do under EU law.  It is something that could deliver quite incredible results if we were to do so.  There should not be any delay in seeking benefits for the industry, performers and audience that are enjoyed by other countries.  At the very least, we should be asking for that report to be made available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#S00100","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":641,"content":"<p>The purpose of this amendment is to require coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to carry out research on the introduction of investment obligations on media service providers operating in the State.  The amendment also provides that the Minister shall present draft legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas outlining proposals for the introduction of investment obligations for audiovisual media service providers not later than six months following publication of the report.<\/p> <p>  Before addressing the substance of the proposed amendment, I wish to note that it was determined that a content production levy was the most appropriate approach in the Irish context.  As with the existing sound and vision scheme administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the model envisaged in the Bill would allow producers to compete for funding on a transparent and competitive basis in line with objective criteria.  This would not be the case with investment obligations, where decisions on the nature of content to be funded would sit with the company subject to the investment obligation.  Furthermore, it is not possible under EU law to introduce an investment obligation based on a specific production location within Europe.  Our approach in respect of the content production levy already ensures a minimum of 25% of funds raised must be allocated to the production of Irish language content.  It is also worth noting that any investment obligation would have to be for the production of European works and not necessarily Irish content.  Many major EU-based providers targeting Ireland would likely already fulfil that requirement through their existing investments, so there may not be a substantial net benefit to Ireland from such a measure.<\/p> <p>  I do not propose to accept this amendment as I am of the view that section 7 of the Broadcasting Act as inserted by section 7 of this Bill will contain appropriate provisions to enable an coimisi&uacute;n to carry out research in relation to this matter.  I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to section 7(5)(d), which enables the commission to conduct strategic reviews on a number of matters including the funding of sector.  I also note that the Minister will have the power under this provision to direct an coimisi&uacute;n to carry out research on any matter connected to its functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2022102600002#S00200","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I have one supplementary question on that issue.

The committee needs to be furnished with an explanatory memorandum to consider that.  From where is the impetus for that change coming?  How is it being considered?

I also thank members for their general support for the Bill during pre-legislative scrutiny and on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  As members are aware, this is a long and technical Bill.  As well as transposing the enforcement and security provisions of the European electronic communications code, the Bill provides the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, with a new civil enforcement regime and an updated criminal enforcement procedure for the electronic communications sector.  The Bill give the enforcement of the electronic communication security measures a legislative basis.  It also provides for additional consumer protections and makes a number of amendments to the Communications Regulation Act 2002.  The Bill represents the biggest update to the regulation of the electronic communications sector since ComReg's establishment in 2002.  It will provide ComReg with the tools it needs to effectively regulate the sector today, and it will bring its powers further in line with comparable regulators in the State and elsewhere in Europe.  In doing so, it will fulfil a programme for Government commitment.<\/p> <p>  I indicated on Second Stage that I would bring forward an amendment in relation to the Digital Hub Development Agency Act 2003 that would confer a function on the board to dispose of its land and property assets on foot of a directive by the Minister pursuant to the 2003 Act.  I am also bringing forward a number of amendments that are focused on the security of electronic communications networks, specifically dealing with the issue of high-risk vendors, HRVs.  These amendments will set out how a risk assessment will be conducted in alignment with the principles of the EU 5G security toolbox.  Recognising the functions exercised by certain Departments and agencies in respect of national security, the risk assessment will be conducted in consultation with relevant stakeholders across government.  The amendment will also set out how HRVs will be designated, and will provide for ministerial notices to restrict or ban designated vendors on networks as a whole or on specific parts of networks.  ComReg should be tasked with the supervision and enforcement of orders relating to HRVs.  Similar legislation has been implemented in 19 EU member states, with a further five indicating that they are at an advanced stage of preparation.  Likewise, the UK enacted similar provisions recently.<\/p> <p>  I also mentioned on Second Stage the possibility that the Government will bring forward a short amendment to the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 in order to provide for payments to be made to or via An Post, particularly in the context of the provision of support to postmasters.  This amendment is the subject of ongoing engagement with the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p> <p>  Two other short amendments will be brought forward in relation to the alternative dispute resolution, ADR, process outlined in the Bill.  The first is a minor amendment that will broaden the scope of disputes that can be subject to ADR to align with current practice and to better reflect the text of the code.  The second will adjust the scope of the code of practice for complaints to align it with the scope for ADR.  <\/p> <p>  Aside from some further examination and possible modification of the definitions and structure of the Bill as a result of these amendments, some consideration has also been given to whether further amendments are required to the appeals provisions found in Parts 2 and 3.  Legal advice is being sought on this matter.  As these amendments require further development, I put the committee on notice that I hope to bring them forward on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Government amendments put forward today, I will give more explanation for the reasons behind each of them when we reach them.  That concludes my opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022102600002#B01100","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":692,"content":"<p>We will now move to our consideration of the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022102600002#B01200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":693,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":694,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 cannot be moved as it requires a motion of instruction to committee.

The Minister can take information he or she is given into account and give that information to the court to justify a decision but that information is unavailable for the other side to test.

The Minister of State is saying that information given to the High Court will not be provided to the other party to the appeal.  If we are seeking to subvert the interference of nefarious states in communications in this State, the way to do it is not to adopt facets of their criminal justice systems.  I will use a word that is bandied about but it is positively Kafkaesque that a Minister will give information to a High Court judge to justify a decision but the other side will be unable to test that information, call it a complete load of codswallop and explain why that is the case.  The other side will never even see that information.  A High Court judge is supposed to act independently of a Minister.  We have separation of powers in this State, which has been pretty well respected since the its foundation.  A judge is supposed to look at the information but cannot hear the opinion of the other side.  In fact, a judge cannot even tell the other side that he or she has the information.  The other side cannot even test the Minister's opinion and assertion that the relevant information goes to matters of security.

The State will say it is uncomfortable with such a vendor's equipment being used in its critical infrastructure networks.  The information provided will not always be suitable for publication.

In terms of appalling vistas, a judge once dismissed the whole idea of an appalling vista.  He was a very good judge, one of the better ones on the Bench in England and Wales at the time.  Unfortunately, the appalling vista came to pass, so they do happen.  The idea is not to provide powers that enable them to happen.  I see one of the officials finds this entertaining, but I have concerns about the amount of power that this measure gives, not to the Irish security services but to foreign security services.  In Ireland, we have a national security service that barely operates.  We do not have a large international security apparatus.  Some states that do are present in Ireland.  When it suits us, we like to think we are the 51st state of one such state and when it does not suit us, we like to portray the polar opposite.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is very much not a stooge for the American, Chinese or Russian embassies, but there is a possibility that, down the line, there will be Ministers who may be stooges for other powers.  Business and money come into this in a very big way.  A very high-profile trade stand-off is taking place between China and the United States on the development of computer components.  Is it beyond the realms of possibility that national security apparatuses are used, abused and manipulated to further the financial interests of a state?  I believe it is not beyond the realms of possibility.  It is quite likely that that would happen, in particular in western economies when we find ourselves with no resources whatsoever or in a time of a shortage of resources.  The United States less so because the dollar is the fiat currency and the US is not in decline in the way that Europe is.  I am digressing, however.<\/p> <p>  I am saying that there is a strong possibility for abuse.  What the Minister of State is saying is that an order can be made by him or his successors.  The legal person could be Jimmy Browne or an international corporation but let us not pretend that a criminal sanction against a corporation is less of a criminal sanction than one against an individual, unless of course we think corporations are not entitled to fair procedures and natural justice.

Who would be in a position to give that information to the Minister of State other than An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I find it difficult to know what information An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or, indeed, any part of our national security apparatus would have on the state of play of semiconductor manufacture in China or how much it is or is not suffering as a result of American measures.  Surely, the only ones who could tell the Minister of State that would be the American security apparatus.  Perhaps the Chinese might want to volunteer that they are actually suffering from this, although I doubt it.  They might want to volunteer that information, however.<\/p> <p>  This whole idea that people will not have the definition and whether it endangers national security is not just about the information itself, but the source of that information.  My concern is for the information the Minister of State might receive, although maybe not him personally because he might have a very critical mind.  There is always the danger that successors will be less inquisitive and critical.  The Minister of State might get lots of information from the American, Chinese, Russian or Israeli Embassies, for example, which might suggest that a vendor's components are sloppy or that a vendor will not be in a position to provide enough of them.  The Minister of State might decide to label somebody a high-risk vendor on the basis of that information.  The vendor then appeals that and goes to the High Court, where the Minister of State says he cannot give the vendor the information he received.  That is not because of what that information is.<\/p><p>It is no particular threat to the security of this State what the state of play of the semi-conductor manufacturing sector in China is.  Rather, a Minister will say that he or she cannot share the information because he or she got it from the British Embassy, the US Embassy or wherever as part of an exchange of information in which confidentiality was assured.  The Minister could give the information to the judge but could not give it to the vendor.  The idea is that we will differentiate between what is and is not national security, yet all of the information the Government is going to rely on is going to come from external sources.  Let us be real, in that we do not have a sufficiently large international intelligence service.  Most of the espionage networks operating in this country are not here because they are worried about what the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, plans to do with the Army any time soon.  They are here to figure out what companies are doing.  A great deal of espionage is based around companies and competition, including competition between states.  There is a distinct possibility that someone in the Minister of State's shoes could in future fall prey to that and make decisions that could not be challenged in an open court.  It is unusual for High Court sittings to be held in private, although they are held in private in family law cases.  For all of the flaws in the process, a case to convict someone of terrorist offences, even terrorist offences in the Middle East, is open and transparent. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022102600002#G02600","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":895,"content":"<p>The Minister can use information from third-party sources.

These provisions will provide that extant decisions relating to ComReg's current alternative dispute resolution process continue as appropriate under the new regime and that disputes that are pending at the time of the new provisions coming into operation are preserved.  To do this, amendments Nos. 17 and 18 will insert a new definition of &quot;Universal Service Regulations&quot; into the interpretations section relating to Part 4 of the Bill.  Section 39, inserted by amendment No. 19, will ensure that a dispute that is before ComReg or an independent person nominated by ComReg under regulation No. 27 can continue as if those regulations had not been repealed.<\/p><p>While the Bill will make worthy amendments to the current regime, it is also important to provide explicit transitional provisions to address extant disputes that are currently with ComReg, or an independent person, for resolution under that regulation to ensure no consumer's dispute inadvertently fell in the transition between the old dispute resolution regime and the new alternative dispute resolution regime established by the Bill.<\/p><p> A new section 40 inserted by amendment No. 20 will ensure that a measure enforced pursuant to regulation No. 27 can continue in force under Part 4.  Under regulation No. 27, ComReg took a number of measures to better implement the regime, including specifying requirements concerning operators' codes of practice for complaint handling and specifying the procedures for dispute resolution, as any measure taken by ComReg requires consideration, consultation with stakeholders and finalisation.  If these measures were allowed to lapse, it would take considerable time for replacement measures to be put in place.  This would, in turn, delay the effectiveness of the regime for consumers.  At present, without this transitional provision, there could be a potential query over whether these measures remain extant under the new regime established by the Bill after the universal service regulation has been repealed by the 2022 regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2022102600002#H05300","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666738800,"counter":947,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1666738800,"counter":948,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 18:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 23, after line 35, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo; &ldquo;Universal Services Regulations&rdquo; means the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and Users&rsquo; Rights) Regulations 2011 (S.I.
