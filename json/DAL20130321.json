Many families are struggling on low incomes and cannot pay their mortgages, yet they are none the less expected to pay the property tax.  The Government has decided that families with a gross weekly income of anything above &euro;480 are not allowed to defer their liabilities.  Anyone who genuinely cannot afford to pay will be hit with a penalty interest of 8% per annum.<\/p><p>  This tax is deeply unfair and fails in any meaningful way to take an inability to pay into account.  Today, we learned that seven out of the eight people living in unfinished housing estates who were exempt from last year's household charge would be required to pay this property tax.  The number of people in unfinished developments who are exempted has dropped spectacularly from 43,000 to 5,000 simply because the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government instructed local authorities to visit every unfinished development and identify which houses should pay.<\/p><p>  What people want above all else is fairness and consistency.  A family that lives in an unfinished housing estate and is lucky enough to have a footpath outside the door and a working public light must pay the property tax, yet another family around the corner in the same estate will be exempted because its house looks out onto a heap of rubble that should have been a green area.  This is a ridiculous scenario.<\/p><p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is using the National Housing Development Survey 2012 report to justify the dramatic drop in the number of people who will be allowed to avail of an exemption.  According to it, there are approximately 1,100 unfinished developments that are in a &quot;seriously problematic condition&quot;.  The report outlines what must be wrong in an estate for it to fall into this category.  The estate would need to be in a bad condition to qualify.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100003#A00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1363861800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>The Deputy has gone over time.

Instead this Government has announced the cut-off of the schemes in three and a half months&rsquo; time and without providing any alternative nor a deadline for the introduction of an alternative. <\/p><p> We call again on the Government to reverse its decision to cease the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant schemes until such time as an alternative is put in place. That alternative needs to be compliant with equality legislation and to provide at least equivalent support to all individuals qualifying under the said two schemes.  From the Minister of State&rsquo;s response yesterday it is clear that at present it intends no such alternative and is speaking generally of the transport options for people with disabilities.  That would be a disaster for so many and make no mistake about it, the many more of us in the Chamber who may, God forbid, find ourselves in need of special mobility access and support in the future. <\/p><p> For large parts of this country those transport options for people with disabilities are negligible because in large parts of the country public transport is virtually non-existent as I highlighted yesterday.  That is why individualised assistance, such as the two axed schemes, were so important.   That point cannot be made strongly enough.  We deplore also the Government decision to cut the housing adaptation grant by 40%, greatly penalising people with disabilities and older people and restricting their ability to remain in their own homes. This is a huge cut which has received very little attention but it has very serious long-term consequences for many people and for the State as it will inevitably mean more people requiring residential care and greater expense for the State.  The Government should reinstate the housing adaptation grant to at least its 2012 level. <\/p><p> There are other cuts to services for people with disabilities, both directly to their services and in cuts across health, education, social protection and local government.  These include the respite care grant, home help and increased prescription charges for medical card holders, if one happens to be an over 70s person still in possession of a medial card despite the Bill that is making its way through the Houses. <\/p><p> We demand that the cuts to services for people with disabilities imposed in 2012 and 2013 be reversed. I call on the Government to immediately publish the long overdue implementation plan for the national disability strategy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100007#E03200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363864800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Recently we discussed the issue of a mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant at the joint committee, following which we had the abrupt announcement that it was to cease pending the outcome of the consultation process in the time ahead.  Since then the centres for independent living have contacted the members of the joint committee and have addressed it outlining their profound concerns.  Profoundly disabled people were present for the hearing.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure there are no more cuts for disabled people.  We cannot go back to the days of institutionalisation which cost the State more money.  I appeal to her to resolve that issue.<\/p><p>  I have two abiding memories of all the years I have canvassed as a candidate in elections.  The first was in a rural area of north Donegal and driving through windy roads and eventually arriving at a farm.  When we got to the farmyard the woman of the house, an incredibly positive person, was tending the sheep.  She went into the house but I was not aware of what was ahead.  Her husband had been paralysed in a car accident many years before and her father-in-law was elderly and almost immobile.  She was looking after her husband and father-in-law and the farm.  When leaving the house, after meeting this remarkably positive woman, I was informed that her sons are the pride of not just that family but the entire community.  This woman was a carer of two men who were incapacitated and looked after a farm.  <\/p><p>  I remember an incredible woman in her early 80s closer to my home place, Buncrana, in the Clonmany area.  Her foster son, a talented young boxer in his early 20s, had been paralysed.  The doctors told her there was no hope of a recovery and that he would be in a vegetative state.  Given her love and affection, she took him home, looked after him and nurtured him.  He was able to communicate by typing words.  Every one of us, irrespective of which side of the House we are on, is a decent human being and we want to do the best for our communities.  The memory of those two women will always be with me.  I know there are many similar stories.  <\/p><p>  We cannot fail carers of disabled people, we cannot let them down.  Whatever has to be done we cannot fail such people.  In all sincerity we need to have a threshold of decency in terms of what point we get to and we need to ensure that people who are profoundly disabled and their carers, people who need our support as a Republic, are given their independence and dignity in order that they can be productive citizens.  Does it really matter if one is economically productive? If one can be there for one's family that means a great deal.<\/p><p>  We have had too many cuts.  The Government needs to do much more.  The previous Government put in place cuts of 10% in the income of people with disabilities, including a cut to the blind person's allowance, cuts to grants for housing extension, cuts in health, education and so on.  Those cuts will have to be reversed.  I repeat again there will have to be a threshold of decency.  Whatever our political perspectives in this House, we are decent people.  We would not have been elected if we were not decent people.  We have the support of our communities to come to this House.  We need to ensure we do not fail disabled persons any more.  We must ensure that those people in wheelchairs who had been empowered and are terrified at the idea of going backwards, are not impacted further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100008#F00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1363864800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Michelle Mulherin is sharing time with Deputies Michael McCarthy, Joe McHugh, Eamonn Maloney, Robert Dowds and Liam Twomey.

Our ability to decide for ourselves is cultivated early in our lives, before even the age of majority is reached, according to our laws.  This ability can be impaired by any number of disabling agents as well as how we are born; these might include illness or accidents.  Therefore the need for assistance in safeguarding our autonomy is far reaching.  This is an important job for the State to support as much as possible each citizen in self-determining his or life and realising the unique talents and potential which lie in each and every one of us, with due regard to the common good.<\/p><p>However, we are not all the same, which is why we make special provision in our social welfare, education and health systems, and through our public physical infrastructure for people with disabilities who find that mainstream services do not accommodate them.  This is how, as a Republic, we demonstrate value for all our citizens and, as a society, espouse more than merely survival of the fittest for our people.<\/p><p> In these challenging economic times people who are rendered vulnerable because of a disability and their families can be fearful of the ramifications for them of cuts to budgets.  Without doubt, it is a very delicate matter for Government to maintain supports in the face of the financial pressures we face and the stark choices to be made.  It could be said that the wisdom of Solomon is required to make decisions on so many competing public interests that face the Government.  However, I know that the need to protect vulnerable people is at the heart of decisions on budgets and policy.  In the case of the Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is present, decisions that have to be made on people with disabilities cut very deep and are very difficult for them, but they work to overcome the obstacles while still protecting the vulnerable.<\/p><p> The fears I mentioned were very much in evidence during the recent abolition of the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grant, which came about as a result of the illegality identified in their operation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and departmental officials are working hard with disability representative groups to find a solution.  It is highly irresponsible for some Opposition politicians to imply that people with disabilities are being attacked and this is some grand Government master plan.  The Government has ring-fenced &euro;10.6 million for these schemes until a solution is found.  This is evidence of the Government's bona fides in this matter - the money, in effect speaks in this case.  The Government will not renege on the need to support financially the transport of individuals who cannot walk.  People who are fearful in this regard can rely on this as a fact.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will reassure the House later.<\/p><p> I condemn the scurrilous way some Opposition politicians have raised fears among the vulnerable for their own political advantage.  It would pay them better to offer practical solutions as to how the legal difficulties regarding these schemes could be overcome in order to address the issue.  Fianna F&aacute;il Members presided over this problem for years even when there was money in the public purse available to spend.<\/p><p> As a backbench Government Deputy, I know we have our own mechanisms for discussion through our parliamentary party and feeding right up to our Ministers.  With the myriad of problems presenting and the demands on the public purse, at the heart of Government decision-making is consideration for the most vulnerable who are those with disabilities and the elderly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100008#F00400","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363865400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Mulherin's comments on the expressions of feigned interest in what is happening people's livelihoods from the architects of the ruination of the Irish economy.  They come in here day after day giving out about measures that have to be implemented partly because they authored them and partly because of the mess they created.  The Government now has to go down a road of difficult decisions to get the economy working again.  In addition to being populist, they are almost as fictitious as that scene in \"Dallas\" when Bobby Ewing was inside in the shower and the previous 12 months are just forgotten about.  That almost ruined \"Dallas\", but that is exactly what the Fianna F&aacute;il spokespersons are doing at the moment.  All of a sudden the last couple of years have been a dream and they are now back to fight the good fight for those on whom they inflicted economic misery and hardship.  It is the Bobby Ewing moment and they barely let an opportunity go by without trying to inflict that type of mirage on the rest of us.<\/p><p>  I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who for years has been involved with disability groups, has been an advocate for people with disabilities and has engaged with people in organisations that support people with disabilities when it was neither politically profitable nor popular.  As a Senator I recall her, as an Opposition Deputy, in meetings with groups working out strategies to formulate policies that she could bring to the heart of Government if she were ever appointed.  Thank God that appointment was made.  I record my appreciation of the unstinting commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to the disability sector for years.<\/p><p>  The programme for Government includes a commitment to publish a realistic implementation plan for the national disability strategy.  In line with that commitment the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is personally chairing a new national disability strategy implementation group.  She has also convened a disability forum to ensure the voices of people with disabilities are being heard.  The first meeting of the forum, which was attended by over 300 people with disabilities, their carers and their family members, was held on 19 June 2012 and a report of the views expressed will be published shortly.  That report will form part of the considerations of the implementation group.  That is not just a report from the coalface, but a report with an implementation follow up and an action plan.<\/p><p>  The HSE has embarked on a national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people to address variations in service availability and to ensure that services for children with disabilities are provided in a more equitable and consistent way.  A few months ago, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs introduced the wording for the children's rights referendum and the Government along with other parties in this House campaigned to put children's rights into the Constitution.  The welfare of children, including children with disabilities, is at the heart of Government policy in terms of planning a strategy to protect young people with disabilities.  It is underpinned by a commitment to the welfare of children that will now be enshrined in our Constitution, which is a very welcome development.<\/p><p>  As part of political reform, we now have one day each month allocated to introducing backbencher legislation.  This month I was delighted to have been selected to introduce the autism Bill which was met with universal approval from all spokespersons in the House, not least the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, who gave a commitment to implement it.  The Bill passed Second Stage in the House and was universally supported.  I acknowledge the support from all parties and none - we also had support from Technical Group Members.  That is very important in devising a national strategy for adults with autism.  It was an historic day in the House to see universal support for a Bill introduced by a Government backbencher.  It augurs well and was a very good advertisement for parliamentary democracy when it functions as it should do.<\/p><p>  Some people scoff because they do not want to acknowledge this.  Given that the country was landed into the middle of an economic mess by the incompetent mismanagement by the gentlemen who sit to our left, maintaining basic social welfare rates in the budget was a significant achievement.  One of the payments that was maintained was the disability allowance.  The Government also maintained the household benefits package and the carer's allowance.  Maintaining that was a difficult day's work, but has been achieved.  It is an indication of the Government's commitment to people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100009#G00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1363865400,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  I acknowledge the role of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, since taking her position of responsibility.  I equally acknowledge the enormity of the challenge she faces.<\/p><p>In the brief time available to me, I am not in a position to go into those wide-ranging challenges.  The real difficulty lies in addressing the separatist approach of the past to disability.  During the debate on the recent change, as enunciated by the Attorney General, in relation to the motorised transport grant the focus was on it being a health issue.  As I understand it, it was a transport issue.  There are issues around progression for people with disabilities which relate to education.  We need an all encompassing approach to disability.  People with disabilities do not want to be treated differently rather they want to be treated equally.  The phrase \"all different, all equal\" comes to mind.  This is where the real challenge lies.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is trying to address this and is doing so well.  It is a major task in these challenging economic times.  The current model is an elongated cumbersome one which requires a lot of money.  We must be creative in terms of how we integrate the services we provide, including by challenging cultural activity within training centres such as F&Aacute;S.  It is not enough to just provide a ramp or toilet that is wheelchair accessible, we must break down the cultural barriers.  It is not enough to point disabled people to the Internet where they can check out courses by places such as F&Aacute;S and so on.  We must do much more in terms of breaking down the cultural barriers in regard to how we treat people with disabilities, pigeonhole them and how we at times, in trying to give them a leg up, patronise them.<\/p><p> I have previously spoken of my relationship with a person with disabilities living in my county whose tenacity and courage in terms of the journey he is on, I admire.  He has moved from being in institutional care in Dublin to a Cheshire apartment in Mayo, a Cheshire apartment in Letterkenny and finally his own independent unit.  That journey is expensive.  He now also has a job in the postal services of LYT Letterkenny.  He has gone on a massive journey.  People with disabilities have the insight and can bring us along on the next part of the journey.  We must replace the separatist approach of the past, a model that has been cumbersome, financially dependent and not economically sustainable and to involve disabled people in this process.<\/p><p> I understand a think tank has been established following the motorised grant situation to examine how the &euro;10.2 million allocation - which is welcome - for the disabilities sector can be ringfenced and the evolvement of a new motorised grant in the next phase.  We need to involve people with disabilities in this process.  We should not take for granted that the umbrella organisations will do this.  As legislators, we should ensure engagement between the Disability Federation of Ireland and communities.  These are the people with the ideas.  People with disabilities often not only live the nightmare of having a disability but also the reality of having a disability.  Their wisdom, insight and experience is paramount in terms of how this conversation moves forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100009#G00300","speaker":"997","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363866000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I listened last night to the introductory contribution on this motion by the Technical Group.  I share the view expressed across the House last night and this morning that we should all aspire to protect the rights of the disabled and to improve the benefits of which they rightly avail.

While I agree in principle with the motion, I believe some of the contributions made last night, which were outside the substance of the motion, were rhetoric that could have been left out of the debate.  If we are serious about addressing this issue we should approach it in that way irrespective of on which side of the House we sit.<\/p><p>  Ireland is virtually bankrupt and is operating on a day-to-day basis with the generosity of its European neighbours who give us &euro;41 million per day to pay salaries, including mine, and the benefits for people with disabilities and social welfare recipients in general.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, on securing &euro;1.5 billion for the disabilities sector this year.  I admire her commitment in securing this funding.  I am sure that like me, she and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, share the view that in better days we will be able to not only restore many of the benefits for the disabled but improve them.  <\/p><p>  I would like to comment on some of the contributions made last night.  I have noted that many of the motions which have come before this House included the signatures of people who propped up the previous Government which ran this country into the ground and caused the financial difficulties now being experienced.  It is dishonest to say to any sector that a budget could be introduced without affecting all sectors of society.  This is what has happened.  It is dishonest to pretend that one sector can be ringfenced in circumstances where this country is bankrupt.  To pretend otherwise is dishonest.<\/p><p>  Like others, I look forward to the recovery of this country and to the restoration of benefits and enhancement of the rights of disabled people when we are in a better position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100010#H00200","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"speech","time":1363866000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Maloney I too look forward to a time when rates, in terms of payments, can be restored to people with disabilities and people generally, including those unemployed and so on.<\/p><p>  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, with whom I have attended meetings with disability groups, on her commitment to tackling disability, which commitment is recognised by all the groups involved.  There is no split between them in their conversations in relation to the Minister of State.  We are fortunate to have a Minister of State who commands the respect of those with whom she engages.<\/p><p>  Having worked in a school for people with physical disabilities, I come to this debate with a great deal of experience of dealing with disability.  I have witnessed the difficulties under which parents of children with disabilities and the children operate.<\/p><p>There is no doubt many disabled people and their parents operate in an heroic way in overcoming their difficulties.  As a society we could do more to help people in this situation and I praise our local authority in south Dublin which makes a particular effort to include many people with a diverse range of disabilities in its staff.  This is not sufficiently taken up by business throughout the country.<\/p><p> Part of the reason we are discussing this is because two elements of the disability allowance, namely, the means-tested mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant, have been declared illegal.  It may be controversial to say so, but where money is short it is better that younger people rather than older people are prioritised.  I am moving into the older category myself, but younger people have more of their lives in front of them.  I hope we will be able to come up with a legally accepted system.  As a general principle, younger people should take priority over older people.<\/p><p> It is well worth noting that the Government provides a wide range of services to people with disabilities, including residential services to 9,000 people, day services to 22,000 people, respite residential support for 7,500 people and 1.68 million personal assistance and home support hours.  The cuts to disability funding which have been made during the recession are very difficult and should always be a cause of concern for us.<\/p><p> We know the cuts to the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant were made because they were seen to be illegal under the Equal Status Act.  These payments will continue to be made to those already in receipt of them until the end of June as the Government devises an alternative legal method to meet people's needs.  I hope we succeed in coming up with something satisfactory.  I welcome the fact the Government has already established a review group to examine the entire area and come up with recommendations by the end of May.  It is also important to stress the Government has committed that the &euro;10.6 million spend on the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant will be spent on the solution identified by the review group.<\/p><p> The Government has also taken other positive steps in the drive to provide a better quality of life for people with mental and physical disabilities.  I commend in particular the commitment to publish in the coming weeks the assisted decision-making (capacity) Bill.  This legislation is long overdue and will help to remedy a set of laws on mental illness and impairment which belong to the Victorian era.  It will safeguard the rights of those who are unable to make decisions for themselves and provide a framework for assisted decisions.  This is very welcome and long overdue.  I also welcome the moves under way to begin HIQA inspections of residential homes for people with disabilities.  It has troubled me these were not included in the initial list of places which HIQA had a mandate to inspect given the vulnerability of this group of people.  I have no doubt HIQA will do a very thorough job in inspecting these residential homes.<\/p><p> Last night I heard Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v speak on this subject.  I have no doubt he, like the rest of us, has real concern and empathy for people with disabilities, but it is very difficult to listen to comments from Fianna F&aacute;il given the huge problem they put on the shoulders of the Irish people, most particularly by accepting the huge debt from Anglo Irish Bank and the like.  This is what really makes it so difficult for us to deal with the issues we are faced with today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100010#H00300","speaker":"1011","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363866600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>From meeting people with disabilities on an individual and organisational level I know that in recent years they have felt let down and, to some degree, isolated.  This is very much because they have seen a reduction in services.  They are very aware of the resource issue, and they are more aware of it and the concerns it raises than some of those who comment on the issue in the House.  Many of the problems we experience are communications problems, with regard to explaining to people with disabilities and their organisations what is going on.<\/p><p>  Much of what has happened for people with disabilities in the past decade has very much been driven by disability organisations themselves.  We have a very good Minister of State in Deputy Kathleen Lynch, because she has great empathy with what is going on for people with disabilities.  She is honest about what can be achieved and about what we must try to do.  For this honesty to come through we must ensure that resources intended for the disability sector arrive there.  In recent years many service plans drawn up by Departments are not necessarily implemented in the way we voted for them.  This issue has been raised time and again.  It is particularly prevalent with regard to the HSE, where funding is given for a specific service but it is not used for that service.  We often find out mid-year or towards the end of the year that money has been diverted somewhere else.  This must stop.  If money is allocated at budget time for a specific service it must stay with this service.  Ministers and Ministers of State must ensure funding stays with the service for which it is intended.  Funding for disability services is significant at &euro;1.5 billion, but with such a huge amount of State funding and a number of voluntary and State organisations involved, one can see how funding can be diverted.  We must focus on ensuring what we say we will do in service plans is what we do, so we remain honest with people with disabilities and we keep their confidence and trust that we mean what we say when we try to provide services for them.<\/p><p>  Nobody can deny that huge changes have been made over the past two decades in how people with disabilities can access services, education and work.  I have seen it in my work as a doctor.  We still have plenty of scope, even with limited resources available at present, to do a hell of a lot more.  The Government is very much focused on rights-based services.  We are not only trying to build this for the duration of the Government, but we are trying to hardwire it into the thinking of everyone involved in implementing legislation and policy.  This needs to remain our focus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100011#J00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1363866600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Joan Collins who is sharing with Deputies Tom Fleming, Stephen Donnelly, Thomas Pringle and Seamus Healy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100011#J00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1363866600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>During the debate I have heard comments that this side of the House is not practical with regard to ringfencing or protecting certain areas.  It is the responsibility of the Government, particularly during times such as those we are in at present, that certain areas are ringfenced such as DEIS schools, education and disability services.  These are services for the most vulnerable in the community who need support.  The mobility allowance has been targeted as part of the continued diversion of State money into the bank bailout.  This is what lies behind the Government's decision to cut the mobility allowance to approximately 4,700 people and the cut to the motorised transport grant for approximately 300 people at an annual cost of &euro;10.6 million rather than extending these benefits to those aged over 65.<\/p><p>When the Ombudsman referred to the Equal Status Act, I do not think she meant its remit should be cut or finished.  She wanted to see it extended to the over-65s and said that any reference to 65 years should be taken out of the legislation in order to allow it to be extended.<\/p><p> On 27 February, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said that extending the scheme to the over 65s would cost between &euro;170 million and &euro;300 million, but those figures sound as if they have been made up.  How could a scheme costing &euro;10.6 million per year for approximately 3.1 million people aged between 14 and 65 cost &euro;170 million for those over 65, which is a cohort of approximately 550,000?  It does not make sense.  How could a mobility allowance and a motorised transport grant for the older group, which is about one sixth the size of the 14 to 65 age group, cost 16 times more for those over 65?  That does not make sense either.<\/p><p> On what basis is that figure calculated?  Is it an annual cost for those over 65?  Does it include everybody with any kind of disability or those with mobility difficulties?  If we extrapolate it from the number of people under 66 currently in receipt of a mobility allowance and motorised transport grant, approximately 900 people over 66 would be entitled to these benefits on that basis, thus costing around &euro;1.9 million annually. <\/p><p> If we say that the rate of older people needing help with travel costs is twice the rate for the younger age group, the annual cost would be approximately &euro;4 million.  If the rate for the older group was five times that of the younger group, the cost would still be less than &euro;10 million a year.  How therefore can the Minister of State and the Government say that the cost of extending the existing benefits to people over 65 will be an extra &euro;170 million to &euro;300 million?  It does not make sense. <\/p><p> The reality is that the Government's prime concern is the cost of these benefits.  This is explicit in a statement from Dr. McLoughlin and the Minister of State which said that the commitments to provide services are now secondary to the bank bailout.  The commitments in the programme for Government are meaningless.  Fine Gael and Labour declared that they would put in place a plan for implementing a national disability strategy but after two years in Government there is no sign of any plan other than cuts.<\/p><p> Three weeks after the abolition of the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant, the Disability Federation of Ireland's representatives say there has been no contact with them on this issue.  There are no indications of alternative benefits from the Government or how they intend to provide benefits to those over 65 who need them.<\/p><p> The Government's strategy is supposed to include people with disabilities in mainstream social life, including employment.  People with disabilities have extra costs associated with travel and the mobility allowance recognised that.  These benefits helped people with disabilities to avail of transport networks and thus have access to the wider community.  It is no good having disabled-access train carriages if people cannot get to and from the station.  Cutting the mobility allowance or restricting access to these benefits will reduce the incomes of people who are already being squeezed.  People on about &euro;10,000 per year will have the extra &euro;2,500 to help pay for travel costs taken away if these benefits are not restored.<\/p><p> Yet there was no problem in ensuring that AIB and the Bank of Ireland got almost &euro;25 billion stop them from going bankrupt.  They are now hounding people for unaffordable mortgages, while the chief executive of the Bank of Ireland, Mr. Richie Boucher, gets over &euro;830,000 per year.  The likes of Bertie Ahern gets a pension of over &euro;150,000 along with the other 30 ex-ministers who will receive pensions of well over &euro;100,000 each this year.  There is never a problem in ensuring that the highly paid and wealthy are paid out of the State coffers, but when it comes to those in need there is a question.<\/p><p> I wish to make a particular point about the sensitive personal medical approach that is supposed to be pursued in future.  I have already raised the case of a person with disabilities who is in a Storm-chair, but the HSE bureaucracy is unbelievable.  He got his chair and all the adjustments but he cannot get the HSE to provide lights for it.  He works, travels and goes out at night, moving around quite well in the community but due to the lack of required criteria, the HSE will not put lights on his chair.  He cannot put the lights on himself because he is not allowed to tamper with a HSE chair.  That is the madness we are in at the moment.  It is crazy but there are alternatives.<\/p><p> Two weeks ago, the top 300 wealthiest people in this country improved their wealth, on the back of austerity, by &euro;3.6 billion.  They are now worth &euro;66.6 billion while ordinary people are being threatened with cuts like this.  If we put a 10% tax on the top 300 people's wealth we would get &euro;6.6 billion into the State coffers to be able to protect people with disabilities.  Those are the alternatives we should be looking at because &euro;6.6 billion is just couch money for these people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100011#J00400","speaker":"1032","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363867200,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I will start on a positive note.  In recent years, a new direction has been brought about by a number of policy developments concerning disability.  The most notable of these is the national disability strategy which reflects the social partnership agreement Towards 2016 and various programmes for Government, including the current one of 2011.  These developments will impact on the work of voluntary disability organisations and on people with disabilities.  We need to grasp the opportunities that are available so that people with disabilities can benefit to the maximum extent from commitments made through the national disability strategy, which will run until 2016.<\/p><p><br \/>  Unfortunately, however, we must now do so in a very different economic context - one in which the level of funding for priority services for people with disabilities continues to be reduced.  There is an escalation of the concept of providing disability services to a greater extent in the mainstream context.  In addition, there is a huge dependency on the voluntary sector.  The aspirations in Towards 2016 include long-term goals under the national disability strategy.  According to the strategy's mission statement<blockquote>  Every person with a disability will have access to an income which is sufficient to sustain an acceptable standard of living.  Every person with a disability would, in conformity with their needs and abilities, have access to appropriate care, health, education, employment, training and social services.  Every person with a disability would have access to public spaces, buildings, transport, information, advocacy, other public services and appropriate housing.  Every person with a disability would be supported to enable them, as far as possible, to lead a full and independent life, to participate in work and in society, and to maximise their potential.<\/blockquote>  The mission statement also says that &quot;carers would be acknowledged and supported in their caring role&quot;.  If we are to achieve these desirable ambitions the Government will have to redouble its efforts and commitments with appropriate funding also being put in place to achieve these fundamental aspirations.  For instance, many public buildings are not disability-friendly and we have drastically neglected our duties in not complying with the Barcelona agreement in this regard. <\/p><p><br \/>  Due to a major cut of 56% to Kerry County Council's housing grants recently - which is the highest reduction for any council in the country - terminally ill patients, the elderly and the disabled who are in need of basic facilities such as downstairs bathrooms, walk-in showers, stair-lifts and ramps, are deprived of support for any such basic entitlements.  Grant applications have been halted and the council is unable to cater for long-standing applicants who have been approved but, unfortunately, cannot proceed.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I plead with the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and also with her senior Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to ensure that this matter will be addressed, perhaps with contingency money that I understand may be available.  I ask the Minister of State to put these matters at the top of her list to be addressed as soon as possible.<\/p><p><br \/>  I urge the Government to revisit the contentious issue of the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant.  This contravenes Irish and international policy on including people with disabilities in society.  It also flies in the face of the adjudication on the issue by the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly.  The Government will have to act with haste in tabling a resolution before the summer recess.<\/p><p><br \/>  A high number of disability allowance applications are refused.  Many valid cases are appealed but it can take up to 18 months to obtain an adjudication.  Statistics show that on average about one third of the original refusals are eventually successful.  This begs the question about the success rate following all the re-evaluations and assessments.<\/p><p>Were it not for these applicants' persistence over such a long time, they would have been deprived of their rightful entitlements.  This also poses the question as to the number of worthy cases who do not pursue this lengthy process.  Were they to do so, perhaps their applications would be granted but many of them simply give up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100012#K00200","speaker":"1050","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363867800,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and call Deputy Donnelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100013#L00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1363867800,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister for Social Protection to address this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100013#L00300","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1363867800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>At a time like this, one must wonder what is the point of this Chamber.  Deputy Finian McGrath has tabled an extremely important motion before the House with the support of many Members in the Technical Group.  As I look across the Chamber, I see the Government's overwhelming majority is represented by a single highly capable Member, namely, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  No senior Ministers or Government Deputies are present.  I wonder what those in the Gallery think of the sight of a bunch of Deputies standing up and talking into the air on an issue as important as disability and the cuts to the disability sector.  Each one of these empty seats costs the people of Ireland approximately &euro;250,000 per annum and standing up here right now, it comes as no surprise to me that the citizens of Ireland have increasingly less faith in their elected representatives.<\/p><p>  Nevertheless, the motion before Members is extremely important and I congratulate Deputy Finian McGrath on bringing it forward.  His motion does three things, namely, it recognises the scale of support provided by the disability sector, highlights the variety of cuts that have been imposed on that sector and calls on the Government both to reverse one recent decision on the mobility grant and to honour its commitment to treat people with disability in this State with the respect and dignity that is their right and which they deserve.  Deputy McGrath's motion points out that 13% of the population is coping with a disability, that one person in 25 is providing unpaid care to people with disabilities and shockingly, that in Ireland, one carer in 50 is under the age of 15.  However, since 2008 the sector has experienced a 14% cut in funding.  When one factors in inflation, this equates to a 20% cut in real purchasing power for the sector.  In this context, many organisations have 85% of their budgets locked into pay and pensions and under the terms of the Croke Park agreement, not only can they not replace their staff but they must award pay rises.  Consequently, service providers are being hit with huge cuts and must take them all from 15% of their budgets.  The result, as every Member is aware, has been huge problems for both the service providers and more critically, obviously, for those whom they support.<\/p><p>  The most recent cut has been to the mobility grant.  I accept the Ombudsman's finding and that the Government must act.  However, as Deputy Joan Collins pointed out, the figures are spurious.  I examined them and at present the two grants, namely, the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant, cost approximately &euro;10 million per year.  For example, in 2011, the cost was &euro;10 million.  According to the Government, extending these schemes to include those who are over 65 could add a further &euro;300 million.  In other words, the cost would increase from &euro;10 million to more than &euro;310 million, which sounds pretty dodgy to me.  However, the numbers nonetheless are large and there is very little money available.  Consequently, I accept that any response must be taken seriously and must be done in a careful manner that does not incur an annual cost to the State of &euro;300 million.  However, it is unacceptable to cease the current grant, which costs less than &euro;1 million per month, while trying to figure out what the new scheme should be.  There is no reason the Government could not have simply continued it before introducing the new scheme.  I do not doubt the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and have heard her speak with passion and expertise on the issue of disabilities in this Chamber many times.  However, she is not a full Minister and when one looks at the cuts that have come and the way in which they have been imposed, one cannot but conclude that the disability sector is not receiving the priority it should from both the present Administration and its predecessor.  The choices we make in crisis will determine our character as a nation.  It is easy to give out money when there is lots of money around and when one is borrowing too much of it.  That is easy but the choices we make now will determine our social values.  At present, history will look back on this D&aacute;il and its predecessor and will state the elected representatives of the people chose to take money from disabled children at the same time they paid tens of billions of euro to professional financial investors.  The present Government can still change this and still has time to do so.  That is the choice it faces and I hope the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will do everything they can in this regard.<\/p><p>  I will use the time remaining to me to make a special plea for St. Catherine's Association, Wicklow.  It provides a phenomenal service to the people of Wicklow and recently was obliged to put 58 staff on notice, which will have extremely serious consequences.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has been engaging in good faith with me and the other Wicklow Deputies on this issue and I have a request I wish to put on the record on behalf of that institution, namely, that the funding for the 58 staff be provided until the end of the school term.  I appreciate that things must change and there have been governance issues.  Moreover, I acknowledge this is not the fault of the HSE but taking out those 58 teachers mid-term will cause a great deal of distress and disruption to the pupils therein.  Consequently, my request is that until the end of the school term, emergency funding be provided that allows the school to continue.  This would minimise any disruption and would give the new board time to come up with a new plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100013#L00400","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1363867800,"counter":246,"content":"<p>At the outset, I pay tribute to Deputy Finian McGrath for the introduction of this Private Members' motion and congratulate him on the work he has put into placing it on the Order Paper for the House.  In a modern society, it is sad that Members are obliged to discuss motions such as this which call for the protection of the disabled, for a halt to the cuts in their income and payments and for help for them to allow them to live independently and to steer away from institutionalisation, as well as calling for them to be given their rights as equal citizens in this land.  However, it appears as though this is what Members have come to.  Has the Government really stooped so low that it must pinch the pockets of these vulnerable people to pay for the mistakes of the better off?  In the recent past, there have been cuts to personal assistance that meant disabled people were obliged to sit out overnight outside Leinster House in protest before the Government reversed that barbarous decision.  This was followed by a cut to the respite care grant and now, most recently, by the slashing of the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grants.  Disabled people simply are wondering what will be next.  In recent days, I received a letter from a disabled person from my constituency who is a double transplant patient suffering from cystic fibrosis.  He wrote that he dreaded to see the postman coming or to turn on the radio to hear what will be cut next.  The loss of the mobility allowance will mean his ability to live independently will be curtailed severely.  Following the decision of the Government to slash such mobility payments, all 5,000 people who are in receipt of them, all of whom have disabilities and need the payments in order to leave their houses, will lose up to &euro;280 per month.  This targeting of the most vulnerable people in our society is an absolute disgrace.<\/p><p>  It is highly unlikely, perhaps even impossible, that within the next three months, when these payments are due to end, the Government will have devised and implemented a public transport strategy that will take into account the transport needs of all, even those with disabilities.  Moreover, even if the review is completed within the next few months, it still will be a long time before changes on the ground become evident.  The people who are being targeted in this instance are individuals who are unable to use public transport and for those who need to adapt their vehicles for driving.  What are these people supposed to do while the Government awaits yet another of its infamous reviews?  For people in remote areas, such as County Donegal, the consequences will be disastrous.  I have been contacted by numerous constituents who are worried sick that they will lose their mobility allowances, as well as by some who were about to apply but now cannot and are devastated by that.  For them, they will be housebound because public transport, for those who can use it, is non-existent in Donegal, even before one considers those who cannot access it because it is not disabled-friendly.  The plan of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will neither fix this nor solve this problem.  People with disabilities cannot be ignored or neglected.<\/p><p>The Government cannot force people to stay in their homes.  It must allow people who are eligible to apply for the limited supports that are available.  The Department and the Government have had years to resolve this mess.  It is their, not disabled people's, mess to resolve.<\/p><p> The Department must establish a scheme that is legitimate and allows for all people who are eligible to apply for mobility payments to do so.  It must retain the personal assistant service and provide the supports, including educational supports, that are necessary for disabled people to be truly equal citizens.  It must also adequately support those who are caring for disabled people.  Not only does providing the means to allow disabled people to live independently give them a better quality of life and recognises their contribution to our society, it also saves money in the long term compared to the cost of the institutionalisation that would be necessary otherwise.<\/p><p> People who live with disabilities have had to fight all their lives, and their families have had to fight on their behalf.  Supports were never easy to access.  We have seen the struggle families have had to get domiciliary care allowances.  Even mobility allowances and transport grants were not easily accessible for disabled people.  They have had to fight constantly.  We must build a society in which they are recognised and in which that struggle is seen to be our struggle, and not only theirs.  They have had to fight for every support they get.<\/p><p> The Minister has failed to protect and provide for the disabled and continues to target them with savage cutbacks.  This is outrageous decision making, particularly by the Labour Party Minister of State who is overseeing this process.  I call on all Members to oppose the Government's proposed amendment to this motion and to recognise the rights of disabled people as equal citizens in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100013#L00500","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363868400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>It is a pity that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has left the Chamber as I wish to draw to her attention a situation that has developed in my constituency of Tipperary South.

On 28 February last, with ten minutes notice, the Health Service Executive announced the closure of both residential and day services for persons with acquired brain injury.  This was done without any consultation with the service users, stakeholders or staff.<\/p><p>  The transitional living unit, called Sl&iacute; Eile, was developed by committed staff, who are continually open to change and have changed over the years.  They built the service over the last 14 years since it was established in October 1999.  It is acknowledged to be a quality service for people with acquired brain injury.  The unit is the only HSE-run unit for rehabilitation services for people with acquired brain injury in the south east.  It provides short to medium term residential rehabilitation placements in the community for three people at any one time.  The unit is based in Clonmel and aims to be a stepping stone to greater independence for people with acquired brain injury who may possess basic self-care skills but who are having difficulty managing their lives due to cognitive and sometimes behavioural difficulties.  The unit's residential service provides a 24 hour support service on the days of operation from Monday to Friday.<\/p><p>  Alongside the residential service, the transitional living unit provides a day service from Mondays to Thursdays for people with acquired brain injury.  There are approximately 22 service users.  The focus of the day service is on social interaction, skills development, peer support, personal development and computer, literary, communication and leisure skills.  The unit's residential and day service is staffed by a manager and nine social care workers.<\/p><p>  This announcement was made at ten minutes notice and without any consultation with staff on Thursday, 28 February, when the southern senior management of the HSE was on its way to a forum meeting in Cork to announce this decision.  The management obviously instructed local management to indicate the closure to staff effectively at the drop of a hat.  There was no consultation and no information was given to service users or clients.  One can imagine the trauma and distress of service users when this information became available, not directly from the HSE but on the basis of that announcement.  The staff have built up this unit over the last 14 years and it is acknowledged to be excellent.  The staff have always been open to change and built the unit on that basis.  Even at this late stage the staff are open to change in the provision of these services.  The decision makes little or no financial sense, as there are few financial savings involved, but it ensures maximum disruption and upheaval for service users.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister to investigate the absolutely appalling manner of the announcement and the conduct of the HSE in making it.  I also call on her to reverse the decision.  This service is absolutely necessary.  It caters for the entire south-eastern area both on a day and residential basis.  There are rumours, because no consultation has taken place, that there will be some involvement by Acquired Brain Injury Ireland, but that organisation provides no rehabilitation service.  The closure of the service in Clonmel will deprive service users in the south east of a rehabilitation service.<\/p><p>  I cannot stress strongly enough how traumatised and distraught the service users are as a result of this.  The staff are utterly dismayed with the dismantling of a quality service that has been built up over 14 years and the disrespectful manner in which the life-changing news was conveyed at ten minutes notice.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to tell the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, about this and to ask that an investigation take place into the manner of this announcement and the conduct of the HSE in this regard.  I urge the Minister of State to reverse the decision and ensure that these services are available for persons in the south east with acquired brain injury.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100014#M00400","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1363868400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I am happy to have the opportunity to summarise the position of the Government on the motion tabled by Deputy Finian McGrath and the Technical Group.  I have listened with interest to Members on both sides of the House, as did my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, earlier this morning and last night.  Indeed, the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to this issue has rightly been recognised by Members on both sides of the House.<\/p><p>  The position taken by the Government in doing everything in its power to protect those who are most vulnerable is clear, given the very significant financial difficulties the State faces at this time.  It is incumbent on us to find better ways to use the moneys we have available to us to extract the best value for those most in need in our society.  That is why, with regard to health services for people with disabilities, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, spoke in detail about the significant funding of &euro;1.5 billion which is committed in 2013 to meeting the health and personal social care needs of people with disabilities.  The Minister of State outlined the major programme of reform being undertaken to ensure we focus our efforts in the most appropriate way in respect of funding for people with disabilities.<\/p><p>  Front-line services are the priority for the Government.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive is committed to keeping the number of personal assistant hours at a level consistent with that provided in 2012.  Additional funding of &euro;4 million has been allocated to help find places for the 700 school leavers with disabilities who will require a service this year.  Funding of &euro;1 million has been ring-fenced to meet the housing needs of institutions in 2013, and this will enable housing authorities to provide up to 150 new homes in the community for people with disabilities.<\/p><p> We are finding new and better ways to deliver services which will provide choice and control for people with disabilities.  It is the Government's firm belief that this is the best way for people to live full lives in the midst of their local communities.  The national implementation framework for the value for money and policy review of disability services will pave the way for migration towards a model of person-centred, individually chosen supports and help to implement a more effective method of assessing need, allocating resources and monitoring resource use.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, stated last night, choice and control will shift to where it correctly belongs, namely, with the individual and his or her family.<\/p><p> A number of Deputies referred to a so-called postcode lottery in services for children.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, acknowledged that services have developed independently and were often established to serve one specific group of children only, resulting in a wide variation in the services available.  We are working to resolve this issue on the basis of a cross-sectoral approach.<\/p><p> Consistency, standardisation and fairness are the focus of the HSE in its current reconfiguration of existing therapy resources for children.  Our aim is to ensure services are as integrated as possible and targeted to the areas of greatest need.  We look forward to the Health Information and Quality Authority's standards for residential services for people with disabilities, which will be placed on a statutory footing this year, with the related registration and inspection regime also set to commence.<\/p><p> Many Deputies expressed concern about the needs of those who have been in receipt of the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant.  I reiterate that the decision to end the schemes was not taken lightly and every effort is being made to devise an appropriate solution or solutions to resolve the issues arising.  The project group which has been established on a cross-departmental and agency basis includes relevant individuals representing the disability sector whose role is to communicate and advocate for those in need of supports in addition to helping finding solutions.  The group's work is well under way and we must allow it to continue in order that the most appropriate solution or solutions can be ascertained.  In the meantime, the payment of mobility allowance will continue for a period of four months for existing recipients.  I stress also that the funding of &euro;10.6 million remains in place and is committed to meeting the priority transport needs of people with a disability.  I confirm also that there is a contingency fund in my Department.  I will convey to the Minister the comments made by Deputies Donnelly and Healy on specific facilities in their constituencies.<\/p><p> The new assisted decision-making (capacity) Bill will align modern legislation with the principles contained in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The guiding principles of the Bill reflect the principle of the dignity and autonomy of each individual person and the assumption that the person has the capacity to take decisions unless the contrary is shown.  It also acknowledges the freedom of a person to make his or her own decisions.  The intention of the Bill is to support specifically the right of all persons to equal recognition before the law.  The legislation will replace the existing ward of courts system.<\/p><p> On the issue of constructive engagement with groups representing the disabled, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, set out the wide-ranging approaches being taken in the national disability strategy's implementation plan to bring together Departments, agencies and local government with the disability stakeholders group, which represents the many facets of living that confront people with disabilities.  The Minister of State also noted the role of the disability forum which reaches out to individuals with their lived experience of disability to ensure the widest possible inclusion takes place.  The issue of people with disabilities is extremely important, as is clear in the concern expressed by Members on all sides.  I assure the House of the concern of the Government for people with disabilities and thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I am also grateful for the opportunity to place this issue to the fore in the proceedings of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100014#M00500","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363869000,"counter":253,"content":"<p>While many of the sentiments expressed and assurances given by the Minister of State are positive, those who are affected by disability have reason to be somewhat sceptical about words of assurance.  The programme for Government contains noble aspirations and states the Government will \"ensure that services meet the needs of users\", \"facilitate people with disabilities in achieving a greater level of participation in employment, training and education\" and \"ensure that the quality of life of people with disabilities is enhanced and that resources allocated reach the people who need them\".  It is extremely difficult to square these positive aspirations and fine sentiments with the shocking decision, which was taken without consultation with those affected, to abolish the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant.  Large numbers of extremely vulnerable people are living in a state of anxiety because they fear their quality of life and ability to participate fully in society will be dramatically damaged and downgraded at the end of June when the proposed cuts are implemented.<\/p><p>  Representatives of the Centre for Independent Living appeared before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions to express their views on the proposed abolition of the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant.  They seek an assurance from the Government that individual direct payments will be maintained.  No such assurance was forthcoming in this debate.  When the Government indicates that alternatives will be put in place in the absence of providing an assurance that these alternatives will be direct, individual payments, people in receipt of these allowances are right to be worried.  They want direct payments because they allow them to have a degree of freedom, autonomy and self-determination.  It is only by continuing to provide the current supports and enhancing them, as promised in the programme for Government, rather than cutting or downgrading it, as people fear will be the case under the proposed alternative, that the Government can honour the commitments it made and the sentiments the Minister of State has just expressed.  Will the Minister of State provide a firm assurance to those who receive the motorised transport grant and mobility allowance that their direct payments will be continued?  Those are the words they want to hear.  They do not want bus tickets nor do they wish to rely on public transport because they would not have the same level of individual freedom and autonomy as they enjoy with direct payments.<\/p><p>  The Government states - wrongly in my opinion - that corporation tax is sacrosanct and we cannot touch the profits of multinational companies.  Its position is topsy-turvy.  Surely, when one is discussing budgets and resources, the sacrosanct items should be the supports and services provided to the most vulnerable, especially the disabled.  Is that not where the Government's priorities should lie?  Should it not decide that mobility allowance and motorised transport grants will not be touched regardless of what problems arise?  Likewise, should it not state that personal assistants and home help hours to the disabled and vulnerable, funding to voluntary organisations that support the disabled and vulnerable and grants to older people to adapt their homes will not be touched?  Those are the assurances the Government failed to provide.  They are the items that should be sacrosanct but are not.  Many have been cut or, in the case of personal assistants, the Government tried to cut them but was prevented from doing so because disabled people protested and forced it to back off.<\/p><p>Those are the assurances we want, to match the fine words and noble sentiments in the programme for Government.  Let the Minister of State match words with deeds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100015#N00200","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363869600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Finian McGrath for bringing this important issue before the D&aacute;il. I concur with what Deputy Seamus Healy said about Sl&iacute; Eile in Clonmel.  The anger of people in the south east at the closing of this facility is unbelievable.  Last week, I took part in a radio show with some of the workforce of Sl&iacute; Eile.  More than 1,700 calls came into the radio station from Clonmel and across counties Waterford, Wexford and Tipperary.  People cannot believe the Government has reached the stage of cutting services to the most severely disabled people, those with severe brain injuries.  The people who work in the facility are highly skilled.  Some of them trained in England in the specific skills of rehabilitating those with severe brain injury.  Within the next year, 5,000 people will present at hospitals throughout the country with severe brain injury, adding to about 60,000 people already suffering.  Brain injury rehabilitation is a specific service by highly trained personnel.  This closure will be extremely detrimental to the Minister of State.  I do not think she realises the seriousness of what she has done in cutting this service by highly trained people.<\/p><p>  The most vulnerable people in society are those with disabilities and those who care for them.  Parents care for their children and children care for their parents.  The psychological trauma they suffer is everlasting.  A brain injury does not heal so that everything is all right in a few weeks or months.  People have to live with brain injury for the rest of their lives.  The trauma within a household when a brain injury occurs is dramatic and heart-rending.<\/p><p>  In the current economic circumstances, surely it is obligatory for all of us to help those who are most vulnerable in our society.  Wherever cuts are made, and even if those of us on this side of the House oppose them, to withdraw services from the people who are most vulnerable is shameful and appalling.  Knowing the Ministers of State, Deputies Jan O'Sullivan and Kathleen Lynch, as I do, I know they do not want to do that.  It is not in their psyche to do so.  The Government must, however, take another look at what is being done and find another way.  We can all suggest alternative ways to get the money.  The Government is not going to listen to our alternative, which is to take from the rich and from those who are not paying their fair share, but whatever is done, why must services be taken from those who are vulnerable?<\/p><p>  These people cannot speak for themselves, because they cannot speak.  They often cannot get to a polling station because they are too ill.  These are the people who need to be protected by us, no matter what we have to do.  There are decent people in all parties in the House.  We have all come across people who suffer a disability and the people who work with them, sometimes having to manage them for 24 hours a day.  We have seen the love shown by carers and how disabled people are deprived of the simple pleasures in life the rest of us can enjoy.  We must offer them something back and give them a little extra, year after year and budget after budget.  We should not be cutting at all.  The Minister for Finance should be trying to find something extra that would give these people a lift and a better quality of life.  That is what they deserve and need.<\/p><p>  When we speak about vulnerable people and the most vulnerable in our society, we must put some thought into the families who spend 24 hours a day with a person who has a disability.  We must give some thought to the mother, father, son or daughter who will spend the rest of their lives caring for a disabled person.  No money can pay for that, but we should not offend these people by making miserable cuts to the mobility allowance or other disability payments.  That is offensive to them.  They believe they deserve better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100016#O00200","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1363869600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I thank Members from all parties who have contributed to the debate.  I particularly thank members of the Technical Group who strongly supported the motion.  I listened carefully to the contributions but I also listened carefully to Government Deputies who misrepresented sections of our motion.  I will go through those later and respond to the Minister of State.<\/p><p><br \/>  The motion is about the rights of the disabled as citizens of the State.  It is about supporting these people.  They were attacked and treated very badly in recent months.  Only this morning, following yesterday's debate, I received two letters from parents of children with an intellectual disability.  One said:<blockquote>My daughter has Down's syndrome.  You may or may not be aware that currently she will not automatically be entitled to resources in mainstream education.  This is because Down's syndrome is not categorised as a low incidence disability.  My daughter is a wonderful, bright, curious little girl.  She has a right to equal education which supports her reaching her full potential.  Please help us achieve that for her and all children with Down's syndrome.<\/blockquote>That is just one letter relating to this debate which arrived this morning.  Yesterday, I was contacted by a factory worker who is looking after his disabled wife.  Their application for carer's allowance was turned down.  Instead of turning down the application by this man, who supports his very disabled wife, we should be giving him a gold medal and doing our best to support him.   The Government has cut the respite care grant by a measly &#8364;325.  Some of my colleagues spoke about the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of euro being wasted, yet we impose this cut on families where someone has a disability.  These are real people and they are citizens with rights.  They deserve support and respect in this debate.<\/p><p><br \/>  Last night, we heard a lecture from the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on listening.  She was agonising about the issue.  People with disabilities have spoken but the Government is not acting on what they have said.  They now want delivery rather than being listened to while the services and supports they rely on are being demolished.<\/p><p><br \/>  Regarding the national disability strategy, the Minister of State talked about listening exercises.  A number of her colleagues also spoke about the importance of listening.  Let us get down to reality.  First, the programme for Government contains a commitment to an implementation plan.  We still do not have it in the third year of the Administration.  Second, a three year plan was to have commenced in 2013.  The previous Government had undertaken significant planning work at official level to prepare the plan.  The national disability strategy implementation group was not established until November 2011, at which point the Minister of State said it would take six months to prepare the plan.  It has not yet been published and, meanwhile, a number of further deadlines have passed.  I understand the finalisation of the plan has been repeatedly delayed because some Departments have not provided their input.  It seems that some Departments are not co-operating with stated Government policy.  There was still no commitment to publication in last night's speech by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am pointing out the reality for people with disabilities.  We have had all the listening, all the talk and all the guff.  I ask the Minister of State to implement the Government's promise and reverse the decision on the mobility allowance and grant or, alternatively, set up a proper scheme with immediate effect.  I also ask the Minister of State to fulfil all the disability related promises in the programme for Government.<\/p><p>Last night, I mentioned figures relating to the intellectual disability sector.  An extra 500 respite, day care and residential places per year for four years would wipe out the deficit.  The numbers and the amount of money involved are not as significant as people claim.  There is considerable potential.<\/p><p> I thank my colleagues for their great support.  Many of the people who work with disabled people or in the disability sector appreciate the fact that we have returned this issue to the political agenda.  We can discuss economies, bailing out banks and Cyprus, but we must first ensure that we deliver services of the highest international standards to our citizens, including people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100016#O00300","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1363870200,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 71; N\u00edl, 45.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Joe Carey; N\u00edl, Deputies Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh and Finian McGrath.<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100017#P00200","aye":["1062","946","1079","989","1030","975","988","1031","972","1041","1087","991","994","1091","968","1075","1007","1011","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","1105","1068","1055","1019","1051","995","958","1089","949","973","1033","1012","1021","1110","1053","990","982","1023","996","1064","997","1082","977","1038","1026","1004","1070","985","1034","1067","1056","1045","1018","1058","1073","971","1061","1063","966","1074","1013","961","978","1104","1095","950","1109","1024"],"nay":["1003","1020","1096","1071","1032","1083","1037","1015","959","1107","976","1022","1047","1084","1100","1050","1108","1094","960","1049","983","945","1040","962","998","999","1008","1017","1090","993","981","1052","1177","969","1044","1054","1028","984","1005","1001","953","1178","970","1102","956"]},{"type":"vote","time":1363870500,"counter":259,"content":"","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100018#Q00200","aye":[],"nay":[]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1363870800,"counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100019#R00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1363870800,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Ciara Conway - the need to reverse the 58% reduction to the Waterford County Council disability grant;  (2) Deputy Paschal Donohoe - the need for the Minister for Education and Skills to respond to the campaign for a new Educate Together secondary school in respect of the Dublin 1, 3, 7 and 9 areas;  (3) Deputies Dara Calleary and Denis Naughten - the need to sanction funding in respect of the ArtAssist pump in counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon;  (4) Deputy Derek Keating - the need to make provision for persons with a learning disability at St. John of God's, Island Bridge, Dublin particularly in view of the discharge of a person (details supplied);  (5) Deputy Jonathan O'Brien - the implications arising from circular 0008\/13, Budget 2012 &ndash; Public Service-Wide Review of Allowances and Premium Payments, that was issued recently to teachers;  (6) Deputy Michelle Mulherin - the need to direct EirGrid to implement smart grid technical solutions as a pilot project to stretch the network capacity and minimise constraints in North Mayo and to facilitate the number of wind and biomass electricity generating projects;  (7) Deputy Simon Harris - the need to contact the President of the Maldives in view of plans there to physically punish a 15 year old rape victim for having sex outside of marriage;  (8) Deputy Barry Cowen - the list of exempted developments from the property tax published;  (9) Deputy Tom Hayes - the need to outline the future of St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel, County Tipperary;  (10) Deputy Clare Daly - the criteria used exempting unfinished estates from the local property tax;  (11) Deputy Kevin Humphreys - the need to intervene with the ESB to ensure that guided tours and current opening hours continue at the Georgian Museum, \"No. 29\", Merrion Square, Dublin 2;  (12) Deputy Thomas P.

The country continues to be in a precarious situation.  At the best of times, it was a difficult situation while at the worst of times, we could have fallen over the cliff.  We are very lucky to have political parties in this country that were prepared to take responsibility for running the country at this difficult time.  On taking office, this Government inherited all of the bills, both private and public but both parties in Government accepted the challenge.  In other European countries, parties offering for Government in a similar climate have failed and continue to fail.<\/p><p>  As I pointed out last night, there has not been a single indication from anybody on the other side of this House that he or she intends to do anything other than spend the public's money.  The Opposition wants to spend money that the public will eventually be accountable for, in terms of repayments.  It wants to spend money that does not exist even though this country is &euro;1.2 billion short of meeting its commitments every month.  That is a stark and startling situation and in that context, I hope that there will be a recognition by the Opposition that the situation in which we find ourselves must be remedied.  It cannot be remedied by people who were in control at the time and who now wish to run away from reality.  Simply because certain Deputies happen to be in County Meath engaged in a by-election campaign does not relieve them in any way of responsibility for what they entered into when they were in control.  <\/p><p>  Sadly, people's feelings are being manipulated in a cynical fashion at the present time.  People are being treated as if they are children and that is not fair.  It is not fair to the people, to political parties and to Independent Deputies.  Everyone must recognise that we are in a difficult and tight spot.  This Government does not take any pleasure in doing what has to be done.  It grieves Ministers and the Government as a whole greatly to have to do some of the things we are doing.  <\/p><p>  There is no point in trying to say that European institutions did this to us because they did not.  We did it to ourselves, individually and collectively.  People can seek someone to blame but we must all take some responsibility.  To take that point to its logical conclusion, why not challenge and charge people for malfeasance under various Acts?  Why not bring people to court, charge them and see what happens then?  However, as we know from experience, very few people want to accept responsibility for their activities in the past.  There have been many investigations in this House, the DIRT inquiry being a prime example, but very few people have been willing to accept responsibility for their actions in the past.  That is the way it has been and continues to be.<\/p><p>  It is with great regret that the Government finds it necessary to review the entitlement to a medical card for those over 70, even though the decision to grant medical cards to such people was made in the run-up to a general election, in order to buy the votes of older people.  That decision was made with the approval of many Deputies who are now on the other side of the House.  That is the reality and unfortunately, avoiding reality is something we have been particularly good at in recent years.  This Government recognises that the decision now being taken will create difficulties.  It will create difficulties for Ministers, backbenchers and members of the public.  It will create difficulties for families, for those at work and those unemployed, as well as those who are retired.<\/p><p>Sadly, there are very few options available to us and none is easy.  When people pretend to insist that there are easier options available, they are wrong and they continue to damage public confidence in the institutions of the State.<\/p><p> I have been a couple of years in this House and I have seen it all before.  History has indicated that succeeding generations seldom learn from the mistakes of their predecessors.  We have only to consider what happened in Europe in the 1920s and subsequently to see this, and the same arguments are taking place now that took place then.  These are arguments about who is to blame and how we can get even.  This usually ends with people getting even only with themselves, which is tragic.<\/p><p> It goes without saying that Ministers are doing everything possible to alleviate the burden on the people affected by this and other measures.  This comes as no surprise and many of us anticipated this problem two, three, four or five years ago.  Many of us predicted everything that happened.  We must ask the question of whether we can afford a repetition of the kind of scene we have or have had for the past number of years, with the people led to the top of the hill and shown the vista before them as the promised land.  Suddenly, hopes were dashed and people found themselves between a rock and a hard place.  It is truly appalling.<\/p><p> This is not a political point but rather a lesson for everybody who enters this House from now on.  If there ever was a lesson to be learned, it should come from the indiscretions of the past 15 years, when it was quite clear the economy was going well and could fend for itself.  Greed took over, everything was thrown by the wayside and the idea was for everybody to have a party.  Unfortunately, we are now paying for that in spades.<\/p><p> I hope people will understand this measure and if they do not, there will be a worse problem that must be dealt with in a different way at a different time.  To those who say we do not know what we are talking about, that idea cuts both ways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100019#R00600","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363871400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to this new legislation, the Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Bill 2013.  The medical card issue and the health of our senior citizens is important and should be part of a broader debate on health service efficiency and proper care for those over 70.  We allow senior citizens a great debt, particularly those who paid taxes through their noses in the 1970s and 1980s.  I remember very well the famous PAYE marches from years ago, and these people paid taxes and made a contribution to the State.  They deserve care and respect for that work.  We discovered later that many people from that time did not pay taxes, and I welcome the fact that the Revenue Commissioners have brought in more money because of efficiencies.<\/p><p>  Overall, nearly 43% of the national population has free access to GP services under the General Medical Services scheme.  As 1 February 2013, there are 1,855,797 medical cards, equating to over 40% of the national population.  There are 130,301 GP visit cards, representing nearly 3% of the population.  Expected activity in 2013 for medical cards and GP visit cards reflects the Government's approach to the issue, with the total number of medical cards expected at the end of 2013 at 1.921 million and the total number of GP visit cards expected to be 265,257 at the end of 2013.  This is the scale of people affected by the medical card eligibility rules.<\/p><p>  In the 2013 budget, two interrelated changes to the over 70s medical card eligibility arrangements were announced.  The income limit for an over 70s medical card is to be reduced to &euro;600 per week, or approximately &euro;31,000 per year for a single person, and &euro;1,200 per week, equivalent to gross income of about &euro;62,000 per year, for a couple.  For those whose income is between &euro;600 and &euro;700 for single people and between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,400 for couples, they will receive GP visit cards.  They will also continue to have the cost of their GP services covered, with the HSE meeting the prescription drug costs in excess of the drugs payment scheme threshold of &euro;144 per month.  There are approximately 370,000 people over 70 in the State, with approximately 360,000 medical cards issued to people over 70, leaving coverage of that population at approximately 97%.  I welcome that.  The medical card coverage for those under 70 is approximately 35%.  The policy change will leave approximately 92% of those over 70 unaffected, with approximately 20,000 medical card holders over 70 - the wealthiest 5% - continuing to receive free GP services instead of the medical card.<\/p><p>  I listened very carefully to Deputy Durkan's points.  I do not know if he was listening to the previous debate on disabilities but a number a of Independent Deputies have always dealt in reality and put forward positive proposals.  Our proposal for the mobility allowance issue was in the region of &euro;12.6 million.  People are angry because this Government broke promises when it was elected.  We knew of the crisis at that time, and when I was banging on doors, I remember being told that people should try to do their best in here.  Nevertheless, people did not want to listen to false promises, which is why many people are grieving so greatly, as Deputy Durkan indicated.<\/p><p>  The Deputy stated that we all caused the problem, but certain people - including some politicians, Ministers, developers and senior bankers - caused it.  We must not label everybody when we are apportioning blame for the economic downturn and the crisis.  Some people were greedy, cocked up and did not do their job efficiently, and they should get the blame.  I endorse Deputy Durkan's comments to the effect that some of those people who wrecked the country should be charged.  I do not wish to interfere with the judicial system but I hope to see some prosecutions in the end.<\/p><p>  A transitional arrangement will apply to current medical card holders over 70.  Those who qualified for medical cards before 1 April 2013 will automatically retain those cards until 31 May 2013.  Between 1 April and 31 May 2013, medical card holders over 70 who qualify for a GP visit card - where gross income is more than &euro;600 but less than &euro;700 for single persons or more than &euro;1,200 but less than &euro;1,400 for couples - will be required to notify the HSE accordingly.  Under the legislation it is proposed to make a change in the manner in which those over 70 who have obtained judicial separation are assessed.  With the proposals, separated people over 70, although still legally married, will be assessed as single persons, which is welcome.  Their assessment will take into account obligatory maintenance payments.<\/p><p>This proposed approach is similar to that used by State bodies such as the Revenue Commissions.  These are the details in the legislation.<\/p><p> Going back to the higher GP usage by older people, there are some interesting statistics.  Older people use the health services more often than young people.  The CSO survey shows that in 2009-10, older people were more likely than the general population to visit their doctor in that year; 74% of the general population visited a GP at least once in a year while 94% of those over 70 visited a GP at least once a year.  The same study shows the average number of GP consultations increases with age, with 18 to 24 year olds averaging 2.4 visits per year and the figure rising to 5.4 consultations per year for those 70 and over.<\/p><p> I know the Minister of State is interested in the broader debate and his heart is in the right place.  We must look at a sensible, fair and equitable health service for the entire population, with sensible funding proposals based on the general taxation system.  I strongly advocate universal health services similar to those in other countries.  I would pick the models that are most efficient and work best to emulate.  Currently, many people covered in the private health insurance sector face huge costs.  I know many people who would rather give few bob extra in tax so they did not have to go to private companies for health needs.  The Government has a fair and equitable health service on its agenda and if it comes up with the right proposals, many people on the Opposition benches will support them.  Health must be prioritised but it is about more than just spend, spend, spend, as Deputy Durkan pointed out.  There must be clear funding and stability, along with efficiency.<\/p><p> I have seen some tremendous examples of good practice in the disability sector in the last six months.  The sector has taken a financial hit while continuing to deliver quality services, particularly those working in the intellectual disability sector.  Fresh, new people are working in the sector, young adults between 20 and 35 who are working with those with intellectual disabilities.  They are doing amazing work and it is important we mention that in this debate.  Just because they are examples of good practice does not mean we must penalise them by cutting their budgets.  We should reward them instead.  The 500 respite and residential care places per year for four years between 2012 and 2016 recommended by service providers can be achieved and would make a major dent in this issue.<\/p><p> The new income limits for medical card eligibility for persons over 70 were announced in the budget for 2013 and this Bill introduces that change.  It is anticipated the measure will generate &euro;12 million in savings during the second half of 2013 and &euro;24 million in the full year.  We all know this is a difficult time for the Government and the Department of Health.  This saving is part of the &euro;781 million in savings the budget set out to achieve in health spending, including an overall reduction in the cost of primary care schemes of &euro;323 million.  That is the bigger picture but I urge the Ministers that while looking at waste and efficiency, they must also be conscious that front line services or services to senior citizens or those with a disability must be given special exemptions from any cuts.  The vision of the health service can be observed through how it treats the weakest and most vulnerable.<\/p><p> That &euro;781 million in savings in 2013 must not be achieved by slashing and burning.  There are many examples of good practice in the health service.  There are problems in certain areas but we should reward and develop good practice and efficiency.  I commend the staff working in the health services, the doctors, nurses, carers and porters, who all do an excellent job.<\/p><p> The new income limits are that a single person over 70 with a gross income of &euro;600 per week will qualify for a medical card, while a single person over 70 with a gross income of between &euro;600 and &euro;700 will qualify for a GP visit card.  We should encourage preventative measures for senior citizens.  We have many good senior citizen groups and we should encourage them to be more proactive in encouraging physical exercise for older people.  This would reduce the need for many GP visits and visits to accident and emergency departments.<\/p><p> I was recently in the accident and emergency department of Beaumont Hospital with a minor complaint.  I was on a chair for 17 hours, then I got an armchair before eventually getting a trolley.  While there, I met many senior citizens and it was very upsetting to see how they had to wait.  The Minister of State should keep fighting on this, we must do something about it.  It is easy to score political points but the bottom line is that anyone who has the chance to be in government for five years must make some sort of impact.<\/p><p> The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Health Act 1970, as amended, to change the eligibility rules for medical cards for persons aged 70 years and over.  The date the changes come into effect will be by order made by the Minister.  Section 7(4) makes provision for the HSE to provide support to anyone who seeks help in making an application due to any incapacity.  That is a good section because, as most back bench Deputies know, there are many problems for senior citizens and those with a disability when dealing with bureaucracy and HSE application forms.  Many of them come to our clinics, which is part of our job.  I hope section 7(4) is implemented in a professional and caring manner.  Section 7(10) defines the meaning of &quot;civil partner&quot; as that in the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  This is a progressive subsection that acknowledges the reality of modern Ireland.<\/p><p> I welcome the debate on this legislation.  I urge the Minister of State to introduce radical new reforms in the health service.  If we are to help the over 70s we must tackle the other problems and get involved in health promotion campaigns.  There is a great deal of potential to make sensible savings without directly affecting senior citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100020#S00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363872000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>This Bill sets out to achieve savings of &euro;24 million annually.  It is envisaged that &euro;12 million will be saved in the second half of this year if the Bill is passed.  The overall budget for the medical card system is &euro;750 million.  The &euro;24 million being saved is nitpicking in the overall context.  Statistics show older people make more use of their medical cards than the general population.  The figures show 94% of people over 70 visit their GP on a regular basis.  It follows then that they have a high intake of drugs to help them cope with illness and disability.<\/p><p>As highlighted recently, the savings can be trebled or quadrupled if the whole issue of the cost of drugs is tackled.  I appreciate that efforts have been made by the Minister for Health, the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, in this regard.  The issue must be tackled vigorously.  We learned recently from the <i>Sunday Business Post <\/i>that vital drugs and medicines here cost double and treble the amount at which they are available to the National Health Service in the UK.  We cannot allow this to continue where a neighbouring island only a short distance away uses the same suppliers.  That is a ridiculous comparison.  This is the route we should take.  If we go in headlong, it is obvious that such costs are a deterrent to those seeking medical aid.  Although covered for the cost of the doctor's visit, the next stop is the pharmacy.  There are also the costs at the accident and emergency units which will be imposed and hospital daily care charges will be lost to this group, which is a vulnerable sector of society.<\/p><p> The gross income limits will be reviewed annually by the Minister for Health.  The Bills Digest states that the limits may be increased or decreased with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This will deprive more than 5% of the people of the medical card if the Bill is passed.  That review should be done in a sensitive manner.  We should not be too aggressive with these people.  It has been stated that the transition period will continue up to May but perhaps the Minister would consider extending it to the end of summer as many people will have to face various forms and online communications with which they are unable to keep up.  <\/p><p> A whole raft of overheads is coming on stream for these people - the local property tax, domestic water charges in addition to a cut in the telephone allowance and a cut in household benefits such as electricity and gas.  There is the imposition of the 1% levy on hard-earned pension pots which had been put aside for a nest egg.  There is also the accessing of health insurance and all types of insurance, including motor insurance.  I ask the Minister to row back and rethink the issue.  I am not in favour of this in the current situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100021#T00200","speaker":"1050","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363872600,"counter":272,"content":"<p>The new arrangements provided for in budget 2013 to address Government spending for medical card schemes could be viewed as an important marker for how we distribute scarce resources in a fairer and more equitable fashion.  It is clear that a balance must be struck between protecting the most vulnerable members of society while also being mindful that those who can afford to carry more of the costs of their treatment should do so in the fairest way possible.  Fairness is the key word when evaluating the changes to qualifying criteria for medical cards for older members of society.  The proposed changes in the Bill will have absolutely no effect on the vast majority of older citizens.  They will affect only the relatively better off, those who have single income in excess of &euro;31,000 or couples with incomes in excess of &euro;62,000.<\/p><p>  There is an ongoing and very necessary debate about what people consider fair and how middle income individuals, those who are at work paying mortgages and educating children, consider they have shouldered the brunt of rebuilding the nation's economy.  It is clear that only the most well-off individuals will be affected by the particular set of changes proposed in the legislation.  Those over 70 who, by any objective measurement, have the capacity to pay more towards the cost of medical treatment will pay more.  This is a position I support.  Nine out of ten over 70s will not be affected at all by the change and will still receive a full medical card.  Of course, those who fall below the limit, down as far as &euro;600 per week or &euro;1,200 for a couple, will still receive free GP cards, allowing them to visit a doctor as and when required.  It is important to note that those few affected by the change will not, as Deputy McGrath and others have pointed out, have to give up their cards immediately as there will be a transitional arrangement in place.  Those who qualified up to April 2013 can hold on to their cards until the end of May.<\/p><p>  In targeting the scarce resources towards those who arguably need them the most, tough decisions are required.  These decisions need to be fair and to be seen to be fair.  In many ways the decision in the first place by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government to award medical cards to everyone over 70 years of age, regardless of income and resources, epitomised the political and financial culture that pertained and which bankrupted the country.  That decision did not make financial sense, and neither did it pass the test of equity.  The economic crisis which we are pulling out of was a direct result of a succession of vote-grabbing flourishing of bust cheques from successive Fianna F&aacute;il Governments based on what we now know was an utterly false developer-led boom and nobody should forget that.   The adjustments to this scheme, reflected in the Bill, are necessary and they are required to ensure that the money we have available to us goes towards funding schemes of critical importance for those who need the most.  I support the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100022#U00200","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1363872600,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Deputy Gerard Nash should have indicated at the outset that he was sharing time.

When ever spending reductions or cutback are proposed, it is always difficult for people.  This Bill is no different.  The fact is we are living in difficult times.  This is obvious in every sector of society.  No matter what sector one speaks with, everyone appears to have problems, particularly in running their homes or business and we, in running the country, have a difficulty as our finances indicate and we must do the best we can for the people.  That means we must have sensible and good services for the people, whether in health services, education, transport or agriculture, and it is hard to do that in difficult times.  The proposed cutback in medical cards is a sensitive issue and has to be seen to be fair.  Therein lies the challenge.  There are many areas I wish to highlight and bring to the attention of the Government, the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, who is present.  There are many sections of society who should not lose the medical card, for example, women with cancer.  In my constituency I meet people suffering from cancer.  I do not have to tell anybody in the House of the trauma people go through when families, particularly a mother, are hit by cancer.  I have witnessed situations in my constituency where people, whether in the public or private sector or the self-employed, have to undergo a means test and an assessment.<\/p><p>I speak in particular about the self-employed, people who are trying their best to keep a business going who might be struck down by an illness such as cancer.  When they apply for a medical card they cannot get it.  In this day and age when we can give a lot out for nothing and we try to look after people, it is desperate that those people are left without a medical card.  I have raised the matter previously, but nothing seems to change.  I request that in future assessments of the medical card situation the Minister for Health should look at those vulnerable people.  It is unfair on them at a hard time in their lives.<\/p><p> I understand the Government needs to find areas in which to make savings, but savings could be made in other areas.  Some of the earlier speakers talked about the drug purchase scheme, which leaves much to be desired.  There needs to be more consultation with the people working in the health service.  Every week in my clinics and elsewhere, I come across people who work in the health service.  They point out several opportunities to cut out wastage.  We need more consultation with the people working on the front line.  When they come to our clinics protesting about what we are doing, they say they could find savings but have not been consulted.  In future the Minister should try to consult more with the people and he will find great knowledge and ideas for savings without having to touch the areas that affect people.  We were all elected to public life to try to help people.  Medical cards provide great security for people.  In future, we should consider other ways to make those savings and avoid impacting the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100022#U00400","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363873200,"counter":276,"content":"<p>One of the key priorities of the Department of Health, the HSE and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been to make savings in the health budget through measures that are concentrated, implementable and durable.  There has been significant progress against the backdrop of extraordinary cuts.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has said that his principal stand is not to cut services, but to cut the cost of those services.  In 2010, the cost of operating the GMS for 1.7 million users was &euro;1.9 billion.  The specific cost of the over 70s medical card scheme is &euro;750 million per annum.  It is forecast that the measure in this Bill will generate &euro;12 million in savings during the second half of 2013, and &euro;24 million in a full year.  This saving is part of the &euro;781 million in savings that budget for 2013 set out to achieve in the health budget, to include an overall reduction in the cost of primary care schemes of &euro;323 million.  The Government's primary aim is to cut the cost of services and not the services themselves.<\/p><p>  I challenge the scaremongers, who mostly exist on the Opposition benches.  Let us remember that 92% of people over the age of 70 will retain their medical card.  The Government's commitment to protect the most vulnerable remains more steadfast than ever.  The maintenance of health services will be a key priority next year despite the need for significant savings.<\/p><p>  A significant part of this Bill allows for data sharing between the HSE and the Department of Social Protection, and the HSE and the Revenue Commissioners.  This will include the sharing of personal and sometimes sensitive data between these bodies for purposes of assessing and reviewing eligibility, entitlements and liability for taxes and charges.  The Data Protection Commissioner must be consulted before such data can be shared.  We have repeatedly been given the hoary excuse that the computer systems of the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Social Protection were not up to scratch and communications between those two statutory bodies were impossible.  If this problem has been known about for so long, why was it not tackled and sorted out years ago?  It will certainly be tackled now.<\/p><p>  Instead of engaging in across-the-board cuts the Government is taking a measured approach as outlined in the Bill.  It is vital that any possible changes are made in a manner that takes full account of those most in need.  Having worked all their lives, the least we can do for the older community is to ensure that they can live out their years with decency, and without having to scrimp and save every penny.<\/p><p>  The changes proposed in this Bill are happening in the context of broader health service reforms which will create a single-tier health system, where the need of the patient is put at the centre of the health system.  These include the phased introduction of free GP care for all and the introduction of universal health insurance, which will effectively end the two-tier health service.<\/p><p>  The reforms are working.  Not alone have we proven that we can maintain a safe service, despite the naysayers, we have actually improved services in the past two years.  There has been a reduction in the numbers of people on trolleys and a reduction in waiting times for elective procedures.  Figures published last November showed that the number of adult patients waiting longer than six months for an elective surgical or medical procedure had fallen by 37% since the Government took office.  The number of children waiting longer than three months for a planned procedure had fallen by 66%.  The recent response to a parliamentary question also showed there have been far fewer operations cancelled during the Minister's tenure than during the tenures of his immediate predecessors, who had plenty of time and money to address the health services.<\/p><p>  Eight years ago, the HSE was established in response to the excessive spending and certain difficulties within the regional health boards.  It became a catch-all, obese organisation, independent and over-staffed, presiding over a succession of health scandals.  The measures detailed in the recently published Future Health - A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Services 2012-2015 are very different.  The actions are now specific and time-bound.  The Government is confident to be held to account.  The goal of all these reforms is to put the needs of the patient at the centre of the health system.  The essential public nature of the health system will not be changed.  We will see a new focus on keeping people healthy while moving away from simply treating ill people.<\/p><p>  The Government is conscious of the importance of health and health care to all members of our society, particularly during a time of economic crisis.  We will move away from the current hospital-centred model of care towards a new model of integrated care that treats patients at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as close to home as possible.  Structural reform is key to addressing the problems of the health service according to the document, which emphasises the need for good governance, the avoidance of duplication and a strong regional focus in delivering value for money.<\/p><p>  The complexity of the health care environment necessitates that health policy, legislative objectives, resource allocation models and management structures be aligned to plan and deliver health care services strategically.  Health care systems around the world struggle to reconcile three competing objectives: equality of access, high quality and low cost.  These are objectives which the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has made the cornerstones of his reform programme.<\/p><p>  The Government's health strategy focuses on the key aims of the integration of health and social care services to better meet the needs of the population of Ireland.  This integration of service delivery across professional and institutional boundaries will deliver health care based on client needs and in the most cost-effective location.  Ensuring that patients are able to move easily through the entire care system requires services that are well organised and informed by best available evidence and practice.  In this context, there is an emphasis on the provision of a model of integrated care that leads to greater integration between primary and secondary care with the development of care pathways, referral protocol, guidelines and shared-care arrangements.  Using performance data and other available information will help to determine performance and improve services based on the needs of patients.  Nobody ever said it would be easy but it is going a long way with the reforms started by the Government. <\/p><p>  The document is highly significant in that it will affect our well-being and economic social performance like no other initiative.  In addition to the aspects already mentioned - universal health insurance and free GP care - I wish to highlight the new patient safety agency to be established and also the health and well-being agency.<\/p><p>This shows the holistic approach the Government is taking towards the delivery of services, particularly its proactive rather than reactive measures in the area of health and well-being.<\/p><p> The value for money report and access to care variations are key components of the implementation of any process and need to be closely aligned to the strategies outlined in that document.  The focus now is on keeping people healthy rather than treating them when ill.  It is also proposed to move from the hospital centre model of care to a new integrated service which treats patients as close as possible to home while ensuring the best possible value for money for the State.<\/p><p> This Bill is only one small step towards the delivery of the &euro;700 million savings required this year in the health services.  However, it is a measured and effective cost-saving exercise.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100023#V00200","speaker":"1075","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363873800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I thank the Technical Group for sharing its time and allowing me to speak on this Bill.  This legislation provides us with an opportunity to discuss generally the administration of medical cards and what has been happening in this regard over the past 24 months in particular.  Owing to the downturn in the economy, people who never before envisaged needing a medical card have found themselves reliant upon having one.  Medical cards for the over 70s are vital given the raft of additional charges they now have to pay.  While some of these people have paid off their mortgages, many are living on modest pensions from which they must meet the cost of the household and water charges and fuel costs, which have increased dramatically over the past three years.  The average home heating oil bill has increased by 60% to 75% over the past three years, which is an enormous increase in terms of the income on which people on modest pensions are living.<\/p><p>  I do not like speaking about a person who has left the House.  However, I cannot tie anyone to the Chamber.  Deputy Nash referred in his contribution to people on this side of the House being engaged in vote grabbing.  It is a little rich for a member of the Labour Party to be speaking about vote grabbing given the signed pledges broken by that party on taking up office.  Yesterday and today, there were protests outside this House by people who believed the promises made to them by the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  While I am critical of the contribution made by Deputy Nash, I welcome the positive and sincere contribution made by Deputy Tom Hayes in regard to people suffering from cancer.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, has been involved in politics for a long time and may recall that in the past a person with a consultant diagnosis of cancer was, regardless of means, entitled to a medical card, which was right and proper.  A person who has cancer has enough to deal with and should not have to be concerned with the cost of medical care.  I would like a return to the situation of the past whereby a person diagnosed with any form of cancer, regardless of means, was automatically entitled to a medical card.  This should be reintroduced and should continue.<\/p><p>  During a briefing two weeks ago I discussed with officials from the Department, who deal with applications for carer's and disability allowances, invalidity pensions, illness benefit and so on, the issue of eligibility in general for medical cards.  When it comes to assessment of people under any scheme, the goalposts have been moved dramatically, in particular over the past three years.  Previously, applications for a medical card accompanied by a general practitioner's report on a person's illness, be it cancer or another illness, was sufficient.  Currently, people are being refused a medical card on the basis that their medical evidence is not sufficient.  What this means - the officials will not put this in writing; they never do - is that the evidence required should be from a consultant rather than general practitioner.  I tried hard to drive home that point with the officials during the briefing two weeks ago.  Every politician, including the Acting Chairman, Deputy McConalogue, will be aware that medical evidence from general practitioners is not now being accepted.  An application supported by anything other than a consultant's report will be refused.  That is a fact.  I challenge anybody to tell me or prove that I am wrong in that regard.<\/p><p>  It is particularly mean that Department officials, when following up on applications for medical cards or under any other scheme, are requesting that the person provide more evidence from their doctor.  People are taking this to mean that they require stronger evidence from their doctor.  While the doctor has given the best medical evidence available, he or she is not a consultant.  The officials need to be straight with the people and tell them that they will not qualify for a medical card or illness benefit without evidence of diagnosis from a consultant.  While in the first instance I would rather that the doctor's evidence be sufficient, if that cannot be accepted, the officials should tell the people the truth.  The Minister of State will be aware that this process is resulting in additional financial burden for people.  While in many cases consultants do not charge for updated reports, a consultant who has not seen a patient for a period will be unable to provide an updated report without first seeing him or her, which incurs a considerable cost.  Consultants must and do charge, which puts a further financial burden on people.<\/p><p>  The gist of this legislation is amendment of the eligibility rules in respect of the over 70s medical card.  As stated, under the GMS scheme, almost 43% of the national population has free access to general practitioner services.  I am concerned that given the number of people who have GP only cards and do not have the financial wherewithal to take care of their health, what is proposed in this Bill will result in more cost to the State.  I would not like to see a situation whereby people will opt to wait to see if they get better rather than go to the doctor.  If this happens, they may end up critically or dangerously ill and need to be hospitalised.<\/p><p>We all know what happens when people are hospitalised; they take up acute beds which incurs considerable expense.  The earlier people are assisted, the better, and if having a medical card entices them to go to their local GP in time, it is sensible, prudent and the right way to go.  Since 1 February 2013, some 1.8 million medical cards are in circulation, which equates to 40% of the national population.  This reflects what I stated earlier, that people are under a financial pressure they never were before.<\/p><p> I appreciate that the reduction in income limits is being introduced to reduce spending on medical cards for those aged over 70, and it is forecast this measure will generate &euro;12 million in savings during the second half of 2013 and &euro;24 million in a full year.  This sounds like an almighty amount of money, but if it results in people taking up acute beds when they should not be, we might spend a lot more.  We must be very careful that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water.<\/p><p> The changes proposed in the Bill are in the context of broader health service reforms.  These include the phased introduction of free GP care for all and the introduction of a universal health insurance plan for 2016 which will effectively end the two-tier health service we have at present.  On a daily basis people are dropping their VHI or full health cover because they cannot afford it.  A headline in one of the national newspapers today states people in negotiations with banks on debts and mortgages in crisis will be told to get rid of a car or private health insurance.  This is not sensible because it is awful to think of anyone with private health insurance not being able to pay for it and having no proper medical cover.  This is not right and it is not a good way for people to finish up.  It is certainly not a good way for those aged over 70 to finish up.<\/p><p> The Bill being published so close to being initiated in the Oireachtas means stakeholders and interested people have had little opportunity to make statements.  I want to highlight the views of Age Action Ireland, a group about which I know a considerable amount and I support the work it does.  Following the budget announcement in December 2012, Age Action Ireland criticised the reduction in income limits for those aged over 70.  It stated the sharp reduction in the income threshold for medical cards for those aged over 70 will cause hardship and further undermine the ability of older people who will lose their cards as a result to meet their health care costs.  Age Action Ireland was also concerned about this reduction in the context of a number of other charges facing older people, as I already stated, as a result of budget 2013, such as the increase in the prescription charge for medical card holders from 50 cent to &euro;1.50, the increase in the threshold for the drug payment scheme, the decrease in the amount available for the household benefit package, the introduction of a carbon tax on solid fuel and the introduction of a property tax.  This is a major issue and I ask the Minister of State to take on board the views of an association such as Age Action Ireland because it does invaluable work in representing elderly people.<\/p><p> Nobody should ever underestimate the importance or value of heat when it comes to elderly couples and people aged over 70.  There is nothing worse than visiting an elderly person - not that I would consider a person over 70 to be elderly now because thankfully people live longer than they did in the past - and finding the person in a room without adequate heat.  It is most distressing.  This in turn leads to bad health.  Today is a cold day and many people in the city, and in towns, villages and the rural countryside, do not have adequate heat in their houses.  I feel tremendously bad about this.  The Government should address this in a more concise and workmanlike way.  An elderly person not having heat automatically leads to medical problems.  The simplest cold can progress to a flu and then to pneumonia which, in a very short time, could kill a person.  This is happening on an hourly basis.<\/p><p> I am sure of my facts because I know of many instances of elderly people who stay at home and do not have adequate heat to keep them warm during the day or at night.  This is a crisis which should be tackled.  The introduction of a carbon tax on solid fuel was a horribly mean measure.  It was also mean to young families.  The country must ensure older people are warm in their homes at night, otherwise it will have a knock-on effect on their health, and it is an awful thing to do to these people who have worked so hard all their lives.  It is awful to think they find themselves in a position of not being warm when they sit down and take their ease, which they are perfectly entitled to do after a lifetime of work and perhaps rearing families.  I would like to hear the comments of the Minister of State on this.<\/p><p> When it comes to processing medical cards, one of the biggest debacles we have witnessed in the history of the State was when people thought it was a good idea to take the processing of medical cards away from county level.  We had a great system whereby those processing medical cards worked in conjunction with community welfare officers and knew everybody.  A network was in place.  Local and national public representatives were able to make direct representations to those dealing with the processing of cards.  Additional information may have been required and it could be streamlined or handed in.  It was a great system.  People thought the right thing to do was break up this system.  The excellent local knowledge has been taken away.  Local community welfare officers no longer have direct input to impart their knowledge to those processing cards.  This was a shocking thing to do.  We have all seen the disaster which ensued.  People are waiting for their medical card applications to be processed which in turn means people are not able to take care of their health needs or avail of other benefits which go along with having a medical card, such as sending young lads to school.  The extraordinary waiting period has deprived people of medical cards.  It was an extremely poor decision.  I have spoken to many people involved in the old system, such as community welfare officers or those dealing with the cards, and they all say it was a shameful thing to do which certainly did not benefit those applying for medical cards.  The same happened with regard to student grants but I do not want to speak about this because I want to stick to the subject at hand.<\/p><p> I am opposed to changing the criteria for medical cards for those aged over 70.<\/p><p>Nowadays, people find it hard enough to qualify for a medical card or a GP visit only card, be they over 70 or not.  This is a penny wise and pound foolish endeavour.  The Minister of State may claim that we are going to save &euro;24 million but I do not think we will save one cent.  I remain to be convinced otherwise.  In the longer term, I think it will actually cost the State money.<\/p><p> Local GPs, who work with their patients daily, were previously able to contact the local processing centres when a medical card was applied for.  They could thus have an input but all of that has virtually gone now.  That personal connectivity has gone to Dublin where everything else has gone also.  There are so many Government Ministers and Deputies in or around the capital that they think the whole world stops at the Red Cow roundabout and we do not exist at all.  This is one of the most anti-rural governments we have had since the foundation of the State and that will be proven in time.  The Government is anti-rural; it is all about centralisation and grabbing everything for Dublin but time will prove this policy to be wrong.<\/p><p> I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence.  I also thank the Technical Group for the time its Members have afforded me.  I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100024#W00200","speaker":"1049","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363875000,"counter":281,"content":"<p>This Bill seeks to amend the eligibility rules for the over-70s medical card.  Some 40% of the population has free access to GP services under the GMS scheme.  As of 1 February, there were 1,855,797 medical cards, which equates to 40% of the population.  In addition, there are 130,000 GP visit cards, representing nearly 3% of the population.<\/p><p>  Medical cards were providing blanket cover to the over-70s, of which there are 370,000 in the State.  Currently, some 360,000 medical cards have been issued to people over 70, providing cover to about 97% of that cohort.  About 35% of the population aged under 70 is covered by medical cards.<\/p><p>  The policy change will leave about 92% of existing over-70s as medical card holders.  About 20,000 over-70 medical card holders - that is, the wealthiest 5% - will continue to receive free GP care instead of a medical card.<\/p><p>  Over the past two years, the Government has undertaken a stock-taking exercise of extravagances.  The over-70s medical card should not be seen as an extravagance but we have had no cross checks between social welfare, Revenue and the Department of Health.  Many concerned people are ringing me because they are being asked about their medical cards and whether they require them.  The vast majority of elderly people have no need to worry because we are effectively undertaking a stocktaking exercise.  However, there are people with medical cards who should not have them.  I am not talking about the over-70s, but well-connected people.  The knew somebody who knew somebody else but I cannot understand why they got medical cards.<\/p><p>  I wish to praise the Department of Health, the Department of Social Protection and other Departments that are now writing to people on this matter.  A &quot;nod and wink&quot; system went on but people are now handing in their medical cards, which I welcome.  However, we should do everything possible to ensure the elderly, especially the over-70s, have medical cards, free GP visits and access to the health services they require.<\/p><p>  I am a VHI member and pay for my own cover and that of my mother who is over 70.  There are many people around the country who may not go to a doctor because it will cost &euro;40 or &euro;50 and they may not be able to claim it back.  I am delighted that people have medical cards enabling them to visit the doctor and get their drugs.  There is another side to the story, however, where taxpayers must think twice before visiting a doctor or getting prescriptions due to the cost involved.  Such people do not have the required money because they are paying for mortgages, light, heat and phones.  There is a big debate going on but I know the Government is committed to ensuring that people who deserve to have a medical card, need one and will not abuse it, will have one.<\/p><p>  The cost of private health insurance has been raised in this debate.  Like many other people, I have shopped around.  People must ask themselves whether they can afford a certain level of cover but it may still cost them approximately &euro;200 per month.  That amounts to &euro;2,400 annually, which I can afford for myself and my mother but it is becoming increasingly expensive.  Many people, both in and out of work, have had to forgo their medical insurance which is putting significant pressure on the system.  We need to look at that issue.  I ask people who are covered by the VHI, BUPA, Aviva, Quinn or any other insurance company to shop around.  If they do not do so they may become hostages to fortune.  It is nice to have the option to shop around.<\/p><p>  People are now monitoring how they heat their houses in order to save money.  They may heat one room instead of heating five or six unoccupied rooms.  We are now beginning to realise that heating costs hit our pockets.  I wish it were not so, but we must all look at this situation.<\/p><p>  I recently attended a meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in Donegal, the constituency of the Acting Chairman, Deputy McConalogue.  I asked where these woodchip fuel stoves have come from.  In every house, they are like a little baby in the corner and people say how fantastic it is.  However, these stoves have been available for the past 20 or 30 years in Germany and elsewhere in continental Europe.  Yet we are only embracing these concepts now because we thought that wood, turf and other fuels were free.  They are not free, however, because somebody must cut the turf. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100026#Y00200","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1363875000,"counter":282,"content":"<p>The Government will not let us cut turf any more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100026#Y00300","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1363875000,"counter":283,"content":"<p>There has been a lot of innuendo, as well as untruths, about what is happening with turf cutting.

Deputy McGrath should come down and he and I will talk about Roscommon hospital eventually.  I will take great pleasure in ensuring that patients in County Roscommon, as well as in Roscommon town, will be safer than was the case two years ago.

Moreover, one should remember there is in place both an air ambulance and paramedics.  Lives are being saved and that is what the Government will do.<\/p><p>  I will turn to a few other issues that have been discussed.  Many people have spoken of how the elderly must be protected.  I accept this and appreciate that Deputy Mattie McGrath has given me space to be heard because, while I digress a little, unfortunately what happens in respect of turf cutting, health and so on is there is absolute and complete hysteria.  Everyone can appear on local radio or in the newspapers and everyone can write a letter but, ultimately, I speak as a Government Deputy who must deliver patient safety and the future of health services in a county that is very annoyed, and rightly so, but the truth will win out.  The issue of fuel was mentioned and a few weeks ago I raised an issue in this House and around the country in respect of a European Union judgment pertaining to Irish pensioners living in Ireland who have a United Kingdom pension or who have some work-related link with the United Kingdom.  Any person who was born before 1 July 1951 is now entitled to claim for the United Kingdom's fuel allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100027#Z01500","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1363875600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>When is the closing date?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100027#Z01600","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1363875600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>The closing date is 31 March.  I have sent out tens of hundreds of applications.  I pay tribute to the Irish people who went to work in the United Kingdom.  I have taken great pleasure in sending such applications to people from Kerry, Donegal, Monaghan, Tipperary, Clare, Roscommon and nationwide.  These people were not afraid of work but went out and built up the United Kingdom and when they contact me, I send out the forms to them.  It is wonderful to encounter people who appreciate one is highlighting their ability to apply for a fuel allowance in the United Kingdom, which I believe to be worth up to &euro;300.  I am delighted to be able to highlight this anomaly and to be able to tell people they are entitled to apply for the United Kingdom's fuel allowance and am delighted they are so doing.  Once again, I am delighted with such appreciation from people who never sought anything over their lives.  They built up the United Kingdom, as well as this island of Ireland, they work for themselves and are delighted they are getting something back, which is nice.<\/p><p>  The Government is engaged in a stocktaking exercise and I have no doubt but that the Minister of State, Deputy White, is committed to this process.  Vulnerable elderly people over 70 should not be left without a medical card or a GP card.  Effectively, what went on heretofore was whatever one was having oneself.  As I noted, multimillionaires and multibillionaires were entitled to free medical cards, just as were people in receipt of pensions of &euro;170 per week.  That is inequitable and is unfair and I am confident the Minister of State will ensure this does not happen.<\/p><p>  Finally, there was something of a hoo-hah in the budget a few months ago regarding a reduction in the telephone budget.  Eircom and the other telephone service providers were able to provide telephone services for &euro;60 or &euro;70 because no one questioned it.  Now, however, Eircom has offered a new telephone service for &euro;19.99 per month.  There was no sign of such a service until this Administration decided not to give people money to give money to Eircom, the ESB or whatever.  The Government decided to give what it judged to be fair.  Eircom subsequently was in a position to reduce its charges and hopefully Bord G&aacute;is and all the other utilities will follow suit.  Once again, however, if the Government provides &euro;200, it is akin to negotiating with a builder when building a house.  During the good times, builders always used to ask how much was one's mortgage.  The builders then took away that mortgage, thereby obliging one to seek more money from the bank to pay for furniture and the garden.  Effectively, the current Government is asking the pertinent questions and is coming out with what it considers to be a reasonable amount.  It then is up to the utility companies to match that, which is what I believe has happened.  I wish the Minister of State well in respect of medical cards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100027#Z01700","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1363875600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I also am delighted to be in position to speak on this Bill.  Before he leaves the Chamber, I thank Deputy Feighan, for whom I have a lot of respect, and I am not scoring points with him at all.  I am familiar with the position regarding the hospital but he knows as well as do I that dealing with HSE officials and so on is extremely difficult.  One does not get proper information and all Members come under pressure.  In addition, Deputy Feighan made many valid points with which I agree completely.  Cards were given out willy-nilly like Christmas cards but people got gold cards for 20 years from the State body and from the Department.  Moreover, neither Deputy Feighan nor the Minister of State ever objected to it.  Consequently, everyone must take some share of the blame.  We all went mad and that was never right.  It was ludicrous that the Department was unable to conduct a proper assessment at the time and we now are paying the price for it.<\/p><p>  Before Deputy Feighan runs away, I was present on the day when the grey brigade came to the church down the road, whose name I cannot recall, during the lifetime of the previous Government.  I went there accompanying my good friend, the former Minister of State and Deputy, Se&aacute;n Connick, and we met extremely frustrated and annoyed people.  Moreover, I was out that evening, when the former Minister of State, M&aacute;ire Hoctor, was on the podium.

While one might suggest that I am negative and oppose many things, I do not oppose this measure.  I oppose many things the HSE does but in this case, I believe there must be a reason and it is necessary to cut our cloth according to our measure and, consequently, this issue must be examined.  However, doing it in a knee-jerk fashion, as was done that time in the budget, caused holy war - if Members will pardon the pun - in that church that day.  I never saw anything like it and it was quite frightening.  People became animated and upset and much unnecessary anxiety was caused.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge it was badly handled when the then Government announced people were obliged to give back the cards or they would be taken back.  People who had them in their wallets took them out and showed them to me.  They had these cards they had acquired from the State in their handbags and purses.  These were people who were over 70, who had paid taxes and had worked in Ireland and elsewhere to build up their economies and had been given this gold-plated card, as they called it.  Incidentally, I note the cards were even gold coloured.<\/p><p>They felt they had something, so where is the trust and the bond?  It was simply announced as part of the Budget Statement that they would be taken from them.  We calmed that situation down and produced new figures.<\/p><p> I still believe the threshold was quite high at &euro;700 for a single person and &euro;1,400 for a married couple, and I made that case at the time.  I know many working men and women, with perhaps three or four children or even more, who have an income of half that amount of money.  They might have nearly &euro;400 in disposable income, but they cannot get a medical card.  As everybody knows, children get sick and prescriptions are very expensive.  There was a total imbalance.  When we rowed back at that time under pressure we left the threshold too high.  I will be criticised for saying that.  There is no point in millionaires having a medical card.  They do not need it.<\/p><p> The general practitioners, GPs, must take a share of the blame as well.  I heard a GP speaking on the radio a couple of months ago about elements of the sick pay schemes.  The GPs will have to pony up and level with people.  They must tell them to stop coming into the surgery.  I do not mean this badly but I know people who go to mass in the morning, call to their GP, go to the chemist, buy their few groceries and then go home.  It is a type of social event.  That is happening.  They are lonely and isolated people.  The doctors should tell them to call once a fortnight or once a month, unless they are sick.  I have seen this happening.  We all do when we are out canvassing.  We call to the health centres and see what happens.  I am not saying those people are doing anything wrong.  They are entitled to do that, but what if they had to pay for it?  When a child is sick, my wife will ring the doctor.  She is a nurse, so she is better qualified than I am, but she will ring first because it costs &euro;50 or &euro;60 for a visit.  Then one has to wait to see the doctor, which is the most ironic part.  I have often rung on a Monday morning about a child who has been sick since Saturday or Sunday night only to be told to come in on the Tuesday morning at ten o'clock.  In the meantime, one has a screaming child.  That is the other aspect of this, when the doctor's office is full of people who do not need to be there.  The GPs have a big role to play in this.  With the roll-out of special centres for medical care, we will have to deal with this issue because it is unacceptable.<\/p><p> I have visited houses when canvassing, just as the Minister has.  I have often been brought into a kitchen or parlour where press after press, even cabinets for good delph and china, are full of tablets.  The tablets have been hoarded, unused, which is quite dangerous.  They should have been returned to the GP for charities or to be sent abroad if they are still safe for use.  They are dished out by the chemists when the Government is paying for them.  We must examine this very carefully.  We must be responsible about it but we must deal with it effectively.  I am disappointed, as is always the case with the Department of Health and the HSE, that there is very poor consultation with the stakeholders.<\/p><p> Deputy Feighan commented about telephones and units.  I was on the communications committee under the last Government.  ComReg has failed to stop the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is increasing charges.  Each time they sought an increase the regulator allowed it.  The savings should be made in that area.  Deputy Feighan said that Eircom has announced a package for &euro;19.99, but that is quite useless.  It is only for a limited number of local calls.  It is not the same as what people had previously.  Those companies' representatives should be called before us.  We are in a recession and we need them to decrease prices.  However, every time they ask for an increase from the regulator, or the supposed regulator, they get it, regardless of the amount they seek.  Bord G&aacute;is has secured several increases in the past 15 or 18 months, as has the ESB monopoly.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, the same will happen with An Bord Uisce.  As I have said previously, the only thing I like about that body is an t-ainm, An Bord Uisce.  &Uacute;s&aacute;idim beag&aacute;in&iacute;n Gaeilge agus t&aacute; Seachtain na Gaeilge ann anois.  Aside from that it means less empowerment of the people.  The Minister knows that as well as I do.  He and I have been in council offices looking for water connections for people and support for the many group schemes that pioneered water projects, before the councils took them over.  Many people have leakage problems and so forth and we are the go-between for them.  Once responsibility is given to An Bord Uisce, it will be like what happened with the HSE.  I am sorry but there will be no more accountability.  Bord G&aacute;is has handed over its own franchise for maintaining the gas service to Balfour Beatty.  Now there are problems with staff and the companies.  I do not mean to divert from the content of the Bill but that is a fact of life.<\/p><p> Bigger is not better.  We saw what happened with Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, this year.  It was an unholy mess.  When one looks at how county councils and vocational education committees dealt with grant applications, one can see that the entire system went off on a tangent, and there was no accountability for it.  There was also no understanding and, above all, no feelings for the people.<\/p><p> As previous speakers have said, people will get sick if they are cold in their houses, if they do not have security and if they are turning off security lights because of the cutback in the free scheme.  We thought we had a land of plenty and that the pot would never run dry.  However, it did and we must be responsible about it.  Many of these people are very frugal and responsible.  They might only have a single bar electric fire switched on.  They do not waste.  In fact, the schemes initiated by Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, are helpful in those cases for saving energy.  These people have worked and paid their way.  They should not be penalised for that.<\/p><p> The history of the medical card for people over 70 is a mess.  There is the cost of the medical cards for the over 70s and the type of medical cover provided.  Many speakers have referred to private health care.  I have a big family and the cost of mine is &euro;6,000 per year, but it provides less and less cover.  People are being forced out of private health care.  As I said this morning in the House, people with mortgages are now being told by the bankers to get rid of their health insurance, their second car, their Sky subscription, which I do not have, and their broadband.  What will they be left with?  We must be careful.  Then the health system is coming under more pressure because they are sick and going into hospital, thus clogging up the system.<\/p><p> There must be joined-up thinking here.  While we must deal with the issue there must be consultations with the stakeholders.  We must also have a tamer or more compassionate way of consulting and talking to people, rather than announcing this, that and the other and frightening them.  That is what happened in 2009 with that announcement in the budget and all hell broke loose.  Look at the anxiety that was caused.  After criticising them a short while ago for a very valid reason, I salute the GPs for continuing to supply the drugs and continuing their visits in that interregnum when there was a great deal of anxiety.<\/p><p> We must deal with the drug companies.  The pharmaceutical companies are among the best employers in Tipperary but we must deal with them effectively.  We are only skirting around the edges and tickling them.  There are vast profits in that sector and vast savings to be made.  That is what we must attend to first.  We must expose all the foreign trips by consultants and others promoting these drug companies.  Half of that money should be kept at home.  Cut the waste and give the services to the people.<\/p><p> The introduction of free GP care for all is another failed promise.  It has been slowed down by huge problems.  The introduction of universal health insurance is planned for 2016.  The Minister says it will effectively end the two-tier health system.  I do not think I or any of the other Members will be in the House when it happens.  It is not going to happen.  The financial situation will not allow it.  It is imaginative and ambitious but there are too many vested interests.  The biggest of them are the HSE and officialdom.<\/p><p> The Minister should cut out half of the baggage and red tape and deal with the issues effectively.  He must deal with the drug companies, their prices and the prices and charges of consultants.  What consultants are charging for any hospital procedure under the private health care system is just staggering.  I recognise the good work that is done in hospitals but the charges are staggering.  It is not a cash cow that can be milked over and over again.  The game is over and the sooner people see that, the better.<\/p><p> Reform is required because the evidence is that user fees are a barrier to accessing care at primary care level, thereby causing late detection of illness, poorer health outcomes and greater pressures on acute hospital long-term care systems.  The over-70s do not abuse the system and never have.  They never had much, lived frugally, worked hard, educated their children, paid their taxes and are law abiding people.  Age Action Ireland is one of the bigger representative groups.  The HSE and several other Departments are funding many of those organisations.  Look at the waste in that regard.  Some of them have little to do.  They set up offices with chief executives and a plethora of officials, but they are not serving on the ground.<\/p><p> I salute Muintir na T&iacute;re.  Why was it not consulted?  It was founded by the late Canon Hayes in County Tipperary more than 50 years ago and does tremendous work.<\/p><p>I served on its board for a number of years.  It works at the coalface with community alert and also did minor repair works and provided great value for money for people who received grants from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  During a blizzard two or three years ago, many of the organisations to which I referred, which had established helplines, were forced to refer callers to the Muintir na T&iacute;re helpline because they did not have staff to deal with problems.  Civil Defence, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and many general practitioners dealt with problems whereas the organisations in question, despite being relatively large, placing major advertisements and offering free telephone numbers, could not tell people which towns and villages were in the county, not to mention providing any other information.  Muintir na T&iacute;re and community alert have 1,700 local organisations.  I manned the former's helpline on the odd Saturday or Sunday for a short time and it was open for 24 hours per day.  It was ironic that callers were referred to this helpline by other organisations which did not answer calls 24 hours per day.  This is also the case in many other areas.  For example, it is not possible to contact a social worker from Friday evening until Monday morning, other than in exceptional cases.<\/p><p> We must examine where the funding is going in some of the organisations that are always consulted.  While they may have a large staff who enjoy good careers in a Dublin headquarters, they are not familiar with the facts on the ground, unlike Muintir na T&iacute;re.  As I stated, some of them were found out recently, which is no harm because they do not provide a service.  While these lobbyists tend to be represented at various round table discussions, including national wage negotiations, because they can surf the Internet and know how to be in the right places, they are not delivering services on the ground.  This issue must be examined to ensure money is allocated to the appropriate organisations.  We must not continue to waste money in many areas.<\/p><p> On the revised income limits, I ask people to be practical and honest.  Even in the rare cases where two parents are working, a family will find it difficult to survive on their take home pay after taxes, PRSI, pension levies and everything else have been deducted.  They face significant costs if a family member becomes sick, and many parents will not visit a doctor because they want to save money for their children.  That is the unfortunate reality.  For this reason, everybody must share the load.  I ask my colleagues to consider the proposal in a calm, cool and collected manner.  It does not involve a massive reduction in thresholds and must be viewed in the context of the unholy mess created in 2009.  Deputies should speak to community welfare officers because they know what is wrong in the system.  Joined-up thinking is needed and efforts must be made to eliminate some of the scandalous abuses in the community welfare system.  Any Deputy worth his or her salt will know what is taking place in his or her constituency because one can see prams that have been left outside health centres by people who have been given new ones.  The Minister of State and I must buy prams for our children and pass them on.  This is a racket involving reckless people and it should have been stopped long ago.  Given the waste that is evident in many areas, the elderly must be the last people to be touched.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy Frank Feighan for raising the position of those who receive the Queen's shilling - I term I used earlier to describe another group - because they worked in England and receive a British pension.  Two weeks ago, I listened to a discussion on a radio show.  People rang up to say time was running out to submit applications for an entitlement in Britain because the closing date for receipt of applications was 31 March.  People are not aware of this issue, especially older people.  I do not mean to imply older people are illiterate but many need help filling out the relevant forms because they can be intimidating.  I appeal to the Minister for Health to speak to his counterparts in the European Union to extend the deadline for the receipt of applications under the scheme to which Deputy Feighan referred.  People are not aware of it and I must admit I first heard about it on the radio recently.  The current pension arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom are reasonably effective.<\/p><p> Deputy Feighan also referred to turf cutting.  I was not taking a snipe at him earlier but turf is not only a source of heat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100027#Z02000","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363876800,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Turf cutting does not arise in this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100029#BB00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1363876800,"counter":309,"content":"<p>In my area, one would not go near the bog when the fog was low on the hill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100029#BB00300","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1363876800,"counter":310,"content":"<p>The Deputy will not go near it today either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100029#BB00400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1363876800,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Turf cutting was a pastime and saving the hay and going to the bog were summer activities.

It is important the legislation would address a number of anomalies.  However, a number of other anomalies which I will bring to the attention of the Minister of State are not addressed.  These gaps in the system deny people, especially people with incomes slightly above the threshold, the right to a medical card.  The working poor are highly aggrieved because they believe they are not entitled to anything but must pay for everything.  They are not entitled to a medical card or general practitioner visit card, while others, who have more disposable income and, in some cases, greater gross income, are legitimately entitled to a medical card under the current rules.<\/p><p>  I will provide one example of the type of an anomaly that affects older people.  The income limit for a medical card for an older couple aged more than 70 years is &euro;298 per week.  A couple who are in receipt of the maximum contributory old age pension, which is &euro;230 per week each, in addition to the half rate of carer's allowance, will have a total weekly income of &euro;562 per week.  A couple in this position will receive a medical card because all of their income comes from the social welfare system, even though it exceeds the &euro;298 income limit.  However, the position is different for a person with a similar income if part of it is provided by the social welfare system in the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>Since the pension is coming from the United Kingdom it is calculated as income and not disregarded, as it would be for an Irish social welfare recipient.  Such a person's income could be below the threshold and their sole income could be from social welfare but they are denied a medical card because some of the income comes from a contributory social welfare payment in another jurisdiction.  That anomaly probably contravenes EU law and needs to be clarified and addressed.<\/p><p> A more frustrating anomaly relates to the working poor in this country.  The purpose of family income supplement is to support low income families and encourage them to stay in work. The family income supplement element of their income is disregarded in the means test for the medical card but the supplement could push their total income over the income threshold and cause them to be denied the medical card.  Meanwhile, someone who is considerably over the income limit but whose income comes solely from social welfare will qualify.  The system is being turned on its head.  It penalises people who are in work in favour of others whose sole income comes from social welfare and discourages people who are on social welfare from going back into employment.  I accept that there is a transition period, the purpose of which is to iron out anomalies.  Nevertheless, consider two neighbours living side by side.  Both are on, pretty much, the same income but one gets up every morning and goes to work, if they are lucky enough to get employment, while the other does not even attempt to find employment.  What is the incentive to either of those neighbours to go to work?  They may get a few extra euro but they will lose their medical card in three years time, or the law could change in the intervening period.  The ethos of the medical card needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> Consider another example.  A single person in receipt of disability allowance of &euro;188 per week as well as the half-rate carer's allowance is entitled to a medical card.  Someone in employment and earning &euro;290 per week, which is less than the first person's income, is denied a medical card.  The system is wrong.  Some people who are just over the income threshold get nothing while others who are significantly over the income threshold, because their sole income is from social welfare, are entitled to a medical card.<\/p><p> I am also frustrated by the roundabout way we have doctored the income threshold for the medical card over the past number of years.  The income threshold has not increased but, because of budget changes, the cost of attending hospital has gone up and the payments people have to make until the drug refund scheme kicks in have increased.  The medical card system allows no formal recognition of that.  More and more people are being pushed into this poverty trap.  This needs to be addressed.  The Bill, while it deals with anomalies, does not deal with several genuine anomalies which incentivise people to give up employment and go into social welfare system.<\/p><p> When the Minister of State replies to the debate, I hope he will deal with the issue of granting only GP visit cards for the long-term illness scheme.  The original Government announcement was that those covered by the long-term illness scheme would receive medical cards.  That has been watered down and they are to receive doctor only, or GP visit, cards.  Can the Minister of State give us a timeline for that change?<\/p><p> When the Minister brings forward that legislation, I suggest that it be extended to other long-term illnesses, such as haemochromatosis, that are not now covered by the scheme.  Policy decisions were taken by a series of Governments not to entertain any extension of the long-term illness scheme.  Illnesses such as haemochromatosis should be included in the scheme.  This disease does not involve any additional costs, other than the out-patient charge, so sufferers would benefit from having the GP visit card.  They are a significant proportion of the population.  Other long-term illnesses, including colitis, have been mentioned by Deputies on this side of the House.  Recognition should be given to them.<\/p><p> The vast majority of children with life limiting conditions will never see their 15th or their 18th birthdays.  There is a small number of these children, approximately 1,500 per annum, and many are probably in receipt of the medical card, either on means grounds or because of their medical condition.  A small cohort do not have the medical card.  It would be some recognition of these families if they were included in the scheme.  I will raise this matter with the Minister when the legislation comes to the House in the next number of months.  This needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> A person who is aged 70 or over and is no longer within the income threshold can apply for the ordinary medical card.  Other issues, which are not taken into account for the over 70 medical card, will be considered.  However, the discretionary medical card, which traditionally was given in cases of medical hardship, has been greatly curtailed since the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, took over the provision of the service.  I have significant experience of such cases over a long number of years.  The HSE took a pragmatic approach to them and took into account the genuine costs involved in attending medical appointments and so forth.  It is now nearly impossible to get any movement from PCRS.  When we do get movement, in the vast majority of cases people are issued with a GP visit card rather than a medical card.  In many of these instances the additional hardship relates not just to medicines, but to frequent visits to hospital and to consultants in Galway or Dublin.  Additional financial costs are associated with that, especially since the withdrawal of transport support from the HSE.  The closure and downgrading of hospitals such as Roscommon County Hospital, is forcing more people to travel to avail of services.  <\/p><p> With regard to Roscommon County Hospital, I must dispute claims that Roscommon hospital is busier today than it ever was.  This is load of rubbish, as the mathematics show.  That is all I will say on that matter.  I do not want to get involved in that debate because it is not relevant to what is in front of us today.  <\/p><p> The discretionary medical card is, slowly and surely, being withdrawn.  Where there are cases of genuine need a GP visit card only is issued.  I ask the Minister of State to look at that situation.  Families who suffer significant financial hardship need a medical card.<\/p><p>In many cases, having free access to a general practitioner will not deal with their financial hardships in a substantial way.  It is probable that they also see a number of consultants, which incurs additional costs - consultants' fees, inpatient costs, transport, lost earnings, etc.<\/p><p> I hope that the Minister of State will consider my point on the long-term illness scheme.<\/p><p> A proposal has been put to the Minister regarding the establishment of a national fund for sick children with life-limiting conditions.  It would save money for the local offices of primary, community and continuing care, PCCC, services.  The HSE is spending approximately &euro;47,000 per annum per child through its various local offices.  This figure could be reduced by half if there was a national office to control services.  It would provide consistency in the provision of services for children with life-limiting conditions across the country.  In my county, a white line in the middle of the road is the provincial dividing line.  A child on one side gets access to a certain level of services while a child on the other side has a different entitlement.<\/p><p> I hope we can deal with the anomalies in the system across the country.  The primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in Dublin is doing so in respect of medical cards, but the same cannot be said for children with life-limiting conditions.  Everything depends on the local budget, the attitude of the local health office manager to a particular case and families' persistence in pushing their cases.  Sometimes, parents whose children are sick do not have enough energy or time to push as hard as they need to.  A child with a lower level of dependency can get a higher level of support purely because a family has access to someone who can do the pushing or who has the wherewithal to articulate their case well.  This is not right, particularly given our limited resources.<\/p><p> HSE offices spend approximately &euro;8.2 million per annum.  At a launch in the Mansion House on Monday of last week, however, it was estimated that a budget of &euro;5 million would provide the necessary services.  I have provided the details to the Minister for Health.  After today's debate, I will send a copy to the Minister of State, Deputy White.  By taking this service out of local offices and centralising it in Dublin, a significant amount would be saved and a better quality of service could be ensured for children, some of whom will live for a week, a month or one, two or three years.<\/p><p> As public representatives, each of us has encountered heart-wrenching cases.  We must roll up our sleeves and try to fight for them.  Deputy Connaughton has entered the Chamber.  He and I dealt with a case in which we wanted to get a child home before last Christmas.  A parent should not need to ask one, two or three public representatives to obtain these rights, particularly when the overall national pool of funding is adequate to deal with the issue.  How the money is distributed and the lack of consistency across the country seem to be causing problems.  I urge the Minister of State to consider this matter.<\/p><p> A further issue arises in respect of the analysis of this legislation, namely, the substantial number of older people who have private health insurance.  Many also possess the over-70s medical card.  At a time when the private health insurance system is haemorrhaging families - 64,000 people left last year and, according to a recent survey, one in three families plan to give up health insurance this year - it is bizarre that more older people are buying it for the first time.  If we keep going as we have been, those who can afford insurance - the wealthy - and those who cannot afford not to have it - the very sick - will be the only ones left in the system.  There has been a failure to recognise the crisis.  This trend will place an additional burden on the public health system, which is already creaking.<\/p><p> The problem is not the treatment that people receive once they enter the system.  Rather, the problem is accessing that treatment in the first place.  While it must be recognised and welcomed that waiting lists for inpatient procedures have shortened, the waiting lists for outpatient appointments have grown longer.  This crisis is worsening.  If we force people out of private health insurance and into this system, the problem will be compounded.<\/p><p> Will the Minister of State consider the legislation passed by the Houses in the early 2000s to introduce lifetime community rating?  It would be a step in the right direction and would provide young families and people with an incentive to join health insurance schemes for the first time instead of waiting until they are 55 or 60 years old, which is currently the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100029#BB01000","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363878000,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions on the Bill.  It has been an interesting debate.  The maintenance of health services is a priority for the Government in 2013 despite the undoubted need for significant and difficult financial savings to be made in the health sector.  It has been our intention that front-line health services be protected to the greatest extent possible.  None the less, as has been acknowledged, &euro;781 million in savings must be achieved in 2013.  This cannot be avoided.  The majority of the savings have been designed not to affect front-line activity.<\/p><p>  In the context of this Bill, it is vital that the key message I outlined yesterday be repeated: 95% of people above the age of 70 years will not be affected by the new arrangements.  With respect, this should provide a level of reassurance and comfort to the majority of people aged over 70 years.  We have also sought to minimise the impact on the 5% affected, who earn &euro;600 per week as individuals or &euro;1,200 as couples.  We will continue to ensure that they receive free GP services.<\/p><p>To be clear and so we understand precisely what we are debating - we can disagree on the merits of it - 5% of people will be affected.  The change is that people will lose access to a full medical card but they will all have a GP visit card to replace it.  All - not some - of the people who are above the new eligibility limits of &euro;600 for an individual and &euro;1,200 for a couple, respectively &ndash; we estimate there are 20,000 such people &ndash; will receive and have access to free GP services.  What they lose out on is the contribution to their drug costs, which they will no longer be able to access as they will not have a full medical card, but it will be capped at a level equivalent to &euro;36 per week under the drug payment scheme.  I do not seek to minimise the effect the change might have on some individuals and couples but I seek to remind the House of the precise and factual position of what is being done.  It does bear repeating and emphasising the relatively small number of people who are affected by the change and the fact that every single one of those people affected will have a free GP visit card.<\/p><p> Deputies Kelleher, &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and others advanced the argument that this change is inconsistent with Government policy in respect of universal free GP care.  That is not at all the case.  If I were to propose that individuals would lose access to free GP care and that we were taking something away in the Bill that we were proposing to make available in the universal GP visit card which we intend introducing &ndash; giving with one hand and taking away with the other &ndash; then there might be some merit to the argument but there is no merit to it because what we are doing is not inconsistent at all.  We are not removing the GP visit card from anyone.  The suggestion of Deputy Kelleher that what is intended is at variance with Government policy or inconsistent with it does not hold water.  That is the factual position.  Am I wrong in that?  It might be funny but it is correct<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100031#DD00200","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363878600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>With all respect to the Minister of State, he is seeking respect where there is none.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100032#EE00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1363878600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>Currently, 360,000 medical cards are issued to people over 70.  Therefore, medical card coverage of the over 70s population is approximately 97%.  In comparison, the medical card coverage of the under 70s population is approximately 35%.  As I outlined yesterday to Deputies, it is estimated that approximately 20,000 people will have their medical card replaced with a GP visit card.  That is the factual position.<\/p><p><br \/>  I wish to correct one or two issues so we are clear on what precisely is in the Bill rather than a particular take on it that Members might have unwittingly picked up.  Deputies Kelleher and Browne referred to section 7(5) which states: <blockquote>The Minister shall, on 1 September of every year, review the most recent information on the consumer price index made available by the Central Statistics Office, and may, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, by regulations to take effect on 1 January next following that review, increase or decrease the gross income limits specified for the purposes of this section to reflect any increase or decrease in that index.<\/blockquote>It is clear from the provision that the power given to the Minister to increase or decrease the limits by regulation is predicated entirely on the most recent information on the consumer price index, CPI, in any given year.  There is no right residing in the Minister, or any Minister from this side or the other side, on the basis of the legislation to introduce such change in a whimsical way or on some basis other than the CPI to change the income limits and eligibility.  That is a misreading of what the section says.  It is important that is placed on the record and that people are clear on precisely what is proposed.<\/p><p><br \/>  A number of Deputies referred to the savings that will arise from the changes.  One or more colleagues described it as nit-picking that &#8364;12 million would be saved in this year and &#8364;24 million in a full year.  I find such an argument difficult to understand.  Most of the individual savings that must be achieved across the board are relatively small amounts compared to the &#8364;780 million.  In other words, one is talking about &#8364;24 million, &#8364;30 million, &#8364;50 million, &#8364;10 million or &#8364;5 million.  It does not serve the House for us to say that because the saving is &#8220;only&#8221; &#8364;12 million in a year or &#8220;only&#8221; &#8364;24 million in a full year that it is nit-picking and that it can be set aside.  We cannot operate on that basis because the same argument could be made about every single element of the savings that, regrettably, have to be made.  There is not much point in dwelling on that argument because if that were the case then we would not be able to make any savings at all in the budget we must address.<\/p><p><br \/>  I agree with much of what has been said in the course of the debate.  Many of the issues Deputies raised do not directly relate to the provisions of the Bill.  Deputies made observations on the cost of drugs.  The point is well made and well taken that those issues must be addressed.  They are in fact being addressed by the Government in a number of different ways.<\/p><p><br \/>  There was much discussion about the general primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, approach to applications for medical cards, in particular discretionary medical cards.  Deputies asked me to address the issue.  Points were made about what happened historically.  The fact is that under our system medical cards are not awarded to any particular group of patients on the basis of a specific disease or condition.  That is not the position.  The Act of 1970, which is the legislation under which we have been operating since, including during Deputy Kelleher&#8217;s time, is the one which governs eligibility.  As everyone is aware, eligibility for health services in this country is based primarily on residency and in particular on means.  That is the basis upon which medical cards are granted.  The exception to that is a provision for discretion to grant a card in cases of undue hardship where the income guidelines are exceeded.  It is necessary that we have a system in place for that to be assessed, where a person comes forward in good faith who has a particular illness or condition and he or she wishes to make an application for a discretionary medical card.  We must have in place a transparent system we can all understand and that is properly administered by the PCRS.  That is what we have done.  In addition, we recently set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of those applications.  Deputies have raised issues about particular cases with which they have had to deal.  I am aware of such cases myself.  However, I am satisfied that the system is being administered in a sensitive, transparent and objective way.  If Deputies have any reason to believe that it is not the case I ask them, through you, a Cheann Comhairle, to bring it to my attention.  I refer for example to cases where appropriate sensitivity was not shown or where applications have in some way been improperly or unfairly examined.  That is something I would not wish to see happen.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to the discretionary medical card system there is also an emergency medical card process whereby if a person has become terminally ill a card can be issued within 24 hours in circumstances where someone is faced with such a tragic situation in his or her life.  That does happen and will continue to happen.  Currently, more than 62,000 discretionary medical cards are in operation in the State.<\/p><p><br \/>  I disagree flatly with the point made by Deputy Healy-Rae.  I have not disagreed as strongly with any other observations made.  He said he regrets the removal of the processing of medical cards from local offices to the PCRS.<\/p><p>I respectfully suggest that this has been a very important, successful and progressive move.  We previously had 100 local offices across the country processing applications for medical cards.  What we now have is a centralised system that provides enhanced service delivery to clients and ensures a consistent and equitable national assessment process that everybody can rely on.  Surely that is what we all want.  We want a system that is consistent, effective, efficient and transparent, and that is what we have now.  Ninety-five percent of medical card applications are now processed within 15 working days, which is a major achievement.  Deputies might say that should always have been the case, and I would not disagree, but at least we have achieved that in a relatively short period of time.  Before we centralised the medical card applications system, it was impossible to say how long it would take for an application to be processed.  Now we have both transparency and efficiency and we should welcome that.<\/p><p><br \/> On the issue of community welfare officers and the local input to which Deputy Healy Rae referred, it is true that CWOs no longer have a role in the medical card application process.  However, it is important to emphasise the fact that staff in local health offices continue to provide information and assistance to individuals in connection with their medical card applications.<\/p><p><br \/> We have had a very good Second Stage debate on this Bill and the contribution of Deputy Twomey, in particular, was excellent.  I agree with what he said about the need for a serious debate about issues such as universality and how we fund our health services.  I am strong believer, as is Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, in the principle of universality in the provision of health services.

I have no doubt in saying that given the manner in which it is run, its attention to patients and the quality of care delivered.  Recently it has been brought to the attention of people in the locality that there were changes in services at the hospital.  The reason I raise the issue is to get an assurance from the Minister of State on the future of the hospital and that it will stay in the town.  It is part of the infrastructure and has been in place for many years.  Many doctors, the late Dr. Willie Ryan and the present Dr. Willie Ryan, among others, were very committed, as are the staff and management, to developing and running the hospital.  <\/p><p> The hospital comprises St. Anthony's, St. Clare's and St. Michael's unit, all of which care for the elderly, people who have given long service to the community.  Given the proposed changes taking place the staff and the people of Tipperary are concerned that the future of St. Patrick's Hospital was at stake.  I seek that confirmation from the Minister of State.  I want an assurance on the future of the jobs at the hospital, those who work there, and all the services they have provided over many years and the back-up the hospital has provided to South Tipperary General Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel over many years.  <\/p><p> There is an historic High Court ruling about south Tipperary hospital services, of which St. Patrick's Hospital is a part.

It provides me with an opportunity to update the House on this matter.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy is aware, Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care, including the provision of financial assistance under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  In 2012, with a budget of almost &#8364;1 billion,<b><\/b>financial support was provided to over 22,000<b><\/b>people in nursing homes.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel, County Tipperary.  We are all conscious that these are challenging times for the Health Service Executive in respect of all services. In the case of community nursing units, these include challenges regarding staffing, funding and the age and structure of the units.  St. Patrick's Hospital, originally built in the 1800's has a bed complement of 134 beds comprising 95 long stay, 18 respite and 21 rehabilitation beds.  The hospital is registered with HIQA for a period of 3 years with effect from 28 June 2012.  HIQA inspection reports have identified the challenges posed by the design and layout of the premises in meeting the individual and collective needs of its residents.  Bearing this in mind, and with the aim of maintaining and developing the provision of older person's services in Cashel, the recently published HSE South Regional Service Plan 2013 features the proposed transfer of the respite and rehabilitation beds from St. Patrick's Hospital in Cashel to the adjacent vacant facilities at Our Lady's Hospital campus.  As the Deputy will be aware Our Lady's underwent a significant refurbishment to the value of &#8364;21 million,<b><\/b>completed in 2011.  While at present there are no inpatient services at the hospital, a number of day services are provided.  Having been refurbished to a very high standard, the hospital is not currently utilising capacity to optimum level but it has the potential to provide high quality facilities for short stay services.<\/p><p><br \/>  The main reason for undertaking the reorganisation of services is to facilitate the refurbishment of facilities within St. Patrick's Hospital. Following the transfer of respite and rehabilitation services to Our Lady's Hospital campus, a development plan will be prepared around the remaining long stay facilities at the hospital in order to support its re-registration with HIQA, which will be due in 2015.  I assure the Deputy this proposal will be worked through a consultation process with the staff and other relevant stakeholders of St. Patrick's Hospital over the coming period.  In this regard a project group has been convened, the inaugural meeting of which took place on 19<sup><\/sup>March 2013.  Membership of the project group comprises of representation from both HSE senior management and relevant staff.  I am pleased to confirm that the terms of reference and a schedule of weekly meetings were formally agreed and signed off at this meeting.  It is important to note that the proposed transfer of service will improve the facilities and the environment for patients of both facilities.  It also ensures the retention of a significant service in Cashel, consistent with the approach taken by the HSE South in relation to services for older people in its regional service plan.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am pleased to take this opportunity to reaffirm that St. Patrick's Hospital Cashel will continue to play a significant role in the provision of public services for older people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100036#JJ00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1363880700,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for placing on the record the fact that the future of St. Patrick's Hospital in Cashel is safe.

The Department has recently made strong progress in this area.  As the Minister of State is aware, three Educate Together secondary schools will open in the Dublin area in Hansfield, Lucan and Drogheda.  Each of those schools has different patronage arrangements but Educate Together will be involved in each of them.  As he is also aware, the Educate Together movement at primary level has been extremely successful.  Such schools are popular with parents and teachers and are delivering innovation in curricula and a new school environment which is having a very strong and beneficial effect on young boys and girls across the country.<\/p><p>In Dublin 1, 3, 7, 9 and 11 there is a very large number of very successful Educate Together primary schools.  As those students progress to secondary school, there is no Educate Together secondary school available in that part of the city that is capable of taking them in and allowing them to develop their education within that stream.  There is significant parental interest and support for this, as the Minister for Education and Skills is already aware.  I know he met representatives of the campaign group and signalled that he supports it in principle.  This has already been advanced for other schools in Dublin.  He asked that work be undertaken to assess the level of demand and what role the City of Dublin VEC could play.<\/p><p> I raise the matter because of the level of parental interest.  Even though the campaign is just beginning, it has already obtained 2,500 signatories.  Given their numbers we have a duty to parents to offer them a second level option that allows the excellence that has been delivered at primary level to be maintained.  It is in the interest of the parents and the students who decide to go to Educate Together schools.  I also believe it is in the interest of the overall educational system.  All our schools, regardless of their patronage, do a fine job at the moment in moulding young boys and girls and giving them the support they need.  Educate Together has brought something to the system that should be welcomed and supported.  Given the level of parental demand and interest, I ask that the Government respond to this and put together a plan to meet the need and provide a school in this part of the city.  Given the progress made to date elsewhere on this, I ask that the same level of support be given to this part of the city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100036#JJ00600","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1363881300,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  I thank the Deputy for raising it as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the provision of new post-primary schools.<\/p><p>  Our school-going population has increased significantly in recent years and is expected to continue to increase over the coming years.  It is anticipated that at post-primary level an additional 24,900 pupils will need school places by 2017 with a further 40,800 pupils needing places between 2017 and 2024, based on the Department's statistics.<\/p><p>  The figures I have outlined indicate the situation at national level.  The challenge for the Department is to establish in which locations the school-going cohort will increase most significantly so that sufficient school accommodation can be put in place to meet demand.  The Department is utilising a geographical information system, GIS, for this purpose.  The GIS utilises data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the General Register Office and the Department of Social Protection in addition to the Department's own databases and data from the local authorities.  The Department has carried out a study of the country to identify where there will be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post primary levels over the coming years.<\/p><p>  In June of 2011 the Minister announced that up to 40 new schools are to be established within the next six years to meet our increased demographics.  These consist of 20 new primary schools and 20 new post-primary schools.  This announcement did not include a proposal to establish a new post-primary school for Dublin 1, 3, 7 or 9.  The Minister also announced new arrangements for the recognition and determination of patronage of these new primary and post-primary schools.  The new arrangements published by the Department provide a balanced approach to allow applications to be made by prospective patrons for the establishment of schools.  The criteria used in deciding patronage of the new schools place a particular emphasis on parental demand for plurality and diversity of patronage.<\/p><p>  The Department's forward planning section will continue to monitor enrolments in this area to ensure there is sufficient post-primary school accommodation to meet any projected future demands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100037#KK00200","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speech","time":1363881300,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

Does the Minister of State envisage a review of the number of new schools due to be provided in the next six years to see whether it would be possible for new schools to be included and to ensure the plan remains valid?  While I accept demographics plays a key role, it is not just a question of demographics and the Department needs to make choices.  There is significant demand in this part of the city for such a school.  The total level of demand for second level schools remains unchanged.  However, within that demand a big shift is taking place at the moment.  I do not say that with any disrespect to or in criticism of the existing second level schools which are doing a great job.  However, within the level of demand the Department is tracking by enrolment, a fundamental shift is taking place regarding the kinds of second level schools parents want their children to attend.  If the Department recognises that it is right to have within these areas such a large number of Educate Together primary schools, the same logic would dictate there should also be at least one such secondary school available to those parents.<\/p><p>  I thank the Minister of State for the answer.  I will continue to pursue the point and I would appreciate a response to the two points I have made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100037#KK00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1363881300,"counter":352,"content":"<p>The Minister and the officials in the school building unit in preparing to publish the five year capital programme in 2011 carried out considerable and forensic analysis of that likely demographic challenge and where the numbers would create the most pressure in terms of school accommodation.  In certain communities that bubble or pressure was occurring at primary level and we have responded to that by putting in place plans to construct primary schools in those areas.  In other areas the demographic bubble had moved on to post-primary and again we have responded to that by providing for the construction of schools in those areas between 2011 and 2016.  As we come towards the end of that five year period we will carry out a similar analysis to address the next period, one would assume, from 2016 onwards and I understand much of that demographic analysis is under way.<\/p><p>  With the very limited resources available to the Department for school construction, the first challenge for Dublin 1, 3, 7 and 9 would be to establish that there is demand for a post-primary school over and above the existing provision.  Once that has been established, one would expect the issue of patronage would arise and, as requests for changes in patronage have dictated, there would be a survey of parents in the area to determine the likely patronage of such a school.<\/p><p>  My assessment of the response before me would be that we would not decide on the patronage without establishing an actual demographic need for a new post-primary school to service the area driven by population increase.  As the Deputy might concede, there are some parts of Dublin city where we are seeing either a levelling off or a reduction of population in some areas.  Whether the demographic need would arise for a new post-primary school in the area remains questionable.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's other suggestion is that we might divest the patronage of one school in the locality to another patron.  He might appreciate the challenges that might arise in such a scenario.  At this point, I concede there is a degree of uncertainty over the development of a post-primary school in Dublin 1, 3, 7 or 9.  We will certainly continue to engage with community representatives in the area, including the Deputy, and work as best we can to ensure, if and when that demographic challenge arises, we are ready and willing to meet that challenge in terms of school construction.  We are also more than willing to engage actively with the community to determine the patronage of such a school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100037#KK00400","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Industry","time":1363881900,"counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100038#LL00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1363881900,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, for taking this topical issue which relates to a matter in the constituency of Deputy Eoghan Murphy and myself.  I should point out that I have already raised this issue with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and have raised my concerns about the proposal with the ESB.<\/p><p>  Number Twenty Nine, Georgian House Museum, is located at the corner of Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Street.  It is currently ranked 14th of over 200 attractions in Dublin on the TripAdvisor website.  Current opening hours at the museum are excellent, it operates all year and provides, for a small fee of &euro;6, guided tours to tourists and citizens wishing to learn about Georgian household living in the late 19th century.  Visitor numbers at the museum rose by 10% in 2012 because of rather than despite the interactive guided tours.  The building was first occupied by Mrs Olivia Beatty, the widow of a prominent Dublin wine merchant.  A visit to the house gives young and old alike a chance to experience what life was like for the fortunate who lived in such elegant townhouses and the less fortunate who worked in them.<\/p><p>  The ESB has used the building since 1928.  The Minister of State will be aware that the controversial demolition in the 1960s of the Georgian street scape on Fitzwilliam Street for the ESB headquarters was a major loss to our built heritage in Dublin.  The ESB committed to restoration of Number Twenty Nine in the 1980s as a condition of the development of office blocks facing onto Baggott Street and James's Street East in the 1980s.  The exhibition is a partnership between the ESB and the National Museum of Ireland and has played an important role since 1991 in making more accessible the history of late Georgian Dublin.  Despite savings of &euro;250,000, the ESB wants to downgrade the museum to seasonal opening hours without guides, which would destroy the unique attraction.<\/p><p>  In the year of The Gathering, as we seek to improve our visitor offerings, it would be disastrous to cut opening hours from a six day, Tuesday to Sunday, 49 week interactive guided tour offering to an unguided five day, seven month, April to October, offering.  Many believe this will lead to eventual closure of the house.  For example, while March, owing to St. Patrick's Day, is one of our busiest times, the museum would under the ESB proposal be closed at that time next year when thousands of tourists would be in town.  The tour guides, who would lose their jobs under the current proposals, appreciate that the ESB must make savings and agreed in 2012 to a 5% pay cut.  While they have put a cost-saving proposal to the ESB, it has not been taken on board.<\/p><p>  It would be embarrassing to lose such a tourism gem over such a small saving.  I ask that the Minister liaise across Departments and the ESB to ensure the guided tours and opening hours are not lost.  Our climate does not encourage tourists.  This museum is an all-weather historical tourist attraction, which has been building in terms of attraction year on year.  The cost saving proposal put forward by the tour guides would achieve the savings required.  In this year of The Gathering, we must treasure these gems and build on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100038#LL00200","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1363881900,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I am taking this issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  I wish to advise the House at the outset that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has no responsibility in this matter.<\/p><p>  Number Twenty Nine, Fitzwilliam Street is a restored Georgian house which is run as a museum of Dublin home life in the period 1790 to 1820.  It is owned by the Electricity Supply Board and run by it in association with the National Museum of Ireland.  Issues relating to the opening hours of the venue or the provision of guided tours, are commercial considerations for the ESB and the Minister has no role in the matter.  The ESB, as a commercial entity, must organise its resources in the manner it considers appropriate.  It is hoped that it can continue to make this important museum as accessible as possible to visitors and Dubliners alike.<\/p><p>  Dublin has a comprehensive range of tourism product, including State assets such as the various branches of the National Museum, the National Gallery, Dublin Castle and Kilmainham Gaol.  There are also the long-established visitor attractions, such as the Book of Kells at Trinity College, Christchurch, the Chester Beatty Library and Malahide Castle.  In more recent times, Dublin has seen the growth of a range of new visitor attractions, such as the Guinness Storehouse and the Dublinia Viking Centre.  These attractions, old and new alike, draw hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.  That is not to say we are complacent about the tourism product in Dublin.  The Government, through F&aacute;ilte Ireland, has continued to invest in the improvement of Dublin's visitor attractions.  Last year, a redeveloped Malahide Castle was opened.  Approval has also been given for an investment to enhance the presentation of the Book of Kells at Trinity College.  To ensure that visitors really can get the maximum value from Dublin's tourism assets, a special walking trail is currently being developed through some of the top cultural and heritage sights of the city centre, running across the city from College Green to Kilmainham.  To be called &quot;The Dubline&quot;, it will give tourists greater accessibility to Dublin past and present. <\/p><p>  Dublin's location is also a natural advantage, which is now being fully utilised as a tourism asset.  As a coastal destination on the edge of the countryside, Dublin can be a city where visitors can engage in city-type activities such as museums and shopping or avail of an exciting array of water activities and outdoor pursuits in close proximity to the city.  We want to utilise Dublin's natural attractions and will be doing so by marketing the city as &quot;Dublin Plus&quot;, a city that is urban and rural and for night and day.  The role of technology is now of major importance in bringing a city to life for the modern visitor.  Last month, a new app was launched as part of the Discover Ireland campaign to enhance further the experience of those who come to Dublin.  The new app uses the latest in GPS and camera technology to allow tourists to become their own guide as they navigate the city's attractions.  In a further enhancement to the technology assets available to tourists, free Wifi connections are provided at our main tourism offices.<\/p><p>  All of the larger Dublin hotels have hosted a significant amount of North American business, with some hotels observing particularly strong levels of US visitors.  Across all hotels, there was a good, strong mix of increased domestic, Northern and UK visitors.  Many of the most popular hotels were at 100% occupancy, an increase on their 2012 performance, which was considered excellent at the time.  These figures indicate the strength of the Dublin tourism product and reflect the quality of the support being provided by Government to the tourism sector in the capital.  We look forward with great anticipation to a strong overall performance for tourism in Dublin for 2013, based on the quality and range of Dublin's visitor attractions and the continuing success of The Gathering Ireland initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100038#LL00300","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speech","time":1363881900,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response.

To downgrade Number Twenty Nine to an unguided attraction would be devastating.

It is a standard response, with little understanding of what tourism is about.  As I said earlier, the tour guides are prepared to make further sacrifices to ensure the financial viability of this museum.  Dublin is famous for its Georgian buildings.

This new approach is aimed at ensuring banks offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears by setting specific performance targets and proposing revisions to provisioning standards.  The Central Bank also proposes to update the CCMA so it continues to provide protection to customers who co-operate with their banks while facilitating and promoting the resolution of arrears cases.<\/p><p>  The consultation paper on the review of the CCMA includes a number of proposals intended to clarify and strengthen protections for borrowers.  These include clarifications of the definition of &quot;not co-operating&quot; to ensure lenders and borrowers know what type of engagement is expected; safeguards for borrowers, including specific requirements for interaction by lenders with borrowers classified as not co-operating; and a new requirement for lenders to draw up and implement a contact policy, to be approved at board level, which ensures unsolicited communications are not aggressive or intimidating, that borrowers are given sufficient breathing space following each unsolicited communication and that future contact is agreed in advance where possible.  Also included are increased provision of information requirements to ensure transparency on alternative repayment arrangements offered, including the reasons the alternative repayment arrangement offered is considered to be appropriate and sustainable for the borrower, the frequency with which the alternative repayment arrangement will be reviewed and the potential outcome of these reviews.  These provision of information requirements also cover the implications of options such as voluntary surrender or trading down for the borrower and his or her mortgage loan account, including associated costs or charges; how much, if any, of the outstanding arrears must be repaid; the impact on the borrower's credit rating; and the importance of seeking independent advice on these options.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that in determining whether a proposal constitutes a sustainable solution, the lender will need to evaluate actual and prospective affordability for the distressed borrower and the capital implications for the credit institutions in terms of their prudential responsibility in order to minimise losses.<\/p><p>  While the Central Bank does not mandate any particular model of restructuring and while sustainable solutions will be arrived at on a case-by-case basis, some fundamental principles must be respected.  These include an affordability assessment of the borrower based on his or her current and prospective future servicing capacity for all borrowings; a realistic valuation of the borrower's assets, particularly his or her property; and the use of an appropriate interest rate when discounting future income flows, which should take account of the lender's cost of funds.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that it will assess compliance with these principles in its supervisory audit of compliance with the targets, including through analysis of a sample of modifications.  Other initiatives which the Deputy will be aware of, such as the mortgage advisory function and the personal insolvency reforms, will also contribute to ensuring a fair balance in the interaction between distressed borrowers and lending institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100039#MM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1363882500,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The banks will now be judge, jury and executioner when it comes to dealing with the individual mortgage account of any family in the country.  When one looks at the requirement to put a sustainable solution in place, the bank will decide what the sustainable solution will be.  The definition requires that the bank be satisfied that the arrangement provides a sustainable solution.  The overall package, comprising the revised code of conduct and the legislation promised to reverse the Dunne judgment, and taking into account the banks' veto in the personal insolvency service, means the balance of power has shifted very firmly in favour of the banks compared to mortgage holders.<\/p><p>  The second part of my question relates to living expenses.  Reports in the media today state that minimum income guidelines will be issued by the new insolvency service and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, next week.  Will these guidelines also be used by the banks when they deal with individual mortgage holders or are they merely designed to deal with cases that go before the new insolvency service?

Although this is face-to-face informal contact, there is a code of conduct on contact developed by the Central Bank, which is now being modified.  The exchanges will be governed by this.

This is essential if they are to return to profitability, be in a position to support the economy and repay the State's investment through a return to private ownership.<\/p><p>  On behalf of the Government, I have now directed the banks to come up with plans as to how they intend to address this issue in a manner that can help meet the State's objectives.  I expect the value of those plans to mean a saving of between 6% and 10% of total remuneration costs through reductions in payroll and pension benefits, new working arrangements and structures that deliver efficiency gains.  In the circumstances, the Government has not focussed on individual salaries, employees' levels or specific measures.

This issue is one of the unforeseen consequences of the liquidation of IBRC or at least it was unforeseen on this side of the House, because Members were not aware of it in advance.  While this is not a disaster for the credit union sector as a whole, it is a significant issue for the credit unions affected.  The Minister has confirmed the involvement of up to 16 credit unions with investments totalling approximately &euro;15 million.  Under the deposit guarantee scheme, such credit unions will get back up to &euro;100,000 each and consequently, the credit union sector faces net losses of &euro;13 million to &euro;14 million as a result of the liquidation.  They consider themselves very hard done by and they have a legitimate case.  Essentially, these were deposits in a State-owned bank and the liquidation of that bank and the losses thereby imposed resulted from a policy intervention by the Government.  As the Minister is aware, virtually all other deposits in IBRC were transferred to AIB prior to the liquidation of the bank.  I should point out that many individuals also invested in this product.  Two cases have been brought to my attention.  The first concerned a widow who deposited &euro;200,000, of which she will now lose &euro;100,000.

It was called the Anglo Irish Bank Credit Union Bond 2005 and my understanding of this bond is that it was an equity-linked bond, marketed exclusively to credit unions by Anglo Irish Bank private bankers in 2005.  This bond was never covered by the eligible liabilities guarantee.  It was linked to the performance of the Euro Stoxx 50 index and as outlined in the prospectus, in the event of Anglo defaulting, the investors' capital will not be guaranteed.  The bond offered annual liquidity, that is, it could be cashed in once a year over its eight-year term.  I do not understand, when the State moved out virtually all deposits, the reason credit unions stayed in, when the prospectus has stated that in the event of Anglo defaulting, the investors' capital would not be guaranteed, when they were not locked in and when they had the option of getting out each year on an annual basis.<\/p><p>  That said, to answer the Deputy's questions, in the first instance, &euro;100,000 is safe.  Second, they will join their place in the queue with other creditors to share any residue.

The Central Bank will also, over the coming period, set targets for the conclusion of durable solutions and for the sustainability of such solutions.  The targets should provide a better measure of progress on a more consistent basis and promote a movement away from temporary forbearance measures which are not sustainable in the long term.  In addition, the banks will also be set specific, non-public, targets, principally relating to handling of early arrears cases.  The Central Bank is working with individual institutions to incorporate these measures which will be set in line with each institution's capacity, processes and systems.  These targets will be adjusted quarterly to ensure they are ambitious.<\/p><p>  The banks will be required to publish their performance against the targets for the year end December 2013 and make quarterly reports to the Central Bank.  Banks are also required to make regular returns to the Central Bank on their performance against targets.  The Central Bank will consider each bank's performance against the targets, including assessing whether sustainable solutions have been offered to customers.<\/p><p>  Separately from this Central Bank action, the new personal insolvency system, in particular the new resolution frameworks provided for in the Personal Insolvency Act, will also shortly be available to borrowers who are in significant difficulty in their mortgage repayments.  Utilising this process, the borrower will be in a position to consult an independent personal insolvency practitioner and where necessary to make a formal and realistic personal insolvency arrangement proposal to all eligible creditors, including a mortgage lender.  In such a situation the creditors will be obliged to consider formally and vote on the arrangement as proposed by the debtor.  In the event of a refusal by creditors, the debtor will also have access to the reformed bankruptcy framework, which has significantly reduced the automatic discharge period to three years.  I also remind the Deputy that, under the mortgage advisory service developed by the Department of Social Protection, independent financial advice is available to borrowers who have been offered a long-term forbearance option by the lender and a panel of 2,000 to 2,500 qualified accountants is now in place to provide this service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100042#PP00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1363884300,"counter":401,"content":"<p>The mortgage crisis and the approach that has been taken to it for the last number of years were not created by the Minister.

However, all the evidence points to the fact that the banks will do the bare minimum.  We own AIB.

As I said to Deputy Michael McGrath earlier, the Central Bank will sample the restructured cases to ensure the system is operating satisfactorily.  In addition, under the independent Insolvency Service of Ireland other arrangements will be made.  On the one hand there is the independent Central Bank quantifying what needs to be done, setting that against a timeline and monitoring it as it proceeds.  On the other hand there is an independent insolvency agency under the direction of the insolvency director which has a more formal process.  In both cases, there are two independent agencies doing this work.  The piece that does not match the Deputy's requirements is that they do not impose solutions.

The problem is that while it is good that the Central Bank is looking at the banks and will study what they do, the banks have basically refused to listen to the Minister, other Ministers and the Central Bank for the last two years.  They have not dealt with this crisis.  The only thing the Central Bank can do, if it finds after studying their documents that the banks have not done this, is make them make provisions against the loans, and the State-owned banks have already been recapitalised to make those provisions.

My understanding of what he said was that for those who will enter restructuring, the bank will look at the long-term gain for all the different options that are available.  However, where the value that the bank can get back in the restructuring is less than the current value of the home, the bank will look at repossessing the home.  That is a very dangerous situation.  Basically, Matthew Elderfield referred to what is more beneficial for the bank in the long term.  If somebody has a mortgage of &euro;400,000 and the current market value of the house is &euro;200,000, and the bank comes to the realisation that the most it can get back from the individual is &euro;180,000 with all the different restructuring instruments it has available, it is beneficial for the bank to repossess because it can make &euro;20,000 profit.  However, that is not something we should countenance.  I was alarmed when Matthew Elderfield said that.  Will the Minister comment on that?

At the end of December, for example, there was a total stock of 79,852 mortgage accounts that were categorised as restructured.  Of these restructured accounts, 42,037 were not in arrears.<\/p><p>The arrangement appears to have been sustainable for one half of them and unsustainable for the other half given that half of them were in arrears again.<\/p><p> Of the restructured accounts, 37% are on interest only arrangements and a further 17,000 mortgages are on payments that are greater than interest only, in other words, interest plus some capital.  What we want are arrangements that are sustainable.  When someone enters into an arrangement, the matter should be done and dusted and the person should be able to move on, provided there is no dramatic change in his or her income.  Obviously, the arrangement will change if somebody wins the lottery or an unemployed partner returns to work.

The Government is very aware of the significant difficulties some home owners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations and it has put in place a comprehensive strategy to address the arrears problem with the objective of, where possible, to allow people remain in their home.<\/p><p>  A key element in this is real and effective engagement by lenders with their mortgage customers in arrears.  As the Deputy will be aware, last week the Central Bank announced new measures to require the main banks to offer and conclude sustainable solutions tailored to individual cases.  The range of solutions that can be deployed include the standard forbearance arrangements that are already used but can also extend to the more in depth restructuring arrangements as suggested in the Keane report.  The Central Bank has set out specific performance targets for the number of durable solutions to be proposed by banks and will over time set targets for the conclusion and durability of such arrangements.  This is a very important and necessary development in the ongoing engagement the Central Bank has with banks on their mortgage arrears resolution strategies.<\/p><p>  It has to be accepted, however, that it will not be possible in all cases for people with the most distressed mortgages to retain an ownership interest in their home.  This will not necessarily mean they will have to leave the home.  The mortgage to rent scheme is available to assist families who would be eligible for social housing, and whose house is suitable for that purpose, to remain in their home.  However, to be eligible for this the borrower would have to be in close contact with the lender under the mortgage arrears resolution process and his or her mortgage would have to be deemed to have been unsustainable in that process.<\/p><p>  Personal insolvency reform was also identified by the Keane report as a key measure in addressing the mortgage arrears problem.  The new Personal Insolvency Act has been put in place.  In the context of the personal insolvency arrangement framework, which is the specific framework put in place by that Act to deal with unsustainable secured debt, there are certain criteria and factors that will have to be taken into account when the principal private residence is being considered.  A very important factor is the onus that will be on the personal insolvency practitioner to, in so far as is reasonably practicable, formulate a proposal that will not require a person to dispose of an interest in or cease to occupy their primary home.<\/p><p>  Also, as the Deputy will be aware, an extensive information and advice service has been put in place to assist mortgage holders, in particular when the person is considering a long-term forbearance offer from their lender.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100043#QQ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1363884900,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

People are not being given proper reasons for being deemed ineligible for a split mortgage.

The deleveraging programme set out in the financial measures programme in 2011 was an integral part of this process.  By reducing the size of the banking system, deleveraging was intended to reduce bank reliance on wholesale and central bank funding and so help to create a clean, appropriately sized banking system able to provide new lending necessary to support economic activity in Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  Specifically, the deleveraging plans agreed under the financial measures programme aimed to put in place credible, workable plans for the disposal and run-off of non-core assets to enable each bank to achieve a target loan to deposit ratio of 122.5% by the end of 2013.  In order to protect the domestic economy, deleveraging was to focus on non-core assets consisting largely of international loan assets across a number of portfolios in the UK, the US and Europe and not required to service the retail, SME and corporate banking requirements of the Irish economy.  The deleveraging plans also sought to pace asset disposals appropriately, in order to avoid excessive capital losses.<\/p><p><br \/>  To date significant progress has been made. As outlined in the recently published Department of Finance annual review, both Bank of Ireland and AIB are currently on track to achieve their year-end 2013 deleveraging targets.  PTSB&#8217;s programme has been largely postponed pending the EC&#8217;s decision on its restructuring plan.  Total deleveraging achieved across AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB was &#8364;57 billion as at 31 December 2012.  Deleveraging to date has been achieved within assumed discounts avoiding fire sales as planned.  Remaining deleveraging is anticipated to be achieved through run-down and work-out of non-core loan books over time.  I should stress that the asset disposal programmes at AIB and Bank of Ireland have largely completed.<\/p><p><i>  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>Given the progress made to date by AIB and Bank of Ireland, the fact that the majority of non-core assets are not Irish assets and the fact that their asset disposal programmes have largely completed, I am comfortable that the completion of these plans is not constraining the amount of new lending available in the market.<\/p><p><br \/>  In order to further minimise risks to domestic lending arising from the bank&#8217;s deleveraging programmes, further refinements to the deleveraging framework were agreed with the troika towards the end of last year.  It was considered that the loan to deposit ratio metric had served its purpose in terms of driving non-core deleveraging and remaining deleveraging would be best achieved by a specific quantum of non-core deleverage requirement.  This resulted in the  banks&#8217; deleveraging being assessed based on the existing nominal targets for disposal and run-off of non-core assets in line with the 2011 financial measures programme.  This ensures excessive deleveraging of core portfolios is avoided so as not to impair the flow of credit to the domestic economy and also removed any unintended distortion to the deposit market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100044#RR00200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1363885500,"counter":423,"content":"<p>The essence of this question is credit.  As we know, the banks are deleveraging through the sale of their portfolios of loan assets, mainly abroad, and also by not giving out new credit.  Last year, the Government set targets for credit given by the pillar banks to the SME sector.  The banks say, and the Credit Review Office confirms, that they gave out &euro;8 billion of lending last year to SMEs of which &euro;2.5 billion was new lending to the SME sector.  That same sector repaid &euro;4.5 billion to the banks over the course of last year.  Therefore, the amount of credit in circulation among SMEs last year contracted by &euro;2 billion.  Part of the reason for that, and for the banks' lack of risk appetite, is that they are striving to meet targets.  They are rebuilding their balance sheets.  That needs to happen.  We all acknowledge that deleveraging is a requirement and that the banks need to shrink their exposure.  It is, however, having an impact on the economy.  The overall GDP figure for last year was quite positive, at almost 1%.  The third quarter, Q3, figure showed negative growth and the fourth quarter, Q4, was absolutely flat.  Part of the reason the economy is not doing better is that credit is still the main issue.<\/p><p>  The banks are ahead of target in achieving these requirements.

The Credit Review Office, CRO, has supported this contention.  Lending targets are imposed on the banks.  They must submit their lending plans to the Department of Finance and to the CRO at the beginning of each year.  They must outline how they intend to achieve their lending targets.  They also meet with the Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.

This method can typically reduce the highest radon concentrations by 90%.  An alternative approach is to increase indoor ventilation.  This can reduce radon levels by up to 50% and is thus suitable for homes with up to twice the national reference level.

For example, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, published SI 91 on unfinished estates.  In the whole of the four Dublin local authority areas, he categorised just a single estate as being exempted from the property tax, namely, Priory Hall.<\/p><p>  Many of the Minister's Deputies, who were sitting behind him until a few minutes ago, are very disappointed that the property tax grotesquely impinges on the east Leinster area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100045#SS00900","speaker":"1020"},{"type":"speech","time":1363886100,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I want to call the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032100045#SS01000","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1363886100,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Is this not one of the problems?

If the valuation is in its opinion honest, it will be accepted.  Obviously, if an estate is one in which pyrite is present in many of the houses and that reduces the value even of houses that do not have a pyrite problem, that seems to be reasonable when one puts in a value.  If any question arises, an explanation would be required.  It is the same as what I said previously about houses that are subject to flooding that cannot get insurance.  While they might be lovely houses to look at, they have a very low market value.  The value that goes into the return is the honest opinion of what is the market value.  It is only if it is totally out of line with everything else that Revenue will check it out.  That is the position.
