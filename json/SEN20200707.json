We need to be very cautious and to keep the impact of these decisions under review.<\/p> <p>I note that, as was mentioned by the previous speaker, we have an awful lot of very important work to do.  The fact that this pandemic and crisis are under way means that we have more work to do and that we have to pay more attention to what we do.  The work of the Seanad is extremely important in that regard.  It is important that each of us hold to full and appropriate scrutiny all legislation and all issues relating to Covid.  <\/p> <p>In that regard, I notice that in the Order of Business, the Leader has suggested that we start the day with the Order of Business.  This follows a proposal from last week's Order of Business that Commencement matter debates be discontinued.  Commencement matter debates are the mechanism by which we, as Senators, can hold Ministers to account on specific issues of concern.  I hope the Leader will assure the House that, if formal Commencement matter debates are not to take place for the next few weeks and if we are not to have the resource of parliamentary questions available to those in the other House, mechanisms will be put in place to assure us, as Senators and public representatives, that we will be able to get answers to crucial questions.  During this four-month period, many of us have been writing about key issues of policy.  For example, I have been writing about the availability of personal protection equipment for those in the community and voluntary sector, the provision of public sanitary facilities and the rotation schedules for hospital workers.

One of the glaring issues about the Covid-19 crisis, and preceding crises, has been the merit in the assertion that we work best when we work collaboratively together, and when we take a united and joined-up approach.<\/p> <p>Given its presence in the programme for Government, I ask for a debate on the shared island element as soon as possible.  I will not reiterate the points that were justifiably and understandably made last week about Seanad appointments and certain absences from those appointments.  However, we are where we are and I accept that we have to move on as a Chamber.  The programme for Government, as outlined, allows us the opportunity to discuss what exactly a shared island - a shared Ireland - will mean for us and I do not think we should shy away from that.  One of the great strengths of the Seanad as an institution is that it allows this Oireachtas to become nicely representative, to become reflective of people from right across all of our 32 counties and if we so choose, from beyond, including the very important and vital global diaspora.  In that spirit, I also call on the Taoiseach in particular, in addition to the Minister of State with responsibility for local government - I forget the exact title - to provide for a discussion on the much-promised referendum on the extension of presidential election voting rights to citizens outside the State.  To be fair to Ministers and their officials in the previous Government, a lot of work had gone into it, in terms of options papers and looking at best practice from other jurisdictions around the world.  It is something a vast range of political parties state is their party policy.  It is also something the Constitutional Convention in 2014 voted overwhelmingly in favour of, so I think it is now time for the Government to focus on setting a date.  We need to now see that in the spirit of a shared island and of the new political and societal realities that we show citizens we value them by entrusting them with this important franchise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020070700002#C00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1594128600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>For the benefit of the leaders, the bell is going at 30 seconds to three minutes, just so speakers know they are not actually running over time.

We are a group that is 80% women, four out of five, so I am delighted about that.  This is a Seanad that is 40% women.  That is something that is worth stating and being proud of because the D&aacute;il remains stubbornly unrepresentative of women, with only 22% of Deputies being women.

This is something the Seanad can lead on.

A grand coalition, as this one is, poses challenges to us as the people in opposition.  We are now more in demand and we have the important job of scrutinising every single line of every piece of legislation.<\/p> <p>I, too, wish to raise the issue of direct provision.  I do not know if anyone had an opportunity this morning to listen to the Ombudsman for Children or read the newspapers to hear or read the harrowing commentary from a survey that was conducted by people who live in direct provision.  We are dealing with issues of widespread racism, bullying and exclusion being experienced by children who live in direct provision.  In today's article and report, children were quoted as being called a \"Black monkey\", \"a chocolate\" and \"a terrorist\".  People might say that is all very well, but it is very hard to take as a child when the first contact one has with an awareness of the colour of one's skin is a negative one, or when one receives negative commentary.  That poses many challenges for many people.<\/p> <p>Recently, in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, I attended a gathering where I heard at first hand from many families, and their children, of their personal experiences of living in direct provision.  I spoke to a member of the Movement for Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI, who spoke about how they ran away from their homeland but asked where did they run to.  They feel they have been imprisoned and entrapped, with no one to turn to and no one who values them.  That is not everyone's view but it is the experience of many people.  There is also the lack of respect for the rights of children who are trapped in our direct provision system.  Families are forced to share rooms with people who are strangers they know nothing about.<\/p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste, and former Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, recently said \"we do not need to look across the Atlantic to find racism [because we] have many examples in our own country\", which is really true.  Direct provision is a profoundly racist system that violates basic human rights.  Direct provision has a negative impact on the healthcare outcomes of families, of people, and particularly of children.  The system of direct provision undermines people's values and harms the most vulnerable, which is an issue we need to address.  The neglect and institutionalisation of disliked people in Irish society is not new to us all, and we can go on at great length in relation to that.<\/p> <p>We need to work towards the abolition of direct provision, which I note is promised in the programme for Government.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is charged with a special Ministry to deal with direct provision, children, equality and integration.

The cost of these licences is significant to a local group, be it a GAA club, soccer club or any community organisation, with a renewal cost in excess of &euro;500.  This is a huge amount of money to a local GAA club or a community group that has been stood down since the outbreak of Covid and whose activity has been completely thwarted as a result.  On foot of current indications that large gatherings will not happen for the remainder of this year, these GAA clubs and community organisations will have had no benefit whatsoever from the fee they paid for their licences.

A minimal number of cars were accessing the park through the Castleknock and Parkgate Street entrances.  The peripheral gates and car parks were closed.  The natural landscape was reclaimed and cyclists and pedestrians were prioritised.  It showed us that we have been getting the balance wrong in the Phoenix Park.  I also think the Office of Public Works , OPW, is not getting it all right at present either.  The traffic has returned to 75% of where it was and there is worrying congestion on the roads around the park, creating long tailbacks in the surrounding areas.  It can take an hour to get from one end of the park to the other.  People who depend on access to the park have been affected, such as the Phoenix Park school, Ashtown Stables, zoo goers, employees at Garda headquarters and visitors who use the park as an amenity.  Businesses in the area, which have just reopened, have also been adversely affected.  The OPW has announced it will maintain the closure of the gates and it has also signalled there will be further measures to address traffic volumes inside the park but there has not been any proper consultation on it.

Overnight they wrote to workers offering redundancies, reduced numbers and terms of sabbatical from work.  This kind of approach is not what is needed.  It was recognised that the Covid crisis would have a negative impact on all sectors of the economy, and the Government appealed to companies right across the board to try to work together to hold employees within their embrace until we got to the other side of this.  We will get to the other side of the fallout from Covid but we cannot do so on the shoulders or the heads of workers, or by trampling on the hopes of workforces throughout the country.

It is Ireland's most densely populated region, with one in three people under the age of 25.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John McGahon:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->By developing the north-east region further, we are hugely reducing the number of people commuting to and working in Dublin.  At present 77,000 people travel down the M1, M2 and M3 to commute to Dublin and I firmly believe that we need to try to reduce that number and to attract people further into our regions through jobs and investments.<\/p><p>There are three basic things we need to do in this region.  The first one is to attract new greenfield foreign direct investment.  The second thing we need to do is to have a second-site location.  A second-site location is where a multinational which is already present in Ireland obtains a second site which it can move into and create further employment in that area.  The third thing is very important because this area is right there on the front lines of the Border and Brexit.  We have to make a real effort to try to attract businesses from Northern Ireland and the UK which may want to have a base within the EU to set up in the area.  It would be timely if we asked the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to come to this House in the next couple of weeks to debate his plans for the M1 corridor and how he is going to bring jobs, investment and growth to every region of Ireland.  I would very much appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020070700002#F00400","speaker":"1670","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1594128600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I support Senator Dooley&rsquo;s call for a debate on Shannon Airport.  The experiment of an independent Shannon Airport has failed miserably and we urgently need that debate before any further attacks on the terms and conditions of the workers in Shannon Airport.<\/p> <p>Today I want to call for a debate on the pay and conditions of our front-line workers.  We have seen tremendous support and recognition of their work but I have to ask how much this Government really values the work of these front-line workers.  I could give any number of examples but I will give the example of contract cleaners who put their lives on the line each day.  Indeed, one contract cleaner in a hospital lost his life during this crisis.  We have hundreds of contract cleaners supporting the health service across the country.  They are paid the princely sum of &euro;10.80 an hour.  Imagine putting one&rsquo;s life on the line each day for &euro;10.80.  They were promised under a new employment regulation order an increase to &euro;11.20 but that was then withdrawn by the Irish Contract Cleaning Association.   The Irish contract cleaning companies were too concerned about their profits to worry about what a contract cleaner in a hospital should earn.<\/p> <p>I want to put down a challenge to this Government.  Let us judge this Government by the difference it makes to our front-line workers not just in terms of applause but in terms of pay, recognition and decency in their terms and conditions at work.  If any of the fine words we have heard from all sides in this Chamber mean anything, then we will change those terms and conditions.  Why on earth are we outsourcing contract cleaners in our hospitals?  When we tried to insource contract cleaners through my union, SIPTU, in Limerick a couple of years ago, conditions and standards improved dramatically.  What happened?  The HSE intervened.  It said it was against its policy and that its policy was to outsource, not to insource.  It is high time we got rid of these old-fashioned, failed Thatcherite notions and, more important, began to come up with real solutions to make sure that every front-line worker receives decent pay and conditions.  Let us have that debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020070700002#G00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1594128600,"counter":34,"content":"<p>The issue I would like to raise today is in some ways a follow-on from what the previous speaker said.  It is the issue of maternity leave for workers who have become new parents during the coronavirus crisis.  In particular, I wish to bring the House&rsquo;s attention the campaign which calls for a temporary three-month extension of maternity leave for those workers who have become new parents.  Many Members of the House supported the campaign outside the gates of Leinster House today.  As a parent of three children, my experience was that at the time of becoming a parent, one is at one&rsquo;s most vulnerable but is being given the greatest responsibility.  It is a very special time.  The coronavirus has had an enormous impact on people of all ages, including the elderly and teenagers, but it has been incredibly disruptive to new parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020070700002#G00300","speaker":"1656"}]
