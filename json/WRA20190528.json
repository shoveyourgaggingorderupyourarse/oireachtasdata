Maintaining consistent high standards in residential care is a challenge across many jurisdictions where the work involves caring for adolescents, many with traumatic histories, complex behaviour and ambivalence about their placement.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Residential care is a small, but vital part of our care system and the basis for successful outcomes for the young people relies on the experience,\u00a0quality and resilience of the management and staff group. <\/p>  <p>  Approximately 6 % of children in care - 376 at the end of February - live in residential settings, and 238 of these children live in privately managed centres commissioned by Tusla. Included in this number are older teenage separated children seeking asylum or those received in care from the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Residential settings care for a very small number of children, often two or three. Some are single occupancy, where the largest\u00a0 centres for separated children have, on average, six young people.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  All centres are inspected against\u00a0the relevant standards and regulations and additionally Tulsa registers private centres.

Over the past four budgets however, we have increased investment substantially. It has risen from &euro;260 to &euro;575 million. This significant increase in investment has assisted with an unprecedented doubling of capacity in the sector from 103,000 places in 2014, to 214,000 places in 2018. The average service has grown from 33 places to 44 places.<\/p>  <p>  A key priority for me as Minister has been to support the early learning and care and school age childcare sector through the provision of capital funding, where it is most needed.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In 2019, I secured a Capital budget of &euro;9.6m for the sector which enables a focus on increasing the number of places available, and supporting services to get ready for the forthcoming National Childcare Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  This capital funding is expected to produce approximately 1,300 new 0-3 spaces and 2,300 new school age childcare places this year.

This will enable building to begin over the summer and the places to be available before the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan published in 2018, I ensured that Childcare was identified as a strategic priority and I secured &euro;250 million in additional funding for the expansion of high quality services.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I want to expand opportunities in the childminding sector.

However, in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, I have made a commitment to reviewing such needs in due course.\u00a0 It is important however that in the first instance my Department completes the planned three year evaluation of the AIM programme and that we apply any learning from it to the development of new policy and service provision.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies may be aware that AIM - the Access and Inclusion Model - provides both universal and targeted supports for the meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE pre-school programme.

There is no provision for a third year which may not be in the best interests of a child, and could have the capacity to lead to breaching the statutory school starting age. <\/p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010.\u00a0 At that time ECCE operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.\u00a0 For some children with special\/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so therefore an allowance was made. Their one year ECCE place was split over two years, e.g. a child may have availed of three days ECCE provision in year one and two days in year two. In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been overage for ECCE in the latter year, an overage exemption was granted.\u00a0 It is important to note that this provision of an overage exemption by my Department for the ECCE programme was never intended as a mechanism to delay a child&rsquo;s entry to primary education or to address any issue of non-availability of a school place. In the past, the operation of the system of overage exemption has caused confusion where some parents and providers have mistakenly assumed that an overage exemption approval from the DCYA represented derogation from age requirements attaching to the statutory requirement that a child attend primary school before the age of 6 years.<\/p>  <p>  The application process for an exemption from the upper age limit for the ECCE programme was introduced within a context where:<\/p>  <p>  - The ECCE programme was for a year only; and<\/p>  <p>  - The Access and Inclusions Model (AIM) did not exist.<\/p>  <p>  Given the extension of the ECCE programme in 2016\/2017, the further extension of the programme to two full years from September 2018, and the introduction of AIM in June 2016, the rationale underpinning the policy intent of the system of overage exemption came under review as the initial premise for the provision of an exemption might have been considered to be no longer valid, i.e. an overage exemption as originally designed allowed for a child to avail of one programme year of ECCE over two years, whereas the standard provision is now a full two programme years. <\/p>  <p>  The overage exemption process has recently been the subject of a consultation process and report by the National Disability Authority (NDA). Officials from my Department are now considering policy options following on from this report. The new policy will consider the future of the system of exemptions and how best to support parents and children in the important transition from pre-school to primary school. It is worth stressing that the only rationale underpinning these considerations is what is in the best interests of the child.  <\/p>  <p>  A key finding of the recently published NDA report is that it is in children's best interests to enrol in primary school with their peers and to transition to becoming a teenager with their peers.\u00a0\u00a0I would also note that  associated research shows broad agreement that it is in the best interest of the child to start school with their peers.<\/p>  <p>  Until such time as any new policy proposals are\u00a0implemented, I have stated that the current system should continue. Overage Exemptions currently provided by my Department are governed by three guiding principles as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Letter of Recommendation from a specialist clinician<\/p>  <p>  - Child's age - not being over 6 years of age during the exemption year (as per Educational Welfare Act, 2000)<\/p>  <p>  - ECCE Allocation taken - if a child has\u00a0utilised their full 2 years of ECCE provision they will not be eligible for any further ECCE allocation. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the Department of Education and Skills and the National Council for Special Education to ensure that planning for a successful transition to primary school with the child's\u00a0peers begins as early as possible, and that the necessary resources are in place in the school to enable the child settle in comfortably and optimise their learning experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800050#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Costs","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800050#WRA03050"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[21740\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800050#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to develop targeted supports for parents and guardians in County Wexford paying for childcare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>My Department\u00a0funds a number of programmes and schemes in place to support parents and guardians with the cost of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare. These are available on a national basis through thousands of registered providers across all counties, including Wexford. They include:<\/p>  <p>  - The universal pre-school Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE)\u00a0programme, which provides children with 15 hours per week of pre-school education over a 38-week programme year. Since September 2018 children qualify for two years of universal pre-school.<\/p>  <p>  - The universal Community Childcare Subvention (CCSU) and\u00a0the targeted Community Childhood Subvention (CCS), which provide weekly subsidies to offset fees charged by providers. CCS is available to families who hold a Medical Card or are in receipt of social welfare benefits.<\/p>  <p>  - The Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Schemes provide a weekly subsidy to offset fees charged by providers for parents on approved education or training courses, Community Employment schemes, or those returning to work who need school-age childcare.<\/p>  <p>  - Specific supports are also in place for children in emergency accommodation, in accommodation centres provided by the State for persons in the protection process or programme refugee children in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres.<\/p>  <p>  Radical reforms to the targeted schemes, based on the principle of progressive universalism, are in train. The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), when introduced this October, will replace the CCS and TEC schemes with a single, streamlined scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Under the NCS, parents will continue to have access to the universal subsidy towards the cost of Early Learning and Care. This stands at &euro;1,040 per annum currently for a child under 3 in full time registered Early Learning and Care. Targeted subsidies for children from 6 months to 15 years of age will be provided, with the level of subsidy determined by net household income and the age of the child\u00a0(children).\u00a0Households with a net income of less than &euro;26,000 will receive the maximum subsidy. This can be\u00a0as high as &euro;5.10 per hour, available for up to 40 hours per week, for a child under one. Households with net income up to &euro;60,000 will also benefit, but on a sliding scale from the maximum subsidy level\u00a0available for incomes under &euro;26,000. Further information is available at www.ncs.gov.ie. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these universal and targeted subsidies, the NCS allows for additional support for families where there is an identified need for Early Learning and Care on grounds of child development or child welfare. Families with high levels of need, who require Early Learning and Care for child welfare, child protection or family support reasons, may be referred for support by a specified &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo; body.\u00a0 Where such a referral is made, the family will automatically qualify for a subsidy for the number of hours considered appropriate by the sponsor without having to satisfy the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility, income or enhanced hours requirements. <\/p>  <p>  Recent analysis undertaken by the OECD has concluded that, when the NCS is introduced, the costs of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare to parents will come closer to the OECD average. The NCS, in creating a flexible platform for future investment in funding, will allow subsidies to be expanded over time and\u00a0further progress to be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800050#WRA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Staff","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800050#WRA03250"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[22275\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800050#WRA03300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the status of the recruitment of social care workers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>Tusla&rsquo;s Business Plan for 2019 has identified an initial gross recruitment target of 102 Social Care Workers to cover new posts and attrition. Tusla projects that this recruitment may eventually result in an increase in Tusla&rsquo;s social care workers of\u00a057 once attrition and backfilling is taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has informed me that it has a rolling campaign for social care workers. In addition,\u00a0Tusla\u00a0has developed other initiatives, such as bespoke campaigns for social care workers, to support its on-going recruitment drive in the more difficult to fill Special Care settings. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that at 31 March, 2019 there were 1,152 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) social care workers in Tusla, which represents 29% of its overall workforce (3955 WTE). In addition, Tusla currently engages 210 agency social care workers to ensure continuity of service.<\/p>  <p>  Recruitment of social care workers is particularly challenging in\u00a0Special Care settings. For example, at the end of 2018, Tusla had appointed 131 new social care workers however, 70 social care workers either left or retired from the organisation during the same period. Tusla has identified that there are approximately 1,000 social care graduates per year however, a much smaller sub-group is willing to work in the particularly challenging environment of Special Care. This challenge is further compounded as Tusla is competing with the HSE, Oberstown Children Detention Campus, the voluntary and private sector to recruit from this subgroup.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that Tusla is exploring a number of measures to address the challenges in Special Care, such as increasing the potential talent pool by widening the eligible skills and experience considered for the role, improving the work environment and implementing a new model of care. Tusla has also commenced a stability programme to appoint in excess of 25 agency social care workers on temporary three year contracts into identified posts within the service.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, Tusla has indicated that a key focus for the Agency is the continued development of initiatives to support\u00a0the retention of the talent, capability and institutional knowledge that already exists within the Agency. A Retention Steering Group has been established by Tusla to plan and implement an integrated approach throughout the organisation and its\u00a0work is being coordinated through Tusla&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing and Employee Assistance service. In this context, Tusla has confirmed that the turnover rate for social care workers has fallen from 4.6% in 2017 to 3.52% in 2018 and this may be attributed to the recent work that Tusla has undertaken to address retention issues.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has developed its Strategic Workforce Planning Model &ndash; Phase 1 Multidisciplinary teams which will be rolled out by a Strategic Workforce Implementation Plan 2019-2020 and which encompasses capability and capacity planning. It is my expectation that this will chart the way forward in terms of a realistic approach to the personnel deficits being experienced by Tusla. Tusla has established a Steering Group, and also intends to establish Working Groups, to oversee and drive the implementation of the Strategic Workforce Planning Model and I welcome this approach.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the fact that the Retention Steering Group will feed into the Strategic Workforce Planning Model, focusing on staff wellbeing by assessing workplace stressors, employee psychological wellbeing and critical incident exposure in the workplace. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to HR, my Department is primarily focussed on funding, governance and support of Tusla however, my officials are actively engaging and supporting Tusla and other stakeholders with regard to addressing issues relating to the supply, recruitment and retention of social workers and social care workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800050#WRA03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Funding","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800050#WRA03450"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[22245\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800050#WRA03500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to reinstate funding to youth projects which were hard hit during the recession; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware my Department, along with all Government Departments, was required to deliver substantial savings on all funding programmes in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012-2014. <\/p>  <p>  In recent years funding for the provision of youth services has increased on an annual basis.

Revenue&rsquo;s enforcement of the law in relation to gaming and amusement machine licensing is based on detecting machines that are unlicensed and in particular, detecting gaming machines that have been licensed improperly as amusement machines.  As of 11 April 2019, the total yield under the project was &euro;2.68 million.  In addition, a total of 325 gaming machines have been seized to date for failure to comply with excise licensing requirements.  Revenue has confirmed that the project is ongoing and it continues to be a priority.<\/p>  <p>  I note the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to industry estimates of the number of unlicensed gaming machines in operation and the possible excise receipts that would be involved.  Revenue has advised that it is not aware of the methodology used for these estimates and, in general, considers that there are inherent difficulties in measuring the scale of such illegal activity.  In the case of the national compliance project on gaming and amusements, Revenue is making use of internal taxpayer records across all tax headings, information on gaming and amusement licences granted previously and sharing of intelligence from Revenue offices across the country in its efforts to target compliance and enforcement activity under the project.  This allows for resources to be deployed based on assessment of compliance risk and ensures the best use of resources.<\/p>  <p>  Neither I nor officials from my Department have met or had discussions with the Revenue Chairman in relation to this project.  However, both Revenue and my Department participated in the discussions of the recent interdepartmental working group on the future licensing and regulation of gambling.  I understand that Revenue did provide information to the interdepartmental working group during its discussions on the progress of the national compliance project and this is reflected in the report of the group which was published by the Department of Justice and Equality on 20 March 2019.  Revenue has also advised that it must always plan for the deployment of its resources across all tax headings and that sector-specific projects such as the national compliance project on gaming and amusement machines are undertaken as part of its normal role in serving the community by fairly and efficiently collecting taxes and duties and implementing customs controls.  Similar projects have been undertaken in the past in other areas, industry sectors and professions.<\/p>  <p>  I note the Deputy&rsquo;s query in relation to the identification of local authority areas where Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 is in operation.  Under this Part of the 1956 Act, local authorities may decide by resolution if gaming is to be permitted in respect of the whole or a specified part of its administrative area.  If gaming is permitted in the area concerned, a trader must first apply to the local District Court for what is called a &lsquo;certificate for a gaming licence&rsquo;.  The relevant local authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be given 28 days&rsquo; notice of this court application.  Revenue does not have any statutory role under this court process.  If the District Court grants this certificate, this allows the trader to apply to Revenue for a Gaming Licence, which is required for each premises where gaming machines are made available to play.  If the trader concerned presents the District Court certificate to Revenue and has paid the relevant licence fee, Revenue is under a statutory obligation under section 19 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 to grant a Gaming Licence.  In addition to a Gaming Licence, a trader must also apply to Revenue for a Gaming Machine Licence under section 43 of the Finance Act 1975 in respect of each gaming machine made available to play.  Gaming Machine Licences may only be granted by Revenue to traders who have already been granted a Gaming Licence.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the sole focus of Revenue is on whether the trader concerned has appropriate Gaming Licences and Gaming Machine Licences.  Irrespective of whether a local authority has adopted a resolution under Part III of the 1956 Act, Revenue carries out a standard procedure when engaging with traders who have been identified as making gaming machines available for play in the public place.  Such traders are issued with a 21-day warning letter warning that it is an offence under section 43 of the Finance Act 1975 to make a gaming machine available for play without the required gaming machine licence and this includes a warning that failure to comply with licensing requirements may lead to seizure of the unlicensed gaming machines.  This is followed up by similar 14-day and 7-day warning letters where necessary.  If the trader concerned has not complied with the licensing requirements by this point, the machines are subject to seizure by Revenue.  This approach places the onus entirely on the trader concerned to establish if he or she is in a position to obtain a gaming machine licence.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that at the outset of the compliance project, Revenue did make enquiries to confirm the position of all local authorities in relation to whether they had adopted a resolution under Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  In a number of cases, the resolutions concerned were adopted over previous decades and there were difficulties in establishing the position in relation to a number of local authority areas.  In addition, the widespread reorganisation of local authorities in 2014 resulted in a lack of clarity as to previous resolutions that may have been made.  Ultimately, Revenue determined that it was for the individual traders concerned to clarify their position with regard to the 1956 Act.  The trader must apply to a District Court for a certificate for a Gaming Licence and the relevant local authority is placed on notice of the District Court application.  If a certificate for a gaming licence is granted by the District Court, the trader can apply to Revenue for a Gaming Licence.  If the trader is unable to obtain a certificate for a Gaming Licence, he or she is not in a position to apply to Revenue for a Gaming Licence and Revenue will, following reasonable warning, be able to take enforcement action.  I am advised that this approach allows Revenue to deploy its resources in the most efficient manner possible under the project.  Revenue has not been in contact with the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800052#WRC05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800053#WRD00300"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[22474\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800053#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue that would be raised from the introduction of a wealth tax of 0.5%, 1% and 2%, respectively, on assets of &euro;1 million in value and above with no exemptions in tabular form.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[22475\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800053#WRD00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue that would be raised from the introduction of a wealth tax of 0.5%, 1% and 2%, respectively, on assets of &euro;1 million in value and above with an exemption of &euro;250,000 per child in tabular form.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[22476\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800053#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue that would be raised from the introduction of a wealth tax of 0.5%, 1% and 2%, respectively, on assets of &euro;1 million in value and above with exemptions for farmers in tabular form.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":140,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 to 59, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined to the Deputy in previous PQs (including PQ's 21932\/19, 21933\/19, 21934\/19 &amp;amp; 21935\/19, answered on 21 May), in order to estimate the potential revenue from a wealth tax, it is necessary to identify the wealth held by individuals. As there is currently no such wealth tax in operation in Ireland, the Department understands that the Revenue Commissioners have no basis or requirement to compile the data needed to produce estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax. Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances (for example, after a death), this information is not a complete measure of assets and liabilities in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax. <\/p>  <p>  However, in 2013 the Central Statistics Office conducted the first comprehensive survey of household wealth in Ireland (the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS)). The survey provides information on the ownership and values of different types of assets and liabilities along with more general information on income, employment and household composition. <\/p>  <p>  During 2016, my Department, jointly with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), conducted a research project into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax using the HFCS. The research formed part of an on-going joint-research programme with the ESRI on the Macro-Economy and Taxation. The research paper, available on the ESRI website, presented results on the composition of wealth across both the wealth and income distributions in Ireland. A number of wealth tax scenarios were then applied to the Irish data (wealth tax regimes from other jurisdictions and hypothetical scenarios). In each case, the associated tax bases and revenue yields, the number of liable households across the income distribution, and the characteristics of the households affected are outlined.  While the scenarios do not fully capture the parameters outlined in the questions the Deputy may find them informative.<\/p>  <p>  In order to estimate the yield from a tax with the precise parameters as outlined in the Deputy's questions, it would be necessary to seek the agreement of the CSO to revisit its original survey data for this specified purpose. This would be a significant undertaking that would take considerable time and resources to complete. It is also noted that the HFCS does not include specific data on the global assets for those domiciled or ordinarily resident and the domestic assets for those resident for tax purposes. As such, any estimate on the yield obtained from HFCS data would not fully capture the parameters outlined in the Deputy's question.  It is therefore not possible for me to provide the revenue estimate sought in each of these three PQ's.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800053#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme Eligibility","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800053#WRD01000"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[22479\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800053#WRD01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the definition of \"first-time buyer\" for the purposes of the help-to-buy scheme is planned to cover cases in which a person has previously legally purchased a home but never held a beneficial interest in it, such as in a case in which the person acted as a trustee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>The Help to Buy incentive, introduced with effect from 1 January 2017, is a scheme to assist first-time purchasers with the deposit they need to buy or build a new house or apartment.

Primary legislation was necessary in order to bring that change into effect.

The details of this investment were announced by Minister Moran with Mr. Leo Varadkar TD, An Taoiseach on 3<sup>rd<\/sup>May 2018, at the launch of the Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs). These Plans are the output from the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken by the State, through the Office of Public Works&rsquo; (OPW) Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.<\/p><p>The FRMPs set out the strategic plan to tackle flood risk, with outline design for schemes. While the specific project costs are not available until the procurement for each scheme is complete, the FRMPs did include some preliminary indicative potential costs and these are available on the OPW website, <i>www.floodinfo.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>For schemes which are currently at construction, and following a competitive tendering process for each project, the OPW and Cork County Council are working with project consultants on the following projects: Bandon (estimated cost &euro;28.4m) &ndash; currently at construction stage and is due to be substantially complete by July 2019, Skibbereen (estimated cost &euro;34.5m) &ndash; currently at construction stage and due to be substantially complete in June 2019, and Clonakilty (estimated cost &euro;24.1m) &ndash; currently at construction stage and expected to be completed in 2020.<\/p><p>At this time the OPW and Local Authorities have established Steering Groups to develop additional schemes to detailed design, planning and construction through procurement frameworks that were put in place ahead of the launch in 2018.  The OPW and Local Authorities will, as part of the ten- year programme of investment, continue to establish Steering Groups as capacity becomes available, for those other schemes identified by the FRMPs.<\/p><p>In that regard, the Steering Group has been established to develop the Bantry Flood Relief Scheme, which is estimated to cost &euro;6.6m, to detailed design and construction.  A further five proposed schemes have been identified by the CFRAM programme; namely Ballingeary, Castletown-Bearhaven, Inchigeelagh, Inishannon and Schull. These are not in the first tranche of projects to be progressed, but the OPW and Cork County Council will work closely to ensure that they will be commenced as soon as possible within the 10 year timeframe for the programme of investment.<\/p><p>The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has overall responsibility for Government policy on coastal strategy.  Local Authorities lead on identifying works to protect the coast in their respective areas. <\/p><p>The primary objective of Government policy on coastal protection is to ensure that, in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss of economic assets through coastal flooding, Local Authorities identify appropriate and sustainable measures to protect those assets.  Where defence measures are economically justified and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they can be implemented, subject to the availability of resources.<\/p><p>Where necessary, Local Authorities may put forward proposals to relevant central Government Departments, including the OPW, for funding of appropriate measures, depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat.<\/p><p>Further to that, my Office, through the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme, provides a funding mechanism to support works to protect coastal communities, particularly those at risk from flooding.  This Scheme provides funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation or coastal protection works or studies, costing less than &euro;0.75 million each, to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.

It is not intended to cover the full costs of attending college. The student grant scheme does however, provide for different levels of maintenance support, depending on means.  Grants are also provided at adjacent and non-adjacent rates.  The higher non-adjacent rates are intended to provide additional support to those students who may be living away from home.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2011 provided for a number of student grant measures which came into effect for the 2011\/12 academic year, including the change in the assessment of the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant from 24 kilometres to 45 kilometres. <\/p>  <p>  The 24km distance criterion was originally set in 1968 and had not been updated in more than 40 years. Since then, significant improvements have taken place in the road and rail network and it is considered that the revised distance criteria is more consistent with the type of distances that students may legitimately be expected to commute to college.<\/p>  <p>  The current qualifying distance of 45km for the higher non-adjacent rate of student grant takes into account a reasonable radius within which students may commute on a daily basis. <\/p>  <p>  The data for the 2018\/19 academic year is currently being finalised.

Some schools received slightly reduced allocations, where the data indicates less need, and some schools maintained their existing allocations.<\/p><p>Where adjustments have been made, they have been made in a graduated manner to minimise the impact for schools. Changes to Allocations have been capped to 20% of the adjustment to the retained element which would otherwise have occurred had a graduated approach not been applied.<\/p><p>No school has lost a full special education teaching post as a result of the re profiling process.<\/p><p>There  has also been be no reduction to the overall number of special education teaching posts within the school system.

Friends of the Centre groups have also been established in each centre.  This initiative aims to bring residents, community and voluntary groups together with a view to increasing integration opportunities and providing for the development of greater community linkages with the residents and the centre.<\/p>  <p>   RIA has a complaints procedure which is set out in the House Rules &amp;amp; Procedures Booklet for International Protection Applicants. Complaints are made initially to the Centre Manager with a view to informal resolution. If the person concerned is not satisfied with the outcome of their complaint, he or she may make a complaint to RIA who will investigate the matter and take action as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  In the event that a resident is not satisfied with how his or her complaint is dealt with, he or she has full access to the services of the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children. The office of the Ombudsman received 148 complaints about Direct Provision in 2018, 15 of which were upheld. <\/p>  <p>  Separately, certain decisions by RIA made in line with the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018, relating to material reception conditions and listed in full in Regulation 20, allow for review by a Review Officer, a designated role in RIA. This review may be further appealed to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800057#WRH04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"question","counter":384,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[22393\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800057#WRH04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of unannounced inspections for each direct provision accommodation centre carried out by the Reception and Integration Agency in each of the years 2013 to 2018, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":385,"content":"<p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) oversees a comprehensive and detailed inspections system of accommodation centres for people seeking international protection.

It is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016 and is, as I am sure you will agree, a very important task which must be done thoroughly and correctly. My Department has no role in the processing of individual vetting applications.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding sharing of vetting between organisations, vetting checks are conducted by the Garda National Vetting Bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. <\/p>  <p>  However, the Act provides for the sharing of vetting disclosures in certain circumstances by registered organisations; a facility which is of assistance in the health and education sectors, for example, in reducing the need for multiple vetting applications. Section 12(3A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of a person to undertake relevant work or activities, thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.<\/p>  <p>   In general, the vetting process is working well and I understand that there are no backlogs or delays in Garda vetting at present. This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations. The current turnaround time for vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the e-vetting system is 5 working days for over 85% of applications received. Individual applicants can track the process of their application online using the e-vetting tracking system, details of which are contained in the email received by applicants when completing their application online. Furthermore, in circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is largely obviated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800058#WRJ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800058#WRJ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[22492\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800058#WRJ03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of a naturalisation application by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":425,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy continues to be processed and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.

These supports include employment, capital, research and development, environmental and training grants.  These grants remain an important means of encouraging firms to invest in Ireland, particularly in regional locations.    <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that there is no uncertainty regarding the treatment of intellectual property assets in the tax system.  Irish tax law provides for a scheme of relief in the form of capital allowances available to companies that incur capital expenditure on intangible assets for the purposes of a trade.  The scheme applies to intangible assets which are recognised as such under generally accepted accounting practice and which are listed as a &ldquo;specified intangible asset&rdquo; in section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  An important feature of the relief is that the allowances may only be offset against trading income generated from the intangible assets and, for capital expenditure incurred on or after 11 October 2017, only against up to 80% of that income. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Government introduced The Knowledge Development Box (KDB) in 2015.  The KDB provides for relief from tax on the profits earned from the exploitation of patents, copyrighted software and intellectual property for small companies, provided that the intellectual property was developed through research and development (R&amp;D) carried out by companies resident in Ireland.  The IDA continue to promote the KDB to new and existing clients. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s record results for 2018 underline how strongly Ireland continues to perform when it comes to attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) of all types.  FDI continues to drive the economy with strong employment growth in this sector at 7%, compared to the national average of 3% in 2018.  FDI Exports experienced growth of 10% and an increase of 8% in the amount spent in the Irish economy on payroll, materials and services &ndash; which now stands at over &euro;19.2bn.  Ireland&rsquo;s investment and value proposition continues to resonate with companies across the globe as investors search for stability and certainty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800060#WRL02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement Data","counter":519,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800060#WRL02200"},{"type":"question","counter":520,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[22609\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800060#WRL02300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of staff employed at the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement; the number of vacant positions in each of the years 2001 to 2018 and to date in 2019, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":521,"content":"<p>The number of staff currently assigned to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) is 38 (35.2 full time equivalent).

The first of these building blocks is a clear governance and accountability framework.  As part of its recommendations in this area, the Committee called for the establishment of a HSE Board, the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused &lsquo;national centre&rsquo; carrying out national level functions, and the establishment of regional bodies with responsibility for the planning and delivery of integrated care at a regional level. <\/p>  <p>  The report further recommends that these new regional bodies should be established through the geographic alignment of current administrative regional structures.  As the Deputy will be aware, 9 Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and 7 Hospital Groups are in place on an administrative basis to plan and deliver community and acute care services respectively.  While significant progress has been made by these structures, there is broad consensus that having separate and un-aligned structures for acute and community care impedes the development of a more integrated health service as envisaged under the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Sl&aacute;intecare report recommended that &ldquo;further analysis and consultation should be undertaken to identify how alignment can best be achieved with minimal disruption to key structures including at community healthcare network level&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy published in August 2018 and the 2019 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan published in March 2019 commit to the development of a new system of health structures and governance as called for in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The Strategy and the Action Plan set out a number of actions to deliver on this commitment.  This includes determining the optimal approach for aligning current CHO and Hospital Group structures to provide the geographical basis for the proposed new regional bodies.  <\/p>  <p>  As a first step, my Department undertook a public consultation regarding the geographical alignment of CHOs and Hospital Groups in 2018.  In addition, my Department has carried out further detailed analysis work to determine the optimal geographical alignment of CHOs and Hospital Groups which can be achieved with minimal disruption, and which will ultimately be the geographical areas of the proposed new regional integrated care organisations.  My Department is finalising proposals in this regard, and I hope to bring these proposals to Government shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800061#WRM04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Funding","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800061#WRM04400"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[22344\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800061#WRM04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the annual budget allocated to the Regional Hospital Mullingar for the past seven years in tabular form.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":597,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800061#WRM04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Capital Programme","counter":598,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800061#WRM04700"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[22345\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800061#WRM04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount provided to the Regional Hospital Mullingar under capital works in tabular form.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":600,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare services and infrastructure projects, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to you in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800061#WRM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres","counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800061#WRM05000"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[22350\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800061#WRM05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the current service for primary care mental health services in Raheny, Donaghmede, Edenmore and Kilbarrack, Dublin;

The aim behind LCR was to encourage more young people to take out health insurance - to avoid late entry loadings of 2% per annum which may apply at age 35 and older - in order to ensure sufficient balance in the market overall between younger and older people, and between those who tend to claim more and those who tend to claim less. <\/p><p>Following a comprehensive review of the LCR regime in 2017 by the independent regulator, the Health Insurance Authority, the loadings regime was refined in several ways and credits made available in certain further circumstances. For example, a three-year exemption from 2008 for those made redundant was broadened this year to cover LCR loadings. As of 1 February 2019, persons who have cancelled their insurance for 6 months or more, having previously been insured for at least 3 years, will be credited for any periods of non-cover (the period of 3 years' cover does not need to be consecutive). The credited period is limited to 3 years and is available regardless of why the insured person cancelled their insurance.<\/p><p>More detailed information is available on the website of the HIA at .<\/p><p>Everyone &ndash; with or without insurance - is entitled to access healthcare via the public health system, and the purchase of private health insurance by citizens is optional.

In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.<\/p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal to the MMP, making a clear clinical case for the patient. Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: hse.ie\/yourmedicines.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process for a particular treatment is a matter for the HSE.

I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres.

The PCP may change over time in line with an individual&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time. <\/p><p>Any opportunity for residents to live in smaller settings in the community will come after considerable planning and discussion with those residents and their families.

In 2018, this figure was 27%. This was an increase on the previous year when it was 21%.

To this end, I am hopeful that the increases in payment rates introduced under the mid-term review in 2018 will have the desired incentive effect and result in increased uptake. As 2018 was a particularly difficult year for planting because of inclement weather conditions, the full effect of these changes has yet to be seen.  Active promotion of afforestation is also key to achieving our target which is why I  recently granted support in the amount of &euro;830,000 to 15 innovative promotion projects which will run over the next  two years; their efforts will be complemented by Teagasc&rsquo;s promotional activities and information days, as well the Department&rsquo;s own communication strategy.<\/p><p>We also  continue to engage with stakeholders especially through the Forestry Implementation Group and a Forestry Promotion Group, which discuss  implementation and ways to promote afforestation.  Furthermore, my Department is engaging with Coillte to agree a model whereby Coillte may contribute to afforestation rates, in order to support the  Government in its climate change mitigation effort. We will also explore all opportunities under the new CAP to encourage farm forestry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800068#WRT03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Data","counter":963,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800068#WRT03300"},{"type":"question","counter":964,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[22748\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800068#WRT03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the proportion of forest estate here that is single species conifer and native broadleaf plantation, respectively; the breakdown of the two plantation types between publicly owned and privately owned forests, respectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":965,"content":"<p>The National Forestry Inventory gathers information on tree species composition within Ireland&rsquo;s forests.

It is this company that will be the signatory to the NBP Contract. The equity of NBI will be invested in NBI via a holding company as would be typical for projects such as this. The holding company will be wholly owned by Granahan McCourt Dublin (Ireland) Limited.<\/p>  <p>  The Bidder will invest a minimum level of up to &euro;220 million including equity funding and working capital requirements. This is made up of &euro;175 million from Tetrad Corporation and the rest from Granahan McCourt (Dublin) Ireland Ltd.<\/p>  <p>  At final tender, Tetrad Corporation provided a commitment letter in relation to the equity required for the project. The equity commitments will be contractualised in advance of contract award. This means that the Minister will have the right through those contracts to enforce the equity commitment on behalf of the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800070#WRV04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":1077,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800070#WRV05000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Craolt&oacute;ir&iacute; Seirbh&iacute;se Poibl&iacute;","counter":1076,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800070#WRV04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1077,"qnumday":381,"qnumall":"[22850\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800070#WRV05000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"cad iad na bearta at&aacute; i gceist aige a dh&eacute;anamh chun a chinnti&uacute; go gcomhl&iacute;onfaidh RT&Eacute; a ndualgas reacht&uacute;il i leith na Gaeilge i bhfianaise na tuarasc&aacute;la a d&rsquo;fhoilsigh an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga le gairid inar d&uacute;radh go raibh RT&Eacute; ag sar&uacute; an Achta Craolach&aacute;in, 2009 maidir le sol&aacute;thar cl&aacute;r teilif&iacute;se Gaeilge; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;ites ina thaobh.","asker":"1312","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1078,"content":"<p>De r&eacute;ir Alt 98 den Acht Craolach&aacute;in 2009, is craolt&oacute;ir neamhsple&aacute;ch n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta seirbh&iacute;se poibl&iacute; &eacute; RT&Eacute; agus, ar an &aacute;bhar sin, n&iacute;l aon r&oacute;l agamsa mar Aire ina chuid oibr&iacute;ochta&iacute; &oacute; l&aacute; go l&aacute;.

First 5 includes over 150 actions including a broad a range of measures to support families given their fundamental importance in shaping children&rsquo;s experiences and outcomes.  The vision for babies and young children articulated in First 5 is of a healthy childhood starting in pregnancy; time together with parents especially in the first year in a nurturing and playful home environment where material needs are met; high quality play-based Early Learning and Care experiences; positive transitions to primary school; and supportive community contexts.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting parents in caring for young children at home in a range of ways.<\/p>  <p>  Within the remit of my Department, the policy priorities are to provide access to Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare supports to parents of young children, whether they work full time or part time, or look after their children at home full-time. These policies seek to support children&rsquo;s early development and to support their families.<\/p>  <p>  For example, in terms of Early Learning and Care supports provided by my Department, from September of last year, all children are eligible to avail of two years of universal pre-school, without cost, through the Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE) prior to beginning primary school.  Almost 108,000 children are currently participating, many of whom are children of stay-at-home parents.<\/p>  <p>  The current targeted Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare subsidy schemes are available to families where parents are in receipt of certain social welfare payments, medical cards, or GP Visit cards, again many of whom are stay-at-home parents.<\/p>  <p>  A universal subsidy is available to all parents of children from six months until their child becomes eligible for the universal preschool programme (ECCE), regardless of whether parents are working or not. The National Childcare Scheme which will be open for applications later this year will make  subsidies available on the basis of family income and will also be available to stay-at-home parents. This is underpinned by the Childcare Support Act 2018.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for local parent and toddler groups to organise activities for parents and young children in the community to support their development through play. Both working parents and stay-at-home parents participate.  449 groups were supported in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In the coming years, my Department will also be leading on developing a new model of parenting services from universal to targeted provision, covering key stages of child development and taking account of parents and children in a range of contexts and parenting relationships. <\/p>  <p>  More widely across Government, there are various initiatives that support stay-at-home parents. A child benefit payment of &euro;140 per child per month is available for all children. Budget 2019 announced an increase to the home carer tax credit to &euro;1,500 per year.<\/p>  <p>  There have also been a number of new measures to support parents to spend time at home with children in their early years. Two weeks of paternity leave and benefit for fathers was introduced in 2016. In 2017, there was an extension to maternity leave and benefit to mothers of babies born prematurely.  Budget 2019 announced the introduction of a new paid parental leave scheme which will be available to both fathers and mothers from later this year.  Legislation extending the amount of unpaid parental leave and increasing the age of the child to which it applies has recently passed.  <\/p>  <p>  First 5 sets out Government's commitment that by 2021, parents will each have an individual entitlement to seven weeks of paid parental leave, to potentially allow children to benefit from an additional 14 weeks parental care in their first year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has led the development of the implementation plan for First 5 which will be published this week.  The implementation plan sets out how the first phase of delivery of the over 150 actions in First 5, including many that will benefit stay-at-home parents, will be progressed in the coming three years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800072#WRX01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1143,"content":"<p>Question No. 404 answered with Question No. 402.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services Staff","counter":1144,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800072#WRX01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1145,"qnumday":405,"qnumall":"[22322\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800072#WRX01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the steps she is taking to assist with improvements in the pay and conditions of childcare staff; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1146,"content":"<p>I have been unequivocal in my support for better pay and conditions for staff in Early Learning and Care services.

Measures also include the introduction for the first time of an annual Programme Support Payment to recognise the administrative roles that services play; this totals &euro;21.4m in 2019. I have also continued to provide a higher rate of capitation payment for graduate-led pre-school rooms, to encourage the attraction and retention of Early Learning and Care graduates, and in 2017 I introduced a higher capitation payment for services that employ a qualified Inclusion Coordinator as part of the AIM programme. In addition, last year I introduced a pilot measure for funding services whose staff take part in continuing professional development, and I am extending the pilot this year to include the new 'Aistear and Play' CPD programme implemented by Better Start.

The development of this Scheme is a significant move forward in delivering quality, accessible, affordable childcare to families throughout Ireland. <\/p><p>The Scheme represents a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.  By making this shift and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland, the Scheme aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty. It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.<\/p><p>The Scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare schemes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme, providing both universal and targeted childcare subsidies.  To make the transition to the new Scheme as smooth as possible, families can choose to make the switch to the new Scheme once it launches (targeted for October\/ November 2019) or can remain on their current childcare subsidy programme for one final year.<\/p><p>With regard to income-based subsidies awarded under the Scheme, parents who are working, studying or who meet certain other conditions will qualify for an enhanced-hours subsidy (up to a maximum of 40 hours per week).  The definitions of &lsquo;work&rsquo; and &lsquo;study&rsquo; will be set out in regulations made under the Childcare Support Act 2018 and will be comprehensive, covering differing types of work and study arrangements, such as part-time, week on\/ week off and zero hour contract arrangements. <\/p><p>The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. By removing many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing programmes, a far greater number of families will be eligible for targeted, income-related subsidies. Many families will, for the first time, be entitled to subsidies which will reduce their childcare costs significantly.<\/p><p>There may, however, be a small number of cases where a family who is currently receiving the maximum rate for <i>full-time<\/i>childcare under an existing programme may receive less under the National Childcare Scheme, particularly if their child is &ndash;  in reality &ndash; receiving <i>afterschool<\/i>care rather than full-time childcare.  In such cases, the family can remain on their current payment in the transition period following the Scheme&rsquo;s launch.  I have also directed my officials to undertake research and analysis to examine any adjustments to the National Childcare Scheme which might be required to address unusual or anomalous cases, where this is the right thing to do to protect and benefit lower income parents. <\/p><p>In this regard, I would highlight that the new National Childcare Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.  As such, any adjustments deemed necessary by Government can be carried out in a quick and responsive manner.<\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy may be aware that my Department also funds Educational Welfare services which are operated by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. The Schools Completion Programme regularly provides after-school services or homework clubs. These are most often provided in areas of disadvantage.

Children whose families are homeless are prioritised for services such as homework clubs and breakfast clubs. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla and the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) have agreed a joint protocol to facilitate an inter-agency response to the many challenges posed by homelessness. As part of the protocol, Tusla provides support to the DHRE&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; assessment centres. Here Tusla staff deal with matters of child protection and welfare, educational welfare and Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV) services.  Tusla&rsquo;s Homelessness Liaison Officer supports these centres.<\/p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres, funded by Tusla, provide facilities where homeless children and families can avail of a safe, warm environment for homework, relaxation and nutritious food. Tusla is engaging with the Centres to offer further, enhanced services across the greater Dublin area in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  My Department funds free childcare for children and families experiencing homelessness, under the Community Childcare Subvention Resettlement (Transitional) Programme. This includes a daily meal for each child. 312 children have been registered under this scheme in the current programme year (August 2018 &ndash; August 2019).<\/p>  <p>  Finally, acting on evidence that a minority of young people leaving the care of the State can have particularly complex needs, I have succeeded in having care-leavers included for the first time as a separate category for funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS).  This provides targeted assistance to the most vulnerable care leavers by enabling Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to acquire residential units to accommodate them. Where accommodation is provided under CAS, Tusla will provide and, where necessary advocate for, additional independent living supports, in particular for the most vulnerable care leavers, in accordance with the individual&rsquo;s pre-agreed aftercare plan.  <\/p>  <p>   I am pleased to be able to confirm that as of 24 May 2019, 24 care-leavers have availed of places with different Approved Housing Bodies, including 15 with Focus Ireland, six with the Peter McVerry Trust, and three with Don Bosco. Additional placements have been secured and are expected to come on stream within the coming months. These should be available for other young people leaving care in the near future.  The security provided by a tenancy in CAS accommodation, combined with the aftercare supports identified by Tusla as part of the aftercare planning process, can help ensure that these young people have a safe base from which to begin their transition to independent adult life.<\/p>  <p>  Our response to homelessness overall is a test of our compassion as a society. We need to eliminate child and family homelessness. While we work towards this we must provide the assistance necessary to help these children and families live in a way that goes some way to addressing the challenges of the situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800072#WRX05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abuse Reports","counter":1180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800072#WRX05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1181,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[22459\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800072#WRX05200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the degree to which reports of physical, mental and-or sexual abuse of children has been made known to her Department in each of the past three years to date; the degree to which a satisfactory conclusion has been achieved in each case; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

I and officials in my Department are working towards alleviating this financial strain for all families.<\/p><p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), which will be introduced later this year, is a new user-friendly scheme to help parents meet the cost of quality childcare. The development of this Scheme is a significant move forward in delivering quality, accessible, affordable childcare to families throughout Ireland. <\/p><p>Through the NCS, and a range of other measures, I am committed to changing Ireland&rsquo;s childcare system from one of the most expensive in the world to one of the very best. In designing the NCS, extensive research and consultations have been carried out to ensure that this goal is achieved and that the scheme can help as many families as possible.<\/p><p>Under the Scheme, a Universal subsidy is available to all families using registered childcare with children aged between 24 weeks and 3 years.  An Income Assessed subsidy will be available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy will vary depending on family income, the child&rsquo;s age and their educational stage. It can be used towards the cost of a registered childcare place for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week where parents are working, studying or training, or in circumstances where a parent is unavailable to care for a child. Where parents are not working, studying or training, the subsidy will be paid for up to a maximum of 15 hours per week. <\/p><p>  A priority for me in last year&rsquo;s budget was to increase the lower income threshold under the NCS from &euro;22,700 to &euro;26,000 per annum.  This will &lsquo;poverty-proof&rsquo; the Scheme, ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the highest subsidy rates under the Scheme, over &euro;200 per child in some instances.<\/p><p>A second priority was to increase the Scheme&rsquo;s maximum net income threshold from &euro;47,000 to &euro;60,000 per annum in order to benefit moderate and middle income families struggling with the cost of childcare.  <\/p><p>These enhancements will ensure that 7,500 more children will now benefit from the Scheme relative to the original proposals.  Over 40,000 other children, already eligible for support, will see increases to their subsidies.<\/p><p>The NCS will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. The Scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports.  It will also make work pay for parents trying to get back into employment or training as they will now be able to avail of help with their childcare costs.  Many working families will, for the first time, be entitled to subsidies which will reduce their childcare costs significantly.  Others will see an increase in their level of subsidy.  <\/p><p>The Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme,  or ECCE as it is known, is a universal scheme available to all children in Ireland for the two years prior to them starting in primary school. It is estimated that this scheme can save parents who require full or part time childcare approximately &euro;5000 over the course of the two years. <\/p><p>Over the last four budgets, investment in childcare has risen by nearly 117%.  However, I acknowledge that more investment will be needed.  Historic under-investment in early learning and care has created a situation that has no quick solution.  The new National Childcare Scheme will establish a sustainable platform to enable us to continue investing for years to come, and the Scheme is designed to be flexible, allowing income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates to be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800073#WRY01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1193,"content":"<p>Question No. 421 answered with Question No. 402.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Investigations","counter":1194,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800073#WRY01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1195,"qnumday":422,"qnumall":"[22537\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800073#WRY01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the procedures in place for Tusla regarding investigations of companies and agencies used by the courts to supervise children in court orders in relation to their non-compliance with the Children First Act 2015, with particular reference to the reason the list of non-compliant organisations is not publicly accessible; the further reason there is no sanction in place to publish the details of non-compliant organisations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1196,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is the appropriate body to investigate the non-compliance of a provider of a relevant service under the Children First Act 2015.

This will create hundreds of more places, significantly increasing capacity in just one year.<\/p>  <p>  Concerns have been raised about the availability of childcare places in the registered childcare sector. I am aware that the higher cost of operating baby rooms, due to higher staffing ratios being required, may be contributing to the capacity issue and my Department is monitoring this situation closely whilst also taking a number of measures to address it.<\/p>  <p>  Access to high quality and affordable childcare generally remains a topical issue. The particular focus on availability of places in the centre based sector for the 0-3 age range has emerged in the context of recent media coverage. There is a suggestion that ECCE has been expanded (successfully) at the cost on provision for younger children. <\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), due to be launched later this year will also be a significant intervention to address this challenge. The NCS recognises the different costs associated with providing childcare for children of different ages. The Scheme will provide for a progressive system of subsidies starting with the highest subsidy rates for children under 1(up to &euro;5.10 per hour) and the next highest subsidy for children from 1 to under 3 (up to &euro;4.35 per hour).  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to childminding, I was delighted to secure &euro;500,000 in Budget 2019 to recruit a National Childminding Coordinator and a team of six Development Officers around the country, to support the registration of more childminders with Tusla and thus enable them access subsidies under the National Childcare Scheme. My Department will publish a Childminding Action Plan in the coming months to follow through on the commitments in First 5 and the Programme for Government to further develop the childminding sector.<\/p>  <p>  My Department funds 30 City and County Childcare Committees across the country. Part of their role is to advise my Department on capacity issues. I would encourage anyone having difficulty in securing a place to make contact with their local CCC. Contact details for all of the CCCs, in addition to other information about the services they provide, may be found on www.myccc.ie<\/p>  <p>  As regards capacity issues more generally, each year Pobal conducts research on behalf of my Department to examine a number of factors related to childcare services in Ireland, including the monitoring of capacity. The Early Years Sector Profile report, which was published in November and relates to the 2017\/2018 programme year, indicates that existing childcare provision nationally meets current needs nationwide in terms of capacity whilst recognising that small pockets of under supply may exist within this.<\/p>  <p>  This report outlines a 4% vacancy rate as a percentage of children enrolled in Dublin. Pobal reports that nationally the trend for waiting lists suggests a reduction in waiting lists for older children and an increase for under twos. Pobal cautions that its data on waiting lists cannot by itself be used to inform capacity decisions as parents often place their children on more than one waiting list. <\/p>  <p>  Under the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan published in 2018, I ensured that Childcare was identified as one of our nation's strategic priorities.

In order to accommodate the smooth registration of children on our childcare programmes, we do ask parents who wish to remove a child or move them to another service to provide their current service provider with four weeks notice (where possible) in order to provide a space for that service provider to de-register the child from their service, thus enabling my Department to cease payments to that service in relation to that child. This notice period prevents the IT payment system from declining their child's registration in their new chosen service due to a 'double registration' scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800073#WRY03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":1222,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800073#WRY04000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Improvement Scheme Data","counter":1221,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800073#WRY03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1222,"qnumday":431,"qnumall":"[22395\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800073#WRY04000","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if additional funding will be provided to the local improvement scheme, LIS, to local authorities particularly in counties Leitrim, Sligo, Roscommon and Donegal; the number of rural roads that have received funding under the LIS in each of the years 2016 to 2018, by the local authority in tabular form; the projected number of road projects to be completed in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":1223,"content":"<p>The Local Improvement Scheme, or LIS, is a programme for improvement works on small private or non-public roads in rural areas.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the Household benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;187 million in 2019.  This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year.  This comes to &euro;420 per annum, or &euro;8 per week, plus free TV licence, travel etc.  It's worth noting that Jobseekers Allowance is not a qualifying payment for this benefit, nor the other benefits available under the Household Benefits scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.

In addition to this higher rate, the means test for Carer's Allowance is very significantly more generous than that which applies to Jobseekers Allowance, which widens further the gap in payments between Carers and Jobseekers.  Also, Fuel Allowance is a household-based payment, and a Carer will very often live with and be caring for a person with a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.  A similar household, where the person received Jobseekers Allowance instead of Carers Allowance, would have the same rate of Fuel Allowance, as only one payment is permitted per household.<\/p>  <p>  It would not be accurate, therefore, to suggest that those in receipt of Carer's Allowance are in a less advantageous position than those paid Jobseekers Allowance.  Even when the more generous means test is not taken into account, and even during the Fuel Allowance season, the payments made to Carer's Allowance recipients, including Electricity\/Gas payments, are higher than those made to those in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the payment of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for fuel allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, then they are deemed to have satisfied the means test and fuel allowance is payable subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance then they will have to undergo a means test for fuel allowance.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to amend the criteria for receiving fuel allowance to include carer&rsquo;s allowance as a qualifying payment would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources and this may include exceptional heating cost.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800074#WRZ05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":1288,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800074#WRZ05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1289,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[22416\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800074#WRZ05400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a carer's allowance appeal by a person (details supplied) will be expedited; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1290,"content":"<p>Carer's allowance (CA) is a means-tested social assistance payment made to a person who is habitually resident in the State and who is providing full-time care and attention to a child or an adult who has such a disability that as a result they require that level of care.<\/p><p>An application for CA was received from the person concerned on 2 July 2018.<\/p><p>It is a condition for receipt of a CA that the person being cared for must have such disability that they require full-time care and attention.<\/p><p>This is defined as requiring from another person, continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or continual supervision in order to avoid danger to him or herself and likely to require that level of care for at least twelve months.<\/p><p>The evidence submitted in support of this application was examined and the deciding officer decided that this evidence did not indicate that the requirement for full-time care was satisfied for the care recipient.<\/p><p>The person concerned was notified on 12 September 2018 of this decision, the reasons for it and of his right of review and appeal.<\/p><p>According to the records of the Department, he has not exercised either right of review or  appeal.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800074#WRZ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":1292,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800075#WRAA00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1293,"qnumday":454,"qnumall":"[22434\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800075#WRAA00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to ensure no interruption occurs in respect of rent supplement in the case of a person (details supplied); the maximum rent support available in this case; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1294,"content":"<p>The purpose of rent supplement is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rental accommodation, where they are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.

The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 1 April 2012, new applicants in receipt of Carers Allowance who are not living with the person for whom they provide care do not have an automatic entitlement to the household benefits package. Carers who live with the person they are caring for still have an entitlement of their own to the household benefits package and do not have to satisfy the household composition criteria.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual carers support grant (&euro;1700) in respect of each person for whom they care.  Where a person is in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments, and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their primary social welfare payment and also get the half-rate carer's allowance.  <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that Carer's payments are made at a higher level than other working age income-maintenance payments made by my Department.  The weekly rate for Carer's Allowance is &euro;219 where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 where it is two or more, compared to &euro;203 for most other income-maintenance payments to those below pension age.  The means test for Carer's Allowance is also significantly more generous than those applying to other schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  Any decision to change the qualifying criteria for HHB would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800075#WRAA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Applications","counter":1332,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800075#WRAA04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1333,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[22575\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800075#WRAA04400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a person (details supplied) is entitled to a hearing aid; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1334,"content":"<p>The person concerned is entitled to the hearing aid grant under the Department's PRSI scheme.  <\/p><p>A claim was received on 9th May 2019, payment will issue to her provider on the next payment date, which is 14th June 2019. <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800075#WRAA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Review","counter":1335,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800075#WRAA04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1336,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[22577\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800075#WRAA04700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans for rehabilitative community employment schemes within her Department to be transferred to the Department of Health and the HSE; if there are plans, the details and decision making process of same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1337,"content":"<p>Community employment (CE) is the largest employment programme administered by my Department. It aims to enhance employability and mobility by providing work experience and training opportunities for unemployed persons within their own communities. <\/p>  <p>  A key function of CE is supporting social inclusion and counteracting the drift into structural unemployment.  It is a broad and flexible programme that has been utilised to address many social challenges presenting at individual and\/or societal level.  5% of CE placements are reserved to support the re-integration of participants referred to a CE place on a drug rehabilitation scheme through the delivery of the agreed inter-agency CE Drug Rehabilitation Programme within the CE Social Inclusion strand.<\/p>  <p>  All CE placements are categorised as either a training\/activation strand or a social inclusion strand.  This is to acknowledge that not all CE places are the same.  The Social Inclusion placements provide an opportunity for those who are very distant from the labour market to gain employment and deliver services in their local communities while the activation placements are more directly related to employment opportunities for participants who are long-term unemployed with a view to providing them with more labour market relevant work experience.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies on all sides of the House are fully aware of the positive benefits derived from schemes like CE. Communities benefit from the skills and talents of participants and, in addition, participants are provided with the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities.  Furthermore, many CE schemes provide vital community services across the country, all of which are well embedded in these communities.<\/p>  <p>  The Government agreed to establish an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) to explore the most appropriate organisational arrangements, in particular in respect of those CE schemes whose primary focus is social inclusion and the delivery of social services.

These payments are being reviewed under a new Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pension calculation which includes provision for homecaring periods. <\/p>  <p>  The person has 751 reckonable paid contributions which combined with the maximum permissible number of HomeCaring periods and reckonable credits of 1,040, as set out in legislation, results in an increase from 85% to 86.11% of maximum rate State pension contributory.  A review outcome letter has issued to the person, outlining details of their increase of State pension contributory and includes a breakdown of their social insurance contribution record.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the restorative justice payment, a claimant aged over 66 years is entitled to a maximum payment of &euro;248.30 per week (which is equivalent to maximum rate state pension (contributory)).

The person concerned was previously in receipt of a state pension contributory payment at the weekly rate of &euro;211.40 and their applicable rate under the restorative justice scheme was &euro;36.90 per week.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, and the universal social charge.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.  On that basis if the household consists of three adults and at least four children, the maximum net income threshold for a household in Co. Tipperary is &euro;30,000 and the maximum net income threshold for a household in Waterford City and County is &euro;36,000. <\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. <\/p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.  The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800077#WRCC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Loan Scheme","counter":1424,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800077#WRCC02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1425,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[22746\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800077#WRCC02900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans for a revised credit policy in respect of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme to include a provision to provide persons who previously owned a home but that have gone through bankruptcy the opportunity to apply for a loan rather than being deemed ineligible in view of their not being a first-time buyer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1426,"content":"<p>Applicants for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan must be of good credit standing and have a satisfactory credit record.

Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended. <\/p><p>The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.  The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.  The current income limits are available on my Department's website at <\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies to all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, and the universal social charge.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards.  Local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.  <\/p><p>In relation to previously owned homes or existing co-owned properties, under Section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and Regulation 22(1) of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, a household shall be ineligible for social housing support if it has alternative accommodation that the household could reasonably be expected to use to meet its housing need, either by occupying it or by selling the accommodation and using the proceeds to secure suitable accommodation suitable for the household&rsquo;s adequate housing.  However, Regulation 22(2) of the 2011 Regulations provides that this ineligibility does not apply where an applicant for social housing support owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced.  Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases.  The rationale for this exception is that the terms of a formal separation or divorce will provide for the future ownership and occupation of the family home and it will be clear whether the household that has left the family home can return to live there. <\/p><p>In order to provide more flexibility to local authorities to deal with cases where the ownership of the family home had not yet been finalised, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 amended section 20 of the 2009 Act and Local authorities may now provide such households with social housing support under the Rental Accommodation Scheme or the Housing Assistance Payment scheme until ownership of the family home is resolved in a formal separation or divorce settlement. <\/p><p>The 2014 Act amendment provides that support in these circumstances will be reviewed by the local authority at prescribed intervals and the household will not be able to transfer to other forms of social housing support while ownership of the family home remains to be determined.  However, where the household ultimately qualifies for the full range of social housing supports, the length of time the household was supported under RAS or HAP will be reckonable for the purposes of determining the household&rsquo;s relative priority for a transfer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800077#WRCC04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Eligibility","counter":1441,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800077#WRCC04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1442,"qnumday":506,"qnumall":"[22841\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800077#WRCC04800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of EU nationals refused social housing support due to owning a property in their country of origin, in each of the years 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019; the avenues that exist for those who have properties that have little or no value; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1443,"content":"<p> My Department does not hold information of the type requested by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The assessment of households for social housing support, and the allocation of that support to qualified households is a matter for individual local authorities in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated regulations.  <\/p>  <p>  Under Section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and Regulation 22(1) of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, a household shall be ineligible for social housing support if it has alternative accommodation that the household could reasonably be expected to use to meet its housing need, either by occupying it or by selling the accommodation and using the proceeds to secure suitable accommodation suitable for the household&rsquo;s adequate housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800077#WRCC04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies Data","counter":1444,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800077#WRCC05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1445,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[22897\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019052800077#WRCC05100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 315 of 18 April 2019, if he will provide the original information requested in tabular form, in view of that fact that the county location and agency staff breakdown is not accessible in the link provided.","asker":"1335","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1446,"content":"<p>The county location for each Agency\/Body under my Department's aegis was provided in the reply to Question No. 315 of 18 April 2019 but is set out again in Table 1. <\/p><p>My Department collects information on staffing numbers for certain non commercial state bodies quarterly, broken down by total number of employees and the number of whole time equivalents.
