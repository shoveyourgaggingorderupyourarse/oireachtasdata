The Bill passed all Stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas in July 2013 and was signed into law on 29 July 2013.\u00a0\u00a0Two further steps are necessary for the operation of the legislation prior to its commencement.

Section 6 provides that commencement of the Act would be subject to a ministerial order, or orders, as necessary.  As the Act, for the first time, imposes a significant obligation on Independent Members of the Oireachtas to provide substantial information to the Standards in Public Office Commission, I decided to afford the appropriate lead-in time to 1 July for that to happen, and that is why the commencement date for that provision is 1 July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400004#B00200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1401892500,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I know the Minister was very keen to pass the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2014.

There are a number of vacant properties within this portfolio.  The majority of vacant properties are recently closed Garda stations, with the remainder consisting of properties such as customs posts, former Coast Guard stations and sundry other properties located nationwide.  <\/p><p>  The Office of Public Works has a clearly defined policy relating to vacant properties that are identified as surplus to its requirements.  In the first instance, it engages with other public service bodies, including relevant local authorities, to establish the potential for alternative use in advance of deciding on disposal.  Such alternative use includes the potential for these properties to be made available to meet social housing needs.  <\/p><p>  The Office of Public Works has been actively involved with the relevant authorities to identify potential properties within the portfolio which could be considered suitable to address the current housing issues.  For example, it agreed to make a number of properties available to the Housing Agency and the office is engaged with the agency on the issue of leasing arrangements.  In addition, the OPW recently made a property available to the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  It is intended that this property will be used as a residential centre to support vulnerable women affected by long-term homelessness.<\/p><p>  Deputies will be aware that on 20 May last, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, published the implementation plan on the State's response to homelessness, which outlines the Government's approach to delivering its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  The plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports.  Progress on implementing the plan will be reported quarterly by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning through the Cabinet committee on social policy.<\/p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will chair a working group of key stakeholders which will identify potential suitable and available properties, with a view to putting in place the necessary arrangements to facilitate their use as housing units. <\/p><p>  With regard to determining the criteria by which a property is adjudged to be suitable for social housing, this is primarily a matter for the relevant housing authorities.  I am advised, however, that the following criteria generally apply: the suitability of the property given that many of them are purpose built Garda stations; the location of the properties and level of demand in the relevant area; and the current condition of the property and cost of refurbishment.

To date, the Office of Government Procurement has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to more than 4,500 SMEs nationwide.\u00a0 These events afforded suppliers an opportunity to meet and discuss the issues with public service buyers and provide networking opportunities for suppliers to build consortia and synergies between suppliers to facilitate joint bids.<\/p><p> My Department has also recently finished reviewing and updating existing guidelines and procedures aimed at promoting SME participation in public procurement.  Circular 10 of 2014, launched on 17 April, sets out new initiatives aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses to bid for State business.  These new guidelines are aimed at reducing the administrative burden and costs on businesses that want to tender for public contracts.  The SME working group, established under the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, was consulted on the new guidelines.  The SME working group is chaired by the Office of Government Procurement and includes representatives from the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC, InterTradeIreland, Enterprise Ireland, the Competition Authority, the Small Firms Association, Chambers Ireland and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The new circular has been broadly welcomed by industry representative associations.<\/p><p> The reform of public procurement across the public service is ongoing and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business here and to shape them to win business abroad as well.

The UN-authorised air campaign in 2011 is often lauded as a shining example of successful foreign intervention.  The initial mandate - to protect civilians - was exceeded by nations who had only recently been selling arms to Gadaffi, and the bombing evolved into regime-change.  Today's Libya is overrun by militias and faces a deteriorating human rights situation, mounting chaos that is infecting other countries, growing internal splits, and even the threat of civil war.  As journalist, Seumas Milne, pointed out in <i>The Guardian <\/i>last week, the west seized the chance to intervene in Libya to get a grip on the Arab uprisings.  NATO air power in support of the Libyan rebellion increased the death toll by a factor of about ten, but played the decisive role in the war, which meant no coherent political or military force was ready to fill the vacuum.  Three years on, thousands are held without trial, there are heavy curbs on dissent and institutions are close to collapse.<\/p><p>Fear is growing of an all-out war between militias aligned with the Islamist-dominated parliament and forces led by a former general named Khalifa Haftar, who was reportedly once trained by the CIA.  Haftar has accused the government of fostering terrorism and is calling for an emergency administration to oversee elections this month.  Haftar, a former general under Gadaffi, says he wants to rid Libya of Islamists and led an assault against the militant groups in Benghazi.  Recently, forces allied to him took control of Libya's parliament building in the capital, Tripoli.  At least 100 people have died since the fighting broke out.  This effort to overthrow the elected government is supported by the US.  The US ambassador to Libya, Deborah Jones, said recently that she would not condemn the actions of General Haftar, whose forces stormed the parliament on 18 May.  <\/p><p>Most experts agree that Libya needs assistance in strengthening its central government and the rule of law.  Human Rights Watch stated recently that &quot;Unless the international community focuses on the need for urgent assistance to the justice and security systems, Libya risks the collapse of its already weak state institutions and further deterioration of human rights in the country&quot;.  The US is currently training special forces in areas as diverse as Tripoli, Bulgaria, the Canary Islands and elsewhere for use in places like Libya.  In what has all the hallmarks of mission creep, a small number of US soldiers are being sent to Tripoli to begin training troops, but should the US be the one in charge of the delicate process of building a cohesive security force to combat violent, fractious, armed groups, many of them drawn from the very militias that destabilised Libya in the first place?  No wonder western governments and journalists who hailed the success of this intervention are so silent.<\/p><p>The Irish Government needs to take a very strong position - one of neutrality  - in this area.  We have been far too closely aligned with the US and NATO forces which have wrecked havoc worldwide and are responsible for immense destruction and the deaths of many people.  There is a serious case to be looked at with regard to how the Security Council works.  In the past 25 years with the veto system, China and France have vetoed three resolutions, Russia four, the UK ten and the US 43.  Surely the time has come for the UN to take the role of the policeman, not the US because it is leaving a trail of destruction behind it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400017#P01100","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401900000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The current political and security situation in Libya, as the Deputy has outlined, is both highly complex and precarious and remains a matter of deep concern, both for Ireland and for the international community generally.  Since the fall of Colonel Gadaffi in 2011, serious difficulties, including a weak and divided central government, impotent defence institutions and a proliferation of militias vying for influence, have undermined cohesion in the country.  Overall, two broad political camps have emerged, representing Islamist factions of varied stripes on the one hand and a loose alliance of anti-Islamist nationalists, federalists and tribal militias on the other.  This ongoing instability has understandably led to rising popular discontent and frustration with the political process.<\/p><p>  Recent months have been particularly worrying.  Blockades of oil ports by militias in the east of the country have starved the government of vital revenue.  The government's perceived poor handling of attempts by militias to illegally export this oil resulted in the General National Congress, GNC, sacking former Prime Minister Ali Zeidan in March, while his replacement, interim Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni, resigned following an attack on his family home in the middle of April.  Somewhat controversially, due to doubts over the circumstances of his election, Ahmed Maiteeq, a prominent businessman with links to the Muslim Brotherhood, has now been nominated as Prime Minister-designate, the third Prime Minister so far this year and the fifth in the past two and a half years.  <\/p><p>  Recent weeks have seen a further deterioration.  On 16 and 17 May, forces loyal to the renegade, anti-Islamist, General Khalifa Haftar launched an extensive air and ground operation in Benghazi against Islamist militias, reportedly killing some 70 people.  Two days later, General Haftar sent his paramilitary force, the Libyan National Army, to attack the parliament building in Tripoli, precipitating heavy clashes which resulted in two dead and 60 wounded.  <\/p><p>  Both Ireland and the EU are extremely concerned at the repeated use of violence in Libya, and this latest deterioration in particular.  As was stated in reply to a parliamentary question last week, Ireland strongly condemns the actions of all militias in Libya and calls on all sides to refrain from further use of force and urgently to return to dialogue and reconciliation as a means of restoring stability.  The EU has also voiced its strong concerns over the current situation through a declaration on behalf of all 28 member states, which issued on 24 May.  The declaration called on all sides to refrain from the use of force and to address differences by political means.  It also emphasised the importance of an inclusive Libyan political dialogue and encouraged all parties to actively co-operate with the UN Special Mission in Libya in reaching agreement on a political roadmap for the transition period. <\/p><p>  High Representative Ashton last month appointed a special envoy for Libya, Mr. Bernardino Leon, to further co-ordinate and enhance the EU's actions in support of the Libyan people.  The special envoy visited Tripoli on 24 and 25 May and is actively engaged in efforts to promote urgent dialogue within Libya and a political way forward out of the current crisis.  The EU is also supporting the process of transition and post-conflict reconstruction within Libya through the EU Border Assistance Mission aimed at improving and developing the security of the country's borders. <\/p><p>  There is no doubting the desire of the Libyan people to fashion a new democratic dispensation within their country.  Fresh elections may be held in late June, and if these can proceed with broad agreement, it may provide an opportunity to promote that greater internal dialogue within Libya which is so urgently needed.  Similarly, work on preparation of a new constitution should proceed, following the election of a constitutional drafting assembly in April.  Ireland and the European Union will continue to offer all possible political support and assistance that they can to support the transition to democratic rule in Libya.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400018#Q00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1401900000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Three years ago when Prime Minister Cameron, former President Sarkosy and President Obama joined forces to bomb Libya, the Government here thought they were doing the right thing.  Will the Minister of State not admit at this stage that it was a serious mistake to intervene in the affairs of Libya because it has caused many more problems than it has solved?  With regard to the notion of humanitarian intervention, unfortunately, world powers are pretty selective when they choose to act and not to act and, more often than not, they are guided by self-interest rather than out of concern for the local people.<\/p><p>  When Serbia was bombed at the end of the 1990s, shortly afterwards the South Summit of 133 states convened in April 2000 and rejected &quot;the so-called 'right' of humanitarian intervention, which has no legal basis in the United Nations Charter or in the general principles of international law&quot;, yet we see it being used time and again, in particular, by the US and Britain.<\/p><p>When NATO bombed Serbia, it argued that it was within its area of jurisdiction.  It tried to disown what was going on in south-eastern Turkey in the 1990s, however, where Kurds were being slaughtered thanks to the military support of the Clinton Administration with the aid of other NATO powers.<\/p><p> The selective application of the responsibility to protect principle is stomach-churning.  There was, of course, no thought of applying that principle to the Iraq sanctions administered by the Security Council, which were condemned as &quot;genocidal&quot; by two directors of the oil for food programme, Denis Halliday and Hans von Sponeck, both of whom resigned in protest.  Mr. von Sponeck's detailed study of the horrendous impact of the sanctions has been under a virtual ban in the United States and United Kingdom, the primary agents of the programme.  Similarly, there is no thought today of protecting the people of Gaza - also a UN responsibility - who are being denied fundamental human rights.<\/p><p> In another domain, there is no thought of invoking even the most innocuous prescriptions of responsibility to protect in response to massive levels of starvation in poor countries.  While the UN estimates that the number facing hunger has passed 1 billion, its World Food Programme has just announced major cutbacks in aid as a result of rich countries reducing their meagre contributions and giving priority to their continued support for the arms industry and the bailing out of banks.

I take this opportunity to compliment all of those working in local authority emergency services and elsewhere who came to people's aid at that time.  In the intervening period, we have all had a chance to consider what exactly happened on 12 February.<\/p><p>  My specific concern relates to the process of planning for emergencies, particularly in respect of vulnerable cohorts such as children attending school.  My understanding is that the national meteorological service would have known 24 hours in advance that Storm Darwin, a full-blown hurricane, was due to hit the west coast.  For some reason, however, a decision was either taken or not taken which led to schools opening that morning, thereby putting children, parents and staff at an absolutely inordinate risk.  In some cases, at the height of the storm, text messages were being sent out by schools to parents asking them to collect their children.  There clearly was no joined-up plan for how vulnerable groups like children would be protected in these types of circumstances.<\/p><p>  On 27 May, in response to a question from me, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, pointed to the Department's circular PBU04\/04 as providing guidance to schools on this issue.  Unfortunately, that circular offers no level of comfort to school managers, teachers or principals, offering little advice other than that schools should provide their details to the local authority.  That is not really much good in the situation we saw on 12 February, where debris of every description was flying through the air, third level colleges were sending text messages to their students and staff to say that they were going into lock-down, and staff and principals of schools, particularly primary schools, were left to their own devices to figure out what they should do.<\/p><p>  What is required is a single protocol for all schools.  One of the first issues to be established is whether schools should open at all when a status red weather warning is issued and, if not, how that message can be communicated in a timely and effective manner.  Leaving schools to their own devices in this type of situation is not good enough.  There is anecdotal evidence of gates being taken off their piers and sent hurling through the air in the direction of parents collecting their children from school and of trees falling on cars.  How much of this was avoidable?  Although a man did lose his life while clearing up in the immediate aftermath of the storm, it was very fortunate that nobody died on the day itself.  Indeed, based on what we saw unfolding on our television screens, it is a miracle there was not widespread loss of life and injury.<\/p><p>  Leaving it to the devices of individual schools, managers, teachers and parents to decide whether or not it is safe to go out on an open road in the height of a hurricane to collect children is simply not good enough.  We must have stricter protocols in place and the Department should take the lead in their introduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400019#R00500","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1401900600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>The particular issue raised by the Deputy in the event of a status red severe weather warning code is a matter of wider application as it is equally applicable to the community in general.  The Government task force on emergency planning, in which my Department participates, co-ordinates the overall response to such events.  Departmental officials are currently engaging with the task force on this specific issue with a view to informing future practice.  Officials from the Department are also in consultation with the office of emergency planning of the Department of Defence to enable such protocols to be developed.  They are due to meet shortly with the management bodies for the primary and post-primary sector to review the issues and identify which measures should be put in place.<\/p><p>  The Department is aware that different weather events which warrant a red alert may have different implications for schools.<\/p><p>In particular, a weather event caused by severe wind, as experienced in January and February this year, presents particular issues in the potential damage it may cause and in the sudden and localised nature of such an event.  The red alert arising from a wind event will be taken into account in any protocols which may be devised.<\/p><p> Currently, the lead agencies in regard to determining the appropriate emergency response in any region where there is an extreme weather event or other critical incident are the local authorities and blue light services.  In that context, the Department of Education and Skills has brought to the attention of all schools departmental circular PBU 04\/04, entitled contingency planning in the context of a national emergency.  In particular, this circular requires schools to ensure up-to-date contact details are provided to the local authority.<\/p><p> The Department, as a member of the national co-ordinating committee, acts a conduit for information between the national authorities and the wider education sector at the time of such events.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has the responsibility for leading the response to weather related emergencies.

The Department of Education and Skills has a very important role in emergency planning.  Some 24 hours before this hurricane hit the country, we had information at our disposal and yet we allowed schools to open the following morning and children from as young as five years of age were put into a lethal environment, which was totally unnecessary.  Who in the meteorological service decided not to relay this information so that schools could be told to close?  What have we learned from that to ensure it will not happen again?  That is the crux of the issue.<\/p><p>  I appreciate there is a circular but no county manager will send out a notification to close a school.  There needs to be very clear protocols in place in the Department which can be given to school managers and principals telling them exactly what they should do.  For instance, is it safe to ask parents by text message to collect their child in the middle of a hurricane, putting them at risk by asking them to travel on roads on which they do not know what kind of debris they will find?  The child may well be safer left at school.<\/p><p>  Luckily we are not in the throes of winter but this issue needs to be taken much more seriously.  The Minister knows as well as I do that teaching principals in rural areas, which were the areas worst affected by this, have a million other things on their minds, but if they got a text message from a centralised service the night before telling them to close their schools the next day due to a red warning alert, it would be much more effective than a circular asking them to forward their details to the county manager who probably has been moved and has not taken down their names in the first place.<\/p><p>  This is a very serious issue.  We put children, their parents, their teachers and their minders at unnecessary risk when we knew 24 hours beforehand that there was a red alert and that a hurricane was going to hit the west coast.  As a State, we did nothing about it.  Luckily nobody was killed but will we be able to say that in the future?  We need proper and robust protocols in place to ensure we are not putting vulnerable people at unnecessary risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400020#S00200","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1401901200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter because I recall very acutely the events which took place.  Our information systems are out of balance with each other and the Deputy's timely raising of this matter is helpful.  We have much better long-term weather forecasts and the red alert system, which is relatively new, is certainly much more advanced than anything we had in the past ten to 15 years.  However, we have not upgraded the system in terms of school decision-making and I will give the Deputy a particular example.  I spoke to a principal in Kerry whose small school, although not that small, was severely damaged in that the roof came off part of it.   In fairness to her, whose name I will not mention, she telephoned her diocesan education secretary to find out who was to make the decision or what was the decision, but quite frankly, people did not necessarily know.<\/p><p>  We have a public private division in our education system in that the public side of it, controlled from this House, raises the money, sets the curriculum and so on, while the private side is the patron side.  The main patron is the Roman Catholic Church which is responsible for 93% of all the primary schools in the country.  Perhaps what the Deputy has alerted me to is to have a proper discussion with the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association to put protocols in place because it is not the function of the Department to instruct a school to close for whatever reason, although in this instance it was adverse weather.<\/p><p>  Principals do not necessarily want to take that unilateral decision and they certainly need guidance.  That is something which could be constructively raised with the new general secretary of the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, Monsignor Tom Deenihan, to see what should happen.  If the weather is bad, the CPSMA should make a decision and contact the principals and the boards of management to give principals the authority to notify parents in sufficient time that it is not safe to bring their children to school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400020#S00300","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Placement","time":1401901200,"counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400020#S00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1401901200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I am very grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise with the Minister for Education and Skills the need for him to provide an update on and to outline the provisions which have been put in place to provide additional school places in Greystones, Kilcoole and Delgany in County Wicklow.<\/p><p>We have a recurring problem in Greystones and in the wider Greystones area where in the run-up to September, there is a scramble for school places.  Parents who have been very dutiful and have put their child's name on a list in accordance with the right protocols and timeframes find themselves not knowing whether their child will have a school place in the school of their choice and in the school with the ethos of their choice as is their right as parents.  In some cases, they do not know whether their child will have a place in any school.  As the Minister can imagine, this is causing huge worry and stress.  I have dealt with this issue each September during my time in this House and before that.  It is a recurring issue that needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>In fairness to the Minister and his Department, extra classrooms were provided for St. Laurence's national school, St. Patrick's national school and St. Kevin's national school.  However what is happening is that we are falling into the sticking plaster solution where every year the Department meets the eight representatives of the eight schools in that catchment area.  The principals and the boards of management will acknowledge that the Department has been very helpful in trying to provide temporary solutions but they are only solutions to get them to the following September.<\/p><p>We need to engage in more long-term planning and my colleagues at local level - members of Wicklow County Council and members of the former Greystones Town Council - have expressed this concern to the Minister and to his Department.  We need a longer-term solution.  This is not a reflection on the Minister, who I have always found to be very helpful and forthcoming with information, but the answers to parliamentary questions I have submitted and which have been answered in the Minister's name have been less than forthcoming and have been mealy-mouthed.  I submitted a parliamentary question on this issue on 7 May 2014, Question No. 96, but I was not satisfied with the answer which provided me with no information.  I submitted another question three weeks later, Question No. 236 on 27 May 2014, asking a series of specific questions.  The words matter and I do not just include them to make the question look long.  Most of the elements of the question were ignored.  My office was told by civil servants in the Minister's Department to stop contacting them as it would not help resolve the matter.<\/p><p>As a public representative, Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and a supporter of this Government, I have been inundated with requests from worried parents - neighbours and friends in our community - wanting to know if their child will have a school place.  There should be a better system in place to engage with parents and provide information.  No parent should have to go to his or her TD to find out what the situation is in regard to a school place, but if he or she does, the TD should be able to find that information quite easily.  Will the Department look at some sort of collaborative role in regard to making information publicly available on websites in terms of the number of places provided within a catchment area <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the number of children expected to need to a school place this year?  When I ask questions about what action is being taken and when the review will be complete, it would be helpful if that information could be provided because some of the questions I am asking are also being asked by the local schools.  We have to do better.<\/p><p>Ultimately, we need another school in Greystones, and I have written to the Minister about this.<\/p><p>The reason for that is because the existing schools simply do not have the space to expand adequately.  Based on population figures, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has advised the area is to grow in population and we will have a population bulge in the future.  We need a new school in the area of Greystones known as Charlesland.  Will the Minister provide details on the situation that will arise in September and also take a longer term look to ensure we do not have the same problem again next year that has arisen in the past two to three years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400020#S00400","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401901800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I will respond directly to what Deputy Harris said, which might be a bit more constructive.  We have a growth in population that will not peak until 2026.  The problem is aggravated in many areas, including the area to which Deputy Harris referred, for all the normal reasons, but it will take time to put a response in place to my satisfaction and that will require support and confidence from the educational partners.  What is required is some form of co-ordinated regional planning at local authority level or education and training board level to see what resources exist and what can be utilised.  While we have a system of forward planning, there has been a significant population increase in the area to which Deputy Harris referred and the growth is happening at a faster speed.  Deputy Harris might talk to the local authorities on the matter, to his party&rsquo;s councillors and, following the local elections, the new education and training boards.<\/p><p>  The second issue relates to admissions policy and enrolment which is currently unsatisfactory.  A total of 80% of schools have the accommodation to offer a place to parents who apply to the 3,200 primary schools and approximately 800 post-primary schools, but 20% are oversubscribed in terms of their capacity to offer a place.  Added to that, there is no proper system of waiting list or regulations.  I have a document on admissions policy in draft form which I hope to get finalised and to bring before the House.  It was a consultative document which has already gone to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  The suggestion is that people who move within the country or come to the country for the first time are excluded from local schools because they are not in the know and they do not realise that in some cases when a child is born one must have his or her name put down on a waiting list for school X or Y.  The policy of first come, first served seems like an objective and reasonable one without favouritism for parents seeking education for their children, but it does provide a very strong advantage to parents who live in a particular area who know that they have to register their child for primary school education in virtually the week the child is born, and even then there is no guarantee of a place.  We have not even begun to tackle the issue of getting a child into a school whose ethos is one parents want.  That is another issue that requires discussion.<\/p><p>  I suggest to Deputy Harris that the Department is more than happy to liaise, and does liaise, with local authorities, but the way forward is to get the education and training boards, in conjunction with the Department and local authorities, to work together.  In the coming weeks 12 members of the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board will be nominated by the local councillors and there will be two staff members and five other representative members.  That is the way forward in terms of planning and making sure that we are making the best use of the existing space in the educational infrastructure.<\/p><p>  I do not wish to sound as if the Department has a grand plan to take over the private patronage role of the schools.  It does not, but we must ensure co-ordinated planning that provides and ensures space is available.  We are not in a position to do that as satisfactorily as we would like.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400021#T00200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1401901800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response and for responding directly to the issues I raised.  I have a problem with the official response that the Minister did not read in that the Department gave me a history lesson in terms of the places it did provide.  The class spaces the Minister provided are very much appreciated but they have been taken.  The schools have provided the Department with as much flexibility as they can within the existing campus sites in terms of accommodating additional students.  I still do not know, but much more importantly, the parents of children in Greystones, Delgany and Kilcoole who do not have a place today still do not know whether they will have a place.<\/p><p>  The line from the Department which has been frustrating me for some time is that the schools in the area are engaging with each other in the context of addressing enrolment demand for September 2014.  Could we try to put some meat on what exactly that means?  I would be extremely grateful if in the coming days somebody in the Department could liaise with me and the other Deputies for the Wicklow constituency to explain exactly where we are at, because this is a very time-sensitive situation as schools will shortly shut down for the summer and we must resolve the issue.<\/p><p>  I also wish to refer to the need for an additional school or for an existing school to move to a larger site in the Charlesland area.  That is something the Minister might ask his officials to examine.  The Minister is bang on the money in terms of what we need to do at a local level.  As part of local government reform, those whom we elect at local level must accept the responsibilities they have, but they must also be given more responsibilities in terms of ensuring there are adequate school places and sites and that there is a waiting list structure.  It is not adequate to be told that the schools are still working on the issue because September 2014 is very nearly here and we need to be able to give clarity to parents as to whether their child will have a place in any school, in particular a place in a school of their choice.  The Minister shares my view that plurality and a choice of ethos is important to parents as the primary educators of children in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400021#T00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1401901800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I will not comment specifically on Deputy Harris&rsquo;s area because I am not as well informed as he is, but in some areas there is close co-operation between the various primary schools in order that people know who has applied and there is a certain amount of sharing of information.  However, that is not always the case.  In fact, at the other end of the spectrum one has schools beating the bushes trying to find children that they can bring into a smaller school to maintain their teacher numbers.  Somewhere between those two extremes we must find a way forward that can take the stress away from parents.  I refer primarily to primary school places.  In some cases parents will not know for some time whether their four year old will get a place this September.<\/p><p>  The situation is due in the first instance to massive growth in population numbers.  A White Paper was published by the Department of Education and Skills in 1998 which said that the big task facing the primary school system in Ireland was managing the decline in population.  We had fewer than 480,000 schoolchildren and all the projections were that the population would decline.  We now have 525,000 and growing.  That means we must find extra space.  It also means building bigger schools.  There is a certain reluctance among some to contemplate that.  One can provide far more accommodation in a much more effective and economic way with a two stream or three stream school, which is 24 classes or more.  Some people do not want to have their child in such a school or say that it was not the kind of school they attended.  My primary function, and that of the Department, is to make sure that no parent is deprived of a school place in the first instance and preferably a school place of their choice.  Providing the accommodation in the first instance must be a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400021#T00400","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Investigation","time":1401901800,"counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400021#T00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1401901800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>My Topical Issue matter follows a second report in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>newspaper about the challenges faced by the computer crime investigation unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Very properly, we already have significant penalties for child pornography offences under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.<\/p><p>  When this matter came to my attention, I immediately sought a report from the Acting Garda Commissioner on the question of any backlogs in this area, including with respect to proposals to address any difficulties which have arisen.  As Deputies will appreciate, specific investigative strategies are a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but I consider it essential, as does the Deputy, that garda&iacute; are in a position to investigate these crimes effectively.  I have now received a preliminary report on the matter from the Acting Commissioner which addresses the role of the Garda computer crime investigation unit, CCIU, and its central input in the investigation of these kinds of crimes.<\/p><p>  A review of processes at the CCIU has been conducted with a view to reducing the time taken to conduct the forensic examination of suspect computer media in the context of seeking to identify evidence of child pornography images.  Arising from this, and in the light of consultations with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and senior counsel, new standard operating guidelines were put in place in October 2013.  The guidelines seek to ensure that relevant procedures are as efficient as possible, consistent with what is required to support effective prosecutions.  I am further advised that all examinations of suspect media are now conducted according to these guidelines.  The aim of the guidelines is to ensure effective action is taken in a timely way to deal with this issue.<\/p><p>  The phenomenon of Internet and computer crime, with its transnational dimension, presents enormous challenges to police forces.  I am informed that approximately 70% of crime in this area is transnational.  It is also challenging with respect to the deployment of resources to tackle this issue.  It is complex, complicated and a continuously emerging area for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with and cuts across a number of other areas as well as child pornography.<\/p><p>  The Acting Garda Commissioner has directed an immediate comprehensive review and a strategic realignment of capacity to deal with crimes of this nature, including in the area of child pornography.  This will involve liaison with international partners because so much of it is transnational and a key part is linking with partners in Europe and worldwide so national experts can come together to figure out the best collaborative approaches to deal with this type of crime.<\/p><p>  I welcome the important review done in this area by the Acting Garda Commissioner and following examination of the report which I received today, I intend to meet her to discuss the issues raised by the Deputy and, in particular, to ensure that child pornography cases are pursued rigorously and quickly.

It is undoubtedly experiencing a downward death spiral and an approximate average of 4,000 customers left the market each month in the year up to March 2014.  Moreover, 21,000 people have left since the beginning of this year alone, that is, approximately 1,600 per week have quit during the first three months of this year.  There has been a haemorrhaging of young and healthy customers from the market, which threatens the very sustainability of the health insurance market into the future, leading to much higher premiums for those who remain in the health insurance market, as well as creating huge pressures for the public health system as Members are aware and as is being experienced.<\/p><p>  In response to this, Government policy is incoherent.  Insured patients are now subject to dramatically increased charges for public hospital beds - up to approximately &euro;852 per night - which constitutes a dramatic increase.  If one adds to this the significant curtailment of tax relief that was announced in this year's budget, overall one gets a Government charge of approximately &euro;300 million.  The Government has dipped into the pockets of private health insured people to the tune of approximately &euro;300 million in recent times.  All of this has had a dramatic impact and has accelerated further the exodus from the health insurance market itself.  Meanwhile, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, peddles the mandatory universal health model, which is vague and uncosted.  Incidentally, I note the Taoiseach failed to voice confidence in the Minister for Health yesterday, having been asked to so do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400023#V00500","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1401903000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>How could he?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400023#V00600","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1401903000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Does the Government accept there is a crisis in the health insurance market?

The Government is committed to the ongoing sustainability of the health insurance market as part of the transition to a market-based universal health insurance system.  At the end of March 2014, some 2.3031 million people were insured with inpatient health insurance plans.  While the number of people covered has fallen from a peak in 2008, Ireland continues to retain a high level of population holding voluntary private health insurance at 44.2%.  The Minister for Health desires the best possible environment within which more people, particularly young people, will wish to obtain and retain private health insurance cover that is affordable, competitive and meets consumer needs.<\/p><p>  He intends to introduce shortly a series of measures to help to support the sustainability and competitiveness of the private health insurance market.  This includes lifetime community rating to encourage people to join health insurance schemes at a young age and to retain their private health insurance cover.  In addition, the Minister will announce shortly an initiative on mandatory discounts for young adults.  The Government is committed to keeping affordable health insurance for as many people as possible.  To this end, the Minister has made clear to the health insurers his belief that significant savings from within the industry can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums.  The recently-published McLoughlin interim report on health insurance costs made recommendations in a number of different areas, including the important role of clinical audit in identifying unnecessary claims.  Moreover, the need to address the age structure of the private health insurance market is also important.  As I already mentioned, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, will provide further details on his plans in this regard shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400023#V01200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1401903000,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I put it to the Minister that the market is no longer affordable for many people, particularly younger people, who are leaving the system in their droves.

There are very great concerns in the west and in the north west that this report, if implemented, could result in the closure of maternity services in that region.  Is the Minister aware that the founder and 50% shareholder of this private consultancy firm was appointed by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, as chairperson of the west-north west hospitals group, a major State public health body?  Does the Minister accept that this is a significant conflict of interest?  Surely it is not appropriate that a major player in a private health consultancy firm that promotes privatisation of health services is appointed as the chair of a major public health body.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Health has admitted that the commissioning of the report by this health partnership was not in accordance with HSE national financial regulations.

I also said that the way forward is to use the industrial relations machinery of the State, if it can be helpful to bring the two sides together.  This dispute should be resolved, as industrial disputes are resolved, by talking and by compromise and by coming to a solution.  I do not think it achieves anything to have a tirade against one side when there are two sides to every industrial dispute.  At the end of the day, management and the representatives of the workers will have to sit down and resolve this dispute and they should do so sooner rather than later without discommoding the Irish public further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400024#W01400","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1401903600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I note the Minister did not take the opportunity of the intervening week to read up on the issues at stake.

The Order of Business went a bit quicker than I expected.<\/p><p>The amendment relates to amendments of Part 3 of the Bill where a narrow definition of human rights is used, in terms of enforcement issues but also on a wide range of other functions of the human rights commission.  The narrow definition would overly restrict the commission in carrying out its role.  The amendment seeks to retain the narrow definition for sections 36 to 39, inclusive, and section 41 which relate to the enforcement role of the commission and to allow the broader definition of human rights, as contained in the Bill, to apply to such roles and functions as the providing of information to the public, the development of codes of practice, equality reviews, action plans and carrying out inquiries.  This would be a better interpretation to use within the Bill and would allow the commission to work to its full capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400027#Z00300","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1401905400,"counter":292,"content":"<p>These two proposed amendments relate to the definitions of human rights in the Bill and were discussed at length on Committee Stage.  The definition in section 2 gives the commission a mandate to promote human rights in the widest sense, not limited to Irish law or to conventions that we have ratified, or, indeed, to any existing international convention.  The commission can seek to develop and promote new human rights standards and its discretion in that regard is unfettered.<\/p><p>The definition in section 29 deals with legal or enforcement powers and, accordingly, it is appropriate that it refers exclusively to human rights that are recognised in Irish law.  I should mention again that the Department met the Office of the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, ODHCHR, in October 2012 as part of the consultative process with that office following publication of the general scheme of the Bill.  At that meeting, the Department explained that the rationale of having two separate definitions was to give the new body every possible freedom to work towards the enhancement of the human rights environment in Ireland.<\/p><p>There have also been calls for one unified definition of human rights in the Bill.  Of course, human rights are indivisible and inviolable but the technical device of having two definitions does not challenge that principle in any way.  If we had to have just one definition, it would have to be a narrow definition and be confined to Irish law because we cannot give the commission or any other State agency legal or enforcement powers in respect of matters that are not part of Irish law.  I believe one narrow definition would be a retrograde step because the commission would lose much of its ability to be creative in the promotion of human rights.<\/p><p>However, what we can do, as set out in the Bill, is give the commission the freedom to promote human rights on as broad a basis as possible, and reflect new normative developments at an international level in its work.  In doing so, we have to be clear that its mandate in monitoring compliance with specific human rights standards is limited, as it must be, to those enshrined in Ireland's legislative framework in accordance with the rule of law.  The intention is to allow the commission to be creative in its promotion of human rights principles as broadly understood, but to observe the rule of law in the area of enforcement of standards.  The ODHCHR noted that this approach seemed very close to how the High Commissioner for Human Rights sought to describe her own role, relating to the protection of clearly defined rights and the promotion of broader human rights principles.  The ODHCHR stated that the two definitions approach is a new best practice model which it will encourage other member states to adopt.<\/p><p>The effect of the Deputy's amendment would be to take sections 29 to 35, inclusive, and section 40 out of the enforcement and compliance definition - the narrower definition - of human rights we have in section 29 and into the broader definition in section 2 that relates to wider promotion of which spoke.  I will take a number of the sections, if the Deputy will bear with me, and state what the impact would be of doing that.  For example, section 29 contains the enforcement and compliance definition.  Acceptance of the amendment would create a logical problem because we would be saying that the phrase &quot;human rights&quot; in section 29 means both.  This would make for legal uncertainty and some confusion about what the Bill actually means.<\/p><p>Section 30 relates to provision of information about and keeping under review of Irish legislation on human rights and equality.  Legislation on human rights falls logically within the narrower definition in section 29, but there is no restriction on the commission in how it keeps legislation under review or what recommendations it may make.  Subsection (2) states that the commission may make such recommendations as it sees fit.  Clearly, information to the public is information about what our domestic legislation contains, but there is nothing to stop the commission providing also an individual person or the public generally with information about relevant international instruments that are not part of our law or expressing the view that our legislation needs to be updated.  The commission can provide information on the detail of legislation but, equally, is in a position to make the broader reference to what the international situation might be or where the law might go in the future.  Indeed, subsection (2) makes it explicit that the commission has an entirely free hand in making recommendations for changes in the law.<\/p><p>On the impact of Deputy Pringle's amendment on section 31, when signed into law by the Minister a code of practice can be relied on in court proceedings and used in evidence.  It would be <i>ultra vires<\/i>for me or any other Minister to sign into law a statutory instrument that goes beyond what Irish law allows or requires.  To do so would destroy the credibility of the idea of having statutory codes of practice that can be relied upon by both parties to a potential dispute.<\/p><p>We have one code of practice, for example, on sexual harassment, and I think there is room to use this mechanism more in the future.  This only works, however, if we all understand that the commission is giving advice on best practice within our legal framework as it exists and the Minister is signing that advice into law.  This is not a device that can be used to legislate by the back door for international legal instruments that have not been ratified by the national parliament.  I think the Deputy will appreciate that.<\/p><p>Taking sections 32 to 34, inclusive, the words &quot;human rights&quot; are not found in any of these sections.  The sections are in Part 3, because they relate to enforcement and compliance matters.  They are covered by the narrower definition in section 29 simply as a matter of legal neatness.  By that I mean, it is easier for anyone following the Bill if one definition applies to Part 3 and another applies to the rest of the Bill.  However, in fact, the two definitions of human rights are not actually relevant to these particular sections.<\/p><p>Section 35 deals with inquiries.  The power of inquiry set out in this section is a serious power, including the power to demand the attendance of witnesses and production of documents.  It is based on the understanding that it could never be permissible to conduct an inquiry where there is no allegation or reasonable belief that a breach of statutory duty has occurred.  That is why the narrower of the two definitions of human rights in the Bill applies here.  It could not be permissible in law for the commission to conduct an inquiry without it having expressed any reasonable belief or made any credible accusation that standards demanded by Irish law had been breached.<\/p><p>The Irish Human Rights Commission has confirmed to my Department that the three inquiries undertaken by the commission were undertaken with the tacit agreement of the parties, probably could not have been undertaken without that tacit agreement and were in each case grounded, <i>inter alia<\/i>, on the European Convention on Human Rights which comes within the narrower definition.<\/p><p>In the course of the inquiry, however, and in its conclusions and recommendations, the commission may consider best practice and international standards, and in that regard is free, in this instance, as well, to draw from wider definitions of human rights and of equal treatment than are currently set out in domestic legislation.  What it cannot do is launch an inquiry into something that it, as the commission, does not consider or allege is a breach of applicable Irish law.<\/p><p>Section 41, which would be impacted by the amendment, relates to the provision of legal assistance to a person who wishes to institute legal proceedings in a matter involving human rights law.  I think the amendment would not really change this or achieve anything useful.  The commission is free to offer such assistance if it thinks, and, of course, if the would-be plaintiff thinks, there is an arguable case involving law or practice relating to human rights.  Neither has to prove the case.  That is what the court hearing is for.  The courts will not entertain a case which seeks to rely on something that is not part of Irish law and does not make any effort to ground the action in the Irish Constitution or the European Convention on Human Rights, to which we are a party and which is part of the narrower definition, or in our domestic legislation.  Changing the definitions here will not change that reality.<\/p><p>There is, of course, nothing to stop the commission, once the threshold of having an arguable case has been crossed, from supporting an applicant in referring to other international standards and in drawing the court's attention to the State's wider international obligations, including in respect of international conventions we have signed but not ratified.  However, the commission cannot legislate or take any action to enforce rights for which the Oireachtas has not legislated.<\/p><p>By dealing with each of those sections, I hope I have clarified why I am not accepting the proposed amendment.  In places it could create possible legal uncertainty with the text and in others it would create substantial problems about the constitutionality of the Bill.  I am opposing the amendment, therefore, and I hope the Deputy will understand the reasons I am doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400027#Z00400","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1401906000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1401906000,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<blockquote>In page 9, between lines 18 and 19 to insert the following:<b>&quot;8. <\/b>Pursuant to the Good Friday Agreement, an international agreement of which this Government is a co-guarantor, the Irish Government will take steps to further strengthen the protection of human rights in its jurisdiction.  The Government will bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights.  These proposals will draw on the European Convention on Human Rights and other international legal instruments in the field of human rights and the question of the incorporation of the ECHR will be further examined in this context.  The measures brought forward would ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland.

As the Minister will be aware, our concerns are that it undermines the Good Friday Agreement.  When we from this State would ask those within unionism to support the Good Friday Agreement and implement it in full, particularly the human rights dimensions and to have a Human Rights Act in the North, the fact that we have amalgamated our Human Rights Commission with the Equality Authority does not put us on a very strong platform to lecture them about their responsibilities.<\/p><p>This amendment is aimed essentially at respecting the Good Friday Agreement and it is a challenge to the Bill.  It lays out our fundamental and most serious concerns about this legislation.  Rather than strengthening the State's human rights and equality framework, this is just about saving money.  It is about describing or labelling important institutions that protect the human rights and equality of citizens of this State as quangos.  We are told they have to be amalgamated because there are too many quangos, but that is deeply unfortunate.<\/p><p>A number of years ago, the Equality Authority's budget was slashed by 34%.  That led to the resignation of the authority's widely respected chairman.  There is a fear and concern that the protection of citizens' human rights has been undermined and that this Bill is unfortunately another step in that direction.  Primarily, this amendment is about our concerns over the Good Friday Agreement.  The Bill will undermine the Government when it seeks unionism to implement and meet its responsibilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400028#AA00700","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1401906000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>There was a long discussion about this issue on Committee Stage when the arguments were put to the Deputy about why the Bill was not doing what he suggests.  The position remains that the text in amendment No. 2 is technically inappropriate for legislation.  If the Government were to take forward actions on the lines suggested, these would either be matters for policy and allocation of resources or otherwise issues that would need to be addressed in legislation.  However, one does not put into legislation that the Government should bring forward proposals that may require legislation.  Instead, we just get on with implementing the policy programme of the Government of the day and where this requires legislation, such legislation is brought forward.<\/p><p>  In this case, as the Deputy said, we are merging the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission.  My predecessor consulted the then Northern Ireland Secretary of State around the time this proposal was announced.  I can assure the House that there are no adverse implications for our commitments under the Good Friday Agreement or for our relationship with Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  Equivalence of protection relates to substantive human rights law and not to questions of institutional structures, which will always operate differently in different jurisdictions.

The job description for the position as advertised by the Public Appointments Service includes key responsibilities, and Deputies are very familiar with them.  The person shall act as chairperson of the commission and its committees as appropriate and ensure that the commission operates as a collegiate body; provide strategic leadership to the commission, including leading on the development of the strategic plan and the strategic plan cycle; represent and act as the public voice of the commission, including participation in relevant national and international forums; and support and supervise generally the director in the exercise of his or her statutory functions and the day-to-day administration of the commission&rsquo;s business.  An outstanding individual is sought to become chief commissioner and this person should be able to give strategic direction to the work of the IHREC.

That said, we thought it useful to provide that the chief commissioner should set out his or her personal key priorities and objectives for his or her term of office as part of the commission&rsquo;s strategy statement.  That is the right approach as the statement will be laid before the House.  The approach I am recommending in this amendment therefore gives an opportunity for the chief commissioner to engage directly with the committee on what his or her personal contribution and priorities will be.  This will be laid out for the term of office or the life of the particular strategy statement.<\/p><p>This amendment allows for increased engagement by the commission with the Parliament through work in committees.

This is so on the basis of provisions in the relevant directives that prohibit a regression in existing standards of protection.  This obligation exists even though these provisions have not been used in recent years in practice.<\/p><p>  Section 33, to which the amendment relates, provides that, in connection with preparing either an equality review or an equality action plan, the commission may serve a substantive notice on a person to supply information with regard to an equality review or action plan.  Such a notice may also be served if an undertaking fails to implement the requirements of an equality action plan as outlined in section 32.  This section also provides an opportunity for an undertaking to appeal such a notice and a penalty for failure to comply, other than in the case of a successful appeal being lodged.  The notice takes effect, and has the force of law, after the expiry of 56 days, but a person can appeal within 42 days to the Labour or District Court as appropriate.  In the current legislation, notices take effect after 42 days, but 42 days is also the deadline for taking an appeal.<\/p><p>  Following consultation with the Equality Tribunal, the length of time for taking an appeal in relation to this section remains unchanged, but the period of time after which a notice takes effect is being extended to 56 days.  This is to avoid a situation where an appeal is lodged on the last day possible and on the immediately following day the Commission, which may not have notice of the appeal, commences enforcement action.  Such legal confusion is to be avoided if at all possible.  It is good practice to leave a &quot;gap&quot; and two weeks seems a reasonable length of time and not excessive.

A huge amount of work and practice have developed together with engagement with the social partners which has led to huge improvements in equality standards in the workplace.

That is a very good way to promote best practice, highlighting the good practice to which bodies that have not yet reached that standard can aspire.<\/p><p>The Deputy referred to ongoing evaluation and review in regard to the UK example.  I put on the record that the working group that was established to advise the then Minister on practical issues in regard to the merger recommended this specific approach to the creation of a positive duty on public bodies.  It went on to recommend that a formal review of the operation of this section be undertaken by the Government in consultation with the IHREC after a period of three or five years.  I am happy that such a review should take place and I believe it should happen after three years.  The review should assess the effectiveness of the public sector duty in securing improved human rights and equality outcomes and in assisting public bodies to pre-empt problems on an evidential basis.  The evidence could be gathered by way of an independent evaluation commissioned jointly by the IHREC and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The review should also assess whether there is a need to modify or develop the recommended arrangements, including whether there is a need to institute a formal review and monitoring mechanism and the question of integration with other regulatory assessment procedures, on the basis of the evidence.<\/p><p>The key point I would make in regard to the Bill, as it is worded, is that it presents an opportunity to view the new provision as a positive and developmental opportunity in the way I have outlined in terms of developing human rights standards through the various mechanisms which the commission has at its disposal, rather than at this point thinking in more legalistic and enforcement terms.  I accept part of the point the Deputy made, namely, that we must have ongoing assessment.  The review that will be done, and as I said I would prefer if it took place after three years, will give us information as to how matters are progressing and whether more detailed mechanisms are needed at that point.  I am not accepting to the amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1401908400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>How stands the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400032#EE00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1401908400,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I wish to press it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400032#EE00300","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1401908400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1401908700,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1401908700,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill do now pass.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"vote","time":1401908700,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 79; N\u00edl, 29.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Paul Kehoe and Emmet Stagg; N\u00edl, Deputies Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl and Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400033#FF00150","aye":["980","974","1016","946","989","1029","1030","1042","975","1092","988","1031","972","1041","1099","1091","1046","968","1075","1007","1011","957","1078","1105","1009","1055","951","1051","1076","995","1106","949","967","1097","973","1033","1012","1098","1088","1021","1110","1053","990","1023","996","1180","1194","1000","997","1082","1038","1070","985","1034","1067","1056","1045","1018","1060","1058","1073","971","1061","964","966","1035","947","952","1074","1013","1048","961","978","1010","1095","948","950","1185","1024"],"nay":["1066","1003","1190","1071","1193","1057","1083","1101","1037","959","1022","960","998","999","1017","1090","993","981","1052","969","1044","1054","1028","984","1059","1001","1178","1102","1080"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2014: Order for Second Stage","time":1401909000,"counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400034#GG00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1401909000,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400034#GG00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1401909000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2014: Second Stage","time":1401909000,"counter":345,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400034#GG00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1401909000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p><p>  Just over three years ago in the programme for Government, we pledged to change the social welfare system to make it fairer, better structured, more transparent and less open to abuse.  We pledged, among other things, to provide a fit-for-purpose system, provide better services, remove poverty traps and, critically, focus on providing opportunities for jobseekers.  In the Social Welfare Bills I have introduced over that time, many significant structural reforms and changes have been implemented, as acknowledged by the European Commission, the IMF and similar institutions.  These reforms have helped us maintain a very strong social welfare safety net, despite being in an EU-IMF bailout programme up to the end of last year and having to reduce State expenditure to get the public finances in check.<\/p><p>  Research conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, in tandem with my Department, and published last December shows that approximately 87% of all households in Ireland receive social transfers, such as jobseekers' payments, pensions and child benefit.  We pay child benefit in respect of every child, we have a strong support system for those unfortunate enough to lose their job and we have a State pension structure that has dramatically reduced pensioner poverty.  Ireland's system of social transfers remains the most effective in the EU in reducing poverty and is far superior to that of the other countries most affected by the crisis.  The fact we maintained this safety net throughout the worst financial crisis this country has ever seen is one of the key reasons we are now emerging on the other side and I am not the only one who believes this.<\/p><p>  In its Society at a Glance 2014 report on Ireland, which was published earlier this year, the OECD said: &quot;Income losses in Ireland would have been far greater without a functioning and adequately resourced social protection system&quot;.  It also said that the &quot;focus now needs to be on helping people get off benefits and back into work&quot;.  This is precisely what the Department is doing.<\/p><p>  Since coming to office, I have focused on transforming the Department from a passive benefits provider to an active and engaged public employment service through the Pathways to Work strategy.  Through Pathways to Work, we are getting people back to work and that is the single best way of reducing welfare expenditure.  Every 10,000 people we help to leave the live register saves approximately &euro;95 million in welfare expenditure per year.  That in turn creates the room to protect key services, supports and schemes in other areas of the Department.  People at work, through their taxes and PRSI, fund the system safe in the knowledge that it will be there for them or their families when they need it.  We need to thank the people at work who are paying the taxes and contributing the PRSI for this system which ensure we have adequate social safety nets.  This is a key element of the social bargain and I am grateful that the public has continued to support a very strong social protection system in Ireland when the mood in some other countries has been notably different.  However, to maintain that public support, it is essential that we ensure every euro of the welfare budget is properly spent and where fraud or error arises, that we recover the overpayments as appropriate.<\/p><p>  In this Bill, I am building on the reforms made to date to further improve the system, safeguard its sustainability and ensure Ireland continues to have a very strong welfare state to protect those who need it.  I have introduced a comprehensive package of changes in the area of fraud and control over the past three years.  Effective debt recovery is a key aspect of the Department's control policy as outlined in the new compliance and anti-fraud strategy 2014-18, which I launched in April this year.  It is an integral part of the deterrent approach to control fraud and error.  It ensures that people who have been overpaid realise they have a responsibility to repay and that the Department will take appropriate steps to obtain recovery.  I make no apologies for this, because it ensures that the social welfare budget is there for those who need it most.<\/p><p>  Most social welfare customers receive only the payment to which they are entitled.  However, where overpayments arise, whether through fraud or error, it is essential that these moneys are recovered.  The Department now has greater powers to recover money that has been erroneously paid out or claimed fraudulently.  In 2012, I introduced legislation which allows for up to 15% of the personal rate of the person's social welfare entitlement to be deducted where there is an outstanding overpayment.  Last year, I introduced additional powers for the recovery of social welfare overpayments by way of notice of attachment to earnings and-or money held by an overpaid person in a financial institution.  This measure was designed to improve the Department's ability to recover overpayments from persons with disposable assets or earned income and who are generally are no longer dependent on social welfare payments.<\/p><p>  The Bill further extends the powers of the Department to recover social welfare overpayments.  Notice of attachment provisions are being extended to allow recovery from payments being made or to be made by public bodies such as Government Departments.  In this way, we can ensure that one arm of Government is not paying out lump sums to individuals who owe significant amounts of money in respect of welfare overpayments.  <\/p><p>  I am also bringing in changes to ensure that money can be recovered from employers or former employers.  It is the responsibility of an employer to make statutory redundancy payments to its eligible employees.  Where the employer cannot afford to make these payments, lump sum payments can be made by the Department from the Social Insurance Fund.  This creates a debt against the employer for the amount paid and I am now proposing that these debts be recovered by deduction from any refund of employer PRSI to which that employer may be entitled.  I firmly believe that all possible steps should be taken to recover moneys due to the Department and these measures will add to the measures I have already put in place to achieve this.  <\/p><p>  These new powers have significantly improved the Department's ability to recover moneys from individuals who do not make reasonable efforts to repay their debt while having due regard to their financial circumstances.  In 2012, just over &euro;53.3 million was recovered in overpayments, while the amount recovered in 2013 was approximately &euro;70 million.  Bear in mind that free travel, for instance, which our pensioners, in particular rightly value, costs the State approximately &euro;77 million per year.  The scale of the recoveries really allows certain vital areas to be supported financially.  <\/p><p>  I am also making changes to ensure that people must continue to be habitually resident in the State to receive certain social welfare payments.  Until now an evaluation of the person's habitual residence was only made at the time of application.  From now on, habitual residence may be reviewed after the date of award to ensure that residence conditions continue to be satisfied.  Also, to clarify the application of the habitual residence test, the presumption that persons are not habitually resident in the State if they have not been present for a continuous period of two years in the common travel area at the date of making the application is being removed.  This is what people often call the two-year rule.  <\/p><p>  I am also taking the opportunity in this Bill to transpose the provisions relevant to the social welfare code of EU Directive 2010\/41 on the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity.<\/p><p>I am also taking the opportunity in the Bill to transpose the provisions relevant to the social welfare code of EU Directive 2010\/41 on the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity.  The social welfare provisions of the directive mean ending the exclusion from social insurance of spouses or civil partners of a self-employed worker who participate in the activities of their self-employed spouse or civil partner performing the same or ancillary tasks.  The effect of the provision is to allow those categories of worker access to social insurance for the first time.  The majority of people who will be affected by the measure are women.  It is particularly important that spouses - many of whom are women - of self-employed people, or self-employed farmers, will be eligible to have social insurance cover.  In other words, this Bill will extend social insurance cover to spouses or civil partners of a self-employed contributor in cases where the spouse or civil partner is participating in the person's business and earning more than &euro;5,000 a year.  Up to now only one of the couple could be insured as a self-employed worker for social insurance benefits.  This means that the spouse or civil partner will, under the social insurance system, be able to establish entitlement over time to maternity benefit, widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory pension and State pension contributory in their own right.  This is a very important and welcome reform and will provide excellent value for those involved.  I am very pleased to be able to introduce the measure.<\/p><p>As the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund 2010 pointed out, social insurance benefits &quot;offer excellent value for money&quot; for the self employed.  The review stated:<blockquote>The self employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed - when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  Self-employed contributions are charged at the rate of 4% of reckonable income over &euro;5,000 or &euro;253, whichever is the greater.  Self-employed contributors who pay the minimum contribution of &euro;253 and build up a sufficient contribution history to qualify for the State pension contributory are getting exceptional value for money.  To put the matter into context, individuals paying at the minimum &euro;253 per year over a full working life will receive a pension of &euro;230.30 per week during retirement.<\/blockquote>I hope the measure will be availed of by the spouses of the self employed, especially as many of them are women.<\/p><p>In this Bill I am also strengthening the residence requirements relating to entitlement to means-assessed social welfare payments by requiring the qualified adult of recipients of those payments to be resident in the State or not in prison in order for the qualified adult increase to be paid.  This means that increases in jobseeker's allowance, pre-retirement allowance, supplementary welfare allowance, disability allowance or farm assist in respect of the qualified adult of the recipient will not be payable for any period during which the qualified adult is resident, whether temporarily or permanently, outside the State, or in prison or otherwise detained in legal custody.<\/p><p>In regard to family income supplement, FIS, the Bill will ensure that, in general, once a family qualifies for FIS, payment of the supplement will continue for 52 weeks regardless of a change in circumstances, such as an increase in weekly earnings.  As Deputies are aware, FIS is a weekly tax-free, top-up payment for employees on low pay with children.  It is one of the major incentives and supports to people with children in low-paid work to bring up their income.  At present, more than 44,000 working families with more than 98,000 children benefit from the scheme.  The Department's spend on FIS will increase to more than &euro;280 million this year - a 25% increase since 2012.  I have placed a very high priority on FIS because all the evidence shows that families are better off in work and FIS helps them to continue in work and build towards financial independence.  FIS is crucially important to working families, and the measure in the Bill is about ensuring that families in receipt of the supplement have security and peace of mind about the length of their payment - that it is a full 52 weeks.<\/p><p>In the area of pensions, the Bill provides for an amendment to the Pensions Act to clarify the notification procedures on a direction from the pensions authority to the trustees of a pension scheme to restructure their scheme.  I will table three amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage to allow for the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, to allow secondment of garda&iacute; to the Department of Social Protection, to allow Irish Water to use PPSNs, and to facilitate the transfer of data on households with children to enable the provision of a water allowance for children in the context of the huge data we hold on child benefit.<\/p><p>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title.  Section 2 defines a number of common terms.  Section 3 provides for changes to enable functions relating to payment of benefit or assistance and related payment services to be provided under arrangements with selected payment service providers.  Section 4 provides that only gains from share option transactions which result in the employee actually receiving shares will come within the definition of &quot;share-based remuneration&quot; in order to benefit from the exemption from employer PRSI liability.<\/p><p>Section 5 clarifies the powers contained in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 enabling the Minister for Social Protection to provide for refunds of employer PRSI contributions in the case of certain seafarers employed onboard vessels that are registered in a member state of the EU or European Economic Area and are providing scheduled passenger services between ports within those states.<\/p><p>Section 6 provides that where an employer has a debt owing to the Minister in respect of redundancy lump sum payments and the employer qualifies for a refund of PRSI contributions, the debt owing to the Minister can be recovered from the PRSI refund.  The Redundancy Payments Act 1967 provides for lump sum payments by employers to their employees upon their dismissal by reason of redundancy.  Where an employer does not pay such a lump sum payment to his or her employees who have been made redundant, the Redundancy Payments Act provides that such payments can be made by the Minister for Social Protection to the employee.  The Minister can then recover such amounts from the employer.<\/p><p>Section 7 provides that increases in jobseeker's allowance, pre-retirement allowance, supplementary welfare allowance, disability allowance or farm assist in respect of the qualified adult of the recipient will not be payable for any period during which the qualified adult is resident, whether temporarily or permanently, outside the State, or in prison or otherwise detained in legal custody.<\/p><p>Sections 8 and 9 clarify the rules on entitlement to family income supplement and set out the circumstances in which a claimant who is living apart from his or her spouse or civil partner and children can still claim the supplement; and ensure that, in general, once a family qualifies for family income supplement, payment of the supplement will continue for 52 weeks regardless of a change in circumstances, such as an increase in weekly earnings.  Section 9 also provides that where payment of FIS ceases to be paid to a family during the 52 week entitlement period and the family requalifies for FIS before the end of the 52 week period, then payment of FIS will recommence for the unexpired portion of the 52 week period at the rate that was payable at the start of the 52 week period.  That is to facilitate people who might go in and out of employment.<\/p><p>Section 10 provides for changes in respect of the application of the habitual residence condition, HRC, for entitlement to certain social welfare payments.  The presumption that persons are not habitually resident in the State if they have not been present for a continuous period of two years in the common travel area at the date of making the application is being removed.<\/p><p>In addition, a person must satisfy the habitual residence condition for the duration of his or her claim in order for entitlement to continue.  This also allows for the review of habitual residence in respect of persons who were not required to satisfy such conditions under EU law at the date of application for the schemes concerned.  Habitual residence is just one condition of these payments.  A person must also satisfy other conditions to receive a payment.<\/p><p> Section 11 provides for a number of amendments, consequential to the changes in section 11, to uncommenced provisions contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008 relating to the transfer of responsibility for the blind welfare allowance scheme from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection.  Section 12 is a minor technical amendment to correct an incorrect reference.<\/p><p> Sections 13 and 14 extend the powers for the recovery of social welfare overpayments to include recovery from certain lump sum payments made by the Minister for Social Protection to that person, that is, refunds of PRSI contributions, lump sum payments made under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 and the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984.  Section 15 extends the provisions relating to the recovery of social welfare overpayments by way of a notice of attachment to include situations where the person who has been overpaid has sources of income from payments made from State funds, for example, grants, refunds and repayment of tax.<\/p><p> Section 16 provides for the transposition of Directive 2010\/41\/EU on the application of equal treatment between men and women engaged in self-employment activity, in so far as that directive relates to ensuring that the spouse or civil partner of a self-employed worker can benefit from social protection in accordance with national law.  Section 17 provides for the deletion of three uncommenced amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 which are no longer necessary.  Section 18 provides for a number of minor amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to correct minor typographical and textual errors.<\/p><p> Section 19 defines the term &quot;Act of 1990&quot;, which is used for the purposes of Part 3, as meaning the Pensions Act 1990.  Section 20 clarifies the detail to be provided by trustees to scheme members in the notification, including the right to appeal to the High Court in situations when the Pensions Authority issues or proposes to issue a unilateral direction to the trustees of a scheme to restructure a scheme.  Section 21 provides for similar clarification regarding the notification of scheme members in advance of the Pensions Authority making a direction to wind up a defined benefit scheme.  Section 22 amends section 50C of the Pensions Act to cross-reference the new section inserted.<\/p><p> In the Bill, I am making a number of important changes to the social welfare system to ensure that money continues to be spent on those in genuine need, and every opportunity to recover money owing is explored and used.  The requirement for a strong and sustainable welfare state has been a lifelong conviction of mine and despite inheriting the worst economic crisis the country has seen in modern times, the Government has maintained a strong sustainable welfare safety net to protect those who need it most.  I firmly believe that the safeguarding of the very strong social welfare safety net helped preserve social cohesion throughout the crisis, which is now thankfully coming to an end as we have exited the bailout and seen a return to economic growth and a welcome surge in employment, but continued public confidence in the welfare system is essential to maintain it in the long term.  This is why I am bringing forward the important changes in the Bill.<\/p><p> In 2014, the Department of Social Protection will spend almost &euro;20 billion in social welfare payments and will provide income support to approximately 1.4 million people every week.  The simple truth is the Department will impact on almost every person in the State at some point in his or her life.  We therefore have a great responsibility to our customers or clients, be they children, jobseekers, people with disabilities or pensioners, to ensure their entitlements are paid in full and on time.  Equally, we have a responsibility to citizens to ensure their taxes are properly spent, and that the money is there to ensure the social protection system meets its obligation to protect those who need it when they need it.<\/p><p> I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to an informed debate and to hearing the views of Deputies on the measures contained in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400034#GG00500","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401910200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>One of the greatest myths perpetrated in Irish politics since the foundation of the State has been the notion that changes, or should I say reductions, in social provision for the past three and a half years have been dictated by the troika.  We all know this is a gross distortion.  The fact of the matter is that the members of the troika - I had occasion as part of my party's delegation to meet them several times - were and are interested in the bottom line and reaching certain financial targets.  They were not unduly prescriptive about how the targets should be attained.  For the past three and a half years the Government has chosen quite deliberately and consciously to reach these targets in a regressive manner.<\/p><p>  Progressive budgeting means taking more from those who can most afford it and taking least from those who can least afford it.  What has been done for the past three and a half years is precisely the opposite.  The greatest burden has fallen on those least able to afford it.  The House need not take my word for this.  Look at what Social Justice Ireland, an independent private organisation, has stated; look at the Government's own organisation, the ESRI, which has confirmed it; the United Nations has also confirmed it, as have the EU and the OECD, which the Minister quoted in her speech.  They have all confirmed that the approach of the Government has been regressive in budgetary terms.<\/p><p>  The net result of these regressive budgets is that 16%, which is one in six, of our people are still at risk of poverty.  This is despite the fact the income level by which one measures poverty risk has fallen.  Approximately one quarter of the population experienced two or more enforced types of deprivation, the consistent poverty rate is almost 7% and approximately one in five children up to the age of 17 are in the risk of poverty category, which is double the OECD average.  The basic social welfare rate for a single person is &euro;25 per week below the internationally accepted poverty line.  If one is under 25 this shortfall can reach as much as &euro;113 per week.  This is not a very attractive legacy.<\/p><p>  The changes to the jobseeker's allowance announced in the most recent budget mean the casual debasement of young people continues unabated.  These changes were supposed be introduced as some type of character building exercise to compel people, or encourage them very strongly if I can put it like that, to avail of employment opportunities, even though for every vacancy there are 30 applicants, or to take up a training place, even though the number of training and education places is grossly inadequate for those who need them.  The reality is the sole and exclusive purpose of the changes was to speed those young people on their way to the nearest airport.<\/p><p>  The Minister has a technical amendment to enable the Youth Guarantee scheme to be brought into existence.  I have no problem with the technical provision.  The Minister has gained great publicity in various newspapers and electronic media from one end of the country to the other about her commitment to the so-called Youth Guarantee scheme and her great work at European level to get the EU to agree to it.  On the other hand it is actions that count and not words.  The Government has ring-fenced &euro;14 million when all the experts state that a proper youth guarantee scheme, which would cost &euro;6,000 to &euro;7,000 per head for unemployed youth in Ireland, would cost something between &euro;250 million and &euro;300 million.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Government's treatment of the elderly has been contemptible.  I could refer here to the fuel allowance, the emasculation of the free schemes, the abolition of the free telephone rental allowance, changes in pension entitlements that have made people worse off.  Not to mention the abolition of the bereavement grant, the slashing of home help hours and the medical cards fiasco.<\/p><p> In view of the Government's stated objective of encouraging lone parents to enter the workplace, its treatment of these people is quite incomprehensible.  The amount one can earn and still receive the lone parent allowance has been progressively reduced.  Therefore, the Government appears to be proceeding on the extraordinary proposition that the less a lone parent has to gain by going out to work, the more likely he or she is to go.  It is unsustainable.  I will not mention issues pertaining to respite care grants and so on, as I wish to turn to some of the Bill's provisions.<\/p><p> While examining the contents of the Bill this morning, I noted an apparently innocuous section of the Bill, namely, section 3.  It appears to be an innocuous technical section referring to amendments to amendments and to insertions of new sections and subsections into various items of legislation.  However, this may be the most significant section in the Bill, albeit concealed in the appropriate legalese.  The significant point about section 3 is that it provides for the amendment of section 242 of the principal Act, which is the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  If one reads the appropriate section that is being amended in the aforementioned Act, it is interesting that it makes specific reference to An Post as the service provider for the Department of Social Protection.  However, this legislation quite deliberately is taking out the reference to An Post and is replacing it with something called the payment service provider, whoever that may be.  In other words, the way is being cleared to provide a payment system for social welfare other than through the traditional route, namely, post offices.  This is despite the Government's repeated commitments to the Irish Postmasters Union and its various representatives, in public statements both inside and outside this House, that the post office network is safe and that the contract for the social welfare payment system will remain with the post offices, because this is absolutely necessary to preserve the post office network.  Without the social welfare contract, the post office network will fall apart.  While the Government has given repeated assurances that the network is safe, it is safe because the rock on which it rests - namely, the social welfare payment system - will remain as is.  However, this legislation is deliberately clearing the way to change this, which gives the lie to many of the reassurances the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, has given both inside and outside this Chamber.  Consequently, Fianna F&aacute;il will be opposing the section on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> Sections 13 to 15, inclusive, deal with the collection of social welfare, and the Minister referred in her speech to the change she brought about which enables overpayments to be collected at up to 15% of the principal rate.  When speaking here today, I do not refer to recovering overpayments that were made due to fraud, because more than 70% of overpayments are due not to fraud but to simple error.  Sometimes, these errors were honest mistakes on the part of the individuals but, as often as not, they were on the Department's side.  Even though last year's legislation specifically refers to collection of &quot;up to 15%&quot;, there is compelling evidence that the Department of Social Protection is interpreting that provision differently.  It is interpreting it as 15%.  I have come across numerous cases through my constituency office in which the Department is insisting on a payment of 15%.  Its representatives are stating that they are entitled to seek 15% and that is what they will take.  I have encountered individual cases in which this has caused great hardship and appears to me to be a departure from the actual wording of the legislation under which the Department is operating.  At the very least, Members require a commitment from the Minister to give a directive to the Department to exercise some discretion in this regard.<\/p><p> A change being provided for in the Bill is that an overpayment can now be snatched back in a single lump sum by the Department from other social welfare moneys the Department may owe to the individual.  Alternatively, an attachment order can be issued to snatch back the money in a single lump sum from moneys owed by another agency of the State, such as the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I can envisage cases in which this will cause individual hardship.  Again, I do not refer to people who defraud the Department of Social Protection, for whom I have no sympathy.  I refer to people who find themselves in an overpayment situation due to simple error.  There should be some element of choice in this regard.  Members have been told it is the intention of the Department that this will only happen as a last resort, when the person who has been overpaid is proving to be unduly recalcitrant and is not dealing with the Department on a fair basis.  However, if that is the Department's intention, why not spell it out in legislation?  At present, as far as I can discern, several offices of the Department are choosing to interpret this part of the legislation in their own way.  If it is the genuine intention of the Minister and the Department that this will be used as a last resort, this should be spelt out clearly and unambiguously.<\/p><p> The Minister stated that she is delighted to introduce section 16.  However, she is introducing it on foot of a European Union directive and Members have no choice but to introduce it.  Having been thinking about it today, since first reading it, I do not know how it will work in practice.  As an example, one could takes a business which brings in profits of &euro;80,000, owned by an individual whose wife works in the business performing ancillary tasks.  If she is an employee who is being paid &euro;20,000 or &euro;25,000 per year, that is fine - PRSI can be paid in the usual way and the individual can get whatever benefits flow therefrom.  If she is a 50:50 partner, that also is fair enough, because the profits can be allocated accordingly.  Incidentally, while one can have types of partnership other than a 50:50 partnership, I believe the Department has an idea that partnerships must be on a 50:50 basis.  However, if the person concerned falls into neither category - that is, is neither partner nor employee - will a certain sum of money be allocated to him or her?  There is a reference to the necessity for such a person to be earning at least &euro;5,000.  If one is earning money, surely one is an employee?  I really do not know how this will work in practice.  However, this issue can be teased out on Committee Stage.<\/p><p> The important point in respect of the self-employed is the failure of the Government, once again, to grasp the nettle and deal with the real problem.  The Minister is well aware of a report gathering dust in the Department that points out that the contribution system and the benefits system for the self-employed are inadequate.  The report contains many examples from throughout the OECD in which self-employed people can pay contributions to insure themselves against falling ill, becoming unemployed and so on.  Such measures would encourage people to set up on their own.  Ireland, in common with some obscure place such as Lithuania, is about the only country in the OECD that does not allow for this.<\/p><p>The report recommends that the Government do something about it, whether by means of a compulsory system or a voluntary system - I favour the voluntary system - but if it is to be a compulsory system, so be it.  There are differing views.  The fact of the matter is that three and a half years down the line there has been a detailed report, representations from organisations representing the self-employed, and continuous and very well argued representations by my colleague on the social protection committee, Deputy Ray Butler from County Meath.  I can only take the man at his word - he tells us he has received various commitments from the Minister - but three and a half years down the road, with time running out, still nothing has been done to deal with this fundamental flaw, nor is there any indication as to when, if ever, anything will be done.  That is what real reform in this area should look like.<\/p><p>Section 7 disallows increases for qualified adults if the qualified adult is incarcerated or abroad for a period of time.  My understanding is that this is a repetition of previous legislation.  I ask the Minister to explain if this changes the provisions in any material way.  I have been advised by the Department that the previous legislation only refers to the principal, not the qualified adult.  I am not quite sure that is correct; I will need some clarification from the Minister.  Under the 2005 Act, where this provision previously appears, there was a commitment to draw up regulations.  A situation cannot be allowed whereby if somebody's wife goes for a week's holidays, for example, the principal loses the adult dependant allowance for that period of two or three weeks.  I would like to have sight of those regulations if they are in existence and I would appreciate a copy of them.  I want to know whether any material change is being made.  The adult dependant provision is already dealt with in the previous legislation, in my view.<\/p><p>Again, this shows the complete reluctance to confront the notion of real reform in this area.  For example, everybody knows that the three-day rule constitutes a poverty trap.  In effect, the rule means that a person working 15 hours per week over three days might receive a significant jobseeker's payment whereas another person earning exactly the same amount and in exactly similar family circumstances, working for five days a week, is entitled to no payment.  Is this fair?  Surely the Minister is aware of the numerous representations and submissions made that the three-day rule should be replaced by an earnings-based system to take into account the realities of the modern labour market.  However, any move to eliminate this obvious poverty trap would constitute real reform, which is the one thing we will not get.  <\/p><p>I welcome the changes in the family income supplement in so far as they go.  I still do not understand why, if a person's circumstances change materially for the better or worse during the 52-week period, the FIS cannot be adjusted accordingly.  With respect to the structure of FIS, there have been numerous recommendations and submissions that FIS be changed because, as currently structured, it can constitute a poverty trap.  This arises from the requirement that in order to qualify one must work at least 38 hours per fortnight.  That means, for example, that a person earning &euro;100 per week under the FIS threshold for his or her family size would receive an income support of &euro;60 per week from the State - 60% of the difference - whereas a person with a smaller income and therefore a greater need for State support, working a half an hour less per fortnight, would get nothing at all.  That is obviously wrong.  I do not have to spell it out in any great detail in the limited time available to me.  Why is this wrong not being confronted?<\/p><p>The Minister announced to some fanfare that the habitual residence rules had changed.  I think this provision will change very little.  I refer to the programme for Government, which contains a reference to habitual residence:<blockquote>We will raise the issue of payment of Child Benefit in respect of non-resident children at EU level and seek to have the entitlement modified to reflect the cost of living where a child is resident.<\/blockquote>I asked the Minister for Finance on Leaders' Questions today whether this had been raised at European level and, if so, what the result had been.  He informed me that I should not be asking him that question on Leaders' Questions because it was a matter appropriate for the Minister for Social Protection.  I am asking the Minister that question now and she will have the opportunity to explain to me in her concluding reply.  The Minister may correct me, but in my opinion the new provision means that any child benefit payment to a non-Irish national currently in receipt of benefit remains unaffected.  It also means that the payment of child benefit to EU migrant workers whose children are living in their home countries remains unaffected.  I need confirmation that I am correct on those matters.<\/p><p>I refer to the previous Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013.  I mentioned that sections 13 and 14, which provide for reckonable benefits and loss of earnings claims, would cause difficulties in practice, but I did lament the fact that we had not had time to discuss it properly.  Now, for once, the Law Society has come to my rescue.  It has made submissions to me and, I presume, to my colleagues.  The society has provided concrete examples of how this provision could work horrendously in certain situations.  I can say as a member of the legal profession that there is no doubt that it will be a powerful disincentive to out-of-court settlements.  If anything is done in this country to disincentivise the practice of settling out of court then the whole system will grind to a halt.  It has taken long enough already - although not as long as it used to take in certain circumstances - but if out-of-court settlements are disincentivised it will have horrendous consequences.  I remind the House of the old adage that justice delayed is justice denied.  There will be a hell of a lot of justice denied if this provision works out as envisaged and as it will work out.  The Law Society has expressed this concern much more clearly, and, I am sure, more intelligently, than I could ever put it. <\/p><p>Those provisions have not been commenced yet, thank goodness.  They were due to be commenced last month.  I wish to ascertain the Minister's intentions in this regard.  For example, will these provisions be reconsidered?  Will the views of interested parties be sought?  Will the new provisions - if these are to be reconsidered and recast - reflect the reality of claims settlements?  Has the Department looked at what has been done in this regard in Northern Ireland, which seems to have an eminently more sensible scheme than the one we are trying to implement?<\/p><p>The Bill contains a minor reform to pensions.  As a result of this legislation, if a directive has come from the Pensions Board then the trustees are under an obligation to communicate that directive to their members.  There are various provisions for people to go to court, for example.  I refer to the Pensions Act 1990, which in my opinion contains that obligation.  It is implied in the terms of the Pensions Act 1990.  I have no objection to putting it down in black and white in legislation in specific form rather than saying it is there by way of implication.<\/p><p>Where is the penalty?  The legislation specifically states that the trustees are obliged to communicate this information to their members.  From a reading of the section, however, it appears they will not face a penalty if they fail to do so.  What is the point of introducing an obligation without penalties?  The obligations on trustees provided for in various Pensions Acts, including the 1990 Pensions Act, are accompanied by specific sanctions for failure to comply.<\/p><p> The position in respect of pensions extends beyond this relatively minor point.  The major point is that a pensions crisis has been looming for some time.  While the entire public sector is covered for pension purposes, only 50% of the population as a whole has pension cover.  This means that employees in great swathes of the private sector do not have any pension cover and will rely completely on the State pension on retirement.  As the dependency ratio decreases, as is forecast in all available projections, the current position will become steadily unsustainable.<\/p><p> Anything I have seen by way of legislation or innovation from the Government for the past three and a half years has constituted a disincentive to people to provide pensions for themselves.  Having changed the name of the Pensions Board, the number of members on the board and the title of its chief executive, the Government is now imposing on trustees an obligation to communicate with members that is not subject to any penalty or follow-up.  What is being done to confront the major problem facing the country, namely, the need to provide a pensions structure that is financially sustainable and socially adequate?  While various proposals and suggestions have been made and reports gather dust, the Government has decided to issue an ineffective directive to trustees and change the name of the Pensions Board.  Nothing is being done to confront the real problem.<\/p><p> I am aware that an election is taking place for the leadership of the Minister's party.  Far be it from me to get involved in the internal affairs of another party, although I wish the Minister well on a personal level, but I cannot help noticing, given the blanket media coverage it is receiving, that the buzzword in the Labour Party leadership election is &quot;change&quot;.  The party is experiencing a catharsis as a result of the recent exercise of the franchise by the electorate, which means change is required.  If one examines the Minister's record of change, however, one finds she has not changed anything of consequence.  Defined benefit pension schemes are still in a mess and in terminal decline.  No attempt has been made to place the national pensions scheme on a sustainable footing or allow the self-employed to insure against illness or unemployment, nor has any effort been made to deal with a major report that recommends recasting the entire system of child benefit.  The Minister has not made any effort to confront real reform or make hard choices.<\/p><p> Given the need to be balanced, I should point out that the Minister is certainly associated with change.  When she entered office, for example, she found a system in place for providing free telephone rental allowance to vulnerable elderly people.  She changed the system by abolishing it.  She also emasculated the system of free electricity allowances, which were concentrated primarily on the elderly in an effort to target expenditure towards the vulnerable, by reducing the payment to approximately one third of its previous value.  The Minister also reduced the period for which fuel allowance was paid from 32 weeks to 26 weeks per annum and drastically cut jobseeker's allowance for persons under the age of 25 years, much to their detriment.  She changed pension rules to make pensioners worse off who had paid contributions for many years and readjusted child benefit downwards, despite having made specific promises to the contrary.  The Minister changed the respite care grant by reducing it by 25% and cut the amount lone parents in receipt of social welfare payments can earn, thus creating a disincentive to work.  She also changed the position whereby those who paid social insurance were entitled to a bereavement grant by simply abolishing this payment.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the administrative changes it introduces, what does the Bill do for social provision?  The clue is on page 5 of the explanatory memorandum which, under the heading &quot;Financial Implications&quot;, states the following: &quot;The measures contained in sections 6, 13, 14 and 15 of the Bill to strengthen the powers to recover social welfare overpayments will lead to savings in overall social welfare expenditure.&quot;  This is another cut and yet another missed opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400036#JJ00200","speaker":"1059","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401912000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>In the short time available to me this evening, I will deal with only one aspect of the Bill before returning to its main provisions tomorrow.  This is, in the main, innocuous legislation.  Its only urgent provision is in section 16, which deals with an EU directive from 2010 and, therefore, addresses an outstanding matter that was not addressed when other parts of the directive were adopted previously.<\/p><p>I propose to discuss an issue to which Deputy O'Dea alluded and to which neither the Bill nor the explanatory memorandum explicitly refers, namely, An Post or, for that matter, post offices.  According to the explanatory memorandum: &quot;<i>Section 3<\/i>provides for changes to enable functions relating to payment of benefit or assistance and related payment services to be provided under arrangements with selected payment service providers.&quot;  When one trawls through social welfare and pensions legislation, including the principal Act of 2005, one finds that the purpose of this section is to delete all references to &quot;An Post&quot;.  The removal of references to An Post as the named service provider for social welfare payments could have devastating implications for the survival of local post offices.  The Department has explained that this deletion is being made to remove the privileged position - those are the words it uses - of An Post in the consideration of service providers in future.  This measure does not feature in any of the documents before us.  There is nothing privileged about hanging on by one's fingertips, as many of our post offices are doing.<\/p><p>An Post should have a principal position to reflect the important role local post offices play in the community.  The post office network is crucial to the social fabric, especially in rural areas, but also in urban neighbourhoods.  Post offices have played a key role in the anti-fraud measures of the Department and could probably play a greater role in this regard if all payments made by the Department were facilitated by An Post and its services.  The removal of An Post's status creates the possibility of a multinational company, bank or other entity with no connection to our communities swooping in and acquiring the contract for social welfare payments.  The manner in which the Minister has acted in this Bill opens up this possibility, which would not be in the best interests of those who receive payments, post office workers or the wider community.  There is no reason we should not retain An Post as a preferred bidder, if one wishes, rather than removing all references to &quot;An Post&quot; and placing it on the same level as all other financial institutions and all that would entail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400039#MM00200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1401912000,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Local and Community Development Programmes: Motion [Private Members]","time":1401912600,"counter":355,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400040#NN00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1401912600,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>notes:&mdash; the central role local development companies play in providing local services across Ireland, including the delivery of the Leader programme and social inclusion programmes;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that local integrated development companies also provide supports across a wide range of areas such as rural transport, child care, rural recreation and youth development and administer schemes such as the rural social scheme and the T&uacute;s scheme;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that approximately 1,900 people are directly employed in the sector, thousands of positions are supported by the schemes involved and some &euro;50 million is due to be spent on the programmes in 2014; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that local and community development programmes have a central part in developing and supporting local enterprise and sustaining jobs;further notes the Government&rsquo;s plans to align local and community development programmes within local authorities from 1 July with new programmes due to begin in 2015;<br \/><br \/>condemns the:&mdash; Government&rsquo;s cynical failure to engage in real consultation with the integrated community companies; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; erosion of local democratic structures in the Government&rsquo;s local government reform; andcalls on the Government to:&mdash; fully review the approach to the delivery of community services and programmes by these companies;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; protect funding for Leader programmes through 50:50 co-financing;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure companies that are tendering for Leader funding under the new local authority structure would be obliged to have partnership structures on their boards and their headquarters in the area of the local authority in question to ensure community ethos and local representation are at the heart of the delivery of programmes into the future; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure these companies are used as a one-stop-shop to deliver rural services, including rural transport and community schemes, and continue to play a central part in sustaining the fabric of communities across Ireland.<\/blockquote>I wish to share time with Deputies Dara Calleary and John Browne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400040#NN00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1401912600,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

We could also argue whether the new system he has introduced will add another layer of bureaucracy to a system which requires fewer structures, not more.  When I was Minister, I inherited a strange mishmash of local and community development companies.  Not all of the country was covered by the local development companies, LDC, programme and in some areas there were two companies operating.  I simplified the system considerably to ensure one company would cover all of the territory of the State, that there would only be 53 companies that would be coterminous and, where suitable, a company&rsquo;s boundaries would match those of a local authority.  We also decided that many services, not only the social inclusion and Leader programmes, such as T&uacute;s, the rural social scheme, rural transport and F&Aacute;S schemes, could be run by these local companies.  The local company would be a one-stop-shop in the delivery of State-funded community services.<\/p><p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has, however, taken a different route.  I accept, reluctantly, that in practical terms with the bringing forward of the legislation the LCDCs, local community development committees, are a reality.  However, as the process progresses, it seems to have run into problems which are getting worse.  Before we get into a total morass, it is time to stop, particularly the tendering process, and examine the difficulties created.  The local authorities do not have the capacity to deliver all of these programmes which means that they will have to sub-contract the work to other companies.  The system sees the LCDC making the decision on a Leader programme which will have the Department over it and, in turn, Brussels over it.  Where we used to have three layers, we now have four.  I accept that this is the way it will proceed and that there is nothing I can say that will change the Minister&rsquo;s mind.  However, I hope he will listen to reasoned argument and, before it is too late, consider making some changes to the delivery of the local and community development programmes.  <\/p><p>  I believe having one LCDC in some counties is not suitable.  For example, should the city and county of Waterford and Limerick have one LCDC?  From sheer geography, one would say having one LCDC for County Cork is not suitable.  Traditionally, there were problems with the Gaeltacht in County Donegal, including the Inishowen Peninsula which is as large as County Louth.  County Mayo was always split.  In County Galway, there was one Leader company delivering rural development programmes in all non-Gaeltacht areas west and east of the Corrib.  Connemara and the rest of County Galway were as different as any other two counties.  One cannot travel from Connemara to the rest of County Galway without passing through another local authority area, either that of Mayo County Council or Galway City Council.  The topography and geography are totally different, as well as there being significant linguistic differences between the two.  It covers a very large area, from north to south, from Ballinasloe to Slyne Head.<\/p><p>  Before the Department proceeded to the tendering process, it should have decided the number of LCDCs there would be and consulted those involved.  It was not good enough to allow county council managers or even councillors to decide.  For example, there are 30 councillors in east Galway, as opposed to only nine in west Galway, which means that those in the east always have a majority.  The Minister should examine the suitability of the arrangements put in place by local authorities.  Where they are not suitable and the areas covered are too large, he should inform them to come up with more workable solutions.<\/p><p>  There is no better organisation than Pobal for prescriptions and bureaucracy.  I understand it has come up with a process whereby one tenders for lots, but no one knows what they are.  For example, someone tendering to provide a service in County Dublin might wind up providing it in Tallaght only or in the whole of south County Dublin.  However, he or she does not know because no one has decided what the lot should be.  This has made the business of tendering incredibly complicated - it is like buying a pig in a poke.  I understand various combinations and permutations have to be included in a tender to ensure that when lots are decided, they will fit into the Department&rsquo;s constructions.  It should have been done the other way around.  Before the tendering process began, the Department should have decided the areas to be included and it would have been a straight bidding process, not a mind game, as seems to be the case.<\/p><p>  Another issue that has arisen is that in some places local authority boundaries do not suit.  In the last reorganisation of the programmes I brought most of them within county boundaries.  For example, the programme for Ballyhoura is across boundaries.  Duhallow is in a mountainous area straddling counties Kerry and Cork.<\/p><p>It is an area with its own clear identity predating the setting up of the counties.<\/p><p> We come then to an issue I have discussed with the Minister and for which he has a certain sympathy, namely, the islands.  I am told in the arrangement that is put out - I do not how far the Minister went into the minutiae of this - that in the islands' case it will be up to each county to decide whether the islands can be treated as a group or whether the local authorities will grab the islands, so to speak.  If I know anything about local authorities, they will grab anything they can.<\/p><p> Comhar na nOile&aacute;n has been a successful Leader company and is also the channel through which the funding is given to the island community development partnerships.  A special arrangement made was for it because of the particular role in the islands which is not the same as it would be in a town.  I understand from the tendering process that it will be difficult for Comhar na nOile&aacute;n to tender because the criteria are for a much more populous place than the offshore islands.  For example, I understand  that when it comes to Irish speaking areas, there is no linguistic criterion laid down even though the 20 year strategy for the Irish language is clear that it was meant to be an all-of-Government strategy spanning all proposals from Government and that all Departments, in making proposals, were meant to take the linguistic requirements of Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht into account when drawing up how to provide services to the people.<\/p><p> As I stated at the beginning, I do not want to cry over spilt milk, but I am a person who believes that it is important to try to get a solution that works locally.  Of course, there is a temptation for those in back rooms to always want the tidy solution, for example, that county boundaries are sacrosanct, but the person who said that a tidy desk is a sign of a sick mind was not far from the truth because there are many human situations that do not fit the tidy desk syndrome.  There is an opportunity here to catch our breath.  It has not gone beyond the point of no return.  As I stated, I am willing to accept that the local community development committees are in place, with the legislation having been passed by this House, but the tendering process we have entered into is highly flawed.  It could lead to unintended results.  It is more suitable for large operations which are good at tendering.  Such operations might be no good at delivering programmes.  Some of the most effective tenderers are not good on the ground or rooted in the community, but they are good in getting through what is becoming an ever complex web in trying to submit a public tender for any service, and I do not think that is what the Minister wants.  I would have thought the criteria should include, for example, that the company should be forced to have its headquarters within the functional area in which it will provide the service and that it cannot be effectively an absentee landlord with a big headquarters far removed from the community in which it delivers the service.  Of course, the most extreme such case is the islands.  If one takes Comhar na nOile&aacute;n out of the islands, one will destroy an effective company that not only has delivered to islanders in a way that no mainland company will do with the islands as an adjunct, but also has done something that has helped the growth of Dublin and all urban areas, that is, provided service jobs on the islands.  It has certainly kept Inis O&iacute;rr very much alive.  Would it not be an irony, when one thinks about it, if when all this is done we wound up with a situation where, instead of having these companies with their bases in towns such as Athenry and Kanturk, the services, for example, for rural Galway, under the rural development programme were headquartered in Galway city, as is the local authority, robbing the county of the jobs?  It would rob the staff in such places as Letterfrack and Kanturk, in the far ends of their county, who have jobs in these companies of their employment.  Would that not be a terrible irony that rural development funding would be going in significant measure to urban development rather than to rural development?<\/p><p> I hope that, instead of having a combative two days over this Private Members' motion, the Minister reflects on serious points we are trying to make.  I suggest that the Minister would halt the tendering process, that we would return to the pre-tendering process, that we would address the issues I mentioned about deciding how many LCDC areas there will be and what would be suitable in the tender documentation so that it is user-friendly for those who have the practical experience of providing the programmes, that the Minister would refer this to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht for examination, suggestions and consultations before he proceeds with the tendering, and that the current tendering process that does not kick in until 11 July would be suspended until the Oireachtas committee would have a chance to examine the implications of all the proposals and make cogent submissions to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, based on the widespread concern about how this project of his is proceeding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400040#NN00400","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401913200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v for giving us the opportunity to discuss this issue.  There is no need for us to be kicking this around the place, so to speak.  Everybody on all sides of the House agrees with the phenomenal success of the community development sector since 1991, when the then Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, initially rolled out the Leader model which has developed into many other community delivery projects.  The reason he rolled it out in that fashion then is as relevant today as it was in the early 1990s.  I refer to the disconnect we witnessed again two weeks ago between the public and institutions, such as this House and local authorities.  That disconnect has in many ways damaged the sense of community, meitheal and entrepreneurship in the same way now as it did back then.<\/p><p>  The various Leader and community development companies managed to get around that because they were connected to and based in the community and their staff were of the community.  The Leader programme and the various development programmes sparked a sense of enterprise, social cohesion and ambition within communities that otherwise would have been lost.  If we continue to go the way the Minister is going with these proposed plans, I fear we will lose that enterprise, cohesion and ambition.<\/p><p>  One of the difficulties in community and local development is that it is basically an alphabet nightmare, with, for example, LDPs and LCDCs.  However, there is one project which stands out as a testament to the faith and trust in these programmes, that is, the Great Western Greenway.  Last year, 200,000 people used that greenway, from Westport through to Achill, either walking or cycling.  A number of landowners got involved, giving away their land to support that project, and that could not have happened without the trust in the rural social scheme operated by South West Mayo Development.  The trust on the ground encouraged landowners to get involved in the project.  The ability and acumen of the staff of South West Mayo Development and the ambition of their board, all of whom are from that community, for that project ensured there was innovation and there was a dream.  It ensured that right along the greenway there are products, services and jobs that otherwise would not have been there.  Mayo County Council was a fantastic partner in that project.  Nobody takes away from its contribution, but the trust on the ground, the sense of ownership and the dream and ambition of the greenway belongs to South West Mayo Development in a way one does not get with a large local authority in a county the physical size of Mayo.<\/p><p>  Through these new programmes, with the local community development committee, that trust will be lost.<\/p><p>The local board, which runs the development company, will be replaced by the LCDC which will have as many people on a countywide board as are currently on a local board.  <\/p><p>The Minister has expressed frustration, and he has cause to be worried, about the burden of administration within some of these companies, as well as the financial issues, but local authorities are not necessarily in the best financial health to be held up as a model of propriety either.  <\/p><p>We need to ensure that the work done to date will not be lost.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's proposal to draw back from this and try to give the consultation period one chance to ensure that people on the ground are in agreement with this going forward.  If this matter proceeds in the way the Minister is currently going, it will be without local buy-in, input or support.  The whole notion of local development would then be catastrophically undermined.<\/p><p>In a recent article in the<i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, the Minister said he was not privatising community services.  He said these services were never undertaken by the public sector but by private local development companies.  I have gone through the structure of many such companies with boards which, through articles of association, have to be drawn from various community organisations.  They are community trusts and community-based companies, not private ones. <\/p><p>As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, there is a danger in the tendering process that without that community basis, companies will tender but will not be able to deliver the service.  There is a difference between preparing a tendering document and having the ability to deliver a service.  Local development companies the length and breadth of this island are blessed with the quality of their staff's commitment and contribution.  They are so blessed that the Irish model of local development is now put forward as European best practice.  Representatives of recent EU accession countries are being brought here to see how local development is being undertaken at a time when we are about to destroy that very model by bringing it back in under the auspices of a local authority whereby that localism is lost.<\/p><p>The Minister said we are not going to lose that community involvement but I have gone through the proposed set up and we will lose it.  The notion of having community representatives involved, as opposed to elected representatives - there is a difference - will be lost.  The ability of that community trust which is so important in so many projects will also be lost through the broader local authority structure.  <\/p><p>Can the Minister clarify the tendering process?  I presume it is correct that the current development companies will be allowed to tender, but what other companies will be allowed to tender?  Will private service companies, although not even in the county and perhaps based in Dublin or in another EU state, be able to put together a tendering document developing and delivering services remotely?  Could such companies usurp the very model the Minister is trying to protect?  What will be in the tendering process to protect a service provider's local integrity?  <\/p><p>I know the Minister is constricted by EU tendering rules, but someone somewhere will have to stand up to them.  Perhaps the Minister will get a chance later in the year to stand up to an EU tendering model that is so anti small companies, be they community ones or small and medium enterprises.  If the Minister gets the chance to do that around the European Commission table he will have done a great service.  Now is his chance to start by saying &quot;No&quot;.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400041#OO00200","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401913800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>Maybe he is not going there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400042#PP00200","speaker":"1096"},{"type":"speech","time":1401913800,"counter":363,"content":"<p>We should have a European model which supports local development.  It should not be lost for the sake of some tendering rules which are utterly unfair and disregard the success of that model in the first place.<\/p><p>  The Minister has made an argument concerning administration costs.  There have been leaks to newspapers about the salaries of various CEOs, but moving them into county councils will not save a huge amount.  If, as the Minister says, the local companies will be protected, then nothing will be saved.  The majority of those companies operate very tight ships considering the effort and hours that staff put in, as well as the projects they take on.  There will be job losses because this tendering model will not guarantee jobs.  The Minister is trying to protect the skills we have but that tendering model will not protect existing staff who have skills that cannot be bought in the market place or replicated.<\/p><p>  Protection must be given to existing companies both to deliver Leader and the LCD programme.  They have both the required expertise and ability.  In the previous cohesion round, we saw there were good people for tenders but when it came to delivery it did not happen.  We saw the difficulties it caused for companies such as MFG, so we do not want that to recur.  We cannot allow that loss of time and delivery space in communities.  <\/p><p>  The Leader programme was a beacon that sustained rural economies through dark times.  We need it again now to sustain rural communities.  We need the LCDP to give communities a chance and to help those who are left behind so they can catch up.  In addition, we need the training opportunities it presents to communities and particularly to participants.  The very schemes rolled out by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v when he was a Minister, such as T&uacute;s and RSS, are now used as models in other programmes.  They owe their successful ethos to the health of the local development sector, which is now under threat.<\/p><p>  One of the lessons of the recent local elections is that rural economies are falling apart.  The heart is being taken out of them by the move towards bigger urban centres.  We can use the current network of local development companies to shout &quot;Stop&quot;, as the late John Healy said.  They can be an effective model to do that if we give them responsibility for rural services, such as a one-stop-shop for services, including local transport, rural enterprise and agricultural supports.  In such circumstances, one could invest in those companies for the future of rural Ireland, or one can decide to adopt a tendering model which can be done anywhere by any entity with no connection to rural Ireland.  <\/p><p>  The staff and board members of local development companies have done this State very significant service.  The Minister should allow them to continue doing so.  In the coming weeks, he should engage with them to see if there is a shared way of moving forward.  Everybody shares their aims, so this is the Minister's opportunity to deliver on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400042#PP00300","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1401913800,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion before the House concerning the future of local development companies.  As we are all aware, local development companies have played a major role in the development of rural and urban areas in recent years.  The first such company in Wexford commenced in 1991.  They have been very successful since then in providing facilities for people to establish their own businesses, as well as helping local communities in various ways.<\/p><p>  It is important to defend the core community partnership ethos of local development companies in providing Leader programmes.  Local development companies have played a critical role in supporting local enterprise, as well as providing services in communities across Ireland.  The Minister's plans to subsume the programme into local authorities and contract it out will jeopardise the independence of companies involved.  Instead of reforming local government, this measure will destroy a successful model of communities being empowered to help themselves.  The Government should re-examine this matter immediately before the link between the companies and communities is destroyed.<\/p><p>  I have serious concerns about this matter being handed over to local authorities.

We all know about the huge waste of money in local authorities, but we are now going to hand over another block of enterprise to councils who will be the ring-masters.  If the Minister goes ahead with this project - I certainly hope he does not - he should ensure that whatever moneys are allocated in future will be ring-fenced and that county managers will not be able to raid the kitty of whatever the Minister may decide to allocate.<\/p><p> I find it difficult to understand why the Minister is going down this road.  He has visited many of the development companies around the country and has seen at first hand the tremendous work they do.  In my county, Wexford, the boards have been doing great work in the past four or five years, and I am sure it is the same in every other county.  Wexford Local Development, WLD, is a company limited by guarantee with a voluntary board of 24 directors, eight of whom are elected community and voluntary sector representatives.  It is a not-for-profit company and the membership of the local community development committees will have far fewer community and voluntary sector representatives under the Minister's proposal.  Much valuable expertise and many people who have been providing a free service will be lost under the Minister's proposal.  It is a major mistake.<\/p><p> From January, the local and community development programme currently delivered by WLD will be procured by Wexford County Council through a public tendering process, raising the prospect of private commercial companies delivering the county's biggest social inclusion programme under the auspices of the local authority on a for-profit basis.  Deputy Calleary referred to the tendering process.  How will it work?  There is a major concern that these companies will no longer be able to compete against private sector companies that are already providing such services.  Companies in the EU - for example, in the UK and Germany - will be eligible to tender for these projects, and that is a major concern regarding the new board when it is established. <\/p><p> In my constituency, many good projects were funded by WLD.  The Minister is also aware of this as he was briefed fully on WLD, visited some of the projects and recognised the important work it was doing in the county.  WLD employs 81 people directly, with a further 450 people employed through various employment schemes such as T&uacute;s, community employment, CE, and the rural social scheme, RSS.  What will happen to these people?  I met 73 of them recently and they had no notion of where they will stand.  There has been no dialogue or discussion.  In a reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister told me the CEO was supposed to brief these people and tell them what was happening.  However, the CEO and board are very much in the dark about what is going to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400042#PP00600","speaker":"1096","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401914400,"counter":368,"content":"<p>They have been talking to us for 18 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400043#QQ00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1401914400,"counter":369,"content":"<p>They are not in a position to tell the 73 people if they will be in work after 1 January 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400043#QQ00300","speaker":"1096"},{"type":"speech","time":1401914400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>The election is over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400043#QQ00400","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1401914400,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Deputy Browne has the floor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400043#QQ00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1401914400,"counter":372,"content":"<p>The Minister will be gone to the green grass of Brussels, I presume, and the best of luck to him.

Will they continue to be paid?<\/p><p>  Communities will lose out on funding leveraged by WLD to complete community projects and deliver programmes and services to which Wexford County Council does not have access.  This would be a major blow to communities in Wexford, which in 2013 benefited from an additional &euro;3.1 million in funding leveraged by WLD.  In 2014 or 2016, will there be &euro;3.1 million available?  I doubt it, and if so it will probably go to private enterprise or some other area through tendering for the schemes.<\/p><p>  The powers that be and Brussels, as the previous speaker said, regard this country's model, which was established by former Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and others and is being destroyed by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, as the way forward.  We are abandoning a scheme that is recognised Europe-wide as the model for other countries.  We are putting it under the local authorities, and we all know what happens when they get hold of things.  Many years ago when I was a councillor and the Minister was a member of Kilkenny County Council, the development projects were within local authorities, and it did not work very well.  We established the county enterprise boards and local development companies because it was recognised that it was not working as it should have within local authorities.  Local authority members and officials see their role as overseeing such matters as roads, planning and waste management, and they are not in the business of creating or developing jobs, other than protecting their own jobs within the structure of local authorities.  That is why I am afraid the Minister's proposal will seriously damage the future of local development companies.<\/p><p>  The Leader companies are local action groups which were established in 1991 to promote the development of their own specific rural areas.  If one travels to any rural community, one will see the tremendous work that has been carried out by local groups.  Local groups became active, got involved in working with the local development companies and had a sense of purpose, moving forward and doing things for their communities.  I fear this will be lost because we have already received a communiqu&eacute; from the Minister's office - I do not know if he has read it yet - saying that when the new county councils are established this week they need not nominate people for local development companies.<\/p><p>  There were members of Wexford County Council in the previous local development companies and it worked very well.  Why is the Minister sending a diktat that elected members of local authorities should not be on the new local development companies?  We have seen too much of that, with Deputies and councillors precluded from sitting on certain boards.  The Wexford local development committee has no Fianna F&aacute;il councillor, only Fine Gael councillors, but it is working very well.  Will the Minister explain why he is sending a diktat to the county manager not to put councillors in local development companies?  It is not right, because the councillors were elected by the people for the people, and surely they have a right to make contribution to whatever new board structure the Minister is talking about.<\/p><p>  The Minister comes from a rural constituency, Carlow-Kilkenny, is a former local authority member and is very aware of what happens on the ground and how successful the local development companies were under their own steam when they were autonomous.  While he says the local authority will not have much power over them and that they are only being housed within the local authority structure, from what I hear, the county managers and officials do not think that way.  We have a new county manager who sees himself as the driver of this new company the Minister is establishing, and this is where it will fall down.  I predict that in a year or 18 months Wexford County Council or another council will be left short by the Government for road works or other local authority schemes and the county manager will propose to take &euro;1 million from the fund the Minister of the day has allocated.  We will have fireworks when this happens because we will see that the Minister's decision was not in the right direction and was not going to help job creation and community development.<\/p><p>When the Minister replies I ask him to specifically state that the moneys allocated to local authorities for this project be ring-fenced.  County managers should not if they can get county managers on-side be able to hive off money for normal council projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400043#QQ01000","speaker":"1096","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401915000,"counter":378,"content":"<p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, is sharing time with Deputy Heydon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400044#RR00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1401915000,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote>To delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot; and substitute the following:&quot; - welcomes the overarching vision of Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government of a local government system leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services, and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably;<br \/><br \/>- notes that following the publication in Putting People First of recommendations for enhanced alignment between local government and local development an alignment working group, including representatives of the Irish Local Development Network, was established to assist and advise on implementation;<br \/><br \/>- welcomes the structure of the local community development committees being established under the reform programme, which will facilitate full and comprehensive representation of all actors, including community interests, and whose membership will be decided in a fully transparent, representative and democratic way;<br \/><br \/>- recognises the important role of local development companies as part of these reformed arrangements, including continued implementation roles in programmes and the provision of supports across a range of areas;<br \/><br \/>- welcomes the Government&rsquo;s decision to allocate 7% of the rural development programme, RDP, to the Leader element, 2% over the minimum required by the relevant EU regulation, resulting in an overall programme complement of &euro;235 million for the 2014-2020 period; this, coupled with delivery of two Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine artisan food schemes using the Leader approach, results in a full Leader complement for the 2014-2020 period of some &euro;250 million;<br \/><br \/>- notes that any entity that expresses an interest in delivering a RDP local development strategy using the Leader approach must meet the requirements of the EU regulatory framework, including that the entity should be a partnership of public and private local socioeconomic interests where no single interest group represents more than 49% of the voting rights at decision making level;<br \/><br \/>- recognises that local and community development programmes continue to play an important part in national social and economic recovery, including in the provision of valuable social services, direct and indirect supports for enterprise development, and employment creation; and<br \/><br \/>- reaffirms the continued partnership between community representatives, local authorities, local development bodies and statutory partners in ensuring effective co-ordination and targeting of services and avoidance of overlap and duplication, placing services before structures.&rdquo;<\/blockquote>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this evening's debate and to set the record straight on a number of issues relating to the ongoing process of reforming how we deliver on our local and community development agenda.  This Government has set out clearly its aim to position local government as the primary vehicle of governance and public service at local level.  That role involves local government in leading economic, social and community development; delivering efficient and good value services; and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably.  These were the cornerstones of our policy document, Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government, published in October 2012, and they have also been reflected in the Local Government Reform Act 2014 under which the recent elections to a radically streamlined system of local government have taken place.<\/p><p>Local economic and social development involves a complex set of factors, including public service inputs, employment, skills, investment, innovation, productivity and quality of life.  Supporting local development involves fostering methods to engage local people in the process in order to promote sustainable development and participation.  It is widely recognised, most notably in a recent OECD report examining the delivery of local development in Ireland, that the co-ordination and management of this type of integrated process at local level is a key function of local government.<\/p><p>Given the capacity and, in particular, the democratic mandate of local government and the enhanced role set out for it in Putting People First, it is entirely appropriate that local government would have a key role in local and community development into the future.  It will ultimately ensure more efficient and effective delivery of local and community development supports and interventions at a local level, putting the needs of citizens first in the delivery of publicly funded programmes and services.  It is this focus on citizen-centred outcomes rather than the protection of existing delivery structures that is my primary concern.<\/p><p>Far from eroding local democratic structures, as the Fianna F&aacute;il motion suggests, the commencement last Sunday, 1 June, of the principal provisions of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 represents a major milestone on the path towards a reformed and improved local government system, which will represent its citizens and communities effectively and accountably, which provides the services that people need efficiently; and which works in a financially responsible way, achieving the best possible value for money.  It restores key elements of local government removed by Fianna F&aacute;il-led governments since 1977.  Fianna F&aacute;il, in effect, reduced local government to just local administration.<\/p><p>The structural and other changes in place since last weekend constitute the most far-reaching changes in the local government sector since the current system was established in 1898.  At county and city level, this has involved the dissolution of local authorities in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford and their replacement by new merged authorities in each case.  At sub-county level, we have introduced an innovative approach to local governance in the form of municipal districts which, unlike the isolated town councils they have replaced, embrace all parts of the county, uniting towns and their hinterlands and dispensing with outdated town boundaries.  Overall, the number of local authority structures has reduced from 114 to 31 and the number of councillors from 1,627 to 949.  A key outcome of this reorganisation will facilitate the refocusing of resources to be used to improve front-line services and to enhance the quality of life in local communities for the future rather than maintaining duplicated structures.<\/p><p>It is important to emphasise that the reform programme is not just about structural reorganisation.  A range of other new policy initiatives also came into operation on 1 June, including provision for an enhanced role for elected members regarding economic development and enterprise support; new regional spatial and economic strategies; stronger oversight of local authority performance; the dissolution of city and county development boards; and the establishment of local community development committees.  A further central element of the reform programme is the positioning of local authorities to take a much more central role in local and community development, particularly to ensure the most efficient and effective outcomes for citizens and communities.<\/p><p>Before I advance any further on this issue, it might be useful in order to provide a context for the current reforms if I remind members briefly of the background to local development structures and programmes and how they have developed in the recent past.  In 2002, the then Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government established the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs against a background of concern at the multiplicity of structures and agencies through which local and community development schemes and programmes were delivered.  There was an inherent danger of fragmentation of services and diffusion of resources, with the new Department inheriting a number of local and community programmes with diverse structures which had been operated under the aegis of several different Departments.  The cohesion process initiated a number of years ago by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v to address these issues resulted in a significant reduction of local delivery structures for a range of rural and local development programmes.  The close to 100 partnerships and Leader companies operating until 2009 were reduced to a total of 53 entities providing full nationwide coverage, a figure that has since been reduced further to 50.  This rationalisation was then to be built on in a subsequent phase of cohesion concerned with improving and joining up the outputs of programmes.<\/p><p>In particular, the then Government saw a clear need to redesign its community development and social inclusion programmes, particularly the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, and the community development programme, CDP, drawing on good international practice and providing for ongoing evaluation of the programmes.  A comprehensive programme of redesign was implemented which streamlined the delivery of the LDSIP and CDP with the introduction of the local and community development programme, LCDP, in 2010.  The reduction in overheads achieved would support the effort to maximise the impact of available funding at the front line.  There was opposition, as there always will be, among some groups to the model for integrated service delivery and structures at local level, maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>was never an option given the issues relating to the delivery of the previous programmes, the concerns of the Committee of Public Accounts about the multitude of structures in the system, the criticisms in the McCarthy report and the prevailing budgetary reality at the time.<\/p><p>In May 2011, following the formation of this Government, responsibility for community functions and the LCDP transferred to my Department.  The LCDP is my Department's main community development scheme, covering all areas of the country and representing the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State.  Total funding of &euro;281 million has been allocated to the LCDP since it was introduced in 2010 and all 50 local development companies are contracted to deliver the LCDP to the end of 2014.  The current programme officially ended at the end of 2013, having operated for four years, but it is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of &euro;47 million, pending the roll out of a new social inclusion programme in January 2015.<\/p><p>Over the past three years, my focus has centred on building on the reform process that the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government had started.  I am therefore more than a little mystified as to where Fianna F&aacute;il is coming from with the motion it has tabled.  As part of the programme of reform of local government, local community development committees, LCDCs are being established in each local authority area.  These committees, comprising public private socioeconomic interests, will have responsibility for local and community development programmes on an area basis, including my Department's Leader and local and community development programmes.<\/p><\/font><\/b><\/p><p>They will develop, co-ordinate and implement a more coherent and integrated approach to local and community development than heretofore, with the aim of reducing duplication and overlap and optimising the use of available resources for the benefit of citizens and communities.  I am trying to finish what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v started.<\/p><p> In the specific context of local development, the primary objective of the alignment process, outlined in Putting People First, is to improve co-ordination of publicly funded programmes at local level, to reduce overlap and duplication and to better target resources at a time of significant social need.  Looking back over time, several studies and initiatives under successive Governments have sought to identify or implement improved co-ordination of local development funding, including reports such as Better Local Government: A Programme for Change, 1996; the report of the task force on integration of local government and local development systems, 1998; and the Indecon review of the county and city development board strategic reviews and proposals for strengthening and developing those boards, 2008.  In general, these initiatives did not achieve their objectives so, in many respects, it was unsurprising that the most recent report by the alignment steering group highlighted that challenges remain in terms of the multiplicity of agencies and committees that are supported locally, with the consequential risks around duplication, overlap, lack of joined-up planning and the need for better targeting of resources of publicly funded programmes.<\/p><p> The Government policy on alignment recognises that the capacity of all those involved must be mobilised for more effective delivery of services, the local authorities, local development bodies, other statutory partners, and the community sector.  It is with this in mind that as part of the process I am introducing the new public participation networks, PPNs, which will greatly enhance the voice of the community and voluntary sector, in particular through their role in local community development committees, LCDCs.  For the first time community is being recognised on a statutory basis.  The PPNs will nominate people to LCDCs, and will include not just a community voice but also representatives of social inclusion and environmental interests.  This is all part of the overall push for greater citizen engagement in the context of the local government reform programme.<\/p><p> For the sake of clarity, the House should be aware that there are approximately 700 people directly employed in local development companies to support the delivery of the Leader and local community development programmes, LCDPs, on behalf of the Department.  The companies also deliver a range of other programmes and interventions under contract to other Departments and agencies, and this may explain some of the misinformation that Deputy Browne had when he spoke about the various rural social schemes and T&uacute;s programmes that will be effectively obliterated.  These are managed by the companies on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, so perhaps he will address those issues to that Department.  My Department's contractual relationship is with the individual companies which are in turn responsible for their own staffing and employment issues.  Therefore, my focus has to be on ensuring the structures and contractual arrangements between my Department at the centre and the local delivery mechanisms are designed in a manner that ensures the most efficient and effective outcomes from the Leader programmes and LCDPs which are delivered on my Department's behalf.  I would be failing in my duty if I did otherwise.<\/p><p> I fully recognise the strengths and capacities of the local development companies, which is very well articulated in the Government's policy document, Putting People First.  As for all organisations involved in delivering services to the public, the prime focus of local development companies must be, first and foremost, on serving the public, rather than on retaining sole control of public programmes.  We need to ensure value for money and, therefore, in accordance with the public spending code, best practice internationally, legal advice and ensuring the optimum delivery of services to clients, the LCDP successor programme will be subject to a public procurement process.  I do not have any option.  I must observe the law.<\/p><p> With regard to the delivery of the development programmes managed by my Department, as an integral part of the alignment of community development and local government, oversight of the LCDP will transfer to the local community development committees, LCDCs, within each local authority from 1 July next.  The new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, is one of my Department's key priorities and its budget for its first year of operation will be addressed as part of the 2015 Estimates process.  The SICAP public procurement process will be a competitive process that will be open to local development companies, other not-for-profit community groups and commercial firms that believe they can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new programme.  The LCDCs will procure the programme locally.  All proposals received will be assessed in accordance with the assessment criteria notified with the tender documentation, and the contract or contracts will be awarded on the basis of that assessment.<\/p><p> The aim of SICAP is to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration.  It aims to build on more than 20 years of local and community development work funded by my Department and its predecessors.  It strives to build on the country's internationally commended history of local and community development activity and also aims to take account of international experience in recognising the need for local approaches to complement and add value to mainstream service provision in our public employment and education services.  My Department is aware of the work undertaken in recent years by the leadership in energy and environmental design, LEED, and other divisions within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in recognising the value of local approaches to promoting inclusive economic growth and in recognising the role for local government as a key player in that regard.<\/p><p> Eurofound, the OECD, the International Labour Organization, the National Economic and Social Council, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, have all commented on the fact that the key route out of social exclusion is to support individuals to be in employment.  Programmes such as SICAP can be beneficial in helping those most distant from the labour market to be better prepared for access to the labour market by working with them to enhance their educational and training capacity.  This programme will prioritise supports to those who are unemployed, including those not on the live register.<\/p><p> SICAP is being introduced at a time of significant structural and policy change in the Department with regard to local government reform and the roll-out of the new LCDCs and the governance model for local and community development in each local authority area.  SICAP is a substantial player in the change process as a key programme for which the new LCDCs will have management and oversight.<\/p><p> Leader, the community-led local development approach, has been a tool for the delivery of rural development interventions in Ireland since its inception in 1991, and will remain at the heart of the delivery of rural development interventions for the 2014 to 2020 programming period.  The Government acknowledges the positive impact the use of the Leader approach has had on the development of rural areas in Ireland in the 2007 to 2013 period and recognises the part the local development companies have played in this.  In the context of a more cohesive approach to the delivery of all local development interventions, it is important that Leader funding is part of a more strategic approach to supporting development in rural areas, and for that reason the Government is proposing some changes to the future delivery of the Leader elements of the rural development programme.  The changes are proposed to achieve two main objectives, to promote a more cohesive approach to local development as outlined in Putting People First, which I have just outlined, and to address issues and challenges faced through delivery of the current 2007-2013 programme.<\/p><p> The added value of the local development companies' role in the delivery of Leader lies in their well-developed ability to empower their communities and support them to build their capacity to access funding through Leader.  This role is, and will remain, critical to the delivery of Leader funding and ensures the quality of the interventions funded under the programme and the ability of these interventions to address local needs.  For the avoidance of any confusion, I acknowledge that the current local development companies have well-developed skills and experience in this area in particular and I see them continuing this role in their capacity as partners on the LCDCs.  I have indicated this to the local development companies on many occasions.  I have met the representatives of the Irish Local Development Network and of the County and City Managers Association many times and have repeated these points to them over the past 18 months.<\/p><p> It is incumbent upon us in government not just to ensure the funding delivered through Leader supports high quality interventions that address needs locally but also that it complies with the processes of sound financial management and audit compliance.  The Deputies opposite are well aware of issues around good corporate governance, financial management or lack of it in many of the companies, but I heard no mention of those issues in this debate.  I suppose in some respects I am not surprised by that but there are issues that cannot go unnoticed when one is trying to reform the programmes we have now.  We must take those issues into account when developing the new structures and models of financial management and proper compliance with the programmes because we are subject to audit, not just at national level but also at EU level.<\/p><p> The broader role currently undertaken by the local development companies involves the management of the administrative and payment processes that are also an integral part of the Leader funding process.  It is in this context that my Department has experienced some difficulty in the current programming period.  It is part of the job of my Department to mitigate risks to funding as far as possible, and I make no apology for this.  We are dealing with European and Irish taxpayers' money and we must ensure the systems for the management of that money are robust.  I propose to do this by amending the systems to address the challenges identified and experienced in the 2007 to 2013 programming period.  I believe this is a sensible approach which will ultimately ensure a more efficient delivery of the funds in the 2014 to 2020 period.  Primarily, this will involve ensuring the systems we use to deliver the Leader elements of the 2014-2020 programme are fit for purpose and that any entity contracted to deliver the Leader elements of the RDP has the financial and management capacity to do so.<\/p><p> In this context and in the interest of clarity, Ireland proposes to support the implementation of rural development interventions through the Leader elements of the RDP 2014-2020 at local level using a public private partnership approach.<\/p><p>This will form part of a more integrated and coherent approach to local development that involves community and local government organisations in leadership roles, guiding a more integrated and co-ordinated approach to the delivery of all funding, both European and national, at a local level.<\/p><p> The priorities at local level will be developed using a partnership approach that will draw on the skills and expertise of local public and private socioeconomic interests, including local development expertise, local authorities and community and voluntary organisations, in consultation with the wider population.  These strategic priorities will then form the basis for programme-specific priorities in each area.  This approach would see local authorities working in partnership with local development agencies and community representatives to design and implement local development strategies at local level, based on the strategic priorities already identified.  Both strategic priorities and programme-specific priorities would form part of an overall planning process at a local level and this would be integrated with planning processes at regional, national and European levels, thereby addressing the need for a more integrated approach to support for rural development.<\/p><p> Such an arrangement also envisages the identification of a lead financial partner as part of the partnership arrangement.  The lead financial partner must have the capacity to provide the financial support necessary to ensure successful financial delivery of Leader-type interventions for the duration of the programming period.  This will address the significant challenges relating to the financial solvency and capacity of legal entities which were experienced in the programme period.  The system also proposes to delegate the administrative checks required to verify expenditure to an independent entity with the capacity to ensure these checks are carried out to a consistently high standard at all times.  The composition of the proposed public private partnership will be in line with the requirements of the EU regulatory framework and fulfil all the criteria necessary to be considered a local action group in both composition and ethos.<\/p><p> I am proposing to conduct a two stage local development strategy selection process providing the opportunity to develop this partnership approach incrementally and with full and comprehensive consultation to maintain the integrity of the community-led local development approach.  The aims of these processes are to facilitate the development of robust, implementable strategies that address the needs of individual local areas and are complementary to other development processes at local, regional, national and European level.  I am confident that the systems to be put in place will facilitate the effective inclusion of support provided though the Leader elements of the rural development programme in the broader local development context, while ensuring the efficient management of expenditure as required by the regulatory framework.<\/p><p> There has been comment on the need to engage with the local development sector.  Let me put the record straight.  Shortly after the Government published Putting People First, which included recommendations from the expert group on alignment, I invited the Irish Local Development Network to participate on the alignment implementation group which was being established to assist and advise on the implementation of the proposals approved by Government.  The implementation group was to have two ILDN representatives, two local government representatives and representative from my Department and Pobal.  In fairness to the ILDN, it wanted time to consider its participation, and the implementation group met without its participation initially.  The ILDN then come back to my Department and indicated that it would participate if the name of the group could be changed from &quot;implementation group&quot; to &quot;working group&quot;, if its terms of reference could be changed and if they could have an extra nominee.  My Department acceded to all these requests.  Since then, the group has met 11 times and, additionally, I have met them directly on three occasions, while my Department has had several further bilateral meetings with the ILDN representatives.  The notion that there is not consultation or that there is no engagement is absolutely a false one.  Any suggestion that I or my Department have not engaged in consultation simply does not stand up to scrutiny.  There has been far too much inaccurate commentary on this and other aspects of the alignment process, not least during the recent local elections campaign.  Despite all of that, it is important that there is clarity around the fact that the process is marching on, not least through the establishment of the new local and community development committees under the Local Government Reform Act and the development of the new SICAP and Leader programmes.<\/p><p> I wish to reiterate what I have said earlier in this debate and many times previously, namely, that the Government recognises and acknowledges the contribution of local development companies in the delivery of local development interventions at a local level.  Equally, I want to make it clear that they form only part of a complex landscape that requires a more streamlined approach in order to increase efficiencies and ensure that all funding available at a local level has the maximum impact.  The role of local government is widely recognised as key to the delivery of local and community interventions, and the aim of the local government reform and alignment processes is to strengthen this role for the benefit of communities all over Ireland.<\/p><p> I have assured the local development companies on a number of occasions that they will maintain a role in the new architecture that will support a more integrated approach to the delivery of development funding at local level.  I envisage that this role will play to their particular strengths and I am absolutely convinced that the new systems will allow them to focus more on supporting the delivery of high quality development interventions at local and community level.  It is with this in mind that I again request that local development companies continue to engage with the reform process, and I am glad they will meet my Department this week, as I firmly believe that the outcome of this will support us all to facilitate the sustainable, integrated development of communities across the country, an aim towards which I believe we should all be working.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v for his constructive approach and also Deputy Calleary in regard to the matters they raised, and I will certainly consider some of the issues raised by them, of which I have taken note.  Perhaps we can have a further engagement on these matters in the future.  I assure Deputy Browne that all moneys under these programmes will be ring-fenced for what they are intended and not for filling potholes in Wexford, and I am sure his son, whom I congratulate on his recent election to Wexford local authority, will ensure that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400044#RR00300","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401916200,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for sharing his time with me on the important topic of this Private Members' motion.  I welcome the overall funding package for the next Leader programme, which should not be taken for granted.  Normally, when one fights for things, once they have been obtained, people, particularly those in Opposition, move on to the next fight without acknowledging, as in this case, that the securing of &euro;250 million in funding has been a massive achievement by the Minister.  The EU regulations stipulate that a minimum of 5% of the rural development programme be allocated to Leader, and Ireland has decided to increase its proportion to 7%, acknowledging the vital role Leader has played in rural development down through the years.<\/p><p>  It is vital that greater efficiencies and operational savings are achieved in the delivery of the new programme.  As in any facet of public life, we have had to cut our cloth to suit our measure across the board.  We must ensure that we find greater efficiencies, minimise administration costs and maximise the funding available to support projects and local communities.<\/p><p>  The Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, launched by the Taoiseach last month, identified a range of areas of particular need that could be supported through Leader interventions.  These include economic development, job creation, rural tourism, enhanced national communication initiatives to improve broadband and building community capacity.  Broadband provision, in particular, strikes me as a particularly important issue.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, recently unveiled Government plans to extend fibre broadband to villages and towns around the country that currently have a significant deficit.  This is a crucial issue in my constituency of Kildare South where people who currently commute could work from home a few days a week.  That would have a massive impact on local communities and a knock-on impact on improving the quality of life for many people.  If there was a way to allocate some of this money, for example, towards increased and improved broadband provision, that would have an knock-on impact on economic development, job creation and small start-up businesses where people could work from home, as many people who have businesses already do.  The knock-on impact on local communities would be very significant.<\/p><p>  I would like to reference some Leader projects that have already been undertaken in Kildare South, with which I have worked closely and directly.  The Minister will be well aware of the community centre project in Suncroft, for which funding was sanctioned recently, and the Kilcullen child care centre that was allocated funding of &euro;317,000.  Mistakes were made along the way and there were delays and huge headaches for local community groups.  As a local Deputy, I ended up being dragged into the middle and going back and forth between Department officials, the local community groups and the County Kildare Leader Partnership.  The Minister is aware of the issues that I have highlighted to him.  In the formation of a new Leader programme, we must ensure that instances such as those do not happen in the future.<\/p><p>  Funding under the programme has had a positive impact.  The child care centre in Kilcullen opened today.  In Suncroft the development project is continuing apace.  Only last week the community had a hugely successful &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; event to help fundraise the last segment of the project, and it was a real example of community spirit.  I am thinking of places such as Rathangan, which was granted funding of &euro;500,000 for a community centre, and Castledermot, which was granted the same amount of funding.  Deputy Calleary mentioned the heart being taken out of rural towns and villages.  These were communities that were left behind in the boom that the previous Government, of which his party was a member, oversaw.  When one meets people from Castledermot now, one does not hear them talk about derelict buildings or issues in their town but about a huge sense of community pride.  The old school that has been redeveloped on Main Street has transformed the community, and this has brought out the best in the people.  Castledermot has a population of 1,398 people, according to the last census, and the funding allocated of &euro;500,000 has been a massive investment in that small community.  Rathangan has a population of fewer than 2,500 people and Suncroft has a population of 735 people, and the funding allocated to those communities has made a massive contribution.  What we are doing in terms of reform is adopting a citizen-centred approach that concentrates and gets the best return on such investment.<\/p><p>  It has been suggested that local authorities are a problem and that we should avoid putting any services their way. <\/p><p>That has been the Fianna F&aacute;il approach in the past, ever since it abolished rates in 1977, a decision that forced local authorities to go cap in hand to the Government.  The establishment of local enterprise offices and the centring of a broad range of services therein will allow us to maximise the return from the existing local government structures and leverage them more effectively.  I trust local authorities to use the additional powers they have been given, including those relating to the local property tax, to best effect.  With greater power comes greater responsibility and accountability and this, in turn, will give us a much more accountable and fit-for-purpose local authority structure.  The provision of community services and their administration should be undertaken through this improved structure.  <\/p><p> I acknowledge the Minister's engagement with the Irish Local Development Network on its alignment implementation role.  I take the opportunity to thank the local development companies throughout the country, past and present, for the work they have done in local communities.  I look forward to seeing a stronger Leader programme into the future, a programme that will facilitate the great community spirit we have seen throughout the country in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400046#TT00200","speaker":"949","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401916800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>It is ironic that we are discussing the alignment of local government with the community sector when the Leader programme and the local development programme are being held up by the European Union as models of social inclusion.  The European Court of Auditors, in condemning what is now proposed by the Government, has recommended that other member states follow the example of what was done in this country in recent decades.  If the so-called alignment proposal is implemented, control of funding will be retained in local authorities but not - this is the key point- under the control of the democratically elected councillors.  Instead, the control will rest with the county manager and there will be no certainty that funding will go to where it is needed most.  In many cases, it will be used by managers to compensate for the drastic cuts in local government funding in recent years.  The Government claims these cuts are being made to reflect the removal of water services provision from local authorities.  However, the level of cuts is far greater than what is being spent on water services.  Moreover, the revenue from the local property tax which was supposed to go towards local services such as parks, libraries, footpaths and lighting has been handed over almost in its totality to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  <\/p><p>  The attacks on the local community development sector are just the latest phase in the onslaught on local democracy and the community sector in which the Government is engaged.  These attacks are happening, even though the record of local community development companies and the Leader programme speaks for itself.  According to SIPTU, the local community development programme dealt with 47,792 cases in 2012.  It was responsible for providing after-school and other outlets for 84,722 young people.  In the same year 7,000 people were supported into employment and more than 18,000 took part in education and training projects.  This is apart from the 1,900 people directly employed in delivering the programme.  That is a remarkable achievement, the evidence of which can be seen in every county.  Of course, there are examples of where the schemes have been less successful.  However, I can speak authoritatively in saying the programme has been a huge success in County Laois, as I understand it also has been in the Minister of State's county.  As I said, the Leader and community development programmes are held up as models of social inclusion by the European Union.  The proposed alignment threatens to undermine all of this.  Not only will it threaten the jobs involved, but it will also have a potentially disastrous impact on communities, with many being forced to curtail services or close them down.<\/p><p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il motion before the House does not refer directly to the issue of competitive tendering.  It is a source of great concern that private companies will be able to bid for contracts to perform community work.  There is no benefit in setting community groups against each other to compete for the same resources.  Moreover, no private company should benefit from people's disadvantage.  We need look no further than Mother England to see what happens to the community sector when this approach is attempted, with services formerly provided by voluntary and community groups farmed out to the private sector.  That strategy has been a disaster across the water, where the authorities are now trying to pull it back.<\/p><p>  It is difficult to envisage how the new structure will operate.  I checked in recent days to see how it was panning out in County Laois and it is not a pretty picture.  All of the changes are happening on 1 July, but there is very little of the infrastructure in place.  Private companies, of course, will only be interested in making bids for schemes that are guaranteed to make money, leaving other schemes to bite the dust.  In the five years of the Leader programme, the Laois Partnership Company has assisted 434 projects.  In 2013 it assisted 150 people directly in returning to employment and assisted 119 small businesses.  Some 108 children from disadvantaged areas are attending preschool and after-school projects.  In addition, the company manages a local employment scheme and provides a vast range of training courses, many of which provide candidates with FETAC qualifications.  The administration of all of these schemes is largely funded through the social inclusion programme.  Without this funding, the Laois Partnership Company would be unable to administer dozens of projects.  It is that funding which keeps the show on the road.  Community employment schemes, preschool and after-school projects and everything else cannot be delivered out of thin air.<\/p><p>  Local development companies have a strong voluntary ethos and their board members are volunteers.  Unfortunately, as I said, the Fianna F&aacute;il motion does not address the possibility of privatisation.  Fine Gael is determined to go down the Thatcherite road which proved a miserable failure in Britain.  What do members of the Labour Party, none of whom is here, have to say about this?  Are they happy to follow their colleagues in government down that road?  SIPTU is seeking to deal with the industrial relations issues and it is vital that the Department engage with it, through the Labour Relations Commission, to seek to address the likely consequences for workers employed by the local development companies.<\/p><p>  I brought forward a number of amendments to the Local Government Reform Bill 2014, not to be mischievous but to highlight the danger of leaving so much power in the hands of county managers.  If a local authority is fortunate enough to have a good county manager, everything will be fine.  However, the legislation states in respect of the membership of the local community development committees, &quot;The chief officer of the Committee shall, in consultation with the Corporate Policy Group, seek and select nominees to the Committee ... and shall submit a list of recommended nominees to the members of the local authority for their consideration&quot;.  The punch line is in the provision which states, &quot;The nominees shall be appointed to the Committee, without omission or addition, by resolution of the local authority&quot;.  Do people understand this is effectively putting everything in the hands of the county manager?  The Government's reform programme is supposed to be about taking power from county managers and putting it back in the hands of councillors.  This provision stands that principle on its head and will seriously restrict local authorities.  The Government has tied the hands of the 949 councillors elected last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400047#UU00200","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1401916800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Once again, I find myself in this Chamber challenging the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition on its lack of consultation and erosion of democracy.  This time we are talking about local development companies and the privatisation of the community sector.  The reputation of community development companies in the allocation and administration of Leader programmes is second to none.  All of us who have worked with them in locations throughout the country can verify this.  Community development companies have 20 years experience and are a real success story.<\/p><p>  The Leader projects have been a successful job creation mechanism in rural Ireland.  Without them, many rural communities would be destitute at this point.  From 2011 to last year, they created nearly 3,000 jobs.<\/p><p><font color=\"#383A3A\">They also assisted more than 6,700 enterprises and supported more than 2,000 tourism initiatives.  Villages and communities, which were enhanced one way or another by Leader projects and funding, numbered almost 4,000 in those three years.  The model was adapted by other member states in the European Union.  It was a valuable tool to combat social exclusion and was a cost-effective job creation mechanism under democratic control of communities.  Now we have a tendering process established which will do no more than pit community organisations against each other and leave the way open for yet another way to privatise something.  If the profit margin is not thought sufficient, will they just disappear altogether?<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#383A3A\"> The Minister, Deputy Hogan, is the whizz kid of privatisation and here is another example.  His plan is to make community development another source of profit for the private sector.  Is nothing safe from this drive for profit?  Will we see profitability becoming the driving force behind these projects instead of the common good of the community and job creation in rural areas?  We now have Irish Water.  Remember refuse collection was privatised and there were waivers for old age pensioners and people on low incomes but they are gone.  Local development companies are following that.  Will child care, community supports for the vulnerable, youth recreation projects and those designed to include those who are excluded from communities disappear?  That is a big question and I have no doubt that if we proceed along this route, that is what will happen.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#383A3A\"> The community-led ethos must be preserved with participants' needs being prioritised over profit.  The changes to the way local development is organised will have serious consequences for the community and rural development programmes.  Currently, the Leader partnerships, independent non-profit organisations, manage and administer Leader funding for development programmes and they do a damn good job.  The planned changes will see the management of funding being transferred from the partnership to local authority-led entities and, as Deputy Stanley said, giving absolute power to county managers.  Those of us who have been on county councils have seen good ones and not so good ones.  Giving that absolute power to one person is an affront to democracy.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#383A3A\"> There is also a workers' rights aspect to these measures.  If the LCDP is put out to tender, the fear is that it will lead to a race to the bottom, with private companies seeking to undermine pay and conditions with a view to winning tenders and boosting profits.  What are the arrangements being put in place for any transfer of employment of workers?  Will there be redundancies and, if so, who will pay the redundancy of workers being laid off?  <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#383A3A\"> It will also impact on the efficient delivery of the local services, currently run by local development companies.  <\/font>I fully appreciate the invaluable work that companies such as North and East Kerry Development do in supporting local organisations.  The likes of North and East Kerry Development should remain the applicant body for Leader and the successor programme to the local and community development programme from this year onwards.  I work very closely with it and with its directorship.  It does fantastic work and has helped small companies start up.  Such companies are far more important to the area I come from and to many areas in Ireland than the IDA.<\/p><p>It is mind-boggling to think that while the European Commission holds Ireland's community-led model as an example to the rest of Europe to follow, our Minister is proposing to replace our example of best practice with the centralised version of which the Commission is so critical.  Local development companies should retain their independence and be allowed to continue their brilliant work in our communities. <\/p><p>I do not know if members of the Government are listening to people who live in rural isolated areas.  If they were honest and truthful, they would relay to the Minister what I and others on this side of the House have been doing tonight that the way local development companies operate is invaluable to local communities and rural Ireland.  To do away with them and to give absolute power to county managers will do an awful disservice to the people who put us here.  Will the Government reconsider the road it is going down?  Why tamper or do away with something which is working beneficially for everyone?  <\/p><p>Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins is shaking her head but she knows as much as I do, given the areas from which she comes, the value of local development companies, what they have contributed over the past number of years, the number of jobs they have created, the amount of work they do in local communities and the number of small businesses they helped to start up, but all of that will be taken away from them and given to one person as a result of what the Government is proposing.<\/p><p>I ask the Government to reconsider this proposal.  In particular, I ask those who call themselves members of the Labour Party to reconsider going down the road of privatisation, although it is nothing new in that they have sold out everything since they went into Government.  They will do anything for power.  They have given up all the values and principles for which they are supposed to stand.

The people gave them their answer last week but what did the Government do?  It issued a diktat in Monday's newspaper attacking all the elected councils.  It cut travel expenses, training courses and so on.  It was a punishment.  The sooner this Minister leaves us to go to Brussels, the better.  He will not stand and face the people.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, and Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins will face the people because they are waiting for them.  They can shake their heads until they fall off but what is happening is downright wrong.  It is blackguarding and bullying ordinary people and community projects.
