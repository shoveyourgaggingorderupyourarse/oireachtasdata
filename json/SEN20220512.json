The conference gave people the opportunity to hear about the transformative work that happened in schools and communities as a result of the programme.  The Taoiseach, who established the programme as he was the Minister for Education at the time, acknowledged all of the terrific work as did the current Minister for Education, Deputy Norma Foley.  I wish to acknowledge the SCP work that has been carried throughout the country.<\/p> <p>I appreciate that the Cathaoirleach accepted my Commencement matter that seeks an update on the Curragh-Kildare school completion programme and calls for necessary supports to be provided to enable the programme to carry out its work.  Recently, I was contacted by the acting chair of the Curragh-Kildare school completion programme cluster, which consists of Kildare Town Community School, which has more than 1,000 pupils, St. Brigid's primary school, which has more than 1,000 pupils, as well as the Curragh post-primary school and the Curragh amalgamated primary school.  The cluster has been supported since 2006 by the school completion programme.  It has done a lot of really good work.  The cluster works with children at primary and post-primary levels who are at risk of not completing their schooling, which is hugely important within any community and town.  One school home-school liaison teacher has been assigned to one of these primary schools, so a huge amount of work needs to be carried out.<\/p> <p>During Christmas 2021, local schools received an email informing them that the current educational welfare officer would leave in the next two weeks, which had the result that many priority cases had to be closed.  A suggestion was made that the school completion programme and the one home-school liaison person could continue to support the remaining families as best they could.  Since then the local schools have sought an update on the appointment of a new educational welfare officer but to no avail.  They have been left with no contact and no support for six months.  These schools do their very best to support their pupils and their families but they cannot do that on their own without proper enforcement and follow-up at a formal level by an educational welfare officer.  The deterioration in attendance has been frightening and, quite frankly, unforgivable.  These schools need external supports and without that schools are powerless, and defenceless, against investigation by the Ombudsman for Children.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is insulting that this situation has been allowed to continue.  It is a slap in the face for the teams within the schools and shows a complete disregard for the years of work that they have put into supporting the programme and the target families.  They have been left high and dry.  It is absolutely time that action was taken here.  It is time that the calls from these schools were heard at the highest levels.  That is why I am raising it today.<\/p><p>It should not be this difficult and school completion programmes should be able to access something as basic as an educational welfare officer.  It is unacceptable that the adequate support is not being given.  This cluster of schools caters for almost 2,400 students in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, initiative who are in schools in bands 1 and 2, and many of whom have substantial care needs.  That there is no forethought or preparations for continued provision for the continuity of support is simply not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051200002#A00600","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652347800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Loughlin for raising her Commencement matter and I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Education.  Senator O'Loughlin sets out quite well and very clearly the merit and importance of the educational welfare officer and the repercussions if such an officer is not <i>in situ<\/i>at a very important time in the development of children.<\/p><p>DEIS is the main policy initiative of the Department to address educational disadvantage at school level.  Currently, 884 schools and more than 180,000 students benefit from the DEIS programme.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, recently announced the expansion of the DEIS programme to an additional 310 schools, with 37 existing DEIS schools upgraded.  This means that in the 2022-23 school year, there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS programme serving over 240,000 students or nearly one in four students.  This will also mean a &euro;32 million increase in the Department's expenditure on the DEIS programme for 2023.  This is the largest-ever single increase in the investment in the programme and will extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest proportions of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p><p>The school completion programme was established in 2002 by the Department to support the retention of young people in education.  It was integrated into the school support programme provided under DEIS in 2005 and is now one of the key DEIS supports.  The school completion programme is a key component of Tusla education support service, TESS.  The programme is targeted to support primary and post-primary children and young people who have been identified as potentially at risk of early school leaving, or who are out of school and have not successfully transferred to education outside of the school system or into employment.<\/p><p>The Curragh, County Kildare, school completion programme comprises two local primary schools and two post-primary schools.  The total funding provided to the Curragh school completion programme by TESS is in the region of &euro;170,000 <i>per annum<\/i>.  The project provides targeted supports to young people identified as requiring support.  In addition, universal supports are given to some 500 students.  More than 700 young people receive interventions, ranging from intensive supports multiple times weekly to after-school supports and school holiday programmes.  The project also delivers a significant number of programmes such as mentoring for achievement, mind out and decider skills.<\/p><p>The educational welfare service is also part of TESS and operates under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which emphasises the promotion of school attendance, participation and retention.  The educational welfare service deals with children and families who have difficulties with regard to school attendance, participation and retention.  This is a statutory service and its primary role is to ensure that every child either attends school regularly or otherwise receives a certain minimum education to ensure and secure every child's entitlement to education.<\/p><p>A recruitment process with the already-established educational welfare officer national panel is currently under way to fill this vacant educational welfare officer post.  In the interim, TESS management at local level have been working collaboratively to bring together the home school community liaison, the school completion programme and the educational welfare service capacity in TESS to prioritise TESS interventions for children and young people to ensure school attendance.  I will bring the Senator's specific issues to the Minister for Education as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051200002#B00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1652347800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being here to give a response.  While I certainly welcome the expansion of the DEIS programme, my question was not about that.  It was specifically about the welfare office.  I accept that the Minister of State said that more than 700 young people receive interventions.  That just shows the number of young people and the extent of the community that need this support.  The Minister of State mentioned that the recruitment process is under way to fill this job and that management at local level have been working collaboratively to bring everyone together for interventions.  It is not working.  The efforts of the home school liaison and school completion programme are toothless without the legal standing of the educational welfare officer to support their work.  The educational welfare officer is an essential piece of the puzzle.<\/p> <p>I again ask the Minister when the Curragh-Kildare school completion programme can expect to have a replacement educational welfare officer.  What caused the delay?  I appreciate the Minister of State is not within the Department of Education but what will that Department do to ensure that should such a situation arise in the future, the position be filled in a time-efficient manner?

I know it is a situation of which he is very well aware.  In the Athlone area and its environs, there are eight parents who do not have a school place for their children within the Athlone school area for next September.  These eight children have been in autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes within primary school settings.  We now have a situation where there is no school available within Athlone or within 55 km of the town for them to get an education.  That is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>A number of people have also been in contact with me whose children are within the post-primary schools within the area but would prefer if there was another class for them to go to.  We need in the region of 12 to 18 places to be made available within the Athlone area for the kids to go to school.  The reality is that these children are entitled to be educated close to their home.  As it stands, some of these children will have to travel a return journey of 100 km per day to be able to get an education.  This is at a time when our school transport system requires that people go to their nearest school and yet, we are not accommodating that for families.  Parents need certainty.<\/p> <p>I will give the Minister of State an idea of the surrounding areas.  In Longford, at present, we have 48 ASD classes for an enrolment of 4,205.  There is low availability in two of the schools.  There are no places available in Mullingar, Ballinasloe or Roscommon.  Those are all the surrounding areas of Athlone town to where those families now look to have their children educated.  I have been in contact with the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  I know she is working on it but we are coming to the end of the school term and these parents have to get certainty that their children can be educated in the Athlone area, in the environs of where they live, in September 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051200002#B00500","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1652347800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Carrigy for his Commencement matter which is a very important one and, as he has referred to himself, I am aware of a number of cases in my own home town of Mullingar where there is no capacity at all.  This is a shocking situation for families who need certainty and are under significant pressure at the moment in trying to get a place for their children into the future.<\/p> <p>This year, the Department of Education will invest in excess of &euro;2 billion, or over 25% of the Department's budget, in the area of special educational needs support.  As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels.  Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 to a  current total of 2,148 for the 2021-2022 school year.  Of these, almost 1,900 special classes cater for students with autism.<\/p> <p>Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements over the past two years, the Department of Education and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined-up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year.  Overall, this intensive intervention has seen an additional 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places, which have already opened nationwide for the 2021-22 school year.<\/p> <p>The NCSE has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs nationwide.  It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  The NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all the children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  The Department, the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, continue to prioritise support of this work.  As correctly referred to by the Senator, that is very important because there are very vulnerable families travelling a distance, if they are lucky enough at times, in order to get a place.  The transport system can pose a great problem for and stress on a family.   <\/p> <p>The Department also recognises that where parents have difficulties in securing an appropriate school placement for their child, particularly a child with additional needs, it can be a stressful experience.  The Department is working hard to ensure that there are sufficient school places, appropriate to the needs of all children, available on a timely basis nationwide.<\/p> <p>As matters stand, the Department in this reply has confirmed that there is a total of 30 autism spectrum disorder, ASD, special class places in post-primary schools in the Athlone and Moate area.  The Department and the NCSE are always grateful to schools that express a willingness to open a special class to meet the educational needs of students in their local communities.  <\/p> <p>There are special educational needs organisers, SENOs, located across the country and they have a specific remit in helping and supporting parents in accessing the education necessary for their children, including in identifying suitable school placements.  The NCSE is currently engaging in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022-23 school year and beyond.  The NCSE is looking at local information on projected demand for future special education places, particularly to cater for students with autism who have associated complex needs.<\/p> <p>The NCSE has also been working with stakeholders in Westmeath for a number of years to meet the identified need in the county.  SENOs are currently engaged with schools and boards of management in the Athlone and the wider Westmeath-Roscommon regions to establish the level of need to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place to meet that need.<\/p> <p>I should also state that budget 2022 has provided funding to the Department of Education and the NCSE for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022-23 school year.  These additional classes will provide more than 1,700 new places this year.  This additional provision will bring the total number of special classes to more than 2,400 in the 2022-23 school year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051200002#C00100","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1652347800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I compliment the Government on the work that it has done and, in particular, the work that has been done by the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the senior Minister, Deputy Foley, in providing a significant number of places, especially at primary level.<\/p> <p>We have a tsunami ahead of us because we have not created the places at post-primary level.  The reply refers to the fact that there were 30 places in Athlone and in Moate.  The reality is that there are, in fact, 30 places but there is no availability in those towns for any child who wishes to avail of such a place in September.  In fact one child from just outside Athlone, on the Ballymahon side in Glasson, has secured a place in St. Mel's College in Longford.  That is a 90 km return journey every day for that family.  For anyone who knows anything about autism, and I know about this condition personally, one needs to have children in schools in places with which they are familiar.  This is not acceptable. <\/p> <p>It is also stated in the reply that the NCSE has been working on this for years.  This does not take years to sort out.  If one sits down with the schools in the area, not just there but across the country, we know the numbers that are in the primary system and we need to ensure that every family and child who is entitled to get an education - and this is written into the 1916 Proclamation - is treated equally.

I have attended a number of conferences and have engaged with quite a number of cybersecurity companies operating in the State.

That is obviously at variance with what the Senator said.  We will probably have to square that circle in regard to what is stated in the reply. Cyber Ireland is a national industry cluster headquartered in Munster Technical University in Cork.  Cyber Ireland&rsquo;s board membership indigenous and multinational firms as well as third level institutions engaged in cyber education and research.  Ministers and officials are in regular contact with Cyber Ireland and its members and the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will tomorrow participate in the launch of Cyber Ireland&rsquo;s Cybersecurity Sector in Ireland report.  The Minister of State will also soon be travelling to the US with the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, to promote Ireland as a destination for foreign direct investment.  During that visit he will meet with the multinational cybersecurity and digital services firms, which have a base here.  The Government will continue to consult with Cyber Ireland and relevant stakeholders in industry and in the academic community to inform the drafting of legislation and the forthcoming review of the national cybersecurity strategy later this year.<\/p><p>I would like to highlight on behalf of the Minister that a large proportion of legislation covering cybersecurity in Ireland has its origins in the EU and officials are in frequent contact with Cyber Ireland and other industry stakeholders both in Ireland and Brussels to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s national positions are informed by the perspective of industry.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has conducted an extensive industry consultation following the publication of the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a review of the network and information security directive in December 2020.  Officials have continued to engage with industry stakeholders during the Council negotiations last year and the ongoing<b><\/b>trialogue negotiations.  Most recently officials have engaged with stakeholders about the Commission&rsquo;s industry consultation and forthcoming Cyber Resilience Act, which closes later this month.<\/p><p>In respect of other key stakeholders I can assure the Senator that the officials in the Department are in regular and ongoing contact with relevant Departments and agencies in the drafting of legislation for the NCSC.  The Government has agreed that legislation will delineate the NCSC&rsquo;s role in relation to other actors in the cyber area.  The NCSC has long-standing co-operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces, including secondments of personnel.  To address this ever-growing threat of cybercrime and malicious cyberactivity by state and non-state actors, it is essential that the co-operation can be expanded and deepened into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051200002#D00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1652347800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Two years before the HSE was hit the NHS in the UK was taken down and nothing was done in this country to check our systems to make sure we would be robust enough in the event of an attack.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, to the Chamber.  The Connemara Bog Complex is a very large site of approximately 50,000 ha.  It covers the majority of the south Connemara lowlands in County Galway.  The site is bounded to the north by the Galway-Clifden road, the N59, and to the south, it stretches as far as the Moycullen-Spiddal road.  This is a huge area of land that is protected within the Connemara region.  It is predominantly lowland Atlantic blanket bog, with some small areas of old oak woodland with some invasive rhododendrons and, of course, some of the finest rivers are in the area.  That is very important as the Atlantic salmon, a species listed under Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive, is found in some of the rivers within this site.<\/p> <p>There is a long-running history of the selection of this area as a candidate for a special area of conservation, SAC, going back as far as 1997 when there was a first notification of the site.  It was subsequently extended and renotified in 2006.  I understand there has been an appeals process and that appeals have been lodged and processed since then.  The Department is engaging in the final signing off of the SAC.<\/p> <p>I am inquiring in regard to clarification on the appeals.  Will there be any future opportunities in regard to appeals?  I am not talking about large-scale changes.  In some cases, there may be a request for some minor changes to the boundaries of the SAC in the future.  It could be to rectify some issues where there may be mistakes on the mapping, for example, or there could be areas which are commercially sensitive to somebody and it may make sense to make a slight change in the boundary and that could be compensated elsewhere with the inclusion of another area.<\/p> <p>I am inquiring as to whether the boundaries will be the boundaries forever or whether there could be changes to an SAC in the future.  As I said, it is a huge tract of land, some 50,000 ha.  I appreciate it is hugely important in terms of biodiversity and our requirements under the Habitats Directive and it is something with which we have to comply.  There has been a great deal of discussion, engagement and talk since this was first notified as far back as 1997.  We have come a long way in terms of acceptance that SACs are here and are required under European law.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There has to be a process and a boundary created to define that special area of conservation.

It is great to see children back into the Visitors Gallery to see the work in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is very important.<\/p> <p>The designation of European sites under the nature directives is a formal, legal process with a number of steps that must be followed for each site.  The criteria used to set the boundaries of the sites are purely scientific, as is required under the nature directives.  They are designated to protect threatened, rare or endangered species and habitat types, which are listed in the annexes to the directives.  The sites chosen are significant not just on a national but on a European stage.<\/p> <p>The full process for site designation is set out in SI 477 of 2011, the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  The first step is the identification of the appropriate geographical area of the site.  This is done by scientific analysis.  Once draft boundaries are proposed, the Minister notifies landowners and the public of his intention to designate the site and provides an opportunity for objections or appeals on the proposed site boundaries.  Advertisements are published in local media and notices are displayed in local government offices, Garda stations and public libraries.  Landowners within the proposed site, where their identities are known, are notified directly in writing with detailed information including a map of the site and information about why that site is being proposed for designation and details of compensation that may be available.<\/p> <p>Connemara Bog Complex was first publicly notified in 1997 to protect a wide range of habitats and species, including active blanket bog and lagoons.  In 2006, the boundaries of the site were amended by agreement between the Government and farming organisations.  Public notifications were again issued and a further opportunity offered to appeal the amended designation.  In total over the full period, 60 objections, or appeals, were received for Connemara Bog Complex.  Of these, nine were successful, 12 were partially successful, 21 were unsuccessful and 18 were deemed invalid.  <\/p> <p>The appeals process for this site has now concluded and the site has moved on to the final stage of the process which requires the publication of a statutory instrument formally designating the site.  The statutory instrument includes a description of the site, a detailed map showing the area, a complete list of habitats and species for which the area was selected and a list of activities which require the consent of the Minister before they can be undertaken in a way that affects the site.<\/p> <p>It is important to note that all relevant protections under Irish law apply to the site from the time it is publicly notified as proposed for designation.  A full list of all designated sites, the associated maps and statutory instruments is available on the Department's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051200002#E00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1652347800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Before the I bring the Senator in, I would like to add my voice of welcome to the boys, girls and teachers of Glandore National School from west Cork, who are being hosted today by Deputy Christopher O&rsquo;Sullivan.

As I stated, people accept that SACs are with us and are required under European law and people are learning to live with them, though they are not always happy and I appreciate that.

Over the years, the steps to designate a site have remained the same, but we have been able to improve and streamline the process.  For example, the list of landowners at a site is now provided by the Property Registration Authority of Ireland.  However, we still see that not all property is registered with the Property Registration Authority.  Therefore, in order to be sure every opportunity is given to appeal, advertisements are placed in national and local newspapers and notices are also placed in local public offices.<\/p> <p>The appeals process is comprehensive.  If people&rsquo;s initial appeal is partly unsuccessful or unsuccessful and they are unhappy with the outcome, they can make a further formal appeal to the designated areas appeals advisory board.  The board is independent of the Department and it is comprised of a chairperson and equal representation from landowners, user groups and environmental conservationists.  This board considers appeals and makes formal recommendations to the Minister on a scientific basis.

At the moment in County Kildare, as with many other counties, we are going through the long and arduous process of the county development plan.  All Members know how difficult it is to get planning for a one-off house or many other types of development.  Unauthorised developments, however, are popping up to a significant extent.  I am speaking in particular about my experience in south Kildare but I have no doubt the same could be true across the country.  I have been working with local councillors on several cases in Rathangan, Newbridge and Kildare town and there is no doubt that we need a more effective system for dealing with unauthorised developments.  The resources of local authorities are stretched very thin.  That is particularly true in Kildare because there is one county council but two D&aacute;il constituencies.  There are issues in respect of enforcement and that is basically what is causing the problems.  We cannot allow unauthorised developments to go unchecked.  In several of the cases to which I refer the developments are causing significant issues for neighbours.  Even after being instructed to stop and having gone through the courts system, some of the developers are continuing to develop their sites.  That is leading to a financially onerous situation for local authorities.  The system we have is costly and inefficient and does not meet the needs of communities.  There is a need for the House to have a debate on this issue.<\/p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise relates to public transport.  I welcome the reduction in public transport fares that was announced.  It makes a significant difference for many people.  We need to ensure that all services are affordable, but also reliable.  I refer to the No. 120 Go-Ahead bus route.  It basically starts in Edenderry and goes through Derrinturn, Newbridge, Allenwood and Kilmeague on its way to Dublin.  It sometimes goes through Suncroft as well.  It is a key commuter route but it is not up to scratch.  Signage and so on are a problem.  I have received a commitment that will be fixed.  The route is completely unreliable, however.  People are relying on the service to get to work, college or hospital appointments.  Last Thursday morning, two buses did not show up.  On Friday morning, three buses did not show up.  That forces commuters to take expensive taxis, miss appointments or go to the expense of buying a second car.  It is not acceptable and it will deter people from using public transport.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, I had the opportunity to bring the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConaloge, around rural County Kildare.  We spoke to farmers and breeders about the challenges they are facing, particularly those in the context of Brexit, climate change and the Ukraine war.  A particular point raised related to fertiliser.  I saw this morning, and it is worth noting, that fertiliser manufacturer Yara International has reported a threefold increase in profitability for the first quarter of 2022 despite a sharp fall in product deliveries.  One could say it is possibly a sixfold increase.  That has to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051200002#K00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1652347800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting the Senator.

He engaged extensively with a number of the people in the House well into the night, and they really appreciated that.<\/p> <p>In that context, I call again for a debate on children.  We have spent a lot of time talking about the history of children in care, vulnerable children, displaced children and children disconnected from their parents or families through various circumstances.  At this time, we can learn so much from the past and put into place supports for children.  I am thinking especially of Ukrainian children and education.  The Leader will be aware that I have asked before for a focused debate on education, and I call for it again.  I was reminded of that because there was a segment on \"Morning Ireland\" about it.  Some Department officials are meeting today to talk about how they will manage and cope with school places in September, specifically in the context of Ukrainian children and the importance of full integration of and support for both them and their parents.  I ask that we have that debate and a focus not only on education but also on play for children because that is critical to their personal development.<\/p> <p>I call for statements on the latest annual report of the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon.  He has done amazing work.  The Cathaoirleach talks about Seanad reform.  Let us make it real, let us make it relevant and let us bring before the House current reports and discuss and debate them here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051200002#L00500","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1652347800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That No. 17 be taken before No. 1.\"  No. 17 is the Animal Health and Welfare (Dogs) Bill 2022.  This is legislation on which I have worked closely with the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA.  Many people are familiar with the images of puppies seized at ports or on the border or from illegal puppy farms.  All too often people offer to take the poor mites in, but most people are not aware that animals seized under the Animal Health and Welfare Act cannot be rehomed either until the dog is surrendered voluntarily by the owner or until the legal proceedings conclude.  That means that puppies, after receiving whatever essential veterinary care they need, must remain in either foster homes or, worse, in the animal shelter.  This means that they could be nearly two years old before they have a permanent loving home to go to.  This also places a significant financial burden on the rescue organisations, which is often not recovered in court decisions and is being used by the illegal dog smugglers to drain the resources of those organisations.  My Bill seeks to bring the Animal Health and Welfare Act in line with the Control of Dogs Act in order that dogs seized under the Control of Dogs Act, if they are found roaming or are unlicensed, can be rehomed after five days if they are not claimed.  My Bill would allow for those dogs seized under the Animal Health and Welfare Act to be rehomed after five days, subject to a veterinarian deeming it to be in the best interest of the animal's welfare.<\/p> <p>Another element of the Bill would align the microchipping law and the dog licensing laws.  Currently, a dog licence can be obtained online very easily.  In some cases, criminals use dog licences to retrospectively claim ownership of dogs that have been seized.  My Bill will make it mandatory for the licence to include the microchip of the dog in addition to the current requirement of a description.  In addition, it would mean that the local authorities would continue to get the revenue from dog licensing, which they absolutely need.  It would also help to raise awareness among dog owners that they are required by law not only to have their animals microchipped but also to have the details on the microchip kept up to date.  Many people, including very responsible dog owners, are unaware that their dogs might still be registered to the breeder or to a previous owner.  Given the devastation we know families go through when their dogs are stolen or go missing, up-to-date microchip information is the single most important tool in reuniting a beloved family pet with its family.<\/p> <p>I hope the House will accept my amendment to the Order of Business and that we will soon have an opportunity to bring this Bill to Second Stage.  This is notwithstanding the wonderful work that organisations such as the DSPCA and Dogs Trust do.  I thank the DSPCA for all its support on the Bill.  No dog should spend a day longer than is absolutely necessary in a shelter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051200002#L00600","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1652347800,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I second the proposed amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of the latest Daft report.  It comes on the back of a number of reports from both Daft and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, which show that rents in the country are rising exponentially.  They are a huge contributor to the cost-of-living crisis.  They are up 11% nationwide.  In particular, there is a real worry in the north west, where the rent on a lot of homes that are not in rent pressure zones has gone up by nearly 20%.  The issue is very concentrated there.  The Daft report highlights in particular the lack of rental properties that are available and coming onto the market for people to move into.  That indicates a big problem with supply.  To my mind, the way to address this supply crisis is to invest in cost-rental housing, which we know is more linked to affordability than other forms of housing.  Instead the Government launched yesterday the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund, which essentially gives a no-questions-asked subsidy to developers in order to complete apartment buildings in towns and cities.  The subsidy, potentially, can be &euro;120,000 per apartment.  Only &euro;5 million will be allocated to the fund this year, but the amount involved will eventually rise to &euro;500 million.  That money would be much better invested in and spent on better the development of cost-rental housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022051200002#L00700","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652347800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
