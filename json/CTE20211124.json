Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and they will notice that every second seat has been removed to facilitate social distancing.  I urge people not to move any chair from its current position.  They should also maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  I ask for members' full co-operation in this.  Any member participating remotely in the meeting can only participate from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Paul Murphy, Louise O'Reilly and Matt Shanahan.<\/p> <p>  Today's business is to resume our discussion of the general scheme of the sick leave Bill 2021.  At present, there is no statutory obligation for an employer to pay for a medically certified absence of an employee due to illness.  While many employers provide such sick pay, employees who do not receive it are disadvantaged.  We also know that it may encourage such employees to attend work even though they are ill.  In the context of the current public health situation, this is particularly undesirable.  The proposed Bill will provide for the creation of an entirely new right to sick pay, which will be legally enforceable through the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the courts.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses.  From IBEC, we have Ms Maeve McElwee, director of employer relations, and Ms Pauline O'Hare, senior employment law solicitor.  From the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, we have Dr. Laura Bambrick, social policy officer, and Mr. Liam Berney, industrial officer.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations on parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses with regard to references the witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Today, however, witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses have already been advised that they make take legal advice on this matter if they think it is appropriate.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such directions that are given.<\/p> <p>  The opening statements from IBEC and ICTU have been circulated to members.

In addition to the statement we will make today, we intend to provide the Department with a more detailed submission setting out the views of our members on the Bill as it progresses.<\/p> <p>  IBEC contends that the introduction of statutory sick pay poses a significant cost to employers, particularly small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and those sectors that have been most impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  We understand that it is the Government's intention to develop a scheme that is fair and affordable with minimum complexity and administrative burden for both employers and the State.  However, IBEC submits that the introduction of statutory sick pay, in the manner proposed, will give rise to a disproportionate cost burden to employers.  This is at a time when businesses continue to contend with the challenges posed by both Covid-19 and Brexit.  There are additional costs involved in the replacement of skills, with little or no notice, which are lost during a period of sick leave.<\/p> <p>  While the Bill provides an exemption for employers that already operate a company sick pay scheme, the criteria for determining whether an existing scheme is more favourable than statutory sick pay are so stringent that they will likely result in many employers being faced with the cost of administering a company scheme in addition to the payment of statutory sick pay.  For this reason, IBEC submits that the Bill as currently drafted will place excessive costs on employers, regardless of whether businesses have existing company sick pay schemes in place.<\/p> <p>  The Bill provides that the Minister may make regulations for the purpose of prescribing the daily rate of statutory sick leave payment.  As the regulations will not be published until the Bill has been enacted, we do not have full sight of what the prescribed rate will be.  However, we understand from the regulatory impact assessment, RIA, and the general scheme of the Bill that statutory sick leave payment will be at a rate of 70% of the employee's normal rate, subject to a daily earnings threshold of &euro;110.  The daily threshold is based on 2019 mean weekly earnings of &euro;786.33 and equates to an annual salary of &euro;40,889.16.  The Department has stated in the RIA that setting the rate at 70% is to ensure excessive costs are not placed on employers, which in certain sectors may also have to deal with the cost of replacing staff who are out sick at short notice.  However, the proposed payment is undoubtedly favourable when compared with sick pay schemes in other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland where statutory sick pay is paid at a rate of &pound;95.85 per week.  Further, while the Government's stated intention in setting the sick pay entitlement at this level is to provide a minimum level of protection to low-paid workers who may have no entitlement to company sick pay schemes, basing a statutory sick pay entitlement on an annual salary of &euro;40,889.16 goes beyond protecting those who are low paid.<\/p> <p>  The Bill provides for an entitlement to three statutory sick leave days, which may be increased by ministerial order.  IBEC understands from the RIA that the Government's intention is to increase the number of statutory sick leave days to ten by 2025.  While the phased introduction of this cost is to be welcomed, IBEC submits that a potential increase in costs of &euro;1,100 per employee per annum is excessive.  This amount does not recognise the costs to the business of replacing staff who are absent on sick leave, often at short notice.<\/p> <p>  The entitlement to statutory sick leave in the Bill is granted on a per annum basis.  IBEC submits that this entitlement should be specified to be within a rolling 12-month period rather than in one calendar year.  This is a common feature of company sick pay schemes.  Should an employee take three statutory sick leave days at the end of December and then become entitled to another three days of statutory sick leave a week later, in the new calendar year, this would be financially difficult for employers.  The extension to ten days, as indicated, will exacerbate this issue for employers, with greater challenges again for those with peak trading over December and January.  This is particularly the case for SMEs which do not already operate a company sick pay scheme and therefore may be disproportionately impacted.<\/p> <p>  The Bill provides that the entitlement to statutory sick leave arises once an employee has completed 13 weeks of continuous service, which is a significant reduction from the six-month service requirement proposed in the general scheme.  This is a matter of concern for IBEC and its members as many company sick pay schemes do not take effect until an employee has six months of service and-or has passed a probationary period.  A recent survey of IBEC members found that 60% of the 307 respondents who operate a company sick pay scheme had a six-month service requirement in place.  Of particular concern is that the exemption in respect of company sick pay schemes only applies where the company scheme is more favourable than statutory sick pay.  As a result, employers with a service requirement in excess of 13 weeks will be required to pay statutory sick pay of up to ten days per annum in addition to any entitlements arising under the company sick pay scheme.<\/p> <p>  IBEC welcomes the principle of the non-application of the obligations under the Bill to employers which operate company sick pay schemes.  However, section 9 as currently drafted undermines its effectiveness.  IBEC submits that an exemption from paying statutory sick pay should apply where an employer operates a company sick pay scheme that is no less favourable than statutory sick pay.<\/p><p>Where the employer&rsquo;s scheme is at least equivalent to the statutory entitlement, it should not be required to pay twice.<\/p><p> Second, the matters which are stated to be taken into consideration when determining whether a company sick pay scheme is more favourable are overly stringent and will exclude many employers that may operate very generous sick pay schemes.  Specifically, as noted, company sick pay schemes often include a service requirement of six months or more.  Company sick pay schemes often do not apply until the fourth day of absence, in line with the payment of illness benefit, and they often operate on a rolling basis, whereas the statutory entitlement set out under in the general scheme is based on a calendar year.  While the general scheme states that the benefits must, as a whole, be more favourable to the employee, it appears likely that very generous company sick pay schemes may fall outside the scope of this section 9 exemption where certain terms of the scheme differ from the statutory sick pay requirements.  This could result in employees who already have generous sick pay entitlements under their contracts of employment receiving an overlapping increased sick pay benefit at a disproportionate cost to their employer.  The unintended consequence of this wording is that employers will likely seek to mitigate costs by reducing benefits over the statutory requirement or offering lesser terms to new employees.  This in turn would threaten industrial relations stability in the longer term.<\/p><p> IBEC and its members are concerned that although the Government intends the statutory sick pay scheme to be fair and affordable, for many companies, above all SMEs, the introduction of statutory sick pay will present a disproportionate cost burden, particularly in the current environment.  That cost will only be heightened where companies have the additional cost of replacing skills, with little or no notice, lost during a period of sick leave.  While IBEC supports the exemption of companies that already operate company sick pay schemes from the obligations of the proposed Bill, it appears from the current drafting that many employers who already operate sick pay schemes will not be in a position to avail of this exemption, which is of great concern to our members.  IBEC submits that any statutory sick pay scheme that is introduced must be sustainable and not represent a disproportionate cost.  In this regard, as much of the detail that will affect IBEC members will be set out in the subsequent regulations, IBEC will be seeking to engage with the Department on their drafting.  It is vital that IBEC is consulted in order to ensure that any proposed statutory sick pay scheme is fair and affordable, as well as manageable and operable, for employers across the board.  The scheme should include the introduction of tools for managers to be able to operate the scheme, manage and address issues that may arise around sick pay, none of which is currently included in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McElwee.

My colleague Mr. Liam Berney will join us later following his meeting with the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands, if time allows.<\/p> <p>  First, the congress wishes to acknowledge the work of Department officials and the collaborative approach taken throughout on the design of the new scheme, including by this committee.  In the brief time available for my opening remarks, I will focus on key outstanding issues for ICTU and highlight differences between what is provided for in the draft Bill and what was indicated as intended in the general scheme of the Bill, which was published in June of this year.<\/p> <p>  Section 2 of the general scheme provides for the meaning to be ascribed to terms used in the body of the proposed Bill.  Like all employment legislation, the scope of what is provided for extends only to those employed on a &ldquo;contract of employment&rdquo;.  The definition of that term, for the purposes of this legislation, is taken from the Terms of Employment Information Act 1994.  This is a narrow definition and confines the scope of the proposed Bill to those employed on conventional contracts of service.  ICTU recommends a better and broader definition of a contract of employment, namely, those provided by the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Payment of Wages Act 1991.  Both definitions are much wider than the one now proposed.  Paragraph (b) of both definitions extends to atypical forms of working arrangements and is more akin to the notion of a worker in European law and the definition of a worker in UK law.<\/p> <p>  Section 5(2) of the general scheme provides employees with an entitlement to up to three days of paid sick leave per year.  While ICTU acknowledges that it is the clear intention of the scheme design that after 12 months, the three days will automatically move to five, then seven, and ten days in 2025, we are concerned that three days, not ten, will always be written into the legislation.<\/p> <p>  Section 5(5) provides that the service qualification for entitlement to statutory sick leave is 13 weeks&rsquo; continuous services.  Head 6(2)(a) of the draft scheme provides that the entitlements created by the proposed Bill will commence when an employee has completed six months of continuous employment.  Both cannot be right.  The congress recommends that the qualification period be kept to a minimum so as not to stall labour market mobility or create a perverse incentive for employers to dismiss workers before they come into qualification.<\/p> <p>  We are further concerned that the proposed Bill provides that the service qualification be based on continuous service.  Certain groups of workers routinely have their service broken by their employer.  One example is the thousands of early years professionals working in early childhood care and education, ECCE, or preschool services on 38-week contracts, who are forced to sign onto social welfare during the summer.  ICTU recommends that the wording be deleted or amended to ensure such workers do not have to build up their entitlement year after year and are repeatedly left without coverage for months on end.<\/p> <p>  Section 5(8) provides that all sick leave must be certified by a registered medical practitioner.  While the requirement to have the sickness certified is common practice in statutory sick leave schemes throughout the EU, Ireland is unusual in that workers have to pay for primary healthcare.  Very few people in employment are covered by a medical card or a GP visit card.  The Healthy Ireland survey wave 5, commissioned by the Department of Health, shows that an estimated 14.6% of people, or one in seven, aged between 18 and 64 working for payment or profit - that is, employees and self-employed people - hold a medical card, while a mere 3.6% hold a GP visit card.  In recognition that the out-of-pocket expense for a GP visit will create a barrier for workers exercising their new right to paid sick leave, the congress recommends that the final version of the Bill include provision for limited periods of self-certified sick leave.  Self-certified sick leave typically costs about one tenth of the total cost of public service sick leave.<\/p> <p>  Section 7(2) merely provides that the daily rate of statutory sick leave, and the maximum daily amount payable, are to be prescribed in regulations to be made by the Minister.  However, head 7(1) of the general scheme provides that the daily rate is to be 70% of the employee&rsquo;s daily rate, subject to a maximum of &euro;110 per day.  This can be varied by the Minister by regulations made under the proposed Bill.  We recommend that the legislation further require the Minister to consult with the social partners annually on the adequacy of the daily rate, income cap and income floor to ensure adequacy and its interaction with occupational sick pay schemes, and to report to the Oireachtas on the outcome of this consultation.<\/p> <p>  Section 9 of the draft Bill provides, in effect, that the obligations imposed on an employer are not applicable where the employer provides employees with a sick pay scheme which is more favourable than that prescribed by the Bill.  Many contractual sick pay schemes provide for waiting days, typically meaning that no payment is made for the first three days of illness.  ICTU recommends that, rather than excluding the application of the legislation completely where more favourable contractual schemes apply, obligations under the Bill would not apply in respect of any day on which the employee is entitled to be paid by his or her employer under the terms of a more favourable sick leave scheme.<\/p><p>Section 10 of the Bill provides for the granting by the Labour Court, of an exemption from the requirements of the Act.  This is now a standard provision.  Congress recommends that in such circumstance the employee is fully compensated from the Social Insurance Fund and a debt is raised against the employer in the same ways as when a payment is made under the redundancy and insolvency payment scheme with employers that are still trading. <\/p><p> Having convinced the Government of the necessity to introduce statutory sick pay, the priority for congress is now to ensure that the new scheme will protect workers' health and income and bring a basic employment right in line with European norms.  It is this that informs our recommendations to the committee today.  I thank members for their attention and am happy to take any questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses for their presentations.  This is a very welcome discussion.  Sinn F&eacute;in very much welcomes the introduction of a sick pay scheme.  It is long overdue and it is good to see employers and unions working collaboratively to achieve this goal.<\/p> <p>  Could both witnesses comment on why Ireland has been an outlier for so long when it comes to the provision of sick pay?  We quite rightly often hear from IBEC in terms of making sure we are not an outlier in respect of investment in research and development compared to our European colleagues but we have been an outlier for decades on the subject of sick pay.  Why has this been the case for so long?  <\/p> <p>  One of my key concerns about this Bill is the practicalities of it, particularly regarding workers requiring certification from a GP.  Let us be practical here.  Right now, if a worker is sick, he or she is not going to get an appointment with a GP today.  In fact, he or she will be lucky to get an appointment this week.  That is the reality we must recognise.  We must also recognise that unlike our colleagues across most of Europe, where there is no charge to access a GP, here we are looking at anything between &euro;60 and &euro;80.  This means that the first day's sick leave pay is effectively gone because the person has had to pay it out for a doctor's certificate.  This is clearly a barrier to workers accessing the scheme.  Would it not be better to go for a limited self-certification period for the first couple of days not just because it would be the right thing to do in terms of not punishing workers by having them pay &euro;60 but also because it is simply not practical to expect a worker to be able to access a GP on the same day he or she is sick?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#C00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Regarding the reason why we are out of line with Europe, I know the issue of statutory sick pay has been reviewed over many years.  This is not the first time it has come up for broader consideration.  I presume that as with any of these issues around employment rights and terms and conditions that apply, all of these things get looked at.  They look at the principle around our social protection system, the fact that illness benefit was always paid by the State and the fact that there are other provisions to support employees that may not necessarily be in place in other states.  There are probably a very significant number of factors that give rise to that.<\/p> <p>  The Senator&rsquo;s point about certification on day one is of considerable concern to us as well.  Like the Senator, we recognise the challenge for people getting access on day one to certification in a non-emergency situation.  Nevertheless what is really important to recognise here, particularly when we are overlaying a statutory sick pay scheme on existing company pay schemes is that most company sick pay schemes do require certification after the waiting days, which are typically three.  They always require that certification to be produced on day three and do not accept backdated certificates because technically, it is very difficult for a GP to know how sick someone was three days ago so that certification always comes on day one.  <\/p> <p>  It was recognised in a number of the initial consultation papers we received that management of sick pay also helps to manage absence and it was introduced as a positive consideration about the introduction of statutory sick pay, in that it would assist employers in managing absence.  However, there are no provisions in this Bill to assist employers in managing absence and address concerns employers may have around the veracity of sick leave taken, how it is taken or whether there is an abuse of sick leave that is ongoing.  Other pieces of protective legislation recognise that these situations do arise &ndash; not all of the time but they do arise and they do need to be managed and addressed.  This is probably the only piece of management support within this legislation as it currently stands and I know employers would be very concerned to see it removed, albeit we do recognise the challenge around a medical practice being able to issue a certificate on the same day.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The last time the introduction of statutory sick pay was looked at was when the troika was in town.  When it went through our books to look for potential cost savings - to put it diplomatically - it looked at how we provide workers with sick pay.  The troika identified that we are really unusual throughout Europe in that our Social Insurance Fund picks up the cost of workers&rsquo; sick pay from day one &ndash; day one minus the waiting days.  In other countries, the employer is entitled for a short period.  If the illness lasts longer than that, the Social Insurance Fund then kicks in to cover it.  The push-back was very similar to what we are hearing today, which is that now is not the time to introduce it and the country is going through so much that it is important to keep labour costs low.  One of the recommendations of the troika was that statutory sick pay be introduced because the existing situation was placing a risk on the State because the Social Insurance Fund is not a fund.  It is a cost that is taken out of the day-to-day outgoings of the State.  That is the last time this was looked at.  This time, we did not need the troika arriving in town.  It was a global pandemic that brought us to this space.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the GP certificate, we must go back to the origins of this Bill.  It concerned Covid clusters in meat factories.  Employers in this sector are very wealthy with a mostly migrant workforce.  How would that migrant workforce function under this Bill?  The majority of them are on a minimum wage.  The Bill will provide them with 70% of their daily rate.  That is lower than the average cost of seeing a GP, which is &euro;60.  Seventy percent of an eight-hour day on the minimum wage is in or around &euro;57 so already they are out of pocket by &euro;3.  They are also based in really rural communities.  The chances of seeing a GP in a built-up environment such as Dublin are already difficult, so seeing a GP in a very isolated area would add further expense involving in travelling to see that GP as well as the practicalities of having GP certification on the first day.  They would be the concerns of congress, which is why we recommend that a period be introduced where someone can be self-certified in order that people can have those one or two days and then on day three, have the time and knowledge to know if this is a sickness that will require a further period of recuperation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Bambrick.  The meat factory workers are an excellent example of how, unless we move to a limited period of self-certification, this sick pay scheme will not work.  It will leave them out of pocket, as Dr. Bambrick has said.  Clearly, that is not what any of us wants to achieve through this Bill.<\/p> <p>  I have another concern that I want to raise with both parties, which is how we write the legislation.  As Dr. Bambrick has said, it is going to be written in with just three days leave and the idea is that regulations will increase that.  As we all know, there is no guarantee that those regulations will come into force as planned.  We all know that there is likely to be a pushback whenever the next cycle of session comes around.  Would we not be far better to write the schedule of days and increases into the legislation to ensure that we end up with a worthwhile scheme?  While that would not put us on a par with our colleagues in Europe it would at least bring us some way towards that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#DD00100","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>We had expected that we would see something different and more than just regulations.  On the other hand, it is reasonable that there is flexibility to adjust the days without having to fully amend the legislation on every occasion.  I mean that the regulations give a little bit more flexibility rather than primary legislation.<\/p> <p>  I wish to take up a couple of points.  Dr. Bambrick mentioned that we are saying keep wages low and do not bring in sick pay now.  I wish to correct the record and I acknowledge that it might just have been the way I heard Dr. Bambrick.  We are not saying not to bring in sick pay.  We are saying that there are some really challenging issues and very significant costs for lots of employers at this particular time.  Certainly, we are not talking about keeping wages low.<\/p> <p>  When we come to that issue of writing the days into the legislation, I think what we would all recognise is that once those days are in the legislation and are operated by contract with the employee they rarely, if ever, move back.  It is not IBEC's normal operation to see those days move back on an across the board basis.  For example, at the time of the national minimum wage changes many years ago, in response to the financial crisis, IBEC did not support that move at all.  We do not expect to see that type of change would come about.  We do recognise that it is important.  It is covered in the Bill as it is currently stands.  There are exemptions and exceptions albeit that they tend not to be particularly useful to employers individually but they are at least there for individual different circumstances.  I am not sure that having it as a regulation or definitively in the primary legislation might necessarily be any different.  We would not expect to see that being clawed back but it would be normal that regulations could amend legislation.  Also, any increases could be looked at and maybe amended or introduced more slowly in the event of a negative economic situation at any particular point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Similarly to IBEC, Congress would have expected to see at least ten days in primary legislation because the way we are interpreting this is that the ten days will be the floor of this statutory right.

What are her thoughts on this matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#DD00500","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his question.  While I am not a payroll specialist, I know that there are considerable concerns among members about the timescale for the legislation&rsquo;s introduction.  There are undoubtedly any number of challenges that would arise for organisations in its implementation, how it could be managed and how employers would integrate the statutory sick pay scheme, given the complexities they already deal with in running their existing sick pay schemes.  Many employers, particularly those that have grown over many years, perhaps by acquisition, do not have a single sick pay scheme.  We could identify multiple schemes in a number of our larger members that have not had the opportunity to amalgamate them.  There could be ten or 15 schemes still running.  That poses a major challenge to trying to integrate a statutory sick pay scheme, particularly where so many questions remain.  In section 9, for example, no clear understanding can be taken from the current wording as to whether an employer&rsquo;s scheme can be considered better in the round or who can consider it to be better.  Would one or two days&rsquo; difference in a current private scheme make it better than a scheme that the WRC adjudicated on two days earlier?  The Bill provides no clarity or guidance whatsoever.  For employers trying to integrate a scheme like that into their overall payroll programmes would be problematic.

A worker would not get those one or two days every time he or she goes on potential sick leave.  It would be limited to a number of days every 12 months, as Ms McElwee suggested.

This is a big change for Ireland and we are pleased to have the opportunity to discuss this with all the actors involved because we want to get it right.  Ms McElwee spoke about the sectors that have been most impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  She might expand on that and explain what those sectors are.  She also mentioned in her presentation that there are additional costs involved in the replacement of skills, with little or no notice, which are lost during a period of sick leave.  Is it not the case that regardless of sick leave some employers would have to replace skills if somebody was out sick?<\/p> <p>  We need to explore the question of existing schemes being more favourable than statutory sick pay.  I agree with Ms McElwee that we need to drill down into that because I do not see how people could be paid on the double.  The witnesses from IBEC said they would give us more information and I would like them to give us an indication as to what sick pay schemes are out there already, how they are operated by various companies and how they work.  That would help us to examine this.  Ms McElwee mentioned in her presentation that 307, or 60%, of respondents came back and said that they operated sick pay schemes.  Ms McElwee mentioned more than once that the bigger companies seem to be operating a sick pay scheme or maybe more than one scheme in some instances and the smaller companies will be under pressure.  We are all agreed that we do not want to put pressure on SMEs to the extent that they cannot operate this.  We need to find a way around that but big companies can well afford it.  I have also been looking at some research, which I am not sure if IBEC has been looking at.  The research maintains that paid sick leave is good for business.  Rather than impacting on business, if it is done properly it can increase worker productivity, reduce the spread of contagious illnesses, keep businesses open during Covid-19, as was the case in some states in America and reduce worker turnover.  There are huge positives to paid sick leave and some of the larger companies that operate such schemes probably recognise this and understand that happy workers lead to better productivity and so on.  We might need to talk about that.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Dr. Bambrick as well.  I would like to further explore the issue of bogus self-employment.  I was speaking with some employers recently and they maintained that were they to operate various statutory schemes like this one, they would be competitively disadvantaged by other companies that operate bogus self-employment.  I would like to hear Dr. Bambrick expand on bogus self-employment because some employers I spoke with were concerned about that.  The 38-week contracts are another issue we need to explore further.  Dr. Bambrick mentioned that self-certified sick leave typically costs about one tenth of the total cost of public service sick pay.  Where does that statistic come from?  I have looked at what the HSE and others do and the HSE provides seven days of self-certified paid sick leave in a continuous two-year period.  If it is self-certified then how is there a cost?  Maybe I am missing something here and excuse me if I am.  Dr. Bambrick also mentioned that the Social Insurance Fund should be used in some instances, which is interesting and curious, even though others have said that should not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#E00300","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I will take the Deputy's questions from the beginning.  He asked which sectors might be most affected.  We will see it in many sectors, including in our experience economy, which has been hugely impacted by Covid.  The introduction of sick pay schemes there will undoubtedly create an additional burden of cost.  Any businesses that do not have sick pay schemes will feel the cost but our experience economy will be hardest hit.  It is also coming into its most difficult trading period early next year and there are huge challenges around the sector at that time of the year anyway and putting this on top of that provides a significant cost.  There are other sectors across the board where we know that wages tend to be set at a particular rate, whether that is the national minimum wage or whether there are sectoral employment orders or joint labour committee rates in place.  There will also be a requirement for us to look at how we will realign all of that so there is a significant impact across those sectors as well.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of things to look at in the issue the Deputy raised around replacement costs and employers having to replace costs.  We also have a significant challenge in respect of the availability of labour in all sectors.  Not alone is it difficult to replace individuals but it is expensive to replace them.  We also have considerable challenges in the negative context and climate around short-term work contracts and agency working, whereas in fact they are an important part of our workplace flexibility.  The ability of employers to offer and appropriately provide statutory entitlements like sick pay, carer&rsquo;s leave and parental leave relies on that flexibility.  It is important that we do not perpetuate the negative narrative that these are poor employment options.  They often provide a first step in the door for many individuals but it is difficult and costly to replace skills that are particularly unique.  Where you might have somebody in a stand-alone role, there is an additional cost.  That person will have to be replaced; otherwise the company bears the cost of either lost production or significantly reduced production over time.  Employers that are not paying sick leave already bear that replacement cost or productivity loss but now they will also in many cases bear the productivity loss or cost, which is excessive in many cases, and the statutory sick pay cost as well.  The more days that are introduced as we move through the system, the more costly that can become in the long term.<\/p> <p>  Looking at how sick pay schemes operate, the vast majority of members who we have surveyed tell us they have waiting days in place.<\/p><p>There is initially going to be a service element.  Most employers do not start incorporating people into sick pay schemes until they have passed their probation, which is typically six months.  After that, there will be service days and, therefore, there are waiting days where people can take a couple of days' sick leave without the requirement to be paid but also without the requirement to produce any certification for those particular days.  They are still considered to be authorised leave, however.  They are out sick and that is recognised.<\/p><p> When we look at organisations and how sick pay works, however, the Deputy is quite right.  Employers see sick leave as being a benefit.   They see it as an opportunity to attract people to their organisations where they can afford to put something in place.  It is not just larger companies.  Many smaller companies offer sick pay benefits to their employees where, again, they can afford it.<\/p><p> The challenge, particularly with this proposed Bill, is that in terms of offering a benefit, it often has to be managed so that it is not actually just a right, it is a benefit of one's employment and it operates to be beneficial and fairly and effectively.  There is nothing that employees hate more than that sense that people are getting away with stuff where others are operating very effectively.  We know that the unions support and have always supported employers on this piece.  As a result, it will be critical to look at sick pay schemes and say that almost every existing sick pay scheme has a disqualification cause; a reason to say that an employer is not actually operating the scheme fairly and we are disqualifying them from it.  There will be clauses within it which state that the company will review a person's sick leave if it feels that there is a pattern to it or that there is an ongoing problem with the potential to be able to restrict a person's usage of it.<\/p><p> There are abuse clauses, as there are in other items of statutory legislation, relating to people who it is felt are not operating it in line with the principle that it is there to support.  All those things are very important clauses in the context of sick pay.  Then there are other situations where organisations will run sick pay.  There will be issues around whether a person will be eligible to earn a bonus, what schemes are in place and other company benefits that will be dependent on sick pay, particularly where the sick pay is going to be put on a statutory leave footing and how that will interact with other company benefits and schemes, such as, for example, those relating to attendance bonuses.  Were we to suggest that a person is not deemed to be absent on a day that he or she is on statutory sick leave, how will that have an impact?  There is much complexity regarding how sick leave schemes operate within the environment at present.<\/p><p> On the Deputy's final point to the effect that big companies can well afford it, big companies that have put in place sick pay schemes can afford the schemes they have budgeted for and are operating.  If we are now layering on additional costs, that will be challenging for many organisations if we are now referring to day one and, again, the lack of clarity around section 9 as to whether it is better in the round or on the whole and how that will operate may actually increase costs.  The last thing we want to do is to be seen through statutory legislation to drive a race to the bottom where employers step back and say they have actually put in place some significant benefits for employees, including sick pay but often many other benefits.  If this is layered on top and represents an additional cost, employers may say they are able to afford it but are being penalised for putting more favourable policies in place because everything that comes a statute is now layered on top of it instead of being taken in the round, which I think the proposed Bill is trying to do.  That really needs to be made clear because, otherwise, employers will retrench and say that if the cost is going to be added on, they have to be sure and have some certainty regarding what the cost will be.  If, therefore, there are no management clauses in the legislation and no overarching ability to be able to say that an employer has something that is better overall, then employers, quite reasonably, will rely on the legislation and say that that is what they will implement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>That final point was well made.

Our two big concerns for trade unions in winning the right for statutory sick pay, forgetting about the details of the proposed Bill, are what Ms McElwee talked about whereby it could lead to a displacement of existing occupational sick pay at company level, which, at ten days, actually has ended up being more generous than what is in the proposed legislation.  All of a sudden, instead of the proposed legislation becoming a floor it becomes a ceiling.<\/p> <p>  The second issue we had, to which the Deputy drew attention, is whether this will incentivise more bogus self-employment because there will be an incentive for some employers to avoid the costs that will be imposed on them.  That is why we made our first recommendation in respect of changing the definition in section 2 as to who is covered.  That would take in many of those workers who are providing services rather than under a contract of employment.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to people who are working in ECCE, also known as the free year or playgroup year.  If early years professionals are working for the service providers that just provide those playgroup years, they have to sign on for the summer.  They do not have continuous contracts of employment because the facility is not getting the funding through the Government scheme.  Under this proposed Bill, they would have to build up their entitlement again.  A person who starts back in September would not be eligible until December under this Bill.<\/p> <p>  The reason self-certified sick leave is still creating a cost in respect of the scheme is that the worker would still get paid for those pays but he or she would not be obliged to provide the employer with a GP certificate.  Self-certified and uncertified days still operate the same costs to the scheme.  The difference is having to provide a GP certificate for those days or not.  That is where the 10% comes.<\/p> <p>  On the Social Insurance Fund, as I mentioned earlier, it is recommended - and we support this - that where an employer has shown an inability to meet the costs of the scheme, they can go to the Labour Court.  To ensure that the employee is not left out of pocket, however, in the same way that we do with redundancies in the context of companies that are letting workers go but are still trading, the Social Insurance Fund picks up the cost and then the charge is imposed on the employer.  Over time, the Department works with that employer to ensure that the money is paid back.  This means that neither the employee, in the first instance, nor the Social Insurance Fund, in the medium to long term, are out of pocket.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Bambrick and Deputy Stanton.

As I said at the previous meeting, I am relieved and frustrated in equal measure that we are eventually having the pre-legislative scrutiny of this important proposed legislation.  Enormous credit goes to ICTU and to my union, SIPTU, in terms of putting this issue very much on the map some 12 months ago.  My big regret, perhaps, is that it has taken until now for us to talk about introducing this proposed legislation.  Nonetheless, we are here today.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  It is important for me to mention the importance of hardwiring some of the detail into the legislation, which I believe Senator Gavan, the ICTU and others also spoke about.  I am very supportive of that.  I will turn to IBEC first regarding the question of replacement costs and productivity losses or, as Deputy Stanton alluded to, long-term productivity gains.<\/p><p>I note that IBEC undertook a survey of its members with regard to sick pay arrangements within their workplaces.  Was a question about the replacement cost of a person being out of work because of illness asked in that survey?  It is important that we understand there is a replacement cost but we must also understand the extent of that replacement cost in any one workplace.  <\/p><p> As a follow-up to that, has IBEC looked at research on the productivity loss from staff members being out ill?  Is the loss linear?  To me, the loss from a staff member being out one day is not the equivalent of his or her being out six days.  It seems to me the loss would be much greater if somebody was out of work for a protracted period of time as opposed to one or two days.  I know that the productivity loss is a concern to IBEC.  What research has it looked at to quantify the scale of the loss within workplaces?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#F00500","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I think that question was for me.  We did not specifically ask member companies in that particular survey to try to quantify the productivity loss because we understood that a different number would have come back from every respondent.  The scale of productivity loss would depend on the role each company was trying to replace and the specific skill set involved.  It also might depend on the area of the country the company is in.  What we know is that depending on that skill set and depending on the availability of labour, it can be a very different cost and a difficult challenge for many employers.  That is the case now.  It was also the case before the pandemic and it remains the case since the loosening of some restrictions.  The availability of talent continues to be the number one concern for employers.  The absence of people within that talent pipeline in the organisation does matter.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked whether a longer, more protracted absence is more difficult and costly to manage.  In actual fact, many employers find that short-term absences are much more disruptive because staff members are much harder to replace.  If we know somebody is going to be unwell and out of work for a longer period of time, it is easier to make sure a replacement is in place.  It is easier to plan and manage if somebody is likely to be out for six days, ten days or whatever it might be than it is if somebody is out for multiple, very short periods, which tend not to come with a great deal of notice.  There is a cost associated with bringing in somebody from an agency, moving somebody within the business or just doing without and addressing the productivity loss.  It is different depending on the role but short-term absences are much more disruptive for organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>At the start of her submission to the committee, Ms McElwee indicated that IBEC intends to provide the Department with a more detailed submission setting out the views of its members.

Looking at the Bill as it is currently drafted and given the lack of clarity we have, we feel a lot of information is missing.  As I have already outlined, there are a number of clauses, including anti-abuse clauses and companies' ability to be able to manage this system appropriately, as one would expect any organisation to manage an absence policy, in which there is a lack of clarity.  The definitions within sections 8 and 9 are very unclear.  We are expecting that as the Bill moves forward, we will see more clarity around its drafting.  We hope that as a result of our interventions at the committee today, some of the concerns we have around the lack of clarity in the legislation will be reflected as the Bill progresses and it will be amended and updated to address some of those concerns.<\/p> <p>  I have listened to the points Dr. Bambrick has raised this morning about, for example, the definitions within the initial sections.  We have a different sense and a different feeling around the whole issue of who is going to be captured by it.  We have had some discussion around bogus self-employment and who would be captured.  The real concern for employers is that we do not have a definition of \"worker\" in Irish legislation.  One is either an employee or is not an employee.  We have plenty of case law and legislation that allows us to determine who is an employee and who is not.  We have adequate and ample mechanisms, in our view, for how that gets done.  The challenge with legislation like this is that if we have people who are not in a traditional employment contract, that opens up a whole question as to how an employer would understand to whom they have responsibilities.  How would the employer apply existing sick pay schemes to somebody who is not on an existing contract of employment, as we understand it?  How are we going to deal with people who have multiple part-time roles, that is, people who are not just in the employment of one employer?  What happens when a worker's illness might arise from an injury or occupational illness suffered while working for one employer?  How are we going to manage such a situation, even for payroll or reporting purposes, and determine who is paying that sick leave and how it will be structured?  We have no clarity at all around how part-time sick pay is going to be managed, accrued or calculated.  To answer the Senator's question, there is still a major absence of information that will require remedy before we think this Bill is ready to be enacted.  However, we do not intent to delay it.

Ms McElwee said in her opening statement that it would be financially unsustainable for a worker to take three days' sick leave at the end of December and three days' sick leave in the new calendar year.  How is that different from a person taking three days' sick leave because he or she falls ill in September, that person having taken another three days' leave in July?  I ask that mindful of Ms McElwee's previous comments about six days' absence being easier to plan for compared with a day here and a day there.

From our perspective, I am probably looking at particular sectors that were impacted here.  There are two issues.  One is the fact that most sick leave schemes, as they currently operate, are on a rolling basis.  This entitlement arises every year from January to December but it rolls, depending on when sick leave might have been first activated within the rolling period.  The calendar period presents a unique challenge for many sectors, particularly those in our experience economy and those in retail because many of them have extraordinarily busy times.  During those times, those employers would not offer annual leave on a regular basis.  Taking retail as an example, that would be true as we come into the Christmas trading period and the new year's sales period.  It is often a challenge for other employees when people are absent or not around.  Three or four days' absence is disruptive during that period.  If sick pay is available for ten days, somebody could potentially disappear for ten days before Christmas and another ten days during the January sales period.<\/p><p>We were looking at it in the context of the experience economy element across entertainment, hospitality, retail, restaurants and bars, with all those sectors hitting that critically important trading period in December and January.

This is about working together to make sure it is right.  The intentions on both sides is to make sure this is done correctly.  Ms McElwee expressed concerns about the draft legislation and ensuring it is right.  She gave the example of a person who has two jobs who gets injured in one job and how would that would affect his or her other job.  All the examples she gave would have happened in other countries when sick pay was introduced.  How did they manage?  Has IBEC researched how it has been managed in other countries in the context of the various concerns Ms McElwee raised?  Are there good examples of how other countries managed in that regard?<\/p> <p>  This is a question for Dr. Bambrick and Ms McElwee regarding medical certificates.  One of the main concerns about getting a doctor&rsquo;s certificate is the cost for the employee.  Almost 50% of people either have a medical card or a GP visit card.  It would not be 50% because many retired people would have medical cards.  Has any research been done on the percentage of employees who hold a medical card or a GP card?  I know from my constituency office that many people who are entitled to a GP card are not aware of that.  Perhaps we need to get that message out.  It certainly protects the lowest paid.  When we talk about the cost of paying a GP for a medical certificate in respect of sick pay being a significant barrier, I would be interested to know the percentage of employees who hold a GP card or a medical card.

As the Senator said, we have good coverage of the population as a whole with respect to medical cards and GP cards.  The officials mentioned the working-age population in this context last week.  Many people in that cohort are outside the workforce.  I refer to those with disabilities and many lone parents.  If one&rsquo;s youngest child is under the age of eight, one is not required to be looking for work and one is therefore not counted as part of the labour force.  The Department of Health conducts a Healthy Ireland survey every two or three years of a sample of 7,500 people.  It is representative, which means it is similar to the Red C poll one would read about on a Sunday.  It is a snapshot of the population.  We can note from it that one in seven people who are actively working, being either self-employed or employees, has a medical card and one in 27 has a GP card.  When we narrow it down and examine the people not only of working age but who are in employment or self-employed, it is very narrow and the reason for that is the income is based on the household, not on what the individual earns.  We know from research on minimum wage workers that many of them do not live in low-income households because they are either living with their parents, who have their own income, or they are living with a spouse, and the minimum wage earner is a second earner who might have a part-time entry job.  We have very few people who are in work who have the cost of going to a GP covered.  One in seven of them has a full medical card and one in 27 has a GP card.  Many people of working age have a medical card but very few of them who are actively working today will have the &euro;60 cost of a GP visit to get medical certificate covered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Dr. Bambrick said that survey is done every three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#H00600","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>It think it is done every two years.

Would that be a concern?  Would Ms McElwee give us an indication of what that is?

I would also say that there can be increased productivity where there is good management of those schemes and where there are good relationships, but I would also tell the Deputy that the bread and butter of the IBEC executive's role is often dealing with the day-to-day issues that arise around absence and absence management.  Without a doubt we regularly have issues and concerns that arise around ongoing sporadic absences.  They may be around managing issues where perhaps somebody has an underlying concern but often they can be linked to other issues.  It is an ongoing matter for employers to deal with.  It is important that they deal with it fairly and have a process for dealing with it but there is no doubt these are the daily questions that come through around managing that sporadic absence.  Questions arise on how to implement the company's sick pay scheme if people are not providing medical certificates, if employees are always missing on a Monday or if somebody is routinely gone after a bank holiday weekend?  HR departments are occupied with such issues on an ongoing basis and that is one reason we say it is so important that there is governance, because the management of those schemes appropriately and fairly within a process is what makes them work.  It is what makes them attractive and makes other employees feel that everybody is being treated the same way.  Everybody knows when somebody is abusing a sick pay scheme.  When employers do not deal with it it becomes a really significant industrial relations problem.  That is why schemes can be seen as a benefit.  Where they are well managed they address those issues.  Where people are not operating in good faith they can be managed within the provision of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve McElwee"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McElwee.

As Ms McElwee mentioned earlier, trade unions are very supportive when there is genuine abuse happening because these have to date been voluntary arrangements by the employer and so we wanted to see these schemes work both for good worker-employer relations but also to protect the sustainability of the scheme.  I will also point to other international research.  The findings are somewhat paradoxical.  They show that the more generous a sick pay scheme is, the fewer waiting days, the higher the replacement rate cost, the easier it is to access it with those uncertified days, and the less absenteeism we see.  It sounds contradictory, that if one gives people easier access to paid days off, the expectation might be that they might abuse it and take the time.  What the research finds when it digs down is that it allows people to take days off when they have a minor ailment and it stops the condition festering into something more serious that a longer spell of absenteeism is needed to recuperate.  This is what we have seen during the outbreaks of Covid-19.  People had minor coughs and colds, were not sure if it was Covid-19 and took the gamble to go to work because they did not have the safeguard of a sick pay scheme, and within that time whole companies had to be shut down.  Real research exists which says that a generous scheme can be more beneficial and less costly than being very tight about who can access it and the terms under which they can access it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021112400002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Bambrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Bambrick and Deputy Stanton.

Officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment made a number of comments two weeks ago that were not reflective of the reality on the ground with regard to the working age population and their entitlement to medical cards.

There are certainly those who have a break in their employment in a particular year.  When the Labour Party put forward its Bill on sick pay last September, there was a provision for a four-week minimum service period.  Dr. Bambrick made the point that effectively a period of 13 weeks is too long.  What does congress propose the minimum service period should be?

We accept that is a principle that is already established in other legislation.  Our concern around this is the wording of continuous service.  That is where it causes difficulties.  Our colleagues in SIPTU, who represent the early years, drew our attention to the thousands - we are not talking about a niche group here - of workers in the early years whose employment does not exist for 52 weeks of the year.  Under this existing draft legislation, they would start off again as a new entrant employee even though they have established that relationship with that employer.

Hopefully, we are pre-empting much of this now.  Once this gets out into the field, many things will arise and it will be important there is an opportunity in this regard, rather than us of each separately having to lobby the Minister to say that something is an issue.  For example, we might find that some workers will be worse off than they would have been if they had got the illness benefit after day four.  We want to make sure that there are no unintended consequences.  It is not the intention of congress to see employers who moved early and established good company policies being in any way penalised by this legislation.  That would be a big concern.  Equally, bogus self-employment, which was mentioned earlier, would be a concern.<\/p> <p>  For some people the 70% replacement rate will be a disappointment.  However, we are comparing it to the replacement rates in European countries that have had those schemes in place for decades, and some for centuries.  The schemes we are looking at today did not exist from day one.  The really important part of this legislation is it is putting in place the principle that employers are responsible for their workers for a fixed period of time if a worker is too sick to work.  We can look at tinkering around the edges and hopefully improving the scheme in terms of replacement rates, the timing and the certified and non-certified days as it progresses.

Last year, inflation was very subdued across the euro area - even turning negative for several months as economies closed down to slow the spread of the virus.  Coinciding with the easing of health restrictions and increased economic activity, inflation turned positive again in 2021.  We know that many people are feeling these very real price increases, in particular across their energy and fuel bills.<\/p> <p>  Overall, increasing inflation is being driven by three factors, namely, higher energy prices, a rebound in prices for some goods and services that fell sharply during the pandemic and a rebound in demand, which is meeting global supply bottlenecks in both inputs and transportation.  At first, inflation developments in Ireland lagged behind those of the euro area due in part to a slower phased re-opening of the economy but in general, they have followed global trends over the past couple of years.  Increases in global energy prices have been a major driver of inflation in recent months with inflation reaching 5.1% in Ireland in October and 4.1% in the euro area on a year-on-year basis.  Energy prices have both a direct and indirect effect on prices people have to pay for goods and services.  The direct effects on home heating or electricity and personal transport fuels - driven in particular by changes in energy prices in international energy markets - tend to pass through quickly to consumers.  Indirect effects occur via the impact on business costs and tend to be passed on more slowly and only partly to consumers.  <\/p> <p>  The rise in energy price inflation during the first half of 2021 follows on from the fall in prices in 2020 at the onset of the pandemic, that is, the so-called \"base effects\".  Given that the prices of some goods and services fell during 2020 as governments imposed lockdowns, comparing prices from now - when economies have reopened - to last year can produce a sharp increase in measured inflation even if prices are recovering to pre-pandemic levels.  These base effects were larger for Ireland compared with some other euro area countries simply because prices fell by more in 2020 in Ireland.  However, these base effects are playing a smaller role more recently with energy price levels now exceeding those before the pandemic.  While highly volatile and often influenced by geopolitical factors, market expectations are for wholesale energy prices to plateau in 2022 before declining gradually.  <\/p> <p>  As well as energy prices, there are three other components of the Irish inflation index that are important to consider, namely, food, non-energy industrial goods and services.  Increases in food and goods inflation reflect the global factors I have already mentioned, namely, global supply and transport bottlenecks.  Pass-through from higher energy and input costs is also a factor and will likely continue to be so for several months yet.  <\/p> <p>  However, the price of services in Ireland has been increasing through the second half of 2021.  Within the services category, price increases in rents, restaurants and hotels stand out.  This is not only for the scale of the increases but also because both categories together account for almost half of all services spending.  Base effects are also relevant in these categories.  Relative to pre-pandemic levels, rents and restaurant and hotel prices are both 4.2% higher according to the Central Statistics Office, CSO.<\/p> <p>  While measures of inflation are designed to represent an average consumption basket in an economy, people feel the impact of inflation differently and not everyone in the community will experience price increases in the same way.  Some people will be more or less impacted by the recent bout of inflation simply because they are more or less exposed to certain price changes.  Lower-income households, older people and rural households are more affected by energy-driven inflation.  This is because it represents a larger proportion of their spending compared to other groups.  Conversely, higher-income households, younger people and more urban households tend to spend more on services.  <\/p> <p>  In deciding how to respond to inflation developments, monetary policymakers such as me need to consider two things.  First, what is the source of the inflation and how long is it expected to last?  Second, what is the potential for more broad-based and persistent inflation above the 2% target in the medium term?  Forecasting future economic developments is always challenging but there is a remarkable level of additional uncertainty and complexity to consider right now.  We are not in an ordinary economic environment.  <\/p> <p>  Our judgment today is that we expect the global drivers of current inflation to recede gradually during 2022.  On the potential for relative price changes to lead to more broad-based inflation, monetary policymakers across the world have spoken about so-called \"second-round effects\" from inflation into wage setting.  Recent data for the euro area does not suggest, at least thus far, that higher inflation in 2021 is feeding into broad-based higher wage demands, although the upheaval in the labour market makes it more challenging than ever to extract timely and accurate insights from the data.  <\/p> <p>  Monetary policy's primary effect is through the demand side of the economy.  We, therefore, need to be conscious of the effects of tightening policy when the recovery from the pandemic in the euro area remains highly uncertain and incomplete.  The wrong monetary policy action today could prove more costly than the risks stemming from the current spike in inflation.  Over the medium term, it could slow economic growth unnecessarily, which could prevent inflation reaching our target in a sustainable manner.<\/p><p>While lower-income households suffer more from energy-driven inflation, they are also more vulnerable to a contraction in demand that would reduce employment.  Constraining demand now to bring it back into line with what might be a transitory supply interruption would then depress incentives for supply to return.  Having said that, we cannot afford to be complacent.  We need to recognise that there are risks to the inflation outlook.  If current trends in inflation persist, the case for monetary policy action will become stronger.<\/p><p> Turning to other policy levers, Government decisions on expenditure and tax revenue can have an important impact on economic growth, inflation and the broader economy and labour market.  While action is needed to address infrastructure deficits in housing and to meet the challenges of climate change, any investment, given the current economic backdrop, needs to be managed carefully and accompanied, where necessary, by structural reforms to ensure that the demand it generates does not lead to excessive inflationary pressures.  Put simply, the economy as a whole does not need, nor would it benefit from, expansionary fiscal policy in the coming years.  This does not mean that targeted measures which do not add to overall demand in the economy and which offset the negative impact of current inflation on the most vulnerable are misplaced.  More generally, since Ireland is a small, open economy in the euro area, fiscal policy has an enhanced role here as the main instrument of macroeconomic stabilisation.

If inflation were zero or even negative, people's incentives to spend would be distorted.  They would tend not to spend, meaning that businesses would tend not to invest.  That would then result in a deflationary spiral, which, ultimately, would result in lower growth and job losses in the economy.

I absolutely recognise, in particular, that current high energy inflation has a negative and concerning impact on some households.<\/p> <p>  Let me put this in economist language.  The energy shock that we face right now is an international and a global one.  How it is going to affect particular types of energy consumption in particular parts of the country?

We are seeing price inflation in the housing market in both rental and residential properties, which is due partly to the pandemic savings being unleashed into the sector that was closed during that period.  Such inflation is also due to the undersupply of housing that spans the best part of the past decade.  There are also demand-side measures from the Government into the housing market.  For example, last year just over 12,000 homes were purchased and over 6,000 of them were through the help-to-buy scheme.  Does the Government expect this level of intervention on the demand side comprising the proportion, as it does, of new homes purchased to impact on prices?  Does he expect the same effect through the proposed share equity loan scheme that is being considered by the Central Bank?

I have said in the past that the supply of housing is a challenge that we need to address in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I want to make one clarification point and it is important that everybody bears this in mind.  When we talk about inflation and quote numbers about inflation, we do not include the cost of purchasing a house but we do include the impact of rents.  That is partly historical.  The ECB decided at the end of our strategy review back in July that the cost of owner-occupied housing should be included in the calculation of housing.  That is going to require the European statistical authorities to develop a process which can separate out the proportion of a house purchase that is investing in an asset and which should not be included in the measure of inflation from the consumption cost.  I mean it is a technical issue but I think it is important that everybody understands the measure of inflation at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Sorry, the Deputy's time is up.

Oil prices, natural gas prices and costs of shipping transportation have increased very significantly.<\/p> <p>  In terms of future developments, what we can say is that futures markets indicate that there is an expectation that prices of gas and oil will begin to decline somewhere around the first quarter of next year and gradually reducing back towards pre-pandemic levels but there is enormous uncertainty.

They are all having the same conversations as we are.  The inflationary pressures are global because the world was essentially impacted by the pandemic.  The world responded to the pandemic in similar ways.  The world is now coming out of the pandemic and is seeing the same sorts of issues around supply bottlenecks, base effects and energy prices.  On the other hand, there are important differences that we do need to bear in mind because sometimes it is too easy to say this central bank is doing this and to ask why are others not doing the same.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the United States.  One of the, in my view, important differences between the euro area and the United States is the US's fiscal response to the pandemic.  There has been a very significant fiscal impulse that is playing a role in their current inflation numbers.  Although it is fair to say that in Europe there has also been a very significant fiscal policy response, it has not on the same scale as we have seen in the United States.<\/p> <p>  Another important difference, which is perhaps a bit more technical but is worth bearing in mind, is that the Federal Reserve has got a slightly different mandate to that of the ECB.  So the ECB's primary objective is price stability and it has the secondary objective to support the policies of the EU without prejudice to price stability.<\/p><p>The Federal Reserve's mandate is both price stability and maximum sustainable employment.  The Federal Reserve has adopted a policy of average inflation targeting, which is different from the ECB's.  It means that they are more tolerant of overshooting their 2% target in order to help them achieve their maximum sustainable employment objective.  I mention that simply to just bring out the way the Federal Reserve responds, or will respond, to the current inflation pressures may be slightly different from the way the ECB would respond.  This reflects the differences in the mandate and also the more substantive differences in the underlying dynamics. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#C01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I read previously that the mandate from the ECB is connected with the foundation economic environment of the ECB at the time, when there was a great amount of growth going on and possibly nobody ever envisaged jobs being an issue.

We are part of a single currency union.  Our preferred tool is interest rates.  We can raise our interest rates if inflation is persisting, and we can lower our interest rates if the opposite is happening.  As Deputy Doherty said earlier, inflation in the euro area has been below target since the financial crisis, and unusually for a central bank we have been trying to increase inflation for the past decade.  Somewhat paradoxically, the current state of inflation is moving things in the direction we want to go, even though the rates are actually higher than we would like them to be.  Using interest rates has been a problem for us over the past decade because, for a variety of reasons, inflation was so low that interest rates have been operating at what we would call the effective lower bound.  At the ECB they are in negative territory.  When interest rates are at those low levels they are not very powerful so we had to develop a different set of tools to use.  <\/p> <p>  I will outline some of the tools we use.  We purchase assets such as bonds, which is known in some parts of the world as quantitative easing, QE.  We have asset purchase programmes, and we also have interest rates as part of our toolkit.  At the start of the pandemic we increased our asset purchase programme by putting in place an emergency programme, PEP, to cope with the crisis.  They are our first two tools.  The third tool is forward guidance.  We guide the market and help to manage inflation expectations through giving forward guidance to markets, which then feeds through to the economy.  Finally, we have dedicated loan arrangements where we make available to banks, at preferential rates, money that they can then lend on in the economy to promote growth.  That suite of tools is available to us.  Our preferred tool is interest rates, but currently and in recent years it has been more difficult to use.  If inflation persists and is no longer temporary, we would be looking at the whole of that toolkit.  The likelihood is that we would probably reduce our asset purchases before we increase interest rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I thank the Governor for that.

The reality is that the institutional framework we have in place today, at central banks and in the way wages are set, is quite different from what it was 40 years ago when central banks had less independence and where wages were set in different ways.  I am aware that increasingly a lot of people cannot remember the 1970s, but some of us can.  In the 1970s there was a much quicker response between inflation being seen and wages being increased to compensate for them.  As a result, we had that sort of close connection, such as I described earlier with a price-wage spiral.  Central banks did not respond fast enough, or I should say that monetary policy did not respond fast enough, to deal with that.  With the world we are now in, however, central banks have independence to deal with that.  Partly because we have had such low inflation for such a long time there is less of that sort of connection between inflation appearing and wages responding immediately to it.<\/p> <p>  Monetary policy itself, the raising and lowering of interest rates, has quite a lag before it has an effect.

This means that firms are increasingly getting into a loss-making position.  We are not seeing that at the moment.

It is important to have this type of engagement and I appreciate their time, as do all the other members.  As a small businessperson, as well as a politician, I like to think that I and my other colleagues are acutely attuned to the world of finance and the different pressures and complexities that it brings.  As a person who has been borrowing money since I was 18 or 19 years of age, I am becoming acutely aware of how difficult it is, even for an established person, to borrow money and have access to funds.<\/p> <p>  I judge everything by how I see it and what I see going on close to me.  If a person such as me and my close friends locally are having difficulty in accessing borrowed funds, not massive but ordinary amounts of money, where does that leave the young couple of today?  That is the young boy or girl who is making friends or starting out on his or her own or as part of a couple and looking to borrow to try to get on the property ladder or to get a loan for a small or medium sized business to get a bit of a leg up.  If what I would call established people find it difficult, how in the name of God will young people find it?  How are they supposed to manage?  How are they supposed to get on in life?<\/p> <p>  As a politician, I feel so bad every day that young people are being held back and not being given the opportunity.  Everybody talks about how bad the 1980s and 1990s were, but at that time people could walk into a bank, look at a bank manager and sell themselves the bank manager, if the witnesses know what I mean.  Bank managers had autonomy to lend if they liked the look of someone and thought that person was a worker who would knuckle down in life and do what needed to be done to get on.  When I say \"get on\", I do not mean anything big or fancy but getting on in paying a mortgage.  Is that not a great achievement for a young couple?  That is getting on.<\/p> <p>  However, so many obstacles are being put in the way of young people today.  When I meet people in banking circles and in that way of life, the first thing I always ask is what in the name of God they are doing with all the money.  Why are bankers not being more understanding?  Why are Governments not doing more?  It could be said that that is our job, but I like to think people from all parties, be it Sinn F&eacute;in, or all the other people doing a lot of work in housing and the banking sector - I heard Deputy Doherty speaking earlier on and asking questions - are really putting their shoulder to the wheel.  Many politicians are pulling their weight, but I would love to think the banks are pulling their weight and I would like to think the banks' hearts are in the right place in supporting our young people.<\/p> <p>  If we give young people a chance and give them a loan or mortgage when they are looking for one, of course things might not work out for some people and they will fail, but businesses fail.  Individuals do not have the luxury of not failing either.  Things can go wrong in anybody's life, but I would like to think of people being given the chance.  All I want for the young boys and girls of today is for them to be given an opportunity and that we have a banking sector that is kind and understanding.  I also want a Government that would be kind and understanding to young people.  We only get one chance at life.  We only get to live once and I want people to have the same opportunities.<\/p> <p>  I do not want it to be the case that people have to be awful lucky to get on.  It should not be that way.  If people are determined and knuckle down to the job of living, they should be given the same opportunities as everybody else.  It is up to them then to make their way.  Banks play a significant role in people's lives.  Can we imagine the young 18 or 19-year old of today getting scrubbed up and walking into the bank, asking for the manager and saying he or she wanted a loan?  For God's sake, the manager would not talk to him or her.  The manager will hardly talk to us, never mind a young person starting out.<\/p> <p>  The Chairperson knows I do not ever want to rabbit on.  I just want to make my little point.  That is all.  I hope I am making it as clear as I can.  I ask that young people be given a chance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#E00300","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I am not sure there is a precise question.  I completely sympathise with the Deputy's sentiments.  Certainly, the banking system in Ireland is in a much better plan than where it was a decade ago, although, to a certain extent, it is still repairing itself.  We still have, for example, long-term mortgage arrears that are a problem for the system.<\/p> <p>  If the Deputy is talking about housing and the mortgage measures in particular, it is very familiar territory.  Tomorrow, I will be announcing the conclusions of our latest annual review of the mortgage measures.  We are in the middle of a pretty significant review of the entire framework, which will conclude next year, on the mortgage measures.  As I have said in the past, as far as housing is concerned, the fundamental issue there is the supply of housing, as opposed to the availability of finance.<\/p> <p>  In terms of lending to small businesses, we have not seen any evidence to say that banks are short of money to lend.  I would expect that if someone has a good business proposition, and I have no doubt the Deputy has lots of them, he or she will get a positive reaction from his or her bank manager.  However, I completely understand the housing challenge, if that was the Deputy's particular focus.  That is a significant issue, but its solution is not in the availability of credit but the supply of housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Both witnesses are very welcome to the committee.  It is interesting to listen to the way the conversations have been going.  The first area I want to touch on is inflation and inflationary effects.  We have an unprecedented set of circumstances, worldwide, as well as an unprecedented domestic situation.  We have been saying that the common view on this is that it is a blip in that the current inflation is abnormal and will settle down again, it is hoped, in time.<\/p><p>After what amount of time would Mr. Makhlouf get worried that this is more of a sustained increase in the inflation rate?  Would it be six months or a year?  I refer in particular to the cost of living and how people's spending power is being eroded by inflation. <\/p><p> I am also concerned that inflation is eroding the results we will get from the capital projects we hope to deliver over the next ten years under the national development plan.  Shorter lengths of road or rail line will be built for the amount of money we will have.  If things keep going the way they are going for another six months, a year or two years, at what point would the Central Bank decide it needed to have another look at the matter?  At the moment, the Central Bank is observing.  Patience is one thing but this will have to be reviewed.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael Healy-Rae was talking about mortgages and young people.  As a result of inflation and the cost of building homes, they are out of the reach of most people.  I refer to young people and first-time buyers.  Homes are partly out of their reach because of the limit on what they can borrow, which is based on their salaries or wages.  I believe the limit is three and a half times their salary.  In many cases, they will fall short of being able to buy a normal house.  I will ask for the witness's opinion on a matter.  The credit union movement holds a massive amount of people's savings but cannot spend it.  The banks are charging credit unions because they need to keep a certain amount in reserve in the banks.  The banks are holding their money and charging them for that.  Would we be better off trying to make the credit union movement a third force in banking for mortgages for first-time buyers?  Should we try to get something going there?  I know the overall principle is that you can borrow as much as you can afford to pay back but we have created some anomalies and some people are trapped.  They are saving money and doing everything right but when they think they have a mortgage sorted out, the price jumps again because of the lack of supply and moves out of reach again.<\/p><p> I would like the Central Bank's comments on all of that.  I hope I have been coherent.  This is all in my head and I am trying to get it out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#E00500","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will take his questions in turn.  To put it in my own terms, the first question was about how long it would be before I would get worried and feel that we needed to act, that is, how long would inflation have to continue at these levels for me to get worried?  I am worried today.  I am not complacent about this.  I am very conscious that inflation is impacting on households across the country today.  On the other hand, it is not so much a question of a certain amount of time before we feel we need to take action.  However, it is fair to say that the longer inflation persists at these levels, the more likely it is that this will start feeding into wages and having other second-round effects.  For me, it would matter more to see evidence that supply blockages were being repaired and falls in energy prices.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the supply blockages, there is a sort of consensus that these are blockages as opposed to structural changes.  If I may expand a little bit on the supply blockage issue, they are essentially a reflection of a very big increase in demand around the world as a result of restrictions being lifted.  Growth in Ireland, in the euro area and around the world has increased significantly over recent months because restrictions were lifted.  That has led to a big demand.  People had been saving during the pandemic and have now decided to spend their savings.  They have started to spend them either on consumer goods or on services, that is, going out to restaurants and the like.  That very significant increase in demand has put pressure on supply.  This would have happened in an ordinary situation if demand had increased by as much as it has but, in the meantime, a lot of the supply chains closed down because of the pandemic.  They have had to reopen, which has taken time.  Famously, many of the ships that transport goods from Asia to the United States or Europe are in the wrong place.  It takes time for them to get rearranged and ready to transport goods.  <\/p> <p>  If, as we hope, we begin to see evidence that those sorts of supply blockages are being repaired, in some respects, it will not matter whether it takes four months or a year.  If they are being repaired, we know that they will subside.  For example, we know that there is a big shortage of semiconductors.  This is affecting car manufacture but also the production of white goods like fridges and so on.  This shortage is likely to persist for much of 2022.  However, we also know that the supply of semiconductors will come on stream.  That is a question of timing.  It is not simple to say how long this would have to go on for before I would start to worry.  It is more the case that, if I see evidence that these blockages are not being fixed or that different things are happening, I would start to worry.  However, I am worried today.  I hope that I will be a lot better informed in a few months' time because we will have seen more evidence.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's point on housing, I hope he will forgive me because I have forgotten the overall question.  I recall him asking whether credit unions could be a third force.  There is no reason why credit unions could not play a role in the system.  On the other hand, the biggest players in terms of lending money and providing mortgages are the big banks because they have the asset base to do that.  The focus of the Central Bank is always going to be on making sure that the system works in a stable way and that reckless lending and reckless borrowing are avoided, as I have said in the past.  That is a particular focus of ours.  We do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past.  I do not know if there is anything Dr. Cassidy wants to add on that particular point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I might address one point.  The Deputy made a very important point about the effect of inflationary pressures on the delivery of the national development plan and ensuring that we get our money's worth in that regard.  As the Deputy knows, what is planned in terms of capital investment in the coming decade is extremely significant.<\/p><p>Capital spending will be increased to very high levels, which we think is very welcome, in order to address the infrastructure and housing deficits that currently exist, to meet our climate change targets and to enhance productivity.  The challenge that Deputy Canney is alluding to is that we are already seeing inflationary pressures in this sector and rising construction costs, tender prices, labour shortages and levels of demand.  The challenge over the next decade will be to get the most out of the money that we are spending in this area.  That is something we also need to monitor.<\/p><p> I will mention a number of things in this regard.  First, the construction sector and the housing sector in particular will undoubtedly need significant additional labour over the period.  An important element is how the economy can attract that labour.  Estimates are for perhaps an additional 30,000 to 40,000 workers.  It will not be as easy to attract labour from abroad, for example, in construction as it was in the 2000s when wages here were much higher than in some other countries.  Second, the level of productivity in the sector is particularly low and lags behind that some other countries.  In order to deliver successfully on those plans, that productivity deficit will need to be addressed.  Third, we will need to manage delivery and ensure that cost overruns are limited.  If we are to get the most bang for our buck in capital delivery, those are the three things I would point to.  If they can be achieved, then what has been proposed is very welcome and necessary for this economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Can I ask for one clarification there?

They struck a somewhat different note from what we have heard from Philip Lane when it comes to the need for interest rate increases.  I would like to tease that out with our witnesses if I may.  It is something more of a hawkish position whereby Mr. Makhlouf said today that we should not hesitate to increase interest rates if inflation persists.  I am interested because, from my understanding of this, we can see that current inflation is arising as a result of two main factors, one of which is energy prices.  Much of that is due to the geopolitical factors in respect of Saudi Arabia and Russia reducing oil and gas supplies in their own interests.  There is also the reopening of the supply chains that is currently under way.  It will take time but it is happening nonetheless.<\/p><p>I am very interested in hearing the bank&rsquo;s views as to how it feels that an interest rate rise could have an effect on those things.  Would it not be worried in any sense that it could create risks and could stymie the recovery and potentially even create stagflation?  I thank the Chair.

I do not think that there are any differences between Mr. Philip Lane and me on the question of raising interest rates now.  I spoke to him, I believe, last week.  I still think that that is the right position.  If the Deputy reads the remarks I made yesterday, I hope that they are a little bit clearer than the headline in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>perhaps was.<br\/><br\/>Fundamentally, increasing interest rates today would be a mistake.  On the evidence that we have today, and I emphasise and underline the word &ldquo;today&rdquo;, the factors that are driving inflation and the answer to them is not to raise interest rates because that would impact the recovery, slow down economic growth, have consequences for employment and, ultimately, have the completely opposite effect to the one that we would want.  Mr. Lane and I would completely agree on that.<br\/><br\/>What I have been saying is that we need to be vigilant.  If we take a step back, we are in a pretty unique situation today, not just in Ireland or the euro area but in much of the developed world.  We went into an exceptional economic shock in March 2020 when governments decided to close down both demand and supply across the world, and did so voluntarily.  I remember saying at the time that I could not find an example in history of that having happened before.  I do not believe that that particular situation has happened before.  That unique situation is reflected in the world that we are in today, which is that we are coming out of this pandemic, which was a unique experience, and the way we are doing that is putting unusual pressures around economic activity, whether it is the supply bottlenecks that we have discussed or the sudden increase in demand that is being experienced.  As I said earlier, we see those factors as temporary.  The right response, therefore, is patience.  If we are right, we will see those pressures recede.  The wrong response today would be to increase rates.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, if the evidence we see starts to suggest that there are structural changes happening to economies that are going to see inflation persisting, or if we see the current temporary inflation start feeding into wage pressures which are not supported by productivity increases, we will then be exposed to a wage price spiral and to inflation persisting and becoming more permanent.<\/p><p>What I have been saying, and what I said yesterday, which <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported today, is that we need to be vigilant about the circumstances we are in, pay very close attention to the evidence and respond without delay if we see that evidence changing.  That is the sort of point I have been making.  People will make similar arguments in different ways and there will be different points of emphasis.  Reference was made to Mr. Philip Lane.  He and I may have different points of emphasis but we are pretty aligned on the fundamentals, as is the governing council of the European Central Bank, ultimately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#G01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I will consider those comments.

I will have a good read of the article.<\/p><p>My next question is on the high prevalence of so-called zombie companies across the EU and on how a significant interest rate increase could impact them and, by extension, the wider EU economy.  Obviously, increasing interest rates makes it increasingly difficult for them and jeopardises their solvency.  I am aware that the French bank Natixis estimates that the proportion of zombie companies has risen from 3.5% at the beginning of the 1990s to close to 21% in 2019.  The research carried out, including research by the <i>Financial Times,<\/i>indicates one fifth of Europe's corporate landscape may now be zombified, but that research was all carried out before the pandemic.  If more than one fifth of those in Europe's corporate sector were zombified before the pandemic, it seems likely, and it would not be a massive leap of faith to believe, that this proportion has increased.  In this regard, I am wondering about two points.  How many of the so-called zombie companies do the witnesses believe are in Ireland's corporate sector?  From the point of view of financial stability and employment, what would be the implications of a sharp interest rate increase for those companies and the wider economy?  My questions are slightly hypothetical, but it would be quite interesting to hear the delegates' views on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#H00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will ask Dr. Cassidy to respond in case he knows some of the specific answers.  I am not on top of the number of so-called zombie firms in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  There is a related, but slightly separate, relevant point that is worth making.  Many firms and households have benefited from Government supports over the past 20 months or so.  We have been asking what the impact would be if those supports were withdrawn because, in theory, a withdrawal would give the first sign as to whether so-called zombie firms have been surviving only on Government supports.  Their failure will be the first indication we will have.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that if we increased interest rates, it would have a direct effect on the cost of funding businesses.  Those that are not profitable would be impacted.  To repeat what I said earlier, we are not in the business of raising interest rates right now.  The need to withdraw Government supports is a more realistic proposition.  I can comment on the financial stability implications.  We will be talking about this more tomorrow when we publish our latest financial stability review.  Essentially, the Irish financial system went into one of the biggest economic shocks that it has had for a very long time when it was in a fairly robust position and fairly robust health.  The evidence over the past 20 months has been that the Irish financial system has benefited from the repair work it has had to undergo over the past decade and survived the most extreme effects of the shock.  The economy is now coming out of the depths it was in.  The big financial institutions are in a robust enough position to manage the withdrawal of supports that is ahead.  The position on interest rates is a bit more complicated because we are speculating as to what may happen a bit further down the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>This is a very important issue.  The Governor makes an important distinction between firms that are non-viable but kept alive because of the low interest rate environment prior to the pandemic, which the Deputy described as &ldquo;zombies&rdquo;, and firms that became reliant on Government supports during the pandemic.  With regard to the former, there are other countries in Europe that are more exposed.  I do not have a number to give the Deputy but our analysis shows there would not be many non-viable firms coming into this crisis.  The Deputy referred to a sharp increase in interest rates.  Even when interest rates begin to normalise, nobody will be expecting a sharp, significant effect so much as a gradual return to normal.  Therefore, I do not think the effect would be too significant.  It can be economically damaging.  In Japan we saw the concept of evergreening.  Interest rates have been so low for so long that many non-viable firms have been kept alive when they would not otherwise have been able to do so.  That prevents new firms from developing.  It is quite a negative economic development.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the pandemic, the view right across Europe is that when government supports are reduced, some firms may not survive.  The numbers are expected to be much lower than we might have expected a year ago.  The evidence right across Europe, including in affected countries such as Italy and France, shows that while some may be affected, the number will be much lower than expected.  The economies are coming out of this in a stronger position than was previously expected.

I thank them for their briefing and the overview.  Many of the points I was hoping to make have come up already in various shapes.  If the witnesses bear with me, however, I might refer to a couple of different angles.  They are saying they feel that there will not be longer-term inflation so much as more short-term inflation, that patience will be the big ingredient and that if the data change and inflation looks like it will be more long term, we should be able to move on it at that stage.  What tools do they envisage being used?  What kinds of triggers do they foresee and what data do they expect to see changing?  I realise the witnesses have mentioned wages, but we have already seen wage increases in the tech sector as a direct result of being able to work from home.  In construction, there have already been wage increases.<\/p><p>I am trying to figure what the Governor sees as the triggers, if any, down the road and what kind of tools he would act with at that stage.<\/p><p> I have three or four questions.  The capital plan will be a big driver of spending in housing, transport and various different infrastructure.  The Governor is concerned about the size of the spend and how it might impact on inflation.  How would the Governor handle it and at the same time ensure that there is an adequate spend on housing, transport and all those different key projects?<\/p><p> The Governor is talking about the wrong measures having a significant impact now.  What would the Governor consider to be the wrong measures?<\/p><p> Finally, the cost of housing has considerably increased, whether you are buying or renting, and it is a sizeable component of inflation.  It is a reasonable aspiration of people to be able to buy their own home.  Raising the deposit and at the same time paying rent is a significant blockage for people - a real struggle.  Would the Governor see a situation where the ability to pay rent would be seen as proof of ability to repay a mortgage and be considered as part of the assessment?  The Governor has referred to the supply as playing a big part in addressing housing but irrespective of how much supply is there, that issue will be there for younger couples, single people or whoever wants to borrow money.  I would be interested to hear the Governor's views on seeing if there is a way to consider the ability to save while they are paying rent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#H00500","speaker":"1455","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will ask Dr. Cassidy to pick up the capital plan questions.  All I will say on that is I am not only worried about the size of spend.  I am also worried about how it is spent.  However, I will leave that to Dr. Cassidy to talk about.<\/p> <p>  On the wrong measures, to answer that question first, the wrong measure to tackle inflation today would be to raise interest rates today.  That would be top of the list of wrong measures.  Raising interest rates today would have a negative effect on the recovery and it would lead to job losses and business failures.  It would put the whole of the recovery at risk.  That would be the wrong thing to do today in response to what we are seeing.<\/p> <p>  On raising interest rates, to turn to the Deputy's question about the tools if we saw inflation persisting, raising interest rates is the biggest part of our toolkit.  However, if we were faced with that sort of decision what we would probably do - certainly, what I would want us to do, and this is for discussion with all my colleagues at the ECB - is reduce our asset purchase programme first before we raised interest rates.  Fundamentally, it would have a similar effect of tightening policy and having a direct impact on demand.  <\/p> <p>  Someone used the word \"stagflation\" earlier in one of the questions and I did not respond to that directly.  We are not in the stagflation situation that we were in the 1970s.  There is genuine growth happening, both in Ireland and in Europe and around the world.  It may be slightly dampened in the near term because of the re-emergence of restrictions, etc., but there is real growth.  In the 1970s, the \"stag\" bit reflected stagnation and we are not in a stagnation sort of world right now.  We have the tools to deal with inflation.<\/p> <p>  I completely understand Deputy Aindrias Moynihan's point on housing and rents and deposits.  It is one of the questions we are considering in our review of the mortgage measures framework which will not be concluded until next year but I am aware of it.  Fundamentally, we are not trying to stop people from being in a position to put a deposit down.  What we are trying to prevent, as I stated earlier, is reckless lending and borrowing, but how the rules interact with supply being constrained and rental prices as they are is something I absolutely recognise.  It is an issue.  One of the answers I can give to the Deputy's direct question is that banks or lenders have the flexibility today to consider the reliability of the borrower.  If they have a track record that they have been paying X amount in rent, banks have the flexibility to take that into account in their decision-making and to use the flexibility they have to lend above the restrictions as part of that.  Leaving that aside, I completely understand the Deputy's point.  That is an issue that we are thinking about very carefully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>In relation to capital spending, as Deputy Aindrias Moynihan will be aware, the recently announced national development plan, which is extremely ambitious, commits to investment of &euro;160 billion in the period between now and 2030.  It is a welcome opportunity to address the infrastructure deficit in this country to increase housing supply and to meet our climate change targets.<\/p> <p>  The concern the Deputy is alluding to is a very real one and involves a significant sharp increase in the rate of capital spending.  The concern there is that the additional demand feeds through to higher prices as opposed to what you are trying to achieve.  That is something that needs to be monitored.  The timing or phasing in of the plan currently seems appropriate.  If you were to see excess inflationary pressures, if you were to see private sector construction, for example, being squeezed out by the extension of public sector, then you may need to look at the phasing or timing of some of that delivery but that is not something that we are projecting or forecasting at present.  However, it will be necessary to attract more labour into the sector.  It is necessary to look at the productivity of the construction sector, particularly to ensure that we are getting value for money and the economy can control the costs of these massive infrastructure projects.  If that can be achieved, this will have a very welcome effect on the productive capacity of the economy and some of the societal needs in terms of housing and infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Aindrias Moynihan also mentioned wages and referred to some sectors.  I would say the Deputy is absolutely right.  The Deputy identified some of the sectors where wages are increasing quite rapidly at present.  We can identify those sectors as the ones which are experiencing the tightest labour market conditions and finding it most difficult to attract workers.  What we are not seeing yet is that becoming generalised across the economy.  At present, high wage increases are in a few fast-growing sectors - the Deputy mentioned information technology, IT, and construction, and there is also financial business services - rather than across all parts of the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Is the Central Bank looking for it across the board more than in any particular sectors?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#J00400","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>If you get excessive wage increases right across the economy, that is where you get a little concerned that the higher prices are becoming embedded and you get this dangerous phenomenon of a wage-price spiral.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cassidy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#J00600","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>If any of the Deputies present would like to come back in for a second round, please raise your hand.<\/p><p>I have some questions of my own.  During the previous two sessions on inflation, we heard that the expectation that this inflation will last for a short period.  Hopefully, it will ease over the next year.  However, we are all mindful that the pandemic is unprecedented and we are really not sure how it will play out.  I am interested in the Central Bank's longer paper on the aspects that could impact inflation in the longer term.  I particularly wanted to ask about reshoring or the shortening of the length of supply chain, partly because often in my area of politics, we talk about local supply chains and community wealth.  Could the witnesses expand on the downsides, possible threats to reshoring or disruption and changes to supply chains and the impact of this in the longer term?  Is it a consideration or worry that is being raised regularly in the Central Bank's conversations with the ECB?  I know there have been a number of policy papers or research on whether there should be a move towards reshoring that have covered particular sectors such as medical products.  Could the witnesses unpack that for me?  Do they see reshoring and that longer supply chain issue as major concerns?  Do they believe the EU will move towards any particular policy position on that?  I know we have talked about the US and economic protectionism but my question relates more to security of supply chains.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#J00700","speaker":"1559","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>It is a fascinating issue and a very big question.  The Chairman asked me if I was worried.  I am not worried about changes in supply chains as a concept.  I would be interested in understanding what those changes were before I could comment on whether they are positive.  What I put in my paper yesterday is that there is a change in sentiment, certainly in recent years, compared to the previous 20 years, when the question of where manufacturing or production took place was driven quite a bit by cost considerations.  In recent years, partly because of economic nationalism, as the Chairman described, but also because some countries have started to think through their security needs, countries have started to reconsider their supply chains.  The pandemic has changed that dynamic in another way.  The Chairman mentioned medical supplies.  The world is probably in a bit of a state of flux, which complicates the work of a monetary policymaker as we try to understand how our economy is adjusting not just to these questions of strategy, and within the EU, we talk about open strategic autonomy, but also about the developments in technology, digitalisation, 3-D printing and changes in consumer preferences and wants.  All these things will play out over the coming years and will have an effect on economies and the way they work and interact.  What the Central Bank and the ECB need to do is make sure we keep up to speed with those sorts of developments so that we are ready to respond to what are fundamental changes but I would not say today that we are concerned about reshoring.  It is more a reflection that if that sort of structural change starts to happen, it will have effects on the way economies work and we want to make sure we understand that in case it has particular effects we need to take account of in our monetary policymaking.<\/p> <p> The Chairman did not mention the question of climate change.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>In my defence, I was just about to bring that up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#K00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Does the Chairman wish to ask a specific question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Well the pandemic has been a pre-play of what we expect to see from climate change.

Are those two issues linked?  Considering we look at medium- to long-term budgetary issues in this committee, what does the ECB consider to be the timeline for those issues to have a significant impact?  Is it five or ten years?

I suspect that we will never be able to do sufficient economic modelling but I am pretty sure we can do a lot more and better economic modelling as we gather more and better evidence and develop better understanding.  The ECB's position on climate change, which I endorse 100%, is that it is probably the single most significant change to the way economies work in the future.  We reviewed our entire strategy and concluded the review last July.  We decided as part of that review to have a specific climate change action plan, which is pretty comprehensive.  Fundamentally, it is about understanding what changes will happen to economies and the implications of those changes for the way economies work and, therefore, the job we have at the ECB, which is to maintain price stability.  It obviously has implications for financial stability among other things.  I told colleagues at the Central Bank yesterday that if we are going to achieve zero emissions by 2050, and 2050 is less time away than when Jack Charlton took the team to Italia 90, and fundamentally change our economy to achieve net zero, it will involve significant change.  I do not know what that change will be.  I can see it happening around me.  It is not that long ago that the notion of buying an electric car was slightly ridiculous because it could only travel 100 metres.  This is changing and changing very fast.<\/p><p>However, that sort of change will have to be comprehensive across economies if the net-zero emissions target is to be met.  It will have implications for the way the ECB works, understands the economy and sets interest rates and monetary policy.<\/p><p> It is a significant area of work for us.  Just a couple of weeks ago, I wrote to the chairman and chief executive of every regulated financial service provider saying that the Central Bank had certain expectations of how they would manage climate change risk and that it was something on which we would focus.  I also told them that we were going to set up a climate change forum because many of these challenges are new and we need to work on them together with as many players in the economy as possible.

Inflation right now, today, is being driven by three things.  It is being driven by what we call base effect, which is just the statistical phenomenon of the way inflation is measured looking back 12 months.  The reality is that 12 months ago prices fell everywhere as we were in the middle of the pandemic.  We are now coming out of the pandemic and out of restrictions.  That measurement process is feeding into the calculation of a number that we are seeing.<\/p> <p>  Second, inflation right now is the result of supply chain blockages.  With the restrictions having been lifted, we have had a significant increase in demand and supply has struggled to meet that increased demand.  This is partly because of very practical things as I mentioned earlier.  Container ships are in the wrong places to transport goods from Asia here, for example.  This is also partly because of the sheer scale of demand on the part of consumers.<\/p> <p>  Finally, inflation right now is being driven by an increase in energy prices.  All of these are affecting the whole world to some extent or another.  Over the next 12 months we see those pressures dissipating.  So the base effects or measurement point will probably be the first to start to be seen because it will fall out of the calculation.  Hopefully, we expect supply chains to get back to some sort of normality and to certainly work in a way that meets demand.  We see a consequent impact as well on energy prices.<\/p> <p>  Essentially, we see current inflation beginning to dissipate from the start of next year and slowly be seen throughout 2022.  If supply chains do not get repaired, for example, then obviously that prevents normality and that may have an impact on how long inflation persists.  Certainly, it is not going to disappear overnight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021112400002#M01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Is there evidence of hoarding, particularly of fuel?

The Supplementary Estimate arises mainly due to higher costs than forecast for the year under the pension scheme for established civil servants as a result of a higher than expected number of retirements for 2021.  The Supplementary Estimate in respect of the PAS Vote will bring the total gross allocation for the Vote to &euro;20.455 million in 2021.<\/p> <p>  The additional allocation of &euro;3.665 million sought for Vote 17 includes &euro;800,000 of additional current expenditure to enable PAS to provide additional recruitment services to the HSE; and an increased capital allocation of &euro;2.865 million in 2021 to allow for facilities upgrades, which have been carried out over a quicker timeframe than was originally envisaged.  This increased capital expenditure in 2021 will not increase the overall cost of the project, but it will enable works to be concluded over a shorter timeframe.  I understand that further detail on this request for Vote 17 has been provided to the committee.<\/p> <p>  On Vote 12, pensions and lump sums paid under the pension schemes for established civil servants make up 91% of total gross expenditure and, therefore, the main driver of the annual cost is the number of established civil servants who retire in the year.  However, it is particularly difficult to estimate the number of retirements from one year to the next for a number of reasons, including the following: the majority of established civil servants will have a compulsory retirement age of 70; a number of people under age 60 retire each year under cost neutral early retirement or on grounds of ill-health; each year a number of former employees become eligible to claim a preserved pension entitlement; and the average pension benefits of lump sum and pension that will fall to be payable to new retirees in any given year will vary depending on the grades and years of service of that specific cohort of retirees.<\/p> <p>  The 2021 gross Estimate for Vote 12 was &euro;666.3 million, which was based on a forecast of 1,650 retirements from the established scheme.  As a general rule, for each person who retires, the once-off lump sum paid out is three times the size of the annual pension.  Accordingly, increases in retirement levels have a particular effect on subhead A4, which provides for the lump sum payments to established civil servants.  Subhead A4 is, therefore, a key driver of expenditure variance on the Vote in any given year.<\/p> <p>  At end October 2021, &euro;118.6 million has been expended from subhead A4 compared to the original 2021 full-year estimate of &euro;109.8 million.  Further expenditure of up to &euro;23.2 million by the end of the year is expected, resulting in an overall projected excess of approximately &euro;32 million on the subhead.  It is now estimated that total gross expenditure on the Vote for 2021 may be in the region of &euro;700.3 million, some &euro;34 million in excess of the gross Estimate of &euro;666.3 million as voted previously by the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  The committee should also note that the level of the gross Supplementary Estimate being sought will be mitigated by anticipated increased levels of appropriations-in-aid.  Appropriations-in-aid for 2021 were estimated at &euro;326.4 million.  Receipts with respect to the single public service pension scheme are ahead of profile year to date.  Total appropriations-in-aid are now projected at &euro;360.4 million by year end, which is &euro;34 million more than originally expected.  This excess amount will act to reduce the net effect of the gross Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied that approval of the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1000 net will confer the necessary legal authority to meet the pension entitlements of civil servants expected to retire up to the end of 2021.  Approval for the Supplementary Estimate - Vote 17 will also enable the PAS to deliver additional demand-led recruitment services to the HSE and conclude an upgrade of their offices in a shorter timeframe than previously envisaged.  I commend the Supplementary Estimates to the committee and I look forward to our discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021112400002#A00500","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as teacht os comhair na coiste chun na c&uacute;rsa&iacute; seo a phl&eacute;.

I ask because of the remuneration of a particular Secretary General, as was recently reported in the media and debated at different committees.

The majority of the Supplementary Estimate relates to the ongoing works to upgrade and modernise the offices in Chapter House.  That includes, for example, the modernisation of interview suites to include increased options for digital services and to allow for social distancing in face-to-face interviews and so on.

As he knows, 14 recommendations were included in the report, including the establishment of a formal process of interim and permanent appointments to senior posts and for that process to be followed in all instances.  It also recommends the establishment of a body to review the remuneration of senior posts in the Civil Service and public service, and to develop a process for how those appointments are made.

I have looked at the 14 recommendations that were provided by the committee.  Those recommendations will be given serious consideration.  I have had an initial discussion about the recommendations with my officials.  There are some stand-out recommendations, in particular the recommendation to establish a body similar to the review body for positions with a higher remuneration in the public sector.  The report suggests that body is established immediately to review the remuneration of senior posts in the Civil Service and public service and develop processes and procedures governing appointments to senior posts on interim and permanent bases.  I will give consideration to that.<\/p> <p>  I will make the point that until July of next year, the pay level for senior posts will be generally governed by the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  The final unwinding of the long tail of FEMPI will occur on 1 July 2022, in accordance with the legislation.  Once we get beyond that point, the question arises as to what is the appropriate way in which pay issues can be examined at senior levels.  At the moment, as the Deputy knows, and in line with the legislation in place, it is a power that falls to the Minister.  We must consider that if we reconstitute a body similar to the one that was stood down in 2009, we may not always like its recommendations.  It may come forward with recommendations in respect of pay levels that far exceed what the committee or I, as Minister, might be willing to entertain.  We must consider that point.<\/p> <p>  As Minister, I am accountable.  I have attended before the committee in respect of the matter that was the subject of the report.  I am before the committee again today.  It is important that we have that level of accountability.

Would that role be to make recommendations and it would then fall to the Minister to make a decision on individual pay levels?  That requires careful consideration.

I have engaged with local hospital managers and senior management staff within the hospitals and my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, has visited most of the hospitals across the State in the past two weeks.  From my engagement and the information relayed to me by Deputy Cullinane, I have learned that the current recruitment process is not fit for purpose, particularly for regional and rural hospitals.  For example, when recruiting a consultant for a post in Letterkenny, the PAS could offer the position to a person who is located in Dublin and has no intention of relocating to Letterkenny.  The PAS has to go through the process of sending the offer, it being considered and rejected, then must look at the list of candidates again and offer the post to another candidate, and so on.  The PAS might get to the fourth candidate on the list, who is somebody from the region who has an interest in the region.  It is not just about that person moving to the region and taking up a position; it is also possibly about a partner, a husband or wife, who would need to relocate his or her job, and so on.<\/p> <p>  There are no regional panels here.  If there were regional panels in relation to the suitability for appointments, it could fast-track the process, instead of the PAS going through a process that is not fit for purpose and offering positions to professionals who have no intention of taking them up in the first place.  I ask the Minister to comment on that and on the need for a localised campaign.  The centralisation of recruitment in the health service is important in terms of costs and quality.  Indeed, in the review that has been done on the PAS, concerns have been raised and recommendations made in terms of ensuring that it recruits the proper staff.  However, we can see the benefits where hospitals have been able to engage in their own localised recruitment process.  I think we can all accept that there is an emergency in terms of staffing of our hospitals, not least now with Covid-19.  Surely, this needs to be looked at in a way that is about more than just giving resources to PAS, but actually looking at how we are recruiting, why there are no localised panels and allowing our hospitals, within certain parameters, to organise localised recruitment initiatives.  My understanding from the regions is that the ones that are bearing most fruits are those introduced to recruit nurses, in particular, as well as other professionals at higher levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021112400002#C00600","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Undoubtedly, it has been a challenge to recruit the number of staff that we have provided the budget for.  Having said that, a lot of progress has been made.  Last year, over 6,300 additional staff were recruited, which included over 1,700 nurses and midwives.  This year, so far, just under 4,500 additional staff have been recruited.  Therefore, between last year and this year, approximately 11,000 have been recruited.  In such a relatively short period of time, it is the most significant level of recruitment that the HSE has ever embarked upon.  The figures look challenging but from the information that the HSE is conveying to us, I understand that it expects that the figure of 4,500, which is quite possibly the position to the end of September, will rise to close to 7,400 by the end of the year.  There will be a budget to continue with that recruitment next year.  The key point the Deputy made is about the system and the pace at which recruitment is taking place.<\/p><p>All I can say to the Deputy is that this is an issue we have discussed at the Cabinet committee on health.  We have provided the funding and we want to see the staff recruited to improve the quality of the healthcare we are providing to our people.  It is a combination of the work of the PAS and the HSE&rsquo;s internal HR system and the operation of that.  We have asked that information would be brought back to the Cabinet committee on health and I would be happy to share whatever information I get once we receive it.  The Deputy has made a particular suggestion about localised panels to increase the prospect of somebody being offered a job actually taking it up, which is a fair point, and to allow as much discretion at the local hospital level as possible.  We will take those two points and convey them to the HSE.  I want to repeat the point that the HSE has recruited about 11,000 people between last year and this year so far, which is a significant increase in the overall staff resources it has.  It will be doing more before the end of the year and into next year but there is a need to see if we can make the system more efficient.  Localised panels and more local recruitment at hospital level offer some potential and we will take that on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021112400002#C00700","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>From memory the timeframe to recruit a consultant is in the region of two years.  We are recruiting people and that is great and we are competing internationally as others are also trying to recruit but the timeframe is all wrong.  The Minister needs to get under the bonnet of this, look at the steps that are being taken and strip away or shorten some of the time within this.  We have had scenarios where hospitals have told us they have applied for maternity cover for a particular speciality at an early stage, they have since been granted the cover and they are delighted about that but the baby is born and is one-year old and the person who gave birth is back in the position.  That is what is happening in our hospitals.  When we ask our hospital management and staff to indicate at an early and advanced stage that they may be taking maternity leave, which they have no obligation to do, we must streamline that process.  If it is taking that long then there is a serious problem.<\/p> <p>  We may be talking about the length of time it takes to recruit but if that is a speech and language therapist, that means there are dozens of children, whether they have autism or other speech impediments, who are not getting a service in cases.  It means that their educational ability and attainment are curtailed because they have dropped out of a service that they needed during that period or because there is a delay in the service.  It is life lasting and it has a serious impact on the development of a child.  It could be a case of life or death in other specialties which cannot be carried out or in which there is a delay because the position is not filled.<\/p> <p>  The issue is the time it takes to fill a consultant post.  The average time it takes to fill a consultant&rsquo;s post is 513 days.  I recognise that some posts are filled in a shorter period of time but some also take longer.  We have evidence to suggest that positions are being offered to people who have no interest in coming to more regional hospitals.  A localised pull would help to curtail some of that but there are also a number of other suggestions.  Giving more money to the PAS is one thing if it needs it but the process needs to be looked at.  If it is still going to take the guts of two years to employ somebody then that is a problem.  It should never take that long.<\/p> <p>  I am sure the Minister will hear this if he is engaging with hospitals and they say that where they are able to do a localised recruitment campaign, they are able to attract the nurses in.  Letterkenny University Hospital is a case in point.  Dozens of additional nurses will be going into the hospital through a localised recruitment campaign and they will be in place in January.  There is a new ward lying empty in Letterkenny University Hospital because there are no staff to work in it.  That is the problem with the PAS system and the centralisation of recruitment.  We have capital investment in a hospital that is not staffed, that is lying empty and that can accommodate dozens of patients yet the staff to maintain that ward are not there and will not be there until the new year.  That ward is only open to hold the beds when there are 30 or 40 people in the accident and emergency department.  I am sure that is not unique to Letterkenny University Hospital but is replicated elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021112400002#D00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I take the point that the system can be and needs to be improved.  We should also acknowledge that in many instances the PAS is finding it difficult to get the candidates.  The average figure that the Deputy quotes of over 500 days is not solely down to the system.  I acknowledge that there is a need to streamline and improve the system and that is an area of work that the HSE is focused on because I know it has been discussed at the highest level at the Cabinet committee.  There is also an international challenge in attracting candidates into different disciplines within healthcare.  It is not always the case that there are willing candidates but the system is not quick enough or able to assimilate them.  To put the figures in context, at the end of September we had about 130,600 whole-time equivalents in the health service and sanction is in place to increase that to over 141,000.  This is a dramatic scale-up in recruitment across the HSE because we recognise that we have to improve the permanent capacity of the healthcare system.  We have hired about 11,000 new staff across last year and this year and there is more to go.  We will continue to put the resources into this and we will focus on the system to see if there is a way in which we can improve it, while also acknowledging that there is a general problem in attracting candidates to certain posts across the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021112400002#D00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The other way to help to attract people to positions, whether it is nurses or other healthcare professionals, is to send a clear signal that they are valued.

It has been five months since the Taoiseach made an address in New York to say that the Government would bring forward a bonus for front-line workers.  It is two months since he said that it would be finalised shortly.  The Minister has said to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that this needs to be dealt with well before the end of the year and next week we will be into December.  These nurses are in the middle of a fight against Covid in their hospitals again and they are understaffed and looking at Christmas and wondering what leave, if any, they will get.  They are going through another year with no bonus and the Government has not announced a bonus.  How long does it take for the Minister and his colleagues to figure out that our front-line workers should be recognised with a bonus?  The Government has had five months since the Taoiseach publicly made that commitment.  How long more will it take?  This rests on the Minister&rsquo;s desk and it is him who is ultimately responsible for this.  Can the Minister inform the committee when a decision will be arrived at on a bonus?  Has a decision been arrived at or has the Government just dropped the issue?  What will the bonus be?  What will it cost?

As the Deputy knows, on budget day we published our updated budgetary forecasts and also our updated macroeconomic forecasts for the next number of years.  It is fair to say that we have witnessed a strong rebound in the Irish economy in recent months.  That has resulted in very strong revenues across a number of different tax heads, in particular VAT and income tax and, of course, corporation tax receipts continue to be particularly strong.  In addition, we have had some underspends in the system but it remains to be seen precisely what the year-end position will be in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In overall terms, the expenditure that we forecast on budget day for 2021 was of the order if &euro;89.25 billion.  We anticipate that we will come in below that figure; not by an enormous amount but by perhaps &euro;3 million to &euro;4 million.  It depends how Departments complete their programmes between now and the end of the year, particularly on the capital side.  The forecast deficit for this year is significantly reduced from budget day, however.  I believe we estimated it would be of the order of &euro;13 billion versus the figure of approximately &euro;20 billion that was estimated earlier in the year.  Similarly, for next year, there is a significant improvement in the forecast position.  We are, therefore, working on the basis that the recovery of the economy will continue.  If one looks at the forecasts in terms of growth, both modified domestic demand and GNI*, we are forecasting steady and sustained growth over the next number of years, which will result next year, for example, that we will only be borrowing for the public capital investment programme and not even for all of it.  Some of it will be resourced by Revenue for collecting.<\/p><p>We estimate that we will be back to having a balanced budget position by 2024.  Certainly, we are in a better position than we thought we would be several months ago, but we also acknowledge that there is a high degree of uncertainty.  We are all witnessing that, including with the continuing challenge being posed by Covid-19 and the impact that inevitably has on the Irish economy.  We remain optimistic regarding inflation.  It is posing many challenges, not least for the people we represent and for businesses.  Costs and household bills are increasing for the public, and that is a real challenge.  The overall forecast is that inflation will peak this quarter and then begin to moderate.  As the committee will be aware, we forecast on budget day that the average inflation rate across next year will be just over 2%, at 2.2%.  The European Central Bank, ECB, believes that the underlying inflation position remains stable, and that it will moderate.  It is confident that the rate of inflation will stay within what the committee members will know is the bank's overall objective of containing inflation to no more than 2% in future.  <\/p><p> Overall, then, there are many challenges.  From representatives of businesses, I am hearing about staff shortages, increasing costs, global supply challenges and rising energy bills.  Those are the main issues that will present challenges for us in the short term.  We are, however, seeing a strong recovery.  Therefore, we are optimistic, but we must also acknowledge that there is a high degree of uncertainty.  In addition, we also have the issue of Brexit to deal with.  The threat we have heard in that regard from the UK Government concerning the triggering of Article 16 is another potential downside risk for the Irish economy, depending on how that plays out in the weeks and months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021112400002#E01000","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1637712000,"counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021112400002#F00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 101, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Taoiseach has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimates for public services for the year ending 31 December 2021: Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances; and Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service.   <\/blockquote> <p>Under Standing Order 100(2) this shall be deemed to be the report of the select committee on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021112400002#F00300","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Business of Select Committee","time":1637712000,"counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2021112400002#F00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to send on any extra information he was asked for in due course.

I am the chief executive of Mayo County Council and I am joined by Ms Catherine McConnell, director of services who has responsibility for planning; and Mr. Tom Gilligan, director of services who has responsibility for housing.  I thank to the committee for the opportunity to participate in this discussion on housing and physical planning in Gaeltacht areas.  Mayo is one of only seven counties in the State with a designated Gaeltacht and we are proud of our language and Gaeltacht traditions and of the people who have kept these alive.  Members will no doubt be aware that the Mayo Gaeltacht, like some other Gaeltacht areas, has experienced the impact of emigration and population decline over the centuries.<br\/><br\/>Our submission outlines the Gaeltacht in Mayo in terms of location, extent and population trends, as well as highlighting relevant policies of Mayo County Council that impact on the Gaeltacht as set out in the current and draft Mayo county development plans and the local economic and community plan, together with council housing policy and delivery in Gaeltacht areas.  We include maps which show the population density in the county as well as the population change from 1996 to 2016.  As is evident from these maps, the Gaeltacht is largely characterised by low population density, which is no doubt impacted by the nature of the terrain in the Gaeltacht areas, with uplands and mountainous and poor quality land and areas that are geographically distant and poorly connected to the key centres of population.<br\/><br\/>The county development plan is a land-use plan which sets out a vision and an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the county for a six-year period.  The policies and objectives directly relating to the Gaeltacht include the objective:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo strengthen the unique linguistic and cultural heritage of Gaeltacht Mhaigh &Eacute;o, by supporting and facilitating improved physical, social and economic infrastructure at appropriate locations throughout the Gaeltacht areas and [requiring] a Language Impact Statement in respect of significant developments within or close to Gaeltacht areas, or where deemed appropriate, to determine their impact on the usage of Irish as the community language. <\/blockquote> <p>The general policies and objectives that apply throughout the county also apply to Gaeltacht areas, such as those relating to new rural residential developments, environmentally sensitive designations, scenic routes and sensitive landscapes.  The county development plan contains planning policies in relation to rural areas under strong urban pressure in Mayo but our Gaeltacht areas are not affected by this designation or any of the restrictions therein.  In the current draft county development plan, no restrictions apply to the development of housing in the Mayo Gaeltacht, other than those that apply universally due to environmental, landscape protection, road safety or normal planning constraints.  However, as previously set out, the Gaeltacht areas tend to coincide with areas of high landscape amenity, poorer ground conditions and environmental constraints and it is these factors that have predominantly influenced the outcome of applications for development in Gaeltacht areas of the county.<br\/><br\/>The Mayo local economic and community plan includes objectives such as:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo maintain and support the communities of Gaeltacht Mhaigh &Eacute;o and Mayo&rsquo;s inhabited islands by facilitating sustainable social and economic development through the provision of infrastructure (social and physical), housing and services and the need to protect the cultural and natural heritage of the Gaeltacht and the Islands where it can be demonstrated that there will be no significant adverse effects on the environment, particularly on the Natura 2000 network. <\/blockquote> <p>Mayo County Council has 272 social housing units in the Gaeltacht, of which 13 are demountable dwellings and a further 266 people have expressed a preference for housing in Gaeltacht areas.  Mayo County Council has recently built 13 social housing units in its Gaeltacht areas and 24 units are being progressed in the social housing programme for 2022 to 2023.

I thank the witnesses from Galway County Council for their contributions on planning in Galway.  Enurements are something that crop up from time to time.  I have a question about the Irish-clause enurements within estates.  For rural housing, they last for seven years.  On estates there does not seem to be a time-bound enurement.  Is it a lifetime clause?  It is impacting on people being able to secure mortgages.  The banks will find an excuse not to lend to somebody where there is an Irish enurement that does not state how long it lasts.<\/p><p>Could any of the Galway representatives or anyone else answer that with regard to their own counties?  I am sure it is an issue across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021112400002#D00300","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1637712000,"counter":225,"content":"<p>We have Irish language enurements attached to two or more houses in our Gaeltacht areas.  Effectively, the reason for the enurement is to ensure that Irish speaking communities are protected and enhanced and that people would be in engaged in conducting their business and lives through the Irish language.  The enurement clause is an Irish language enurement clause.  The house or property would always have the clause that an Irish speaker or somebody with Irish would be occupying that house.<\/p> <p>  I understand what Senator Kyne is speaking about with respect to securing funding for mortgages for these houses, but we would have a position that if a person had purchased a house, had an Irish language enurement, qualified under our criteria in Galway County Council through an interview and so on, but found sometime into the future that they would have to dispose of that house for whatever reason, we would be and have been open to transferring that enurement to another Irish speaker in order to facilitate the sale of that house.<\/p> <p>  The idea behind the enurement is obviously to protect and enhance the Irish language.  In essence, what we want to do is continue the restriction on the house with respect to the Irish language to facilitate Irish speakers, but we also acknowledge the fact that people have different situations throughout their lives and they may have to dispose of the property.  We would allow the transfer of that enurement to another Irish speaker or somebody who qualifies under Irish language criteria in Galway County Council.

In other situations, we have the enurement attached to the applicant; for example, when we have seven-year enurement clauses on houses in restricted areas in our county and all over the country.

When we spoke about the other enurements, we were talking about them in estates.  There is a policy in our plan that allows native Irish speakers an opportunity to live in the Gaeltacht, perhaps not the Gaeltacht from which they originated, and this also applies to speakers who are proficient in Irish.<\/p> <p>  For clarity, there are Gaeltacht areas around Galway city that are within Galway County Council's jurisdiction, but are under severe urban pressure.  Although they may be in the Gaeltacht, there may be situations where there are other things that are at odds with that.  We would have to look at the idea in the sustainable rural housing guidelines and so on.  There may be other issues which mean a native Irish speaker would not be able to achieve planning for a one-off house in a location around the city even though it is in the Gaeltacht.<\/p> <p>  However, in other Gaeltacht and strong Gaeltacht areas, we have a policy in our plan that facilitates that.

However, we would still look at that policy and take the individual in each application on their merits, based on the case they make and the contribution they would make to the Irish language and culture in those areas.<\/p> <p>  We have to be cognisant of the fact that in the past we have had one or two cases where planning permission was granted and appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which ruled that there would be an issue because the local area was under such urban pressure.  When we are advising people on our policies in the development plan, we have to advise them of that as well, because it is a risk factor.

In each of the local authorities, is there someone in the planning department who could manage an application as Gaeilge?

I did something back in 2018.<\/p><p>How useful is that in terms of delivering the services?  That is also part of our remit.<\/p><p> Mr. Kelly referred to how the Mayo Gaeltacht does not really come under areas under severe urban pressure.  Obviously, it is an issue in Galway and probably less so in Donegal.  What kind of consideration is given by the seven local authorities in which there are strong Gaeltacht areas?  Do these authorities ever meet collectively or cohesively to discuss what they can do as a unit to promote Irish language services and planning within an area?<\/p><p> In that context, what about an area in the Gaeltacht that is under severe pressure to maintain Gaeilge as a living language and a language of day-to-day use?  A planning application may tip the pressure in a negative direction, were it to proceed.  What kind of collective action is taken?  It is the flip side of being under severe urban pressure.

First, in Mayo, we can facilitate a planning application through the process, but it would be with the assistance of staff who could transact business as Gaeilge.  It is probably fair to say that in my experience in local authorities, there are not enough staff who can deal fluently and efficiently in Irish to do the business as Gaeilge.  The Deputy has pointed out that much work has been completed in Mayo County Council over a number of years.  It still leaves the scenario where staff are hesitant and lacking in confidence in those interactions, especially on technical matters relating to planning applications and so forth.<\/p> <p>  While we would be able to accommodate it, we are not at the level of proficiency in order to make that a good service for the members of the public.  As I understand it, a working group has been established and met previously on planning matters in Gaeltacht areas throughout the Gaeltacht counties, which included our department and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  That might not have met recently, but the idea behind that was to ensure there would be some degree of consistency of approach on similar issues throughout local authority areas in which there are Gaeltacht areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12021112400002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as an gcur i l&aacute;thair.

We know that, by and large, the areas that stayed strong with the language had very dispersed settlements, for whatever reason, while towns like Dingle, Belmullet and so on that had conventional European-type settlements all lost the language.

Therefore, the conditions have to be complied with and that is the monitoring as such.  I think we spoke about enurements at the start of the session today.<\/p> <p>  On the linguistic impact statements, we can certainly root out those numbers in terms of how many there have been in the past ten years and how it has developed.  With respect to the fact that, since 2008, we have a Gaeltacht plan up to 2021, we have learned a number of things and we have tried to address them as we are going along regarding the application.  There were a number of infrastructural deficits, in a way, in the context of employment and so on.  Thankfully the 110 kV project was constructed a number of years ago to Connemara which gives continuity of power and certainty of power.  At one time there was an issue with trying to keep employment there and building the numbers.  There are a number of different facets involved.<\/p> <p>  From that perspective, in the variation we did in 2018, we went to the three islands.  We developed a framework plan for the islands, which was a new intervention introduced in 2018, and have developed it further in our plan with a Gaeltacht chapter.  We learned that the islands&rsquo; needs are different.  Their situation is different.  They are a Gaeltacht, but they are also physically different not alone because they are islands but because of the nature of the terrain and the designations and so on.  We learned that the island community needs a slightly different framework from that of the mainland.  We looked at various different aspects of policy that worked in 2008 up to 2018 and amended some of them in order for them to work a bit better for the Gaeltacht areas.<\/p> <p>  On the areas under urban pressure, there are difficulties from that perspective.  We previously mentioned that in cases where we granted a planning application for a once-off house for somebody who qualified under the neart&uacute; Gaeltacht and so on, if he or she was closer to Galway city or that area of urban pressure, An Bord Plean&aacute;la would look at the fact it is under urban pressure and possibly consider that as an area where there was a difficulty in providing a one-off rural house.<\/p><p>Since 2008, we have learned quite a lot.  If we were to look at our Gaeltacht plan of 2008, which we have done, compared with what is proposed in our Gaeltacht chapter of our draft country development plan, we would see a noticeable number of differences that we have learned from and have amended policies.

As committee members will be aware, the sports sector has been and continues to be severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Throughout this time, Sport Ireland and the Department have been continually engaging with the sector, and we know sporting bodies and clubs have been severely hit in every aspect of their operations, not least financially.<\/p> <p>  Last year, the Government approved a Covid-19 package of &euro;88.5 million that helped ensure our sporting bodies were in a position to maintain operations, avoid insolvency and prepare for a return to activity.  The package benefited all levels of the sports sector, including thousands of grassroots clubs across the country, and provided some certainty for sporting organisations in their planning for this year.  In terms of sports clubs, the 2020 funding provided support for more than 166 rugby clubs, more than 400 grassroots and League of Ireland clubs, along with more than 33,000 Gaelic games teams.  In addition, support was provided to 1,637 clubs throughout the country as part of small grant schemes operated by local sports partnerships, and 310 swimming pools were supported in reopening.<\/p> <p>  The financial impact of the pandemic continues to be a challenge for many sporting bodies and clubs, with losses and additional costs putting a severe strain on their finances.  Many organisations and clubs have lost significant amounts of revenue owing to the restrictions put in place for much of this year.  The indoor sports sector has been particularly hit, with indoor sports only resuming in October.  Many challenges still lie ahead for sports organisations and clubs in encouraging all members and volunteers to return, as well as attracting new participants.  We need to support participation programmes and initiatives now to ensure the long-term sustainability of clubs' structures and for the health and well-being of the nation.<\/p> <p>  The Government has approved a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;35 million towards a Covid package of up to &euro;65 million this year, and the rest will be provided from savings from within the Department's Vote.  This funding will allow Sport Ireland, through a number of different schemes, to assist sporting bodies and clubs that are in greatest need as we strive to ensure our sporting sector is supported at every level across the country.  The schemes will be run by Sport Ireland and the funding will be distributed through the national governing bodies of sport, similar to last year.  The schemes will ensure that grant aid will only be provided by Sport Ireland and that the governing bodies are satisfied this funding is absolutely required.<\/p> <p>  Sport Ireland is currently assessing funding applications from sporting organisations with a view to funding allocations being announced and paid in December.  Funding will be allocated as follows: field sports funding to support the main field sports, that is the FAI, the GAA, and the IRFU; a reliance fund to support the national governing bodies of sport other than the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU; a sports club resilience fund to support clubs from all sports; a swimming pools and facilities fund; and a resumption of physical activity fund that will include indoor sport.  Allied to the additional current expenditure of &euro;26.3 million already provided to Sport Ireland, this will mean a total of &euro;91.3 million will have been allocated in addition to the current funding to support the sports sector in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOS2021112400002#A00400","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It also looks at opportunities around additional physical activity in hard-to-reach groups, such as those in disadvantaged areas, people with disabilities and indoor sports as well.  A similar scheme was run through the local sports partnerships last year.  I can provide the funding amount for that.  Last year, in the Covid-19 package that we funded, &euro;3 million went to local sports partnerships schemes for small grants for clubs and community groups and innovation and restart schemes.  More than 1,600 clubs benefited from that across 28 local sports partnerships.  We also had supports for disabilities, older adults supports and a restart and renewal fund.  It will be similarly funded this year.  There are opportunities in areas of biggest impact.  This year, we want to avoid the scarring effect particularly among indoor sports.  There will be a big emphasis on indoor sports that were closed for the majority of the last 15 or 16 months, as members know.  We want to limit the scarring effect on that.

I look forward to the publication of the final report later this year.<\/p> <p>  I thank the various witnesses who have shared their perspectives with the committee.  The committee provides an important platform for voices from across politics, business, community groups and civil society.  Continued engagement from across these spheres illustrates just how relevant and important the outworking of Brexit remains for all of us.<\/p> <p>  Almost 12 months ago, we welcomed the finalisation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA.  This was the final element in a sequence of agreements negotiated to allow the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU and underpin the framework for future relations.  Since then, the work of the joint implementation bodies under the agreement has begun.  In June, we saw the first meeting of the partnership council of the TCA and its subsidiary bodies continue to meet, including, for example, the trade partnership committee which met on 15 November.<\/p> <p>  The TCA, like the withdrawal agreement, was jointly agreed by the EU and the UK.  Through its joint implementation, we want to maximise the opportunities presented by the TCA.  We want to see the future relationship with the UK develop positively.  To achieve this the parties must work together in a spirit of partnership and trust.  When trust is compromised, progress is threatened.  The recent UK approach to the protocol has, unfortunately, called that trust into question.  I believe, however, that there is an opportunity before us now to seize momentum towards agreeing a constructive way forward through compromise and partnership on the protocol.<\/p> <p>  The EU has an unwavering commitment to the people of Northern Ireland and the implementation of the protocol.  Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efovi has repeatedly stated, including before this committee, that the Union's number one priority remains to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is protected, a hard border on the island of Ireland is avoided and the integrity of the EU Single Market is maintained.<\/p> <p>  In October, following extensive engagement with Northern Irish stakeholders, from political leaders to businesses and a cross-section of civic society, the Commission published a package of proposals setting out creative and practical solutions designed to help Northern Ireland deal with the consequences of Brexit.  These non-papers cover the issues of customs, sanitary and phytosanitary, or SPS, medicines, and improving engagement with Northern Irish stakeholders and authorities.  Since their publication, the EU has been in dialogue with the UK with the ambition of achieving agreed solutions that can ensure greater stability and certainty for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I remain in close and regular contact with Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and we met last week.  He remains committed to finding credible and durable solutions for the genuine concerns raised with him by people and businesses in Northern Ireland.  Last week, I also met Lord Frost and reiterated the need to engage constructively in this process, grasp the current window of opportunity and agree a deal that can address the real-world concerns of people in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I believe the remaining issues can be resolved.  However, to do so, we need to get to a much more positive, stable and trusting EU-UK relationship.  We have some way to go to get there.  I assure the House that the Government will not stop doing all it can to help develop, support and sustain such a relationship in the interests of all of the people on this island.  I look forward to members' questions and comments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021112400002#B00200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":363,"content":"<p>We will suspend briefly as a vote has just been called.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021112400002#B00300","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637712000,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.44 p.m. and resumed at 6.03 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Thank you for bearing with us.

I listened to it in my room due to the Covid regulations.  The whole issue of Brexit and where we will go and how we will move forward in the next few months is important.  How will this affect the agricultural community, in particular?  I mention the origin of Irish products and how Irish products could be affected by any disruption of trade.  Some 40% of the North's milk comes South to be processed.  How will that be looked at in the long term regarding the Brexit negotiations?  It is a significant issue for an industry that is worth &euro;19 billion to the economy.  That would be the all-Ireland milk processing potential we have.  It is one of the major drivers in the economy.  How will we work with the companies involved in cross-Border activity regarding the processing of milk products?

There was a temporary situation put in place last year for it.  Can the Minister update us on where that issue will go?  It is a significant issue for many people, particularly in the northern half of Ireland but even in my own constituency as well, who would avail of the scheme.

First of all, it is welcome that the Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme and transition cross-Border directive arrangements have been successfully in operation since 1 January.  Both these measures continue to ensure that patients have access to healthcare in Northern Ireland and, in limited circumstances, the UK.  While the scheme has been operating on an administrative basis to date, the Government intends to place the scheme on a statutory basis.  An extensive examination of options to inform the drafting of the general scheme is currently being undertaken by officials in the Department of Health, and that work continues at pace.  Effectively, there has been an <i>ad hoc<\/i>arrangement in place since 1 January, but we will put that on a statutory footing and the Department of Health is looking to finalise how to do that.<\/p><p>On ports, it might be good to put a number of things on the record.  Initial difficulties in adjusting to the new trading environment have largely settled.  The vast majority of goods movements are now green-routed, which means they are not checked at all and are permitted to leave the port without any interaction with customs or the other regulatory authorities.  Well over 80% of goods are green-routed now.  Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and the HSE Environmental Health Service are actively working together to streamline processes and reduce the administrative burden for traders as much as they can, while continuing to meet our obligations under EU law.  Work is under way to improve inter-agency communication, increase data sharing and reduce duplication and to streamline processes as much as possible while ensuring that the necessary controls are performed.<\/p><p>The committee raised the issue in its interim report, in that it wanted State agencies to effectively be in one location in ports.  To be fair, they are trying to do as much of that as they can.  There have been a number of developments since the start of the year and further developments are intended to address the key requests of traders.  For example, a key request from trade was to provide an interface that allowed system-to-system communications between traders, customs systems, and the Revenue RoRo system.  This has been delivered and has removed some of the manual work involved in completing the pre-boarding notification.  There are limits to what can be done in terms of co-location of authorities at ports.  At Dublin Port, for example, there are space and layout limitations.  In addition, certain checks such as animal health checks or food safety checks may require dedicated infrastructure to ensure that such checks can be safely undertaken, like stables in Dublin Port, for example.  That said, the agencies continue to work together to identify ways in which the passage of trucks through Dublin Port, in particular, can be streamlined.Since the start of the year we have seen a very significant increase in the traffic from Dublin and Rosslare directly to mainland Europe, into France, Belgium and the Netherlands.<\/p><p>We have seen quite a significant reduction in the use of the land bridge, but also quite an increase in UK-Northern Ireland trade, with product coming in through Larne and Belfast.  A significant amount of Northern Ireland product would previously have come through Dublin.  Approximately 40% of product coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain would have come through Dublin Port, and some of that has now been diverted directly into Larne and Belfast.<br\/><br\/>There has been a dramatic shift to direct ferry routes.  There are about 36 direct ferry routes a week now.  That figure would have been less than a dozen this time last year, so it happened in the space of a short period of time.  We had conversations about whether the State needed to subsidise direct routes and our response to that was that we believed the market would respond.  If you subsidise it, you could undermine market forces in terms of the viability of that.  To be fair, the advice from the shipping companies was not to subsidise these routes.  If it makes sense to do it from a commercial perspective, it will happen anyway.  That is exactly what has happened, and it continues to grow.  If anything, we are investing in port infrastructure in mainland Europe to streamline a number of those routes.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, has visited a number of those ports in relation to the investment that is taking place.  The port infrastructure story is a positive one.  While there much focus in Northern Ireland on the problems in terms of checks and goods coming in from Great Britain, the ports in the South have just got on with making the changes and trying to make it work, and some of the supply chains have changed accordingly.<br\/><br\/>In terms of an update on agriculture and on Brexit in general, having a trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, in place is hugely important for agriculture.  A big part of our agricultural trade is with Britain, but a big part of Britain's food trade comes to Ireland as well.  It is an &euro;8 billion trading relationship back and forth across the Irish sea.  It sells much food to us.  It is not quite as much as we sell to them, but it is still a very significant figure.  Therefore, avoiding tariffs on that trade with a TCA was, and is, hugely important.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the protocol, anyone in the food industry in Northern Ireland, and certainly the agricultural industry in Northern Ireland, recognises the value of the protocol.  Whether you are nationalist or unionist, the capacity for seamless all-island trade in terms of the food industry is really important, and the protocol guarantees that.  However, one of the problems with that has been the country of origin rules.  What was clear through the Brexit debates was that even though the protocol effectively extends the EU Single Market for goods to Northern Ireland, <i>de facto<\/i>, the country of origin issues were not solved by that.  If a dairy product is produced in Northern Ireland, it is Northern Ireland product.  It is not EU origin.  Even though it is produced to EU standards and it is produced within the EU Single Market, it is not EU origin.  This has allowed that product to be sold into the EU Single Market seamlessly.  However, if the product is going to take advantage of EU trade agreements with other parts of the world, because it is not origin EU but origin UK, that creates a difficulty.  <br\/><br\/>I have been raising this issue for three years.  We wanted to try to get it resolved in the Brexit negotiations but it was not possible to do that.  There was not a big ask from the UK Government to solve this issue.  Many dairy processors, such as Lakeland Dairies, source a significant portion of their raw material from farmers in Northern Ireland.  That is really important for Northern Ireland agriculture.  I would like to see a situation where the EU works to accommodate Northern Ireland produced product in future trade agreements and to look at whether it is possible to amend existing trade agreements to facilitate Northern Ireland product being considered as EU product of origin, because it is EU standard.  Therefore, if we are going to have Northern Ireland as part of an extended EU Single Market for goods, then one of the upsides of that is to benefit from EU trade agreements in terms of origin.  We have to find a way of doing that that does not undermine the UK origin as well, in terms of potential future UK trade agreements for product produced in Northern Ireland.  That is tricky and it has not been solved yet.<br\/><br\/>The truth is that it has not been that disruptive to the dairy industry.  Dairy prices are strong at the moment.  Senator Lombard and other dairy farmers will know that.  That has not been a big issue yet because there has been a strong demand for dairy products across the EU Single Market.  This will only become an issue if you are relying on that product, or mixed pools from North and South, being sold under EU trade agreements to other parts of the world.  Companies have managed that in a clever enough way so far, and it certainly has not undermined price or market access so far.  However, it is something that the dairy industry would like to have resolved.  It is not just dairy; it is other product as well, including beef, sheep meat, poultry product or whatever.  We import a lot of poultry product across the Border from Moy Park and others.<br\/><br\/>It would be useful if we could facilitate a sort of dual labelling, if you like.  If a product is produced to EU standards, it should, therefore, be seen as part of the EU system, but of course it is UK product and should, therefore, be facilitated as UK product in the future as well.  That is a tricky issue that is not resolved yet.  If we can get the protocol settled in terms of its implementation on the basics through the negotiations between the &Scaron;efovi and Frost teams, then hopefully, through partnership, we might be able to find ways of dealing with that country of origin issue over time.  Luckily, for now, dairy prices are strong so the industry has managed to cope with that country of origin issue, from what I have heard.  It is not an anomaly; it is a real issue.  This could be problematic if there were an oversupply of dairy product in the EU and people were looking to rely much more on access through trade agreements and so on.  Those are the long answers to three short questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021112400002#D00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":371,"content":"<p>We lost a lot of time with the vote.

Certainly, there is a fear that certain drugs may not be able to get into Northern Ireland because they are certified in Great Britain and that certification would not be recognised by the EU, and therefore that product coming into the EU Single Market for goods would be problematic because it is not certified by the EU.  Vice-President &Scaron;efovi has committed to a proposal that would resolve that issue.  In fact, it very much mirrors a UK paper that was presented to the Commission in March, and that is effectively the basis for the solution the EU wants to provide.  It will effectively change EU law to recognise UK certification for Northern Ireland, therefore guaranteeing a seamless supply of medicines into Northern Ireland.  There has been much talk about that.<\/p> <p>  My understanding is that as of yet there has not been a significant shortage of medicines in Northern Ireland, but that was a fear that could develop.  This was a big fear about a year out from when Brexit was likely to take effect.  There was quite a lot of discussion with the pharmaceutical industry on this issue.  It was not just about human medicines, but it was about veterinary and animal medicines as well.  To date, there has not been a shortage.  I have yet to see empty shelves in any Boots stores.  There is one across from my office in Carrigaline, in my constituency.  This has not been an issue.<\/p> <p>  The solution the EU is putting together is a solution for Northern Ireland, not for the EU as a whole.  What we are seeing is the industry responding by altering its supply chains.  There may be some changes in some brands and the use of generic drugs in terms of certain types of drugs and so on, but I am not aware of any concern or panic in the industry that this will lead to a shortage of drugs here.  It has had quite a long lead in time to be able to change supply chains and to ensure EU certification.  I will ask Mr. Karl Gardner to comment on that, but that is my understanding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021112400002#F00600","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Before Mr. Gardner comments on that, I will ask a supplementary question on this.

The manufacturing systems effectively relied on Ireland and the UK seamlessly interacting on ingredients, packaging and research and development programmes and so on.  Some of that was restructured recognising the likely outcome of Brexit and ensuring that products being produced for the EU market were being finished in the EU.

More and more people are starting to look the positives.  When you speak to business leaders, they are very clear on two things.  First, they think the protocol needs to stay, but we have got to make it work a bit better and, second, they do not want Article 16 triggered because they think that is going to have a knock-on consequence in terms of the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  The ask that I get from Northern Ireland, apart from some unionist political leaders, but certainly from business leaders, is that the protocol is not perfect, but let us make it work as best we can, and let us start talking about the upside, because there is very significant upside.  Northern Ireland has this unique opportunity to access a very large UK single market and also the much larger EU Single Market.<\/p><p>If you ask anyone in the agrifood sector, in particular, and many other manufacturers in Northern Ireland, the protocol for them is very exciting in terms of business opportunity.

If there is a large majority of more than two thirds, then the next vote can be put off for eight years.  My hope would be, and this may be naive, is that if we can get compromise and flexibility in a way that allows business and many in the unionist community to accept the protocol, then we could get to the point where there is a very strong endorsement of it and then it does not need to come up again for eight years.  Although for now, it is every four years.<\/p> <p>  While of course you would like cross-community support, you could credibly have a situation where a minority of people in Northern Ireland could do away with the protocol when a majority of people want it.  Cross-community support is part of the Good Friday Agreement on issues that are devolved to the Executive and the Assembly in Northern Ireland.  Cross-community support is not part of decisions for the UK Government, in terms of international decisions.  The principle of consent is about what the majority want and cross-community support is a separate and important issue in Northern Ireland.  The protocol issues relate to a British Government agreed international agreement, and therefore it would be a very perverse approach to say that because of the need for cross-community support, you could have a minority of people deciding the future of the protocol against a majority.  That does not mean we should not look for cross-community support; of course we should.  That is why, despite the fact that many in the unionist community think that I have been very unreasonable in relation to the protocol, its construct and so on, we are probably the strongest advocates for flexibility and compromise on the EU side to try to respond to the legitimate concerns that many have raised.  <\/p> <p>  We should be able to significantly  reduce the checks burden on goods that we can show are staying in Northern Ireland and are at no risk of crossing the border into the EU Single Market or into the EU.  That is what we have been pushing Vice-President &Scaron;efovi on, and to be fair, he has responded.  On the food side, he thinks we can reduce sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks by 80%, as long as we can show those goods will be sold and consumed in Northern Ireland.  Likewise, on the customs side, he thinks that we can reduce the burden by 50%.  That is the space for agreement.<\/p> <p>  Lord Frost wants more than that.  What he is asking for is that all goods that are being sold in Northern Ireland and are staying in Northern Ireland that come from Great Britain should be exempt from any form of checks, customs declarations and so on.  That is a very difficult thing for the EU to deliver and it is not consistent with the protocol.  However, the EU can go a long way with it to reduce that checks burden significantly in what Lord Frost would describe as inter-UK trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

What is the current state of the negotiations?

Generally what happens is the two teams meet on Wednesday and Thursday, and it is every second week in Brussels and London.  Then the two principals meet on Friday to assess progress, or not, as the case may be.  Two weeks ago, there was a noticeable change in tone coming from the British side, which certainly suggested to the EU that the negotiation was worth investing in.  Before that, the negotiations were going nowhere.  Last week was difficult, but at the same time, substantive in terms of the discussions.  The Lord Frost and Vice-President &Scaron;efovi meeting was professional and constructive.  Let us wait and see what happens this week.<\/p> <p>  There is no secret in this because in Lord Frost's briefing of party leaders in Northern Ireland and other stakeholders, including business leaders in Northern Ireland, he has shown much scepticism as to whether or not the &Scaron;efovi or the Commission proposals can deliver what they say they are going to deliver; that is, the 80% reductions in SPS checks on food and agrifood products coming in to Northern Ireland and staying in Northern Ireland and the 50% figure on customs checks.  I have put that directly to Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and his team and they are very clear and strong on that, in that they believe they can deliver those numbers.  Not only that, but they are looking to work with the British Government to show how it can be done.  Of course, that will involve input from the British side too, in terms of the sharing of data and labelling so the EU can fully understand that there is a trusted trader system that both sides can see in a transparent way.  A company like Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, for example, has systems that can show where a product is distributed from in Great Britain.  The product comes into Northern Ireland and it will be able to show the shelf from which it has been sold.<\/p><p>If information like that is shared, then the EU can get much reassurance around trusting that a product is staying in, sold in and consumed in Northern Ireland, and therefore the checks burden on us should be reduced dramatically.  That involves partnership between both sides in terms of sharing information and data and potentially labelling as well.  That is what Vice-President &Scaron;efovi means when he says we can deliver this, but we need partnerships with the British Government and the British regulatory system to make it work.<\/p><p> I am more hopeful than I have been.  I spoke to Lord Frost last week and it was a good conversation.  He reminded me that they still regard Article 16 as a perfectly legitimate tool to use.  I do not believe Article 16 was ever designed to set aside large parts of the protocol.  It was essentially a safeguard clause in an emergency situation to make a temporary amendment, but then to return, in time, to the normal functioning of the protocol.  I do not believe that is what the British Government is suggesting it would use Article 16 for.  It is effectively suggesting that if it cannot get the compromise that it is looking for from the EU, it may act unilaterally and use Article 16 to set aside elements of the protocol that it does not believe are necessary.  If it does that, I do not believe the EU will respond well; in fact, I know it will not.  The EU will respond very robustly and it will regard it as a fairly serious breach of good faith in terms of the protocol and the Article 16 mechanism.  I am sure Vice-President &Scaron;efovi told the committee that the EU regards the withdrawal agreement and the trade and co-operation agreement ,TCA, as inextricably linked to each other.  Therefore, the EU would not even agree to start negotiating a TCA until there was a withdrawal agreement in place, backed by a treaty, that is, international law.  If the British Government decides to set aside elements of the withdrawal agreement, that is, elements of the protocol, then that has a carry-over into whether or not the EU can implement the TCA as agreed.  That is the last place any of us want to be, particularly in Ireland, or in the UK, for that matter.<\/p><p> There is much at stake over the next few weeks, and the focus probably needs to be on what percentage of, and what elements of, checks can we effectively do without, and at the same time protect the integrity of the EU Single Market.  How do we put systems in place that can dramatically reduce the checks burden on goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland that we know are staying in Northern Ireland and can show and prove that?  How can both sides work together to remove that burden and make it easier for businesses to source from Great Britain in terms of their supply chains?  If we can make a lot of progress in that area, that will deal with many of the unionist concerns and many of the business concerns in Northern Ireland linked to the protocol.  The EU is in that space, but it cannot remove 100% of the checks.  That is not credible and it is not consistent with what was agreed.  However, it can certainly show a lot of flexibility, and it is willing to do that.<\/p><p> I will get a briefing on where we are again on Friday.  There is still quite a big gap between the two sides, if we are honest.  At least the negotiations now are focused on and are serious about trying to find landing grounds, which is a welcome change.  We should give those negotiating teams time and space and also the confidentiality of what goes on in the negotiating rooms that, hopefully, can facilitate the building of some trust.  Trust is possibly the biggest problem.<\/p><p> If I am frank, the EU is concerned that if it makes a concession it will be banked and Lord Frost's team will then take that and look for more.  The UK side has got to give something here, too.  It is not all about the EU giving.  If you look at what has happened since the start of the year, all of the concessions and flexibility have been moving in one direction only, and that has been a very successful negotiating strategy for Lord Frost and his team.  However, there are limits to that as to how far the EU can go if it does not believe it is moving towards an end point through negotiation.  We are pretty close to that end point now. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021112400002#G00700","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>It is give an inch, take a mile, as they say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021112400002#H00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>This is a robust negotiation.

There is a considerable body of work there for us now to try to rebuild those relationships, because they are quite strained.  What is the level of engagement now between Ministers and their UK counterparts?  What is that relationship is currently?<\/p> <p>  I will read Senator Wall's questions.  You mentioned seizing momentum in your opening remarks, so what are the next steps?  What supports are in place to deal with Irish exports and UK tariffs?<\/p> <p>  Senator Gallagher, I invite you to ask your questions.  We will then go back to the Minister, because we are tight on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021112400002#H00400","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Apologies for the technical difficulties earlier.  I welcome the Minister and thank him for taking the time out of his busy schedule to update us on where things are in relation to Brexit.  For someone from the outside looking in on all of this, it must be hugely frustrating to be dealing with this particular issue.  Following the Chair's comments, where would the Minister rate the current relationship with the British Government, on a scale of one to ten?<\/p><p>Perhaps he has just answered that question.  In many ways, for somebody from the outside, who does not know all the facts, looking in, it is like dealing with a spoilt child in that they keep putting the hand out for more.  When is a deal a deal?  When is a deal finally sealed?  Everyone thought this was all done and dusted, tied up legally between the two parliaments.  We thought the deal was done.  Here we are now renegotiating again.<br\/><br\/>It could be argued that the tactic employed by the UK has been very rewarding as far as it is concerned.  It seems to be a case that the EU negotiating team keeps on giving.  If I were part of the UK negotiating team, I would want more of the same because it seems to be paying off.  For how long will this process go on?<br\/><br\/>Another question relates to the positives that Northern Ireland would enjoy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the protocol, which the Minister touched on.  It puts Northern Ireland in a unique trading position whereby it can trade unencumbered and have access to the EU market, while at the same time trade within the UK and be part of any future trade agreements the UK may negotiate.  There has been some evidence of that unique position already.  There have been two major job announcements recently, one announced by Coca-Cola in regard to a large number of jobs being created in Belfast, and one by Almac in Craigavon which is creating 1,000 jobs over the coming three to five year period.  In regard to that, Craigavon is approximately half an hour to 45 minutes from Monaghan town.  As someone who comes from a Border constituency, I wonder should we be making more of those job announcements in Northern Ireland.  It is a good story to tell, not just from a Northern Ireland perspective but for those of us who live in Border counties, including my colleague, Senator Joe O'Reilly.  It is not that long a journey to travel from Monaghan town, north Monaghan or even Cavan to Craigavon.  There are benefits for the Border community, if not for the island as a whole.  Should we make more hay, if you like, out of those announcements?  Should we market ourselves across the EU and across the globe, based on Northern Ireland's position, from an all-Ireland perspective?  We could benefit from that unique trading relationship Northern Ireland currently has.<br\/><br\/>My final point is somewhat connected.  The Minister might use his good offices to talk to the relevant people north of the Border.  In early January the minimum unit price on alcohol will come into effect.  For those who live along the Border, many retailers fear that day coming.  We are all in favour of the minimum unit price on alcohol coming in.  It has proven beneficial in Scotland in that it has had the desired effect.  It was my understanding that this issue was going to be tackled on an all-island basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021112400002#H00500","speaker":"1658","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":404,"content":"<p>We could not get agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021112400002#J00200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>We could not get agreement.

There will be plenty of opportunity to do that if we can get an agreement.  I am anxious to focus on the limited but nevertheless evident progress over the past ten days or so and to try to encourage that progress even further.  It is not helpful for me to talk about how people have behaved or what they have said over the past ten months or so.  Clearly, it has put a heavy strain on relationships between the EU and the UK, between Ireland and the UK, and at times also between the UK and Washington in regard to the concerns coming from the White House and others on Capitol Hill.  However, there will be a time to discuss all that.  For now, we have a little bit of momentum in these talks and we should focus on that.  I will encourage both sides to try to make progress.<\/p> <p>  When I said that the British negotiating tactic has been very successful, that is true in terms of delivering concessions and flexibility from the EU, but it is not true in terms of reputation and relationships which are very important for a country the size of the UK and a country as globalised as the UK.  That is all I will say on it.<\/p> <p>  As for the next steps in regard to momentum, there are two very experienced and smart negotiators with very good teams supporting them.  Let us hope that they get the political instruction to do a deal, because that is what is needed here.  Negotiating teams can only do what the key decision makers, politically, allow them to do.  What is needed between now and Christmas is for the British Prime Minister to give a signal to Lord Frost that we need to try to conclude these negotiations and get the best deal available, and we need a signal from President von der Leyen to Vice-President &Scaron;efovi that he needs to do the same.  I have spent a good deal of time speaking to Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi.  We are very lucky to have Mr. &Scaron;efovi.  He is very interested in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  He is very interested in being helpful and in solutions.  He has pushed the Commission really hard, right to the edge of the boundaries of what is legally consistent with the protocol.  That is because he wants to get a deal done.  They are very much in that space.  I hope the British side is too.  They have achieved much in this negotiation in regard to changing how the protocol is both perceived and implemented but, as Mr. &Scaron;efovi said, if they ask for the impossible, then it cannot be delivered.  That is a political choice for the Prime Minister.  I am more hopeful now than I was a fortnight ago.  Is this hugely frustrating?  Yes, of course it is.  We thought this issue was put to bed.  Do not forget, the protocol was agreed two years ago but on 17 December 2020, the British Government agreed an implementation plan for the protocol.  Michael Gove was then the key negotiator and he agreed that with Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi.  The approach changed then, as January and February passed.  The personalities on the British side changed from Michael Gove being the lead negotiator to Lord Frost being the lead negotiator and, as I said, they have achieved much since then.<\/p><p>The EU is getting close to its horizon of what it can do.  Hopefully, that is recognised in London. <\/p><p> Regarding the positives for Northern Ireland, finally some people are starting to talk about that.  Instead of politicians leading the debate, industry is starting to be part of that discussion in a major way.  Some people have asked me if there is a threat that businesses and investment in the Republic may potentially go north?  I do not see that as a threat.  I would welcome a significant increase in investment in Northern Ireland.  It is good for the all-island economy and, God knows, Northern Ireland deserves it, given the pulling and dragging that Northern Ireland has had to put up with throughout the Brexit debates and so on.  I would not begrudge Northern Ireland that economic success at all.  We have a very competitive proposition for foreign direct investment south of the Border but increasingly now, there is a strong and growing proposition for foreign direct investment in Northern Ireland.  Personally I would welcome that.  It is a great opportunity.<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned the mechanisms and compensation for tariffs.  First, the TCA guarantees there are no tariffs, unless the TCA is called into question because the protocol gets called into question, as the two are interlinked.  It would be incredibly frustrating if, after all the negotiations, decisions and compromises to get the TCA and withdrawal agreement in place, all of that started to unravel because of a unilateral decision in London.  I hope that does not happen but if it does happen, the EU is prepared for that, I would say.  I do not want to go into that too much because, again, I do not want to focus on failure when we need to be focusing on achieving an agreement and a compromise.<\/p><p> On minimum unit pricing for alcohol, which does not have anything to do with the protocol or Brexit, when I say we could not get the Executive in Northern Ireland to agree, I do not think that is fully fair.  We have certainly indicated that we would like to do this on an all-island basis because we do not want people going across the Border to shop for cheap alcohol because we have introduced minimum pricing here.  We believe it is a good public health measure to ensure that alcohol is not being used as a loss-leader or being sold for half nothing and being abused as a result.  We believe that has worked in other jurisdictions and it will work here.  We would of course like Northern Ireland to do this with us at the same time but we do not have any guarantees on that and we cannot wait forever.  The Government's view on this is we would like to do this on an all-island basis if we can but, if not, we need to move ahead anyway.  We need to try to manage the cross-Border trade consequences of that as best we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021112400002#J00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>What was the reason for the reluctance on the part of Northern Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021112400002#K00200","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I have not had long conversations with my counterpart in Northern Ireland on this.  This is a political decision for the Executive.  I will not overreach as I sometimes get criticised for doing that by politicians in Northern Ireland.  This is a matter for the Executive.  It is its issue.  We have signalled for some time that we want to do this, we think it is a good public health measure and we would like to do it together but it is a matter for the Executive to respond as to why it either does or does not want to do it on the same timeline as us.  Efforts to do this on an all-island basis have effectively delayed this measure for longer than it would otherwise have been delayed.  The view of the Department of Health is that while it may potentially cause some trade disruption potentially and cross-Border shopping, which would be frustrating, we still think that, on the whole, this is a public health measure we need to move ahead with.  I think it will happen.  It is a fair question and a matter I will raise with some of the political leaders in Northern Ireland whom I will meet next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021112400002#K00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1637712000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>That brings our meeting to a conclusion.
