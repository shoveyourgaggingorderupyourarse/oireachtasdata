It is of particular interest to us as we are very active in the area of research on microplastics pollution.  The statement submitted outlines the sources and some potential impacts of microplastics.  I reiterate our support for the proposed Bill.<\/p> <p>  I will present some of our current and previous work in which we investigated sources and pathways of microplastics.  I will begin with the sources of microplastics and what we know about pathways to the freshwater environment.  A desktop study in 2015, which was funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, outlined some potential sources of microplastics pollution in freshwater environments.<\/p><p>The study identified some catchments which had potentially high-risk microplastic pollution.  We also did a smaller scale study in which we were able to quantify some of these microplastic levels and describe some of the sources.<\/p><p> With particular relevance to microplastics coming from industry, we visited some industry polymer companies.  In one of these, polymerisation processes took place, while another had machining of microplastics.  We found that even though these were quite well regulated plastics industries with their own on-site treatment, they still emitted substantial amounts of microplastics to the sewer.  As well as accidental emissions to a sewer, we also identified some allowable discharges to a sewer which take place due to the current lack of regulation of microplastics in industry.  In our plastics industries, there is an allowable suspended solid loading which is quantified in milligrams per litre.  This can equate to quite high levels of microplastics emissions.  This problem of allowable emissions has also been flagged internationally by Lechner and Ramler in 2015, as they quantified high numbers of microplastics coming out of an Austrian recycling industry.<\/p><p> As well as the accidental and allowable emissions to a sewer, there is also a potential for accidental spillages within industry, such as spillages onto factory floors or onto the surrounding hard substrate outside.  There remains potential for run-off in the storm water drain or perhaps direct run-off into freshwater.  The EPA has funded GMIT and UCD to carry out a project, Sources, Pathways and Environmental Fate of Microplastics, in which we are examining the potential for plastics to be found in the vicinity of plastics industries by sampling the sewer drain and assessing the potential for direct input by looking at nearby water courses.  This work is ongoing.<\/p><p> Pathways from the sources into our sewers have been examined in recent years by several researchers, including us.  In summary, many sources such as those emanating from industry, landfill, storm water drains and domestic use such as washing machines drainage enter the wastewater treatment plant system.  Upon entering, the microplastic loading is partitioned into what comes out in the receiving waters and what is captured in the sewage sludge.  We found there is a high capture rate within wastewater treatment plants of roughly 90%.  In Ireland, microplastics which are incorporated into the sewage sludge may find their way back onto the land due to spreading of sewage sludge practices.  The remaining 10%, which is not a low figure, ends up in our rivers and lakes.  We do not really know where the microplastics go from there or what impact they may have on the environment or human health.<\/p><p> Some other sources we are currently investigating include microplastics emanating from the construction industry, as it has a very high plastics demand, and from astroturf or artificial pitches and playgrounds.  We have carried out sampling and are currently analysing some of our data.  What we want to see is how plastics are spread or transported from these sources and if there is a danger to nearby water courses.  Preliminary results show that aspects of construction design dramatically reduce the leakage of microplastics from astroturf pitches.<\/p><p>They include microplastics from astroturf pitches, used in the construction of boundaries and other features.  Other sources and pathways for microplastics which we really want to investigate include how microplastics, once they become land-spread, are transported overland into nearby watercourses.  In our current study we are investigating the potential for and the mechanisms for overland movement and run-off from rainwater, as well as the vertical migration of microplastics.  This is being done via a series of experiments and fieldwork.  We are also investigating the potential for microplastics in the freshwater environment to be transferred through the food chain and monitoring microplastics in a number of watercourses, particularly in the River Slaney catchment.  Preliminary results of this work show that all of the river water samples obtained so far contain microplastics, the majority of which are microplastic fibres.  We have found that microplastics are present in all of the invertebrate species we have captured from rivers.  <\/p><p> There are certain points at which we might be able to intervene.  There is a high number of clean-up initiatives under way on beaches and rivers.  While this is very useful and important for the surrounding ecosystem, more emphasis should be placed on intervention at an earlier stage.  Of course, prevention is the best solution to the problem; therefore, we very much support legislation or regulations to reduce the production and use of plastics.  This might also be feasible through awareness campaigns, or consumer driven initiatives.  Furthermore, there is great scope for intervention at the product design stage.  Once microplastics or plastics reach the environment or are in use, effective waste management and potential change of industrial practices are very important means by which to decrease dramatically their leakage into the environment.  They can be captured and well managed once they reach receptors such as a wastewater treatment plant.  Technological upgrades to treatment plants to deal with microplastics and allow improved waste management of sludge derived from the plants could also help.  There are a number of clean-up initiatives available once microplastics reach the environment.  <\/p><p> The last slide shows my team which helps to make this research become a reality.  My colleague, Dr. R&oacute;isin Nash, will give the committee an insight into microplastics in the marine environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Marie Mahon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549969200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Having heard about the potential sources of and pathways for microplastics in waterways, it makes sense to look at estuaries, bays, inlets and oceans as their probable destiny but also as sources of secondary microplastics.  All habitats and species mentioned hereafter can be taken to have recorded the presence of microplastics.  Studies have reported the ubiquitous recording of microplastics in the Irish marine environment.  At GMIT, experienced marine microplastics scientists are answering a number of research questions involving identification and quantification in seawater, sediments and biota.  Our aims are to build on the knowledge base, particularly in an Irish context; to produce comparative standardised methodologies; to improve comparability throughout Europe; to increase ocean literacy through providing information on microplastics in Irish commercial species and taking an ecosystem-based approach to our research using Irish case studies.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the earlier studies of microplastics, much of the focus, both in Ireland and outside, was on building a knowledge base.  Dr. Amy Lusher wrote her PhD in GMIT on microplastics and began to show the ubiquitous distribution of microplastics in seawater of the coast and the presence of microplastics both in mesopelagic fish and True&rsquo;s beaked whales.<\/p><p>Dr. Heidi Acampora did her PhD in microplastics and macroplastics in GMIT where she began to show the high levels of plastics in beached seabirds through carrying out beach bird and colony surveys with the help of Citizen Science.  She helped to develop and apply European methodologies for necroscopies in Ireland.  The results of her research led to the use of an OSPAR ecology quality objective to reduce the levels of litter and plastic particles in fulmar stomachs in Ireland.  Current research by Andrew Power, a PhD candidate on a Marine Institute Cullen fellowship, is looking at seabird eggs to reduce the levels of hazardous substances in the eggs.  Niall Keogh, a PhD student, is building on the knowledge of the interactions of seabirds and marine litter, both inshore and offshore.  Dr. La Daana Kanhai recorded microplastics along latitudinal gradients, including upwelling, in the Atlantic Ocean and seawater sediments and sea ice in the Arctic Sea basin.<\/p><p> In the area of methodologies, research led by Dr. Anne Marie Mahon is exploring the use of different plankton nets to sample surface microplastics using Galway Bay as a case study.  This has resulted in providing recommendations on the sampling and processing of microplastics in surface waters in Europe.  The research will also provide valuable Irish data for the levels of microplastics in our backyard.  Building on this research, GMIT is particularly invested in quality control and rigorous scientific standards in the research of microplastics and it subsequently led to our involvement in BASEMAN, a JPI Oceans project, with funding supported by the Irish Marine Institute.  Research involving Dr. Jo&atilde;o Frias, Dr. Anne Marie Mahon, Dr. Ian O&rsquo;Connor and me has resulted in the production of European standardised methodologies for seawater, sediment and biota and recommendations for monitoring.<\/p><p> Research into commercial species is important to increase our knowledge base.  As ocean literacy increases and consumers become more aware of microplastics, they become very interested in the risks associated with seafood.  We have researchers who have examined the intestinal tracts of pelagic fish and the Dublin Bay prawn from fish grounds off the south and west coasts.  The blue mussel is regularly consumed in Ireland, while the common prawn is largely exported.  They have both recorded low levels of microplastics in their intestinal tracts.  We have several research projects exploring research questions in spatial differences and potential impacts on behaviour, etc.  The lug worm, best known for its use as bait, has the potential to result in bioaccumulation of microplastics up the food chain to its predators.<\/p><p> With so much research, national and international, focusing on individual species, we felt it was important to take an ecosystem approach to get a better overview of what was happening in a bay.  Therefore, Elena Pagter, a PhD candidate, and Dr. Jo&atilde;o Frias are using Galway Bay to build a more complete picture to inform both policy makers and the local community.  Based on the research presented and the fact that, for many products, there are numerous feasible alternatives that may be utilised instead of microplastics, we are in support of the general scheme of the 2018 Bill for the prohibition of certain products containing plastic microbeads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n Nash","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549969200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The Bill, as presented, seems to be comprehensive from my point of view.  As we saw at the last meeting of the committee, as well as in the presentations made today by my colleagues from GMIT, there is a lot of evidence that microplastics are a problem.  Our studies show that sediments contain microplastics both from historical and continuing pollution events.  Microplastics in the environment look like food to the organisms which consume them.  They then bioaccumulate which has direct impacts on the organisms and the higher predators which feed on them.  There is evidence of microplastics in both the blue mussel and nephrops in Galway Bay and on the west coast generally, which means that they are in the food chain, which gives real cause for concern.  This evidence adds to international research in the area which confirms the problem across the globe.  In Norway the same species have been seen to contain microplastics.<\/p><p>From that we can extrapolate that this is a real problem.  Rather than waiting for extensive research specifically in an Irish context, invoking the precautionary principle is a really good idea.  We welcome that the Bill provides that, rather than waiting for all this research over the next number of years, we will invoke the precautionary principle and act now to try to prevent additional primary microplastics entering the environment.<\/p><p> The clear definition of microbeads in the Bill, which is inclusive of all plastic particles in the size range, is welcome.  It was less clear in the previous Bill.  It is now clearly defined and it makes it easy to understand what exactly the Bill covers.  That is also welcome.<\/p><p> In terms of the penalty for breaching the law, my reading of it, which may be wrong, is that it would be &euro;500.  That does not seem adequate for the purposes.  It would be a question for the committee as to whether that is correct.<\/p><p> Overall, the Bill appears to be a good addition to our attempts to tackle this microplastics problem in the environment.  I welcome it in its current form state and it appears to be a good Bill with which to proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549969200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Does Ms Dean wish to make an opening statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#J00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549969200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Yes.  I thank the joint committee for this opportunity to consult on the prohibition of certain products containing plastic microbeads Bill 2018.  The Irish Cosmetics Detergents and Allied Products Association is the IBEC group representing Irish companies engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of cosmetics, detergents and allied household products.  The cosmetics and detergent sector takes the issue of plastic aquatic litter seriously and shares the overarching goals of the Government and European Union to address this challenge.  I am joined today by Mr. John Chave, director general of Cosmetics Europe, a European trade association representing more than 4,500 companies and national associations in the cosmetics and personal care sector in Europe.<br\/><br\/>The cosmetics and detergent sector has taken positive action on the occurrence of plastic microbeads in the marine environment.  Building on voluntary initiatives taken by its individual members companies, on 21 October 2015, Cosmetics Europe issued the following recommendation to its members:<\/p><blockquote>In view of the public concerns expressed over plastic debris in the marine environment, and given the availability of alternative materials, Cosmetics Europe recommends its membership to discontinue, in wash-off cosmetic products placed on the market as of 2020: the use of synthetic, solid plastic particles used for exfoliating and cleansing that are non-biodegradable in the marine environment.<\/blockquote> <p>Results of 2018 data<b><\/b>collected by Cosmetics Europe show that between 2012 and 2017, the European cosmetics industry phased out as much as 97.6 % of plastic microbeads used for exfoliating and cleaning purposes in rinse-off cosmetics and personal care products.  The European industry is on track to achieve 100% phase-out of plastic microbeads by 2020.  Our voluntary action was taken in spite of it being widely acknowledged that the cosmetics sector is a minor potential contributor.  Studies estimate a potential contribution of between 0.1% and 2% of the total aquatic plastic litter.  This potential minor contribution is ever decreasing as progress has been made towards the completion of the phase-out of plastic microbeads.  In fact, by far the largest potential contributors to microplastic marine litter are from the breakdown of bigger plastics, for example, car tyres, plastic pellets and microfibres from clothes.<br\/><br\/>Similar to personal care products, the use of microbeads in home care products is very limited and is further decreasing as several companies have already announced their intention to reformulate their product in a more environmentally friendly way.<br\/><br\/>In the 2016 European Commission study to support the development of measures to combat a range of marine litter sources, detergents and maintenance products were not identified as key contributors to marine plastic litter.<\/p><p>The sector traditionally makes limited use of materials that could qualify as microplastics.  In acknowledgment, however, of the potential litter stemming from secondary microplastics during the washing of synthetic textiles, the industry is actively engaged in a cross-industry agreement, through the European Free Trade Association, with European industry associations representing the global value supply chain of garments and their maintenance.  The agreement, which is referred to in the European Commission's strategy for plastics, supports the need for further investigation and a better understanding for the prevention of microplastics released into the environment during the washing cycle.  It also aims to find feasible solutions based on science and research that can be effectively applied by industry, consumers and authorities. <\/p><p> In conclusion, voluntary actions taken by the industry are proving extremely effective at removing plastic microbeads from products.  Any proposed ban of microbeads in detergents and rinse-off personal care products must be supported by clear definitions to operate effectively.  The proposed definition of microbeads in the general scheme is too broad and, as a result, would prevent Irish manufacturers manufacturing rinse-off cosmetics and detergent products that would otherwise be permitted in EU countries.  It would also remove many products on the Irish market until they were reformulated.  The business and consumer impacts in the general scheme, however, do not take this into account.  Pending the outcomes of the European Chemicals Agency REACH restriction process, it is essential for the smooth functioning of the European Single Market not to create regulatory barriers to trade.  We encourage the scope of any proposed regulatory measures to align with existing member state legislation, such as is in place in Britain and pending in Northern Ireland, to avoid disadvantaging the Irish manufacturing industry. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n Dean","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549969200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dean.

Some studies have been done to show that if a small invertebrate ate some microplastics, the level of persistent organic chemicals in the animal will have reduced once the plastics have gone through.  The problem is that they are a vector of pollution.  They can attract, for example, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and transport them.  Whether these chemicals absorb or desorb - or let go - of the pollutants is affected greatly by pH.  It is a concern that in the gut where the pH is lower, this could promote the release of the toxins.<\/p><p>Further up the course, the particles going through a wastewater treatment plant interact with many pathogens.

This is a very interesting topic.  It is clearly quite a technical area and, as such, the committee and the Department were right initially to engage with Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and its researchers.  That was a good move and I acknowledge the support of the Department in encouraging it.  I acknowledge also the work we have seen in the witnesses' presentations, from UCD Earth Institute, the EPA, which has been involved in all this, and the marine and freshwater research centre in GMIT.  I am conscious of what Ms Dean said about commercial activities and the European Single Market.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps all the witnesses could talk about the EU REACH regulation, which basically involves registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals.  The regulation has not fully come into effect yet.  How then do we dovetail our legislation with the forthcoming regulation?  Will the witnesses talk about the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA?  It ultimately manages all the technical issues surrounding this whole issue.  The witnesses might talk us through that issue a little.  Ms Dean also mentioned REACH, and there was perhaps some suggestion that this all might be a little premature.  I do not agree.  When experts such as Dr. Kevin Lynch come before us and talk about the challenge that we now have microplastics in our fish and our food chain, that must ring an alarm bell for us.  We have known about this for a long time.  I also acknowledge the work of my colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan.  She raises this issue constantly in the Seanad, is an expert in this area and has driven this legislation in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  What is the story with REACH?  How does it dovetail with this legislation?  We better be ready and it would be better to move this legislation on.<\/p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to talk about two other issues.  What is their engagement with the local authorities on this research?  The local authorities are licensing bodies and are responsible for monitoring various hospitals, for instance.  In my local authority we had issues with the release of pathogens into the sewerage system.  There are many breaches of these licences across the 31 local authorities, but this is the local authorities' mandate so they do regular sampling and reporting, for instance.  I believe they do not report enough.  There needs to be a greater focus on these drain and attenuation tanks, particularly in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and the hospital sector.  There are huge concerns about pathogens coming into the water streams from the health and hospital sector, and alarm bells should be ringing there.  I have seen some of this myself so I have a little knowledge of it.  The witnesses might talk about this in the context of research.  May I suggest, if they have not already done so, that they engage with some of the local authorities and look at their data?  It is all about data.  This is a science.<\/p> <p>  Have the witnesses had any experience in the course of their work with Teagasc?  Teagasc, as they know, engages in outreach.  Regarding grant schemes under EU farm payment schemes, etc., and environmental initiatives, we know there will be soil cores and soil boring.  There is analysis of those.<\/p><p>The profiles of these cores show various pollutants in the soil.  These are standard with regard to various EU-funded agricultural programmes and a lot of information could be gleaned from them.  Alarm bells must be ringing now that we are told we have microbeads in the food chain.  We must sit up and do something.  I welcome the legislation.  The more scientific and technical research and validation we have with regard to the legislation, the better.<\/p><p> I would particularly like to focus on the Irish Cosmetics, Detergents and Allied Products Association.  How have the private sector and industry been engaging?  Clearly, it is in their interests to do so as people are becoming much more environmentally aware.  People are looking at the backs of products to see whether they contain microbeads.  Many people are becoming very conscious of microbeads in the cosmetic and detergent industries, and in the agricultural and horticultural sector where we know microbeads are used in some fertilisers to assist in their distribution.  These are challenges and I would like to hear from Ms Dean because I am always conscious of industry but we want responsible responses.  It is not enough to say it will impact on profits.  The environment is critical for this generation and future generations.  I have long argued that people have become very conscious when purchasing of how a product impacts on the environment.  I would like to know more about the European REACH process.  I thank the witnesses for engaging with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#N01100","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549969200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I will comment on the REACH process because it is an interesting and important question.  Ireland is not the first country in the European Union to initiate legislation on microbeads.  The UK has legislation, as do France and Sweden.  Italy is implementing legislation and Denmark is planning legislation.  This presents a problem because if various member states have various legislative measures, potentially we will have an issue with the EU Single Market.  Something similar happened in the US with initiatives on microbeads at state level.  At some point, the US federal government stated the measures were breaking up the US internal market and that a federal measure was required that would be common throughout the US market.  There is a strong case on Single Market grounds for a European measure.<\/p> <p>  To give a little bit of history, there are two possibilities to address this at European level.  We could have a regulation or directive that goes through the European Parliament in an ordinary legislative procedure or we could have the ECHA REACH process.  Rightly and understandably, there has been a lot of concern, perfectly articulated by Senator Boyhan, about this problem and the need to address it, and not only on Single Market grounds because it is recognised that it is an environmental problem.  The European Commission decided not to go along the ordinary legislative procedure route but to go through the REACH process.<\/p> <p>  Essentially, REACH is a system for managing chemicals.  Within the REACH process, the European Chemicals Agency has the power and capacity to recommend to the European Commission that it restrict certain chemicals.  This is the process we are going through.  Why did it go down the REACH process and not the ordinary legislative procedure process?  At the time, it was thought that REACH was slightly quicker.  Sometimes the processes in Brussels, as anybody who has ever worked there knows, can take an awfully long time and there is a sense of urgency about this.  This partly explains why the Irish Government wants to push forward the legislation.<\/p> <p>  The ECHA process was begun at the end of 2017.  The speed element is relative because ECHA takes a little bit of time and there are several points to note about it.  It is completely harmonised so it addresses the Single Market problem.  This means whatever legislation Ireland chooses to adopt, and I fully appreciate the sense of urgency and the wish to push forward, will be subject to European legislation.  Essentially, if the domestic legislation is in conflict with European legislation, then the European legislation will take precedence in the normal way of the Single Market.<\/p><p>That is not a controversial comment to make.<\/p><p> This is not likely to be completed until approximately 2021.  It is difficult to say for sure when it will be finished.  The ECHA secretariat had a year to present a dossier.  It finished that on 11 January and published it on 30 January.  Committee members can see the ECHA's initial work on its website.  The second stage of the process must now take place, with the dossier to be considered by the committee for risk assessment, RAC, of the ECHA.  One of the requirements for restriction processes is that a risk must be demonstrated - not necessarily a litter risk, but a toxic one.  It is a slightly controversial part of the legislation.<\/p><p> There will also be a social and economic assessment under which the impact on industry will be considered, which members of this committee wish to discuss during this session.  That process will take most of 2019.  In 2020 or so, there will be a recommendation and, all things being equal, the process will be finished by around 2021.  The Irish legislation will be subject to that.<\/p><p> Members need to bear in mind that the mandate of the ECHA goes slightly beyond what Ireland is considering.  The agency covers intentionally added microbeads and microplastics.  They are a small fraction of a much bigger problem, but the agency is considering the issue across a number of sectors as opposed to just ours.<\/p><p> Other European countries are pressing ahead with their legislation, and there is a certain amount of political pressure to do so.  Legislation was recently tabled for debate in Portugal, but people there opted to wait until the ECHA had decided what it would do.  It is understandable that Ireland might want to push ahead and not wait for the agency, but the take-home point from this is that, after 2021, it is overwhelmingly likely that there will be a restriction on microplastic in some form.  It may be slightly broader in scope than this proposal, as it also addresses other sectors, and the Irish legislation would be subject to it.<\/p><p> That is my take on the ECHA.  Other witnesses might wish to add or correct something if they disagree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Chave","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549969200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Senator Boyhan asked questions on other matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#P00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1549969200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I asked about the synergies achieved in working with Teagasc and local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#P00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549969200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>We have some synergy as regards assessing microplastics in groundwater, which is difficult to do.

He is quite right to express the view that consumers are becoming more environmentally aware.  Of course, the industry needs to responds to this.  I will take the opportunity to talk a little about the recommendation and the action to which Ms Siobhan Dean, director of Irish Cosmetics, Detergents and Allied Products Association, referred to in her statement.<br\/><br\/>In 2012 and some cases a little earlier than that, some companies started to phase out plastic microbeads for exfoliating and cleansing, which is for what they were mainly used in cosmetics and personal care products.  In 2015 we in Cosmetics Europe encouraged our membership to phase out plastic microbeads for exfoliating and cleansing and made the voluntary recommendation that Ms Dean read in her statement, recognising, of course, that this was an issue on which people expected us to act as a responsible industry.  It is not enough for us in Brussels to simply put some words on a page and ask our membership to go out and think about it.  We undertook to follow up to find out whether it was the case that the industry was indeed phasing out plastic microbeads.  We conducted a survey in 2016, at which point we found that around 80% of plastic microbeads had been phased out.  When Cosmetics Europe<b><\/b>made its recommendation, it set a timeframe up to 2020, but there was a kickback.  People said it was very nice that the industry had done this, but why would it take it so long to implement it.  The reason Cosmetics Europe adopted that fairly long timeframe was that it was worried that it would be more difficult for smaller companies that were putting microbeads into their products to reformulate in time.  <br\/><br\/>As part of the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA, process, Cosmetics Europe is required, like other industry sectors, to make submissions on the social and economic impacts which, of course, are important and something the committee needs to consider.  Cosmetics Europe conducted an additional survey and that is where the rather precise figure of 97.6% came up.  Let me reiterate that, according to the Cosmetics Europe survey, 97.6% of plastic microbeads for exfoliating and cleansing have disappeared from the European market.  Why can Cosmetics Europe be so precise about this figure?  We represent more than 90% of the companies involved in the European sector and nearly all of the multinationals and, through associations such as the Irish Cosmetics, Detergents and Allied Products Association and the European associations, smaller companies too.  Cosmetics Europe conducted a massive survey and surveyed half of the entire market, which is pretty statistically sound.  The margin for error is less than 1%, compared to that in opinion polls where it is plus or minus 3%.  Cosmetics Europe can be confident, therefore, that most of the plastic microbeads used for exfoliating and cleansing have been removed and that if they have not already been removed, certainly by 2020 they will have more or less disappeared from the European market.  <br\/><br\/>Members may have questions about the companies that are not members of Cosmetics Europe and not covered by its recommendation, or concerns about imports from manufacturers outside the European market.  These concerns are fully understandable, but the committee needs to be aware that plastic microbeads for exfoliating and cleansing are, to a significant extent, not the real problem.  The problem environmentally is much more with secondary microplastics, tyre abrasions and other such issues raised by GMIT.  In a nutshell, the Senator is absolutely correct - the industry had to respond and consumers are now more environmentally aware.<\/p><p>We did respond.  We have made very significant progress in phasing out plastic microbeads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Chave","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549969200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Let us take a step back from the very technical stuff for a second.  It is important for us to reassert at a very basic level why this committee has spent so much time on this issue, partly at the request of Senator Grace O'Sullivan and Deputy Sherlock at earlier stages and now at the request of the Minister.  We are all concerned as a result of our growing knowledge of the impact of plastics in general on our environment, whether first or second generation microplastics or single-use plastics.  It is becoming a bigger part of our policy debate, and that is a good thing.  The committee is unanimous in taking the view that these things are bad for our environment and that we need to have stronger regulatory mechanisms to reduce the number of them.  It is also important, however, that we do not have this debate in isolation.  I make these points partly with regard to the debate as to whether we should wait for the European Union process.  What has been going on in the European Union and European Commission in recent years with regard not only to microbeads but also to single-use plastics has involved quite a significant battle between industry and environmentalists with regard to how this enormous threat should be dealt with.  It is a threat and we need to be honest about that.<\/p> <p>  To put this conversation in context, the corporate budget for lobbying on the EU's position on single-use plastics is between &euro;1.5 million and &euro;1.75 million.  That is the amount of money industry is spending to advocate for what it wants to see, as it is perfectly entitled to do.  The general approach has been to favour voluntary agreements over statutory enforcement.  These agreements are often weaker than those we are discussing here, in a limited sense.  There are also far lower levels of transparency in the policymaking processes of many member states.  One of the reasons we are now seeing individual member states pushing ahead and saying that they are not waiting any more is because it has been taking so long to progress some of this at European Union level.  Clearly, it would be better if there was a single agreement at EU level, but it is highly likely that, when and if that agreement comes, it will give us a floor above which individual member states may decide to have higher levels of environmental standards.  My view is certainly that this would be a good thing.  I appreciate that we are talking about companies, jobs, and profits to reinvest in the economy, but we are also talking about our ecosystem and its future viability.  If I am ever asked to make a choice between adhering to Single Market principles or doing something good for the environment, I intuitively favour the latter, even if I do not know the finer scientific details with regard to where I rest on the question.<\/p> <p>  I will get back to the legislation because I have a couple of specific questions for everybody and I am genuinely interested to hear people's views.  Head 4 of the Bill deals with exceptions.  We had an interesting conversation with the officials when we were looking at the exceptions.  Some of the exceptions seem to be eminently sensible, such as products for medical or veterinary use and so on, but there was one at which I was surprised.  The heads of the Bill refer to \"creams, lotions or gels containing plastic microbeads designed, manufactured and sold solely for the purposes of application to the surface of a person&rsquo;s skin to protect it from the harmful effects of solar ultraviolet radiation\".  When we questioned the officials, they said that there are no products available on the Irish market that fulfil that function and which contain microbeads or microplastics.  It seemed odd that this would be included in the exceptions.  As microbeads do not add anything to the medical value of sun tan lotions and are purely cosmetic, it seems odd that we would open it up or create an incentive for people to add them to such products.  I would like the views of both the industry representatives and the scientists here on that exception.  Do they have any other comments on the exceptions generally?  Most of them seem sensible but that one stood out as a little bit odd.<\/p> <p>  Head 13 deals with the penalties.  The Chairman is right that there are a number of penalties, including a low-level, class A fine of up to &euro;5,000 and up to six months' imprisonment.  The penalty on court indictment is a fine of up to &euro;3 million and up to two years' imprisonment.  I presume the witnesses' concern is that the first one is likely to be used more often in respect of breaches.  Are they saying that the summary penalty is too low?  Are there examples of other penalties at a summary level, rather than involving going to court, that are at a higher level?  Will the witnesses elaborate on that?  It is important that there is a third sanction, which is that individual members of a board of directors can be held accountable.  This is a power the EPA has in enforcing waste management regulations and so on.<\/p><p>If the witnesses have specific concerns about that, I would be interested in hearing them.<\/p><p> I have a query about Ms Dean's reference to the fact that European industry is on track to achieve a 100% phasing out of plastic microbeads by 2020.  This point has been well made.  She seemed to suggest in the final paragraph of her presentation that she is concerned that the Bill, as drafted, will remove many products from the Irish market until those products are reformulated.  She pointed out that: \"The business and consumer impacts in the general scheme, however, do not take this into account.\"  On the one hand, she seems to be saying that by 2020, which is around the time that this legislation, if passed, will be fully enacted and imposed on Irish industry, there will have been a 100% withdrawal of microplastics or microbeads from the products in which her industry is involved.  On the other hand, she seems to be saying that she still has concerns.  Am I misunderstanding what she is saying?  Are there certain categories of products which are still being produced or sold in the Irish market that will not be included in the 100% phasing out of microbeads?  Given that this legislation, if passed, will not come into effect until next year, what is the nature of Ms Dean's concern?  I want to understand her position fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#S00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549969200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked three questions I was going to ask.

While those of us in the industry are very supportive of this legislation from an environmental impact perspective, we have some concerns about the definition.  This is something we have highlighted with the Department.  The point I would like to make about the definition of a microbead used in the text - \"synthetic water-insoluble polymer\" - is that all plastics are polymers but not all polymers are plastics.  Therefore, the definition needs to be refined and aligned with other legislation, including that in the UK and pending legislation in Northern Ireland.  We have not done any research on the impact on products of the proposed definition that is used in the general scheme.  We are saying that the definition of microbead and the scope of that definition should be refined.<\/p> <p>  Many of the cosmetics companies here are SMEs.  When we surveyed those companies in 2015, they said they were not adding any microbeads into their products anyway.  We have no evidence at this stage that they have been introduced into Irish products.  Any international companies that have said they have microbeads in their products are phasing them out.

The members have raised the issue of transparency and I will address that.  I will release to the committee the Cosmetics Europe submission to the ECHA from when we first started to engage with agency  That submission contains some detailed analyses of polymer materials that we consider to be plastic and some we do not.  There is also some detail around the questions on the formulations.  I agree that it is important to be transparent, and we, in the industry, lobbied on the single-use plastic directive.  That submission might help the committee address those issues.  Some polymers, for example, are liquid or solid in form depending on the stage of the process they are at.  Liquid polymers are generally not considered as problematic in this context as the solid polymers.  We regard the plastic polymers as being the centre of the issue.<\/p> <p>  I turn to the original question on the scope and what would be covered.  One needs to think about this in terms of the definition and the function.  Our voluntary recommendation talked about exfoliating and cleansing functions.  There is a small volume of microbeads in rinse-off products, which are not necessarily used for exfoliating and cleansing.  The quantity is small and, as a fraction of the overall microplastic problem, it is infinitesimally small.  Nonetheless, if one uses the definition without limiting the regulation to exfoliating and cleansing, one will capture microbeads that are in rinse-off products, which are not captured in the US legislation or the current French legislation.  They are, however, captured in the UK legislation.  I urge the committee to consider the UK legislation as a model.  Aligning with the UK legislation makes a degree of economic sense because the UK is currently a major trading partner, although that is turning into a particularly unpleasant subject.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Chave"},{"type":"speech","time":1549969200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>How many days left?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#U00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549969200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>One can, therefore, protect the trade element.  There is no doubt about it, if Ireland goes out on a limb, it will cause problems in trade within the EU and with the US and so on.  Ireland probably does not want to do that.

While there would probably need to be a lot of reformulation, we will just take that on the chin and do it.  Beyond that one can get into problems, and not just with trade.  There would also be the sheer cost of having to reformulate thousands and thousands of products.  When I release our ECHA submission to the committee, the members will see an analysis of different scenarios in which polymers could be restricted - not just microplastics - and what that would mean for reformulations and the impacts on industry.<\/p> <p>  In a nutshell, I urge the committee to align with the UK for the time being.

The reason I believe Ireland should align with the UK legislation at a maximum is that it would preserve the trade position.  When the ECHA restriction is in place, the position with regard to those trade elements inside the European Union is that all the bets are off because that is the new standard.  The way ECHA is going is frankly quite radical if we look at the additional proposals from the agency.  These are likely to go beyond the ECHA legislation.  I will offer one example.  Committee members may be aware of a polymer called styrene-acrylic coating, which is used to pacify some liquids.  When I buy a shampoo, the liquid is not clear because there is material in it to make it not clear - to make it opaque.  Hence, we use the term \"to pacify\".  I am not a polymer scientist but such people can have a legitimate debate about whether that material actually meets the definition of plastic and is thus problematic in this context.  It is highly likely that ECHA will maintain that it is and will regulate the material.  I may be wrong but I think that is likely.  If so, that would go beyond the UK legislation because it does not deal with that particular issue.  While the Department may go forward and put into place legislation in Ireland, it is quite possible that in some, but not all, respects what comes out of the ECHA process may go beyond that in two ways.  The first is that it will cover more sectors whereas the Department is limiting the sectors in this legislation.  The second is that it may address more materials than those currently covered in the national legislation.

We have the most sophisticated regulation of our industry on the globe.  Manufacturers are obliged to ensure the safety of their products when they put them on the market.  That is something they cannot ignore.  I think our colleagues would agree that the idea of toxicity in this context is quite controversial because it is being considered by the ECHA as it is part of its mission.  While we can see the issue of marine litter, the question of toxicity is more complex.  If the committee is interested in the subject, I encourage it to keep an eye on the analysis going through the ECHA which is undertaking a systematic review of all of the evidence in that space.  It is something in which our colleagues in GMIT will be taking a strong interest, too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#W00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Chave"},{"type":"speech","time":1549969200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Do the delegates have further comments to add?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#W00900","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1549969200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>There are industry talks about being self-regulating and phasing out 75%, but it would be self-surveyed and, as far as I am aware, there would be no independent research to back it up.

I sometimes worry a little about the kind of legislation there is in place in Ireland.  Some think that because Ireland has legislated for cosmetics, it has dealt with microplastics.  I suggest it has not even begun to deal with microplastics by legislating for cosmetics.  This problem is much bigger than the cosmetics and personal care industry which is an extremely small part of it and getting smaller.  To go back to a previous question, ours is the only industry that has taken voluntary action in this space.  I do not know of any other that has done so.  The broader question of how industry works to address big issues such as plastic marine litter will need to be addressed, regardless of whether this legislation goes ahead.  That is a much bigger project.  I do not mean to cast aspersions on what the committee is doing, which I understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019021200002#W01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Chave","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549969200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I want to make it clear that this is not the only Bill of this kind that is being advanced.  This is not the only debate about plastics that the Houses are having.  We are all very clear on the fact that this legislation is a small piece of a larger approach.  As it is the first Bill in this sphere, it sets the tone.  If it is passed with the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, it will demonstrate that the country is willing to show leadership on this and all of the other issues.  We are equally as focused on the big issue of single-use plastics which does not fall within the remit of this committee but within that of another.
