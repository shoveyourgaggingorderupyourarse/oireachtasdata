In a clear and decisive manner, the people, through the referendum, have voted for change - for new laws which will end the cruel inflexibility of the eighth amendment.  The people have given the Oireachtas the mandate and the obligation to legislate for a new approach, one that trusts women and their doctors.<\/p>  <p>  Civic society was powerful in this referendum.  Led by women, the Together for Yes campaign ensured that the voices of women remained central to the debate and they provided an immense service to democracy.  The Oireachtas committee, made up of all parties in this House, deserves particular credit for its fact-based, impartial approach to the issue and the comprehensive nature of its evidence gathering and analysis.  It now comes back to the Oireachtas to respond promptly, proactively and positively to the decision of the people.<\/p>  <p>  I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could outline the timescale for the introduction of the legislation and its passage through the Oireachtas.

They were debated at length during the referendum campaign.  It was very transparent and no one can argue otherwise.<\/p> <p> In addition, many women will require this new legal framework urgently.  Some nine women a day travel to the United Kingdom and three a day take an abortion pill.  We also have the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities to deal with.  There is an urgency to this matter for women in crisis pregnancies.  We no longer want women travelling to the United Kingdom on those lonely, isolated journeys.  We no longer want women taking the abortion pill in isolation without medical supervision or care.  Have the Government and Taoiseach considered, in the context of the new legal framework that will emerge, allowing women in Northern Ireland to avail of the services that will be enabled in the Republic as a result of the passage of the legislation?  Has giving them access to our GP services and hospitals been considered?  We already have established links with the health services in Northern Ireland in respect of other areas.<\/p> <p> In terms of consultation with the medical profession, will the Taoiseach outline whether any discussions have taken place with representatives of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and other groups on this issue recently?

A very clear majority, more than two thirds of Irish people, voted to amend our Constitution, to remove the eighth amendment and to put a new clause into our Constitution;13 new words that enable us to legislate for abortion in Ireland so that it is legal, safe and, it is to be hoped, rare.  It was a resounding result and credit for this result should be given to many different people.  I would particularly like to mention the members of the Citizens' Assembly under the chairmanship of Ms Justice Laffoy.  They met weekend after weekend to study the issues and come up with proposals.  It is interesting that they voted for those proposals by almost the exact same margin as was the result of the referendum, so I do not think anyone can argue against the Citizens' Assembly's representative characteristics.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to mention the all-party committee under the chairmanship of Senator Catherine Noone, the Members of this House and the other House who took part in this campaign on all sides, the civil society campaign led by Together for Yes and others, and especially those very brave women and men who told their individual stories.  By opening their hearts they caused others to open their minds.  That was the crucial thing that changed people's minds over the last number of years.  I agree that this change in our society did not just happen in the last few weeks.  Perhaps it happened quite some time ago and the result we had at the weekend was just a reflection of that.<\/p>  <p>  It is now our job, as a Government and an Oireachtas, to give effect to the people's decision.  That involves a few things.  It involves new law to repeal some existing legislation and bringing in new legislation to regulate for the termination of pregnancies in Ireland.  It also involves the development of clinical guidelines by GPs, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  It will also require the licensing and regulation of some medicines which will need to be done by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  There are three discrete pieces of work that have to be done.  One of them falls to us while the others fall to others.  <\/p>  <p>  Meetings on the clinical guidelines involving the Department of Health and the various colleges and bodies that represent doctors are happening today.  There had been initial discussions prior to the referendum but obviously nobody wanted to prejudge the result so detailed discussions really only begin now.  The HPRA will also start its work.  When it comes to legislation, it is the view of Government that we want to legislate as soon and as quickly as possible.  We also want to make sure that we do not rush the process either because there are people who do not accept the result of the weekend and who may challenge the referendum itself in the coming days and who may wish to challenge the legislation in the months and years ahead once we pass it.<\/p><p>It is important that we act with haste but not too much haste that we put through bad legislation.  I think everyone will agree with that sentiment.  The Minister for Health brought a memo to the Cabinet this morning.  The Cabinet authorised him to work with the Attorney General to begin the drafting of detailed legislation right away as a priority, with a view to having it in this House before the summer recess.  We are agreeable to the Deputy's suggestion that the D&aacute;il term be extended into the recess, if necessary, to allow this matter alone to be legislated for and get through Second Stage before we rise for the summer, thereby allowing the select committee to consider the legislation during the recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900004#B00200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527599700,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I asked the Taoiseach about women from Northern Ireland who might wish to avail of services in the Republic under the new legal framework that would inevitably result from the decision made by the people last Friday.

He might indicate whether there was any scenario planning.  I accept that people had to wait for a result, but surely some priority work on the legislation was undertaken on the basis of what was likely to happen.  I would like to make an important point to the Taoiseach.  I know a thing or two about the health service and stakeholders.  I accept that people have their jobs to do, but we need to make it clear to the stakeholders that they cannot second-guess the decision of the people.  Equally, they cannot add caveats to it on the licensing side or with regard to clinical guidelines.  The people's decision is very clear.

A lot of work was put into the general scheme that was published in March.  The planning at the time will make it much easier for the Department of Health and the Attorney General to produce the actual legislation.  The amount of work done and planning in the development of the general scheme means that it will be done in weeks, whereas ordinarily it would have taken months.  We can examine the position on women from Northern Ireland.  My initial impression is that it will be treated like a normal health service.  It is already the case that women who reside in Northern Ireland and women who are Irish citizens can travel to Ireland to avail of healthcare.  There are people on the Northern side of the Border whose GPs are south of the Border.  People from Northern Ireland already come to hospitals here for healthcare.  I imagine it will be treated as a normal part of the health service in the normal way.  We also need to work on the detail of that aspect.  I have mentioned that a number of things need to be done.  It is not just a question of legislating in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Clinical guidelines will also be needed.  It will be necessary to regulate and license the new medicines.  We are still anticipating that even with the best intentions, it will be the end of the year - 1 January 2019 - before we give full effect to the will of the people.

We voted overwhelmingly to remove the eighth amendment from the Constitution.  We said in a strong and unified voice that we would no longer tolerate Irish women being treated as second-class citizens.  We said we trusted women to make the best decisions on their pregnancies and healthcare.  We demonstrated the instinctive compassion of the people.  We said loudly that we were no longer willing to stand over a system that made exiles of women in crisis.  The people led and the politicians followed.  By voting \"Yes\", the people showed us their vision of what they wanted their country to be - progressive, equal, fair and kind.

Our attention as elected representatives now turns to the job of enacting legislation.  It is crucial that we get this done without delay and that we get it right.  I appreciate that there are complexities in meeting the three objectives of passing sound legislation, drafting and agreeing clinical guidelines and enacting medical regulations.  This work needs to all happen in tandem.  We have to remember that between now and the enactment of legislation, women in crisis will still face the same challenges they did before the referendum was passed.  In the interim, as we await the legislation, a positive and necessary step is the immediate repeal of the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995, the abortion information Act.  That would allow doctors to make referrals for women and to confer with doctors outside the jurisdiction about the care of women who will still be forced to travel for terminations.  Repeal of this Act would at least offer women some degree of support and confidence.  By working together constructively, we can pass the necessary legislation promptly.  I hope every Member of the Oireachtas will act constructively and will recognise the decision of the people.  The people have played their part and now it is up to us as legislators to play ours.  <\/p> <p> Given the timeframe the Taoiseach has outlined, will he commit to working with us to ensure the 1995 abortion information Act is repealed immediately?

The likely effect of it would be to delay the main piece of legislation.  This is the nature of these things.  If we do this in a piecemeal manner, the big piece giving effect to what the people actually said at the weekend is the bit that will be delayed.  I know there are numerous suggestions at the moment for piecemeal legislation.  The Deputy has proposed something on information and the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, and others have proposed that too.

That situation will pertain until the law is changed which the Taoiseach envisages to be early next year.  We cannot leave women in the impossible situation that they leave by boat or plane with a telephone number in their pockets without their medical files.  That is an intolerable situation.  I am suggesting as a mitigation - it is nothing more than that &ndash; that we ensure, at a minimum, that women or girls who still have to make the journey can do so with the advice, the care and the assurance of their doctors with their medical files in a joined-up and caring way.

The credit lies with the thousands, mostly women, who campaigned long and hard for the result and those who told their stories bravely and often for the first time.  It lies with those in Together for Yes, again run by women, who, despite many efforts to throw them off course, showed courage in pursuing their campaign strategy and sticking to the core message of care, compassion and change.

The assembly and its predecessor, the Constitutional Convention, have proved beyond doubt their worth.  That model should be used again to look at issues of complexity and importance for the country and its people.  The future patronage and control of the education system is one such issue.  The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector during the term of the last Government was an important step but few schools have since been divested.  The most recent controversy over enrolment in Educate Together schools shows the demand for non-denominational education.

When we served in government together, the convention was included in the programme for Government agreed to in 2011.  None of us really knew how it would work out, but we can now stand over the fact that the assemblies were representative of the public.  Moreover, they gave issues real and detailed consideration and thus allowed us to move on in many ways.  They have been very helpful to the political system in helping us to understand what the opinion of the public would be once fully informed of all the issues.  The Constitutional Convention helped to give rise to the referendum on marriage equality three years ago.  The Citizens' Assembly gave rise not only to the referendum on the eighth amendment but also to the general scheme of the Bill that we published before the referendum.<\/p>  <p>  The Constitutional Convention looked at other things, including ageing and the issue of climate change.  One of the issues we have discussed in government is potentially asking a new citizens' assembly to look at the wider issues of gender equality.  We know, for example, that much good work has been done on issues such as domestic violence, as evident from the domestic violence legislation going through the Houses.  There is work to be done on other issues, for example, the gender pay gap, greater equality in pensions and having far higher participation of women on company boards.  For the first time, some 52% of the people appointed to state boards last year were women, but when we look across the corporate sector, we see it is not replicated.  Fewer than 20% of the members of boards of listed corporations are women.  One of the things we are considering is the next question we will put to the Citizens' Assembly.  The question will look at the wider picture of equality between men and women and ask the assembly to come up with a set of proposals to allow us to follow through in many ways on the result of the referendum and deliver equality between men and women in other areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900008#F00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527600900,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I agree with the Taoiseach 100% on the value of both the Constitutional Convention and the Citizens' Assembly.

The Constitutional Convention made other recommendations, including lowering the age at which a person could become President, which the people decided to reject.  We should not necessarily assume that everything these assemblies or conventions come up with will be approved by the people.  Following through on a Citizens' Assembly's proposal, we will have a referendum next year on extending the right to vote in presidential elections to all Irish citizens, including those living in the North and across the world.  We want to have a referendum on that at probably the same time as next year's local and European elections.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has a policy on school patronage.  We believe in diversity and choice in education and educational patronage.  My view is that diversity should include the Catholic Church and other churches and religions whereas some would argue for a purely secular education system.  There is room in our education system for different forms of patronage, including the Church of Ireland, the Catholic Church, other religions, Educate Together and, of course, Gaelscoileanna.  I am not entirely convinced we should move from a model of diversity to one in which everything is exactly the same.  That is something that could be considered.  We have committed already to an additional 400 multidenominational and non-denominational schools by 2030.  We also have a system now to survey parents on the patronage of new schools.  In my own area, people in Tyrrelstown decided they wanted a Catholic secondary school whereas in another part of the constituency, they decided they wanted an Educate Together.

They want to stay in the places they were born and reared.  All these people would provide a site for a demountable home.  Councillor Johnny Healy-Rae said at last Monday's meeting of Kerry County Council that these people will only leave their home places in a hearse.  That is a fact.  These units have always provided comfort, a bit of heat, security, and safety from the elements and vermin and they still can.  As to rural cottages, only three have been built in Kerry in the last nine years.  From 2016 to 2021, ten are to be built.  However, there are 35 to 40 more people on the waiting list for these rural cottages.  These people will provide a site of their own.  They want to live near their parents and their family and to work on their farms but the Department has agreed to fund only ten of these up to 2021.  Do we have any funding for housing?  If the Government does not, I ask the Taoiseach to spell that out.  We would all understand.<\/p><p>Clearly, these people are providing almost half the cost of housing themselves.

Is this aligned with the famous Project Ireland 2040 where planning permission will only be granted in rural areas if the development does not detract from the greater urban areas?  For instance, Kerry County Council granted permission to a person to build a house on his own place, being a favoured nephew, and it was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la by one of these serial objectors.

That is a fact.<\/p> <p> These rural cottages almost always end up costing tenants, as they have almost always bought them because they are on their own land and they do not like to see anyone else coming into their own land.  It is only a loan, as the houses have been built to standard, and when the tenants have got on their feet, they have bought them out.<\/p> <p> Is the Government trying to move all the people into Dublin or into the urban areas?  That is what I am asking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900009#G00500","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527601500,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I am afraid I cannot comment in great detail about the precise situation in the Deputy's county as I am not fully briefed on it.  The Deputy might elaborate on demountable homes.  It is not a term I am familiar with, but perhaps one with which I should be.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the broader picture, across Ireland 18,000 homes have commenced construction in the past year.  That is a significant increase.  We had a period of seven years during which almost no new homes were built in Ireland because the Government could not afford to build social housing and because the banks and construction sector were on the floor.  We are very much playing catch-up.  We have much to catch up on, but with 18,000 new homes having commenced construction in the past year, we are now building more new homes in Ireland than at any point in seven years.  We need to ramp that up to 25,000 next year and 35,000 the following year.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, we added 7,000 new homes to our social housing stock through different mechanisms, including direct build, approved housing bodies, leases and voids, and we will add almost another 8,000 this year.  We are ramping that up again and increasing the supply of social housing.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned funding.  Specifically, &euro;6 billion is being provided for investment in housing between now and 2021.  That is an enormous investment in housing between now and 2021.  It will deliver 110,000 extra social housing units for people to live in between now and 2021.  That is a huge uplift in investment.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, as the Deputy will be aware, under Project Ireland 2040 we have set out a plan for the nation.  It is a plan for a country with 1 million more people living here by 2040, with most of that growth happening outside of Dublin, the other cities growing twice as fast as Dublin and an extra 200,000 people living in rural Ireland.  Indeed tomorrow, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, will announce further details of the &euro;1 billion rural regeneration fund which will be deployed over the next decade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900010#H00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1527601500,"counter":31,"content":"<p>It is clear the Taoiseach has no understanding of what I am talking about.  At last Monday's meeting, Councillor Johnny Healy-Rae got a reply that the local authority must clearly demonstrate that the proposed demountable unit is required on foot of a genuine emergency - either a fire or a flood.  I must point out to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government that there are many people who reach the age of 60, or maybe even older, whose house has fallen into disrepair.  They will not leave the place where they were born and reared.  All they are asking for is a demountable home to placed on a site, and even connected to their own septic tank.  It is very clear.

A sum of &euro;6 billion is allocated in Project Ireland 2040 for investment in social housing over the next ten years.  Investment in social housing is ramping up dramatically.  To give the Deputy a rough idea of the figures, there were 657 direct builds.  That increased to 2,434 last year.  There were 1,250 acquisitions last year.  There were 600 leases last year with more ambitious targets again for this year.  There is a lot of money being invested in social housing, with &euro;6 billion set aside for the next ten years.  It is up to local authorities to come forward with proposals to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.

One is that a message must be sent to women that they will not be penalised or criminalised, for example, the five women who will try to take abortion pills today.  An instruction needs to be sent to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, not to intercept those pills.  They are prescribed by a doctor, which is the justification given by the HPRA.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue is the suggestion that women would potentially have to attend a GP twice and pay &euro;300 to access an abortion.  I hope that these are wild rumours.  This should be no different to any other medical situation where one visit for a consultation and a prescription is all that is required.  Having to pay &euro;300 for this procedure will be extremely prohibitive for working women and lower paid women who do not have medical cards.  If that was to be the case the women may as well resort to the tele-medicine websites that can provide the service for &euro;90.

N&iacute;l an m&eacute;id cainte n&oacute; an m&eacute;id teagmh&aacute;la anois idir muintir na Gaeltachta agus &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute;.

T&aacute; ceapach&aacute;in polaiti&uacute;la i gceist ag an Rialtas seo anois.  T&aacute; s&eacute; dochreidte.

N&iacute;l m&eacute; s&aacute;sta go bhfuil an chumhacht agus an tionchar cu&iacute; aige chun seasamh suas don Ghaeilge n&aacute; do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute;im ag iarraidh anois go mbeidh an Rialtas s&aacute;sta tiomp&uacute; ar an rud seo agus taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo.  Rud simpl&iacute; at&aacute; i gceist.  Nuair a bheadh bord &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta ainmnithe, bheadh muintir na Gaeltachta in ann a cuid v&oacute;ta&iacute; a chur chuig an mbord sin.

It was made by 1,429,981 people who came out with hope in their hearts to vote for compassion in our Constitution.  As a country we said to Irish women, we trust you and we respect your choices about your healthcare.  More people voted on Friday to remove the eighth amendment than the combined number of people who voted on both sides in 1983.  It was, therefore, a resounding act of democracy.  Thirty-five years ago, the 1983 referendum was described on the front pages of the newspapers as having split our country into two nations - urban versus rural, Dublin, which voted against the amendment, against the rest of the country.  Today we are not a divided country.  We do not have red states and blue states.  Men and women from all regions and all social classes, rural Ireland and urban Ireland and almost all age groups voted yes.<\/p>  <p>  In this Oireachtas and beyond, there are women and men from all political parties and none who campaigned and led on this issue for many years.  Some campaigned for decades and opposed the eighth amendment before it was inserted into our Constitution, showing great courage when it was easier to comply.  We owe a debt of gratitude to these people.  We also owe a debt to the hundreds and thousands of people who went out canvassing, often for the first time, to try to open hearts and change minds.  I hope they will remember that their movement was watched by the entire world and that they will remain engaged in politics because there is much, much more to do.  There is always more to do.<\/p>  <p>  Most of all, we owe a debt of gratitude to those who shared their personal stories in recent weeks and months, women and men who opened their hearts and so enabled others to open their minds.  We were moved by their searing experiences and we were determined to ensure that their stories were not shared in vain.  Saturday's result shows that we heard what they had to say loud and clear.  The days of cold, hard judgment, which cast a long shadow in this country, are banished to the past.  To younger women and men we said, this is your country and one you can be proud of.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's past is a foreign country; we did things differently there.  Now let us look to the future.  In advance of the referendum, the Government published the general scheme of the Bill so that people would know what they were voting for.  This morning the Minister for Health received approval from Cabinet to start drafting this legislation formally and as a priority.  However, it is not just about legislation and new laws.  There are a number of other items that we also need, including the development of clinical guidelines for doctors written by the medical colleges and institutions, and also the regulation and licensing of certain medicines.  All things going to plan, we will proceed with the drafting of the new laws required and bring the legislation into the Oireachtas before the summer recess.  Our speed will be tempered only by our determination to get this right, to ensure a safe service for women and ensure there are no flaws in the legislation that would open it up to legal challenge and delay.  We are confident we can complete all this work before the end of the year and we look forward to working with Deputies and Senators from all sides to ensure we get this right.<\/p>  <p>  We also restate our promise that we want to do more to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and reduce the number of abortions further.  We want more sex education and wider availability of contraception and emergency contraception.  Abortion rates are already falling and teenage pregnancies are at their lowest since the 1960s because of them.  The Government will continue to improve access to sexual health and education to reduce crisis pregnancies and abortions further in the year ahead, so that they become rare.<\/p><p> We want to continue to make Ireland a better place in which to raise a family.  We have started on this, with two years of free preschool now guaranteed to every child, free GP visits for young children, subsidised child care, paid paternity leave, as well as increases in the working family payment and home carer's tax credit for two years in a row.  We will do more because we want Ireland to be one of the best places in the world in which to raise a family - families in their many forms.<\/p> <p> All weekend I found myself reflecting on the referendum result and what the scale of the victory meant.  It demonstrates that politics can bring about change and that democracy does work.  On Saturday I quoted one of my favourite poets, Maya Angelou, because her whole life reminds us of how one can transform the agony of one's life experiences into a beautiful call for equality before the law, tolerance and respect.  Saturday's result was such a call.  It is a call which has resounded around the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900020#S00600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527607500,"counter":201,"content":"<p>The outcome of the referendum has been as clear and decisive as it could possibly have been.  There is no doubt about what we must do.  With an overwhelming majority, the people have given the Oireachtas the right and the duty to legislate quickly for a new approach, founded on the core principle of trusting women and their doctors.<\/p>  <p>  It is an historic change but not one which came about easily.  It is a revolutionary moment fundamentally based on the tireless, passionate and loud advocacy of active citizens.  This change could not have come about without the incredible bravery and dignity of women who came forward, both publicly and on a more personal level, to tell their stories about the cruel inflexibility of a system which had both judged them and denied them care.  I personally thank the women and men in many settings and all parts of the country who spoke to me about their experience of life under the eighth amendment.  From all ages and backgrounds, they were driven by a determination that what had happened to them should not be allowed to keep happening to others.<\/p>  <p>  The best part of the campaign was how the cause for change was led by the largest and most diverse civil society campaign ever assembled in the country.  Led by women and committed to keeping the voices of women central to the debate, the Together for Yes campaign, as well as the umbrella organisations which operated before the campaign, provided an immense service for our democracy.  I also acknowledge the tireless work of groups of doctors and nurses to ensure we had a fact-based debate capable of overcoming efforts to distort and manipulate public opinion.<\/p>  <p>  A key to the success of the referendum was a proposal which respected the evidence of what changes were required to address the clear failures of the eighth amendment.  The Citizens' Assembly had pointed in a general direction but proved that it was possible to ensure a well structured debate could allow people the space to question themselves and reach challenging conclusions.  It was the proposal of the joint Oireachtas committee which went before the people.  It showed just how much could be achieved when we worked together to try to find a consensus.  The chair of the committee, Senator Catherine Noone, carried out her role in an exemplary manner and was 100% correct in emphasising expertise over advocacy.  The tone of debate central to this being possible emerged from the debate on Deputy Clare Daly's Bill which directly began the process which led to the referendum.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal that there be a 12-week period was, for many, a risky decision.  However, there was no other way of dealing with the reality of how to end an inflexible and judgmental system.  It reflected both medical reality and the basic need to trust in the decisions of women.  The fact that the 12-weeks provision gained in support the more it was debated, as well as surviving an aggressive attempt to paint it as going too far, means that we now have real clarity on the principles the people wish to guide our legislation.  On a personal level, I acknowledge Deputies Billy Kelleher and Lisa Chambers and Senator Ned O'Sullivan who proposed the 12-weeks provision at the committee.  Given the urgency to end the current law, the clarity of both the result and the promised legislation, together with the all-party work which shaped the legislation, full and rapid enactment is our basic duty.  We will facilitate this in any way possible, including by having extra sittings.<\/p>  <p>  We also face a new challenge about how we discuss abortion in the new reality where the law is based on trust of women and medical professionals, rather than a constitutional prohibition.  There is no democratic country in the world where there is no ongoing debate about abortion.  Ireland will be no different.  People with strong conscientiously held beliefs must be able to speak.  Our democracy will be undermined if we deny their rights.  However, we must act to make sure the extreme tactics, seen particularly in America, have no place in Ireland.  Many of us have at different times been confronted by the extreme behaviour of a small minority.  They employ shock tactics and aggression to make their point.  This repelled parents during the campaign when they were forced to explain graphic images and extreme claims erected on posters outside hospitals, schools and many other places.  We must from the first moment protect women and medical professionals against the extreme radicalism seen elsewhere that tries to block the operation of democratically agreed policies.<\/p>  <p>  We also have to learn from the campaign to protect our democracy.  The Government's complacency about the abuse of online advertising was cruelly exposed.  The weakness of key elements of how we oversee referendums and elections is there for all to see.  We must act now and not wait until we see here the abuses unfortunately common in other countries.<\/p>  <p>  The people have had their say.  They looked at the evidence, engaged in a long debate and reached an absolutely clear decision.  They want change.  They want laws which end the inhuman inflexibility which was embodied in the eighth amendment.  They want us to trust the decisions of women and the medical professionals on whom they rely for care.  We have had a campaign dominated by the voices of women and stories which have challenged all of us to listen.  It is now up to us to act by rapidly and comprehensively implementing the people's decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900021#T00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1527607500,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Saturday was a momentous day for all the people of the State.  Ireland is changing and the old certainties are being challenged.  A new and better Ireland is emerging.  Saturday was a day when those who had been silenced demanded to be heard.

It was a day when a substantial majority said in a loud voice that we were compassionate, that we trusted women and that we wanted doctors to act free from the threat of criminal sanction.<\/p>  <p>  I thank and congratulate the Together for Yes group on a magnificent campaign.  I also acknowledge the doctors and lawyers who provided their expertise and experience and were listened to.

Their voices have been heard and can no longer be silenced by guilt or neglected by the Government.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Ireland is changing and this is evident in the vibrant \"Yes\" campaign headed by women and many young people.  I wish to thank them and mark their achievement.<\/p> <p> The need and the case for change to protect women and our lives is now unanswerable not only in this jurisdiction but throughout our island.  We need Irish law, Irish service provision and Irish regulation to keep our women safe.  It is unacceptable to those of us in the South that women and girls would buy abortion pills over the Internet and take them without medical supervision.  It is unacceptable to us that they may be fearful of seeking medical assistance should something go wrong due to the threat of criminal sanction.  It is equally unacceptable that any woman or girl in the North would be left in those situations.  It is completely unacceptable that any of these women or girls are criminalised or hauled before the courts.<\/p> <p> The referendum result tells us that Irish norms have changed, that the absolutist position on abortion as a black-and-white issue is gone and that people understand this now in all its complexity.  Even those who have a strong moral objection to abortion now understand that, in the complexity of life, women and their doctors have to be free to act, have to be afforded choice and have a right to choice.<\/p> <p> The imperative now is to act on the instruction of the people.  The result was overwhelmingly definitive, such that I have no doubt the message has been heard loud and clear by Government and all legislators.  The imperative comes from the fact that women must be protected.  Pregnancy, by definition, is time-sensitive.  Every week and every month we fail to enact the legislation, we put our women in the way of danger.  Consequently, we must act speedily.  We have a history of foot-dragging on the issue of abortion because it is considered sensitive and difficult - I acknowledge that it is.  However, if the referendum is to mean anything for legislators and the political system, it is that the days of delay are over and that the time for action is now.  Those of us in Sinn F&eacute;in recognise that imperative.  We maintain the Government cannot delay and must act to bring forward the legislation, and I understand the Government will do so.  We will work constructively and diligently with the Government on this matter.  We have no problem supporting special sittings during the summer months to ensure we get the legislation right and that we get it passed in a timely fashion.  Let us go forward together to ensure this is the first step in creating that new Ireland.  As this chapter in our journey to full equality closes, let us look forward to the next one with the same determination and solidarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900021#T00300","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527608100,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I said yesterday that for many people Saturday was a day of great excitement and that for some of us it was equally a day of relief.  Clearly, 35 years is a long time to wait to repeal a measure we opposed in the first place.  When I was in the Seanad in 1983 we came close to defeating the amendment.  I recognise that would not have stopped the referendum in 1983.  It would merely have delayed it but it might have afforded the time for reflection on what was being done.  I am mindful today of the strong clear reasoned arguments put forward then in the Seanad by Members, including Mary Robinson, Michael D. Higgins and Catherine McGuinness.  I am mindful of the courage of Dick Spring, Barry Desmond, Eileen Desmond and others in the D&aacute;il despite searing opposition from some.  Over the weekend I thought fondly of the late Monica Barnes, a champion of equality.  It is sad that she was not here to see a change she had worked so strongly to bring about for so many years.<\/p>  <p>  Lessons were learned from that rushed and politically damaging episode, when a small minority bullied the two largest parties into proposing an amendment that the then Taoiseach described as dangerous and that was opposed by the then Attorney General.  Those were truly desperate days.  The contrast with the process engaged in by this D&aacute;il could not be more marked.  A deliberative Citizens' Assembly, chaired by Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, provided a platform and a calm atmosphere for all the issues to be fully addressed and for all arguments to be heard.  This was followed by the diligent work of the all-party committee ably chaired by Senator Catherine Noone.  The committee arrived at a set of proposals that attracted broad cross-party support.  We subsequently learned those proposals attracted the support of the people as well.<\/p>  <p>  Yet, the seeds of change were sown many years ago.  In 1992, the Supreme Court laid bare the contradictions inherent in the eighth amendment.  If the evidence of turning a blind eye to the issue of abortion was not obvious enough, the people formally enacted provisions in our Constitution in 1992 to facilitate information to be provided on abortion and for women to travel for abortion but not to have abortions here.  The issue was returned to in 2002 when a further effort was made to remove the grounds of suicide and reverse the Supreme Court decision.  That effort too was defeated by the people.<\/p>  <p>  Yet, it was the tragic death of Savita that radically changed things.  It showed the cowardice of our political system, which had failed to show the leadership that had been called for over many years.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was among the most difficult tranches of legislation enacted by the last Government.  It was pursued line by line and fought detail by detail.  It is not right to say Savita did not die in vain &ndash; she did.  She should not have died.  Nothing can change that.  Yet, people were so horrified by the reality created by the medical-legal environment of the eighth amendment and the tragic way it contributed to the untimely death of Savita that a grassroots movement was sparked throughout Ireland.  That led to the repeal.  It opened the doors for hundreds of women to tell their stories and shine a light on the pain that the eighth amendment had inflicted.  The result on Saturday shows how conclusively the people can make a decision on these matters.  I hope it finally draws a line under decades of struggle.<\/p>  <p>  Abortion will always remain a divisive issue but the scale of the vote - two thirds of the electorate voted \"Yes\" - has definitively changed the context of how terminations of pregnancy can and must be considered in Ireland.  What was once a taboo subject is now openly discussed.<\/p>  <p>  For 35 years we have denied something essential to Irish women.  We have denied them security and protection at crucial points in their lives.  We have denied them dignity too.  Saturday was a levelling day for them.  Our job now, as others have said, is to quickly implement the legislation and right this historical wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900022#U00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1527608100,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Deputies Ruth Coppinger and Br&iacute;d Smith will share five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900022#U00300","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1527608100,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I want to invoke the name of Savita, as others have, as well as the Citizens' Assembly.  There is no doubt that only for the strong pro-choice message that the Citizens' Assembly delivered politicians in here would not have gone as far as they were forced to go.  We should register who delivered the \"Yes\" given the gender-quake and youth-quake that took place on Friday.  Among female 18 to 24 year olds there was a 94% increase in voting compared to the 2016 general election.  There was an increase in women voting in every age and category but it was particularly evident among young people.  They persuaded others and other generations to fall in with a new message.<\/p>  <p>  I never doubted we could have this resounding message.  The battle was not winning the referendum; the battle was getting a referendum granted from the D&aacute;il over the past five years.  Once it got into the hands of ordinary people I had faith that we could persuade them why this change was necessary.  There is a danger that we could see a re-writing of history to the effect that politicians going on a journey delivered this change.  Actually, it derives from the grassroots movement that has built up, especially since the death of Savita.<\/p><p>It was not a quiet revolution, as the Taoiseach informed the world, it was a noisy and boisterous one.  People went on strike, marched and took civil disobedience actions in a relentless fashion to force the issue onto the political agenda.  The socialist left in the D&aacute;il was the only reflection of the movement taking place for a long time and until recently.  The Taoiseach has now appealed to people to stay involved, albeit it could be a dangerous message for him to give out.  I agree that people should stay mobilised until we win free contraception and proper and objective sex education.  The Solidarity Bill should now be progressed.  There are also other issues relating to the separation of church and State.<\/p> <p> What about the housing crisis?  I appeal to people to stay involved to tackle those issues and to continue to mobilise to call the Government out in the same way we did on repeal.  I will be going to the North on Thursday to support the abortion pill bus being organised by ROSA.  The next step is to legalise abortion in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900022#U00400","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527608700,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Having been there in 1983, I remember that the eighth amendment was seen very much as a line in the sand for the deeply conservative and darkly religious regime which had dominated this country since the foundation of the State.  Since 1983, we have learned a great deal with the exposure of all of the scandals around the treatment of women and children in institutions like the Magdalen laundries and the Tuam mother and baby home.  However, we still have a great deal to learn about how we treat women's health.  We need to bring closure quickly to the questions of symphisiotomy and the cervical cancer scandal.  That line in the sand is gone for the old conservative religious dogma of this country and the tide is gushing in.<\/p>  <p>  The D&aacute;il needs to look seriously over the next period at the question of the separation of church and State.  Yesterday, I was contacted by a couple from Limerick who spoke to me after I tabled the &euro;1 Bill to decriminalise the abortion pill in 2016.  In 2016, they had just returned from Liverpool with their little baby girl in a box in the back of the car.  They were extraordinarily sad but wanted to thank all of the Deputies in the D&aacute;il who supported repeal.  Since 2016, they have had a baby who is now four months old.  They had decided they were not going to have any more children because they might be put through the trauma of being exiled from their own country.  They have now decided to try again.  To those who were telling us we were baby-killers, the impact of the eighth amendment on women's health has been lifted and people can see what are the real issues in maternity care.<\/p>  <p>  The key issue in this debate was choice.  Consistently, 62% of the people said women should be given a choice.  Now that they have a choice, they need to be able to choose, not only to control the number of children they have and the number of pregnancies they are able to terminate, but to be able to say they want a family.  For that, they need a home, education and health care.  The Government has failed miserably to provide tens of thousands of people with that choice.  It is a serious economic, social and political issue which we need to address together as a community which has fought and won this magnificent referendum in big numbers.  We need to get real choice for all women of all classes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900023#V00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1527608700,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Yesterday, we were walking across Dublin and we met a Donegal man on a bicycle who was mad to talk.  He said abortion had been an issue all his adult life and he could not believe it was over.  He said he never wanted to hear the word again.  I felt an enormous sympathy.  What he said summed up exactly the way I felt about it myself.  For so many, the weekend's vote was like an enormous weight being lifted.  A ball and chain that dogged us all our adult lives was finally gone.  I cannot believe that I am 50 years of age and it has taken this long.  It has taken my daughter to come home for her first vote to get us here.  For so many women, it represented so much.  It is almost like society atoning for everything it has done to women in this country; atoning for how we stigmatised women faced with crisis pregnancies, the Magdalen laundries, the mother and baby homes, the shaming, the forced adoptions and the robbed identities about which we will hear later this afternoon.  It still goes on.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest sentiment behind the \"Yes\" vote and the question people asked most often was \"Who am I to judge?\".  They said it was not their decision.  So many people in our society have acknowledged that life is hard and that there are choices a lot of people have to make, including today, which they would really rather never having to make.  It is not easy to parent alone in this State.  It is not easy to raise a child or children with disabilities with the lack of support that is there.  It is not easy to find out one is pregnant to a violent man.  It is not easy, of course, to hear that one's much-wanted pregnancy has a fatal anomaly which is incompatible with life.  As a society, we were never going to be able to end that pain, but we could make sure we did not add to it.<\/p>  <p>  When Deputies Mick Wallace, Joan Collins and I introduced our legislation in 2012, only 20 Deputies voted with us.  At that time, four incredible women went on the \"Late Late Show\".  It was the first time people in this State openly identified themselves as having travelled for terminations.  They were Amanda, Arlette, Jenny and Ruth who later founded the group Terminations for Medical Reasons.  Is it not appalling that they and their colleagues had to lay bare their most appalling pain and tragedy in order to turn that into a social movement which changed history?  They should not have had to do that.  I am in awe of them and all of their colleagues who took part in the campaign.  When we assembled here and Deputy Wallace moved the legislation on fatal foetal abnormalities, those women were in the Gallery.  Afterwards, their hearts were broken that the House had voted against them again.  There were people who travelled that day and there is probably someone who is travelling today also.  We should not have compounded their pain but the fact that they stepped forward was huge.<\/p>  <p>  It was not the beginning of the campaign.  Some rewriting has taken place in that regard.  However, it was the beginning of the final phase.  We had the founding then of the abortion rights campaign and the first march for choice, which was the first openly pro-choice activity in the State.  It was only after the march that, sadly, Savita died and the move to repeal gained a greater urgency.  Many people came on board the repeal movement then and I am delighted they did.  However, we should remember the time before the glory days when it was the Well Woman Centre, the Irish Family Planning Association and the Abortion Support Network in the UK which took in our women and girls and paid for their fares.  If I had to name one person more than anyone else, it was Ailbhe Smyth, a giant of this movement who stood there when there was no glory to be had.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge genuinely the role the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, played albeit it took them a while to get there.  I have no doubt they were helped by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, at Cabinet and, definitely, by Deputy Kate O'Connell at the parliamentary party.  While I am not sure they would have got there as quickly without Deputies Zappone and O'Connell, they were at the helm and steered the ship and history will testify that they delivered.  I thank them for that.  Let us be honest however and point out that politicians have not led on this issue.  We have not even followed until recently.  This has been an uphill battle.  A boulder has been pushed up a hill for decades and no one here was behind it.  Let us be honest about it for once.  No one was involved.  In fact, a lot of people here were sitting on the boulder, making it even more difficult for those outside who wanted to push for change.  Others, of course, decided to jump ahead and claim some of the glory once the boulder was at the top of the hill and about to go down the other side, even though they had done none of the pushing.  I do not say that to score points, but to learn the lesson because there is going to be a next time.  Perhaps we can learn something next time around.  We need to move to enact the legislation.  Even today, however, I have heard people trying to out-posture each other as to who will be the most radical, claiming we should cancel all holidays between now and forever and bring in legislation tomorrow or even yesterday.  It is nonsense.  Can we please cop on with the games, which are despicable?<\/p>  <p>  My last point is for students and young people.  I am proud of the student movement.  I was one of those students years ago but we did not succeed in changing the world.  I hope this generation will.  The young people who mobilised and enfranchised their peers are the legends in this.  I hope they make a better job of changing the world than we did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900023#V00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1527609300,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Harty sharing time with Deputy Danny Healy-Rae?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900024#W00100","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1527609300,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I think so.<\/p>  <p>  It is very difficult to follow that contribution from Deputy Clare Daly and I want to acknowledge it.  There was raw emotion in that contribution.<\/p>  <p>  The people have spoken in a strong, clear voice to repeal the eighth amendment.  It is quite obvious that the Irish people put substantial thought into their decision.  They put quiet, emotional thought into their decision.  It was unseen by the political elite and by the political pollsters that such an emphatic two to one majority would come to pass.  It was felt that it would be substantially less than that.<\/p>  <p>  The people voted across the divide.  They voted across the class divide, the creed divide, the age divide and the urban-rural divide.  This referendum has shown how far the Irish people have come in their thinking over the past 35 years.  To vote in a clear majority, two to one, was stunning.<\/p>  <p>  This process demonstrates the strength of our democracy but it also demonstrates that a referendum is the ultimate citizens' assembly, where people make their voices known and the Oireachtas must respond.  As Chairman of the Committee on Health, I have the particular responsibility of facilitating the examination of this legislation, through pre-legislative scrutiny but also through the Committee Stage.  I recognise the urgency with which this legislation needs to come to pass.  We must also recognise that it is a process that has to be examined carefully so that we get the legislation correct and that it stands up to any challenge that may subsequently be put to it.<\/p>  <p>  The central issue revolving around this legislation will be the provision of safe, effective and legally delivered termination of pregnancy.  I believe this will be a new service within the health service and there will be new responsibilities on the medical profession.  There will have to be clinical guidelines and ethical guidelines, which will be very important.  We must also approve new procedures and new medications.<\/p>  <p>  The majority of the termination of pregnancy will be delivered before 12 weeks.  That will be delivered within primary care, through a GP-led primary care service.  This will be unique in the world because I am not aware of any other jurisdiction which has a GP-led termination service.  We need to look at this carefully.  It may well be that these services will have to be provided in GP-led clinics and not just through GP-led standard practices because it is not simple a matter of writing a prescription.  There will be a number of consultations involved in this and there will be the necessity to have dating scanning because the medication which is prescribed will vary depending on the length of the pregnancy.  These are matters that must be dealt with through the medical organisations.  It may well be that GPs will opt in to this process rather than each GP in his or her own surgery providing the service.  There is a level of expertise which will be needed in regard to general practice and that has to be dealt with through the representative bodies.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to refer to the fact that there will be conscientious objection to this.  If the medical profession is to be reflected in the vote, then one third of doctors will not want to participate in this process.  That goes for nurses and allied health professionals as well.  That has to be built into the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  We must dwell on the prevention of unwanted pregnancies and the prevention of crisis pregnancies.  The committee dealt comprehensively with introducing safe-sex education into our schools, so that crisis pregnancies are avoided, and to make available contraception.  Contraception should be made freely available.  I note that is the Minister's intention.<\/p>  <p>  The delivery of termination in the first 12 weeks should be done through a State system.  There should not be a cost attached to it.  We should not have a two-tier termination service.  We need to have a consistent service which is delivered through the public system that is safe and effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900024#W00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1527609300,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Are the Social Democrats and the Green Party sharing five minutes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900024#W00300","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1527609300,"counter":213,"content":"<p>We are and we are sharing time with Deputy Seamus Healy.<\/p>  <p>  I did not vote for the eighth amendment in 1983 and, to be perfectly honest, I felt like it cast a shadow.

I must say the overwhelming emotion is one of relief.<\/p>  <p>  It was an honest process and it was evidence based.  The Citizens' Assembly and the all-party Oireachtas committee not only recommended repeal but outlined to the citizens what they might expect, and that has enhanced politics.

I get a sense that this and the previous referendum on marriage equality have started to put us into a different place where we can finally start seeing a real republic emerging.

This was the first thorough assessment of capacity needs across the health service for more than a decade.  In the following month, 2,600 acute beds and 4,500 social care beds were provided for and fully funded in the national development plan, based on the capacity review findings.

The analysis also took account of the potential impact of health and well-being initiatives, a shift in the provision of certain care services from the acute to the community sector and productivity improvements in our hospitals.  We all know that major improvements in these areas are needed and outlined in our Sl&aacute;intecare report, and it is important that capacity is planned around a new model of service delivery and not the current one.  I think we agree that if we just increase the bed capacity and do not reform the model of care, the beds will just fill up and we will not manage to create the health service we need to.<\/p>  <p>  The ESRI report referred to, which was funded by my Department, is a valuable addition to our knowledge base for health policy.  It contains projections of future demand for health services but does not contain any projections for capacity such as acute beds.  The ESRI methodology also takes no account of future changes in models of care or in productivity improvements.  It is not possible therefore to get from the ESRI model a figure comparable to the 2,590 in the capacity review report.  The baseline projections for demand in both reports, however, are broadly aligned across the range of services examined.  I should point out that the ESRI sat on the steering group for the bed capacity review that said we needed 2,590 more acute hospital beds.<\/p>  <p>  I have stated before that I do not believe that capacity increases alone will bring improvements in our health services, but the national development plan investment programme must be matched with a programme of reform to deliver real change.  To that end, work on a Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan is advancing in my Department and I expect to bring these proposals to Government in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900025#X00700","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1527609900,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

The Department's capacity review says somewhere between 2,600 and 7,150.  The ESRI report broadly agrees with that.  The capacity review says the following: \"In practice the achievable shape of the future health system is likely to lie somewhere between the two extremes set out in this Capacity Review.\"  That would mean 4,900 new beds if we take the midpoint.

I welcome that there is now a political consensus in this House that we need more acute hospital beds.

Clearly, that myth has been dispelled.<\/p>  <p>  We have fully funded the 2,600 beds, which is ultimately the recommendation.  I take the Deputy's point because the bed capacity review does talk about lots of different figures, but it does recommend that this is the figure that would be used if a programme of reform were to be put in place also.  When I talk to people across the health service and look at the document that the cross-party group, the Sl&aacute;intecare committee, produced, it does say \"Yes\" to more hospital beds but it also says to move more into the community.  If we put all our attention on a hospital-centric model, we will be lulled into a false sense of security in not needing to move more services into the community.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to say also that we are not just talking about the 2,600 acute hospital beds.  We are also talking about the elective only hospitals which will provide about 600 further beds, which creates more capacity, and about 4,500 social care beds, which provide transitional care opportunities.  I agree that we need to front-load now and we need to look at the opportunities to get some of these beds in now, because whether it is 2,500 or a different figure, the health service cannot wait a significant period to get those beds.

I will return to the numbers.  The PA report does not recommend 2,600 beds.  What it says is, given their assumptions, the lowest conceivable number of beds we would need is 2,600.  It makes various technical assumptions, some of which are incorrect.  The 2,600 assumes massive investment in primary care and post-acute care and 2,600 beds.  The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, estimates the figure is 7,000.  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association believes that we are short more than 2,600 beds today.  Between the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, the IMO, the ESRI and the Department of Health, no one is saying we need 2,600 beds.  That has now been hardwired into the capital plan, so the Minister would appear to be providing for what his own report describes as an extreme in terms of the least possible number of beds we would need.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Minister prepared to go back to the Department and to PA Consulting, if needed, and ask them, in light of the fact we have provided in the capital plan a certain amount of money for 2,600 beds, how much money would be needed if various reforms do not happen?  The PA Consulting report, for example, assumes a one-to-one transfer between acute beds and primary beds.  For every primary care bed that is put in the community, one less bed is needed in the acute system.  Many experts say that is not a realistic assumption.  It would be useful for us, as we move to implement Sl&aacute;intecare, to say that while we have provided for 2,600 beds at a cost of several hundreds of millions or billions of euros, the midpoint is 4,900 beds and for that we would need an additional sum, &euro;2 billion or whatever, that we have not provided for.<\/p><p>Would the Minister be able to come back to the House and the committee to provide that information to us? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900025#X01000","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527610500,"counter":227,"content":"<p>We all did not get time for supplementary questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900026#Y00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1527610500,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I am flexible with every Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900026#Y00300","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1527610500,"counter":229,"content":"<p>That is why we had the law thing going on for hours longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900026#Y00400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1527610500,"counter":230,"content":"<p>We allow flexibility.

If the question is pitched in terms of the timelines as the Deputy has done she is correct the figure is down.  This reflects the fact that the\u00a0recruitment moratorium that was in place across the public service from 2007 had a real and lasting impact on staffing levels\u00a0in the health\u00a0service.

That work is under way.  It is nearly concluded and we will be guided as a Government by its findings.  The unions have had an opportunity to put their views on what could help with recruitment and retention issues as well.

I accept the point and am not contesting that we need to continue to do more to get back to where we want to be in respect of people working on the front line of our health service.  We also need to make sure that we provide more attractive working opportunities for nurses in the community.  We have a draft policy for community nursing and midwifery which is a response to an integrated model of care.  This model of care proposes one that offers the individual family and community a range of choices and will be facilitated through a variety of changes to the model so that we can have a proactive rather than reactive model of care.

A Vision for Change, published in 2006, set out a ten-year policy framework for Ireland's mental health services.  It recommended that interventions should be aimed at maximising recovery from mental illness, building on service user and social network resources to achieve meaningful integration and participation in community life.  As the Deputy will be well aware, one of the key principles of A Vision for Change was a fundamental move from institutional care to community-based care.  The policy advocated for a move towards predominantly community-based care delivered by multidisciplinary teams.  In line with this policy a number of old psychiatric hospitals has been closed due to the outdated nature of such facilities.  However, the Department recognises that there will always be a need for acute beds.  As such, there are currently 1,018 approved acute beds within the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Investment continues to take place to modernise this area of service and the HSE remains committed to improving rehabilitation services for people with severe and enduring mental illness and complex needs.  This includes the new 170-bed national forensic mental hospital complex now under construction at Portrane, to replace the Central Mental Hospital, CMH, along with new facilities such as a forensic child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, unit and an intensive care rehabilitation unit, which will open in 2020.  The HSE also intends to open an additional ten beds in the Central Mental Hospital as soon as possible once all necessary staff are put in place.  New acute and high observation units have also opened in Cork and Drogheda in recent years, with an additional facility in Galway set to be operational in June 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Many of those with severe mental illness and complex needs are discharged from acute inpatient units to a community residence, most often a high support hostel with 24-hour nursing staff available.  Community residences provide a structure and support that this group of service users most often need after discharge.  They offer an ideal place for further active rehabilitation for those who can acquire sufficient skills to become fully independent and live in their own accommodation.  However, for some service users a more intensive inpatient rehabilitation service is required.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2017 a national project was initiated which included developing a model of care for people with severe and enduring mental illness and complex needs.  The model of care describes a specialist rehabilitation care pathway that ensures that the requirements of people with severe and enduring mental illness are met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900027#Z00400","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1527611100,"counter":249,"content":"<p>In 1950 there were 7.9 psychiatric beds per 1,000 of our population.

We have also seen complaints from the forensic mental health services at the central mental hospital where people are being kept in prisons because there is not enough beds there either.

We have secure hostels with 24-hour staffing and that is a good model that works well.  It is a step-down model; it is not one where we take somebody from acute care and put them straight into the community.  It is a transitional care arrangement.

I believe the HSE is far too bureaucratic and is not accountable enough.  I believe we need to move quickly as an Oireachtas to put in place an independent board to improve governance and accountability and strengthen the oversight and performance of the HSE.  We have known we needed to do that but the national screening programme has made that even clearer.  What has arisen in regard to CervicalCheck has made that very clear as well.<\/p>  <p>  I have now published a general scheme of the Bill.  This will provide for a nine-person non-executive board, including a chairperson and a deputy chairperson.  I want this board to include patient advocates as well.  The board will have the authority to perform the HSE's function and will be accountable directly to the Minister of the day.  The HSE will have a chief executive officer, CEO, rather than a director general, who will be accountable to the board for the performance of his or her functions.  I look forward to working with the Deputy and other Members of the Oireachtas to bring this Bill through these Houses urgently.  I have taken on board the Deputy's suggestion in regard to looking at appointing the chair of that board to have a role in the recruitment of the new CEO rather than doing it the other way around.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to CervicalCheck in particular, I made my views very clear on a number of occasions that I was not happy and that I had serious concerns about the way this situation had been allowed to unfold.  Recent events have shaken the confidence of many people in the programme.  That is why I acted quickly and tried to act with colleagues across this House to put an independent inquiry in place.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The inquiry is led by Dr. Gabriel Scally, Professor of Public Health at the University of the West of England and the University of Bristol.

He is working with an international expert on women&rsquo;s health and will also be advised, as appropriate, by Dr. Hugh Annett and Professor Julia Verne.  The Scally inquiry will examine all aspects of CervicalCheck and involve engagement with the women and families affected.  The Deputy is aware that the terms of reference are very comprehensive and reflect the cross-party engagement.  A website, <i>scallyreview.ie<\/i>, has been set up and went live on 23 May.  It will enable the inquiry to communicate progress, including with the women and their families who have been impacted on.<br\/><br\/>Rather than being judge and jury, I want to await the outcome of the inquiry.  Dr Scally is due to provide a progress report on his work in the first week of June.  The full report is due by the end of June.  I will make my adjudication on specific questions on the basis of the full report.  <br\/><br\/>The Deputy is also aware that I have agreed to establish a commission of investigation.  Serious lessons need to be learned.  We have asked an international expert to come and get to the bottom of it; of who knew what, when and where and if people acted appropriately.

From the revelations in emails from the Minister's Department which were given this week, the Department did ask extra questions to make sure it was not a patient safety issue.  It was a patient safety issue.  The HSE did not fundamentally understand, comprehend or get the seriousness of the issue and it is getting worse.  I am intent because while we consider it to be a live issue, the women affected are unable to get the findings of the reviews.  I hold in my hand one example.  The 209 women affected are not obtaining the documentation they require.  I want a guarantee from the Minister that the HSE will give all documentation and audit review findings to the women in question by the end of this week.

It let the quality assurance director of the HSE to go on holiday during what was the biggest crisis in decades.

Cataract surgery is among the most common surgical procedures carried out in the ophthalmology specialty.  Through the work of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and the HSE, the overall number of patients waiting for cataract surgery has fallen by 22% since July 2017, while the number of patients waiting for more than 12 months has declined by 71% in the same period.  This is one of the areas where we are making significant progress as a result of the investment made through the NTPF.<\/p>  <p>  For 2018, under the inpatient-day case action plan, all clinically suitable patients waiting for more than nine months for a cataract procedure will be offered treatment this year, with 5,000 additional NTPF funded procedures planned in public and private hospitals.  Last year funding was allocated to provide additional capacity at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital and\u00a0a cataract theatre is now operational there.  This year, in line with the action plan, the HSE\u00a0is planning to open\u00a0a dedicated cataract theatre in Nenagh hospital in July.  This will also benefit patients from Deputy Brassil's constituency.<\/p>  <p>  In primary care the HSE published the primary care eye services review group's report in June 2017.  The report sets out the way forward for a significant amount of eye services to be provided in a primary care setting.  The recommendations made in the report are to be implemented on a phased basis.  To support implementation of the report, funding of &euro;1 million was allocated this year to establish new primary care eye support teams in south and west Dublin and further develop the primary care eye team in north Dublin to help to alleviate waiting lists.  We are making progress in this area, but we need to continue to make progress.  There were 10,304 people waiting for cataract procedures in April 2017.  In April 2018 that number had dropped to 7,818.  We are, therefore, seeing the benefits of the investment to reduce cataract surgery waiting lists.  The opening of the cataract operating theatre in Nenagh hospital in July will make a real difference.  It will provide a service for patients from counties Limerick, Laois, Kerry, Clare, Offaly, Kilkenny and Tipperary.  We have begun the roll-out of the new primary care eye support teams, but, clearly, we need to see them being spread throughout the State.

Not only did we appoint a national lead within the HSE to co-ordinate it, but we have also instructed that lead to ensure public health nurses are assigned in each of the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, to liaise with the families.  I do not want to hear of any woman or her family having to go to a meeting in Dublin or being dragged to meet the HSE.

Without naming anyone in the D&aacute;il, I have put some of the women affected in contact with the person co-ordinating this work nationally to ensure their feedback will go directly to the HSE.  I will personally monitor the position closely.<\/p><p>As the Deputy knows, there was a significant downward trend in the incidence of invasive cervical cancer between 2010 and 2015 and we are seeing improvements in five-year survival rates.  For that progress to continue, it is essential that women keep participating in cervical screening.  Recent weeks have shaken confidence in many aspects of CervicalCheck, but participating in screening is vital if we are to continue to see a reduction in the incidence of invasive cervical cancer.  It is welcome that so many women who have been adversely impacted jon or treated poorly by the health service have echoed that message.<\/p><p>As part of ensuring women can feel trust and confidence in the CervicalCheck programme and that it is well managed and quality assured, I have asked Dr. Gabriel Scally to carry out a scoping inquiry into all aspects of CervicalCheck.  I expect him to report to me at the end of June.  He is due to produce a progress report in the first week of June.  Separately, there will be an international clinical expert review panel led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, as I believed it was important to involve external persons.  It will review the screening history of all women who have developed cervical cancer and participated in the screening programme since it was established.  This will provide independent clinical assurance for women about the timing of their diagnoses and any issue related to their treatments and outcomes.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>On the number of free follow-up smear tests, the HSE has advised that this information is not available, given that there is always a time delay between when the smear test sample is taken by the smear taker and notification of the smear is received by CervicalCheck from the laboratories.  Tests are examined in three laboratories, with approximately 50% of the testing done in Ireland and 50% abroad.  All three laboratories meet quality assurance standards and are certified by the relevant national authorities.  The clinical advice is that there is no evidence that the clinical and technical aspects of the programme have performed outside or below international standards or the quality guidelines set for the programme.  However, smear tests can produce both false positive and false negative results.

It is also important that we continue to see if there are areas in which we can do better and if we can learn from other countries.

For educational psychologists that will mean 60 days in-service training to be completed prior to October 2019.  For many counselling psychologists it will mean 120 days or even 180 days in-service training.  By contrast, psychologists who have recognised placements could be deemed eligible even with no post-training experience.  According to some, the criteria for determining which placements are acceptable and which are unacceptable have been poorly defined and appear to have been enacted in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>and highly restrictive manner.

Counselling in primary care was launched in July 2013.  This was established to provide counselling for patients experiencing mild to moderate psychological difficulties who present in the primary care setting.  All adults in receipt of a medical card are eligible for the service.  Since its establishment the service has grown rapidly with almost 19,300 referrals during 2017 and counselling provided from more than 180 locations nationwide.  These services have been enhanced recently through the recruitment of 114 assistant psychologists in primary care.

While the project focuses specifically on adults attending specialist mental health services, it will also describe other services that currently provide talk therapies from HSE funding.  Building on a stepped care approach, the model of care is expected to involve an assessment of the need for talking therapies taking into account stakeholder perspectives and the prevalence of mental health disorders within the adult population.  It will consider evidence-based talking therapies that are best suited to meet the identified needs and outline a recommended operational model for talking therapies provided by general adult community mental health teams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900031#DD01900","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527614100,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  In its submission to the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, the Irish College of General Practitioners said: \"Our health system would appear to value machines, hospitals, and drugs over talk therapy, time to care and social support.\"  Irish general practices are slowly getting bigger.  As the proportion of single-handed GPs, which is now at only 18%, is reducing and more GPs are working in practices with three, four or more GPs, these larger practices could very usefully incorporate an on-site strand of talk therapy delivered within GP practices.  The trendsetting practices are actively exploring the use of relevant innovative care.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE spends 40 times more on medication than counselling services to treat mental health illnesses.  Counselling and talk therapies can often be effective for mild to moderate mental health difficulties but these therapies are vastly under-resourced in Ireland.  People battling mental illnesses need more access to counselling and talk therapies with less reliance on medication.  Much of the evidence suggests that because of a lack of alternative pathways in giving mental healthcare support to their patients, GPs are either relying on accident and emergency departments or on medication.  I am not saying that medication is being prescribed inappropriately but that GPs are having to rely on it because of a lack of alternative healthcare pathways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900032#EE00200","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1527614100,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Browne.  I agree with him and I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, does as well.  The HSE's mental health services are working with the Department of Health on a project which aims to improve access to mental health information and support through the harnessing of communication technologies.  There are a number of strands to this project.  First, there will be enhanced web-based mental health information which will be signposted to ensure the widest possible access to information on both mental health conditions and on our mental health services.  There will be an enhanced text-based live chat active listening service which will respond to queries on mental health and a telephone service that will direct people to appropriate and relevant mental health support services.  There will also be a feasibility study on the provision on online therapies and a framework for the quality standards required for the provision of such services.  Included in this work will be a pilot study examining the feasibility and utility of providing access to Internet-based counselling services from a primary care service.<\/p>  <p>  HSE specialist mental health services provide a wide range of talking therapies in both child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and adult mental health services.  These include specialist behavioural therapy, specialist cognitive behavioural therapy and behavioural family therapy.  Additionally the HSE provides talk therapies at primary care level through directly employed staff, including our psychologists in primary care and our counsellor therapists in counselling in primary care and, as I have outlined, the National Counselling Service.  As I have already stated, these services have been enhanced but there is absolutely room to do more in this regard.

We hear about pilot studies and programmes but they are not being rolled out nationwide.  Things seem to take so long.  Take Jigsaw as an example.  It started as a pilot and is a phenomenal programme.  However, I was told 18 months ago that it was going to arrive in Tipperary within a couple of months.  It is still not there.  It needs to be rolled out across the country.  There is a crisis in the waiting lists for our child and adolescent mental health services.  That is partially because there is a crisis in our waiting lists for access to child psychologists, which in turn is developing because there is a crisis in respect of the complete lack of availability of talk therapy.  In other words, when children first need supports they are not there.  They then need access to psychologists but cannot get to them and the next thing is that they are in CAMHS.  When children who are growing rapidly, both biologically and emotionally, do not get early intervention very quickly the long-term effects can be profound.

Under the revised procedure an assessment of need will comprise a preliminary team assessment that will identify initial interventions and any further assessments that may be required.

I accept the genuine concerns about this matter that have been raised by the Deputy.  Since the commencement in 2007 of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, the HSE has endeavoured to meet its legislative requirements as set out in the Act.  As a consequence of a High Court ruling of December 2009, the effect of which was to open eligibility to all children born after 1 June 2002, the number of children aged five and over and of schoolgoing age has increased steadily as a percentage of all applications received.  The relevant figure was 26% at the end of 2011 but it had increased to 51% by the end of 2017.  This reflects how the number of children seeking access to the assessment of need process tends to accumulate.  The number of new applications for assessment under the 2005 Act has increased steadily since it was introduced.  Some 1,138 applications were received in a six-month period in 2007, whereas 5,839 applications were received in 2017.  Some 43,521 completed applications have been received by the HSE since 2007.  I accept the criticism that this is a numbers issue.  Substantial work was undertaken during 2017 to address waiting times for assessment of need under the Disability Act 2005.  The additional funding secured by the HSE for therapeutic purposes has been invested in the progressing disability services for children and young people programme.  The roll-out of this programme since 2014 has entailed targeted investment of &euro;14 million and the provision of 275 additional therapy staff to increase services for children with all disabilities.  I will engage with this issue and ensure it is a priority during the negotiations on the Estimates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900033#FF00100","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1527614700,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his answer.

A further 30 acute medical beds are scheduled to open later this year in CUH, including two more critical care beds.  In addition, CUH has been supported over the recent winter months with additional home support packages and transitional care beds to reduce delayed discharges which affect patient flow and can have an impact on congestion in emergency departments.  I welcome the opening of an additional 30 acute medical beds in CUH later this year, along with two more critical care beds.  In line with CUH's particular focus on addressing patient flow, it\u00a0initiated a project in 2017 to improve patient flow and the patient experience.  In pointing out that this project, which has continued into 2018, is having a positive impact on trolley performance, I do not mean in any way to detract from the Deputy's point about the difficulties experienced by patients, family members and staff when individuals have to spend long periods on trolleys.  However, I have to show respect to the staff, and the patient flow project they have put in place in CUH, by acknowledging that in the first four months of this year, CUH had 15.3% fewer trolleys than it had in the same period in 2017.  This reduction was achieved even though patient attendances at CUH's accident and emergency department increased by over 1,000, or approximately 7.8%.<\/p>  <p>  Although the overall situation remains very challenging - we have much more to do - I welcome the reduction in trolley numbers that has been achieved by CUH so far this year.

I am in direct touch with some people in the hospital.  I get updates on the patient flow project from the clinical director in CUH.  I assure the House that as Minister for Health, I am committed to continuing the effort to address overcrowding in our emergency departments.

Today, according to the reply to my most recent parliamentary question on the matter, the number is 14.  It is out of line with everywhere else and there is no explanation.  The Minister of State is going to give me the stock answer about recruitment and all that.  I cannot understand why we have this decline when the population and economic activity in this hinterland is growing significantly.  In 2014 there were 89 garda&iacute; in Clondalkin and today there are 92.  In Lucan there were 74 in 2014 and today there are 70.  In Ronanstown there were 91 in 2014 and today there are 88.  In Rathcoole, however, in 2014 there were 23 garda&iacute; and today there are 14.  That is a really significant drop.<\/p>  <p>  This drop means that each Garda unit is a unit of two or three at most.  Nobody has cover for holidays or sick leave.  It is not physically possible to police the area adequately with that number of garda&iacute;.  This drop in numbers for Rathcoole is so obvious and the needs of the community and hinterland are not being addressed.  Housing construction under way and in planning is very vibrant at the moment in Citywest, Saggart, Rathcoole and Newcastle.  The Department of Education and Skills is opening a new second level college in Citywest within two years.  The population and economic needs are there.  I have asked many parliamentary questions and I am sorry for the Minister of State because I know he is going to read out the stock answer.  I really wanted the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to address what is going on and why this region is being denied the level of policing it had before in line with other parts of my constituency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900034#GG00600","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1527615300,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I must apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan.  He wanted and meant to be here but was delayed at the last minute.  I am speaking on his behalf.  He is very grateful to the Deputy for raising this matter.  He points out at the outset that the distribution of garda&iacute; is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and the Minister has no direct role in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Rathcoole Garda station forms part of the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, west division.  The Minister is informed by the Commissioner that on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the DMR west division was 672, of whom 14 were assigned to Rathcoole Garda station, as the Deputy has already told us.  There are also 26 Garda reserves and 55 civilians attached to the division.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister assures the House that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members.  The Minister maintains that real, tangible progress has been made towards this goal.  Garda numbers, taking into account projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017, a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in 2010 a previous Government closed the Garda College and imposed a moratorium.  The measures imposed at that time had a negative impact on Garda numbers across all divisions and the legacy of those decisions continues to have consequences for policing.  When it had brought about an early exit from the bailout and stabilised the public finances in September 2014, the then Government reopened the college and since then just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are performing mainstream duties nationwide.  Some 155 of them have been assigned to the DMR west division.<\/p><p>It is important to appreciate that the increased specialisation in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na means the number of garda&iacute; assigned to various divisions does not include those assigned to various special bureaus or units and, of course, those garda&iacute; who are also undertaking critical policing work such as the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the armed support units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  More than 120 extra garda&iacute; were assigned to the specialist units within special crime operations since 2017 alone.<\/p> <p> The Minister is pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda recruits will enter the Garda College, 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 200 of whom attested in March with a further 200 scheduled to attest next month.  Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p> <p> This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Garda Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of garda&iacute;.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility in our communities.  This will enable the Garda Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda division, including the DMR, Dublin metropolitan region, west division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900034#GG00700","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527615900,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

That is not in line with anything that is happening.  I am failing to get an explanation as to why and if the issue can be addressed.  It is not as if Rathcoole is in a part of the country that is not growing.  Its population is growing rapidly along with its economic activity.  The concern I have is that with only 14 garda&iacute; stationed in Rathcoole, the operation and viability of the Garda force there is somewhat challenged.  It is two or three people per unit which does not even allow the Garda station to be regularly opened.  There is only one community garda.

That is correct.  Of those, 120 were sent to specialist units.  The number of garda&iacute; in Dublin in 2017 actually declined but the number did not decline by 40% like in Rathcoole.  There is no explanation as to why an area with a growing population and economic activity has seen such a decline.

That whole catchment area has seen a significant reduction in the number of garda&iacute; who patrol it.  Just four years ago there were 23 garda&iacute; based there and before that, 26.  The numbers have been significantly higher but are now down to 14.  Residents are quite concerned about the future viability of the Garda station in Rathcoole.

It is the responsibility of the divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division as appropriate.  The Minister is advised by the Garda Commissioner that recent census data is currently being incorporated into the personnel allocation model.  The Minister understands that census information received on a specific county format is amended by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service to reflect Garda divisional boundaries.  However, it should be noted that ratios, such as the number of garda per head of population, are not an appropriate tool to use when considering the allocation of Garda resources as they fail to take into account, among other matters, the fact that crime levels and types can vary significantly among communities of similar population size.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s plans for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 are complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for the force.

I would imagine this is an issue of which the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is acutely conscious.  There are families in such circumstances who are existing day by day beyond crisis point.<\/p>  <p>  I recently put down a parliamentary question asking the HSE for data on the overall number of people with disabilities on a waiting list for a residential placement.  The HSE stated in the reply there is no centrally maintained list of people waiting for residential services.  However, the need for more residential facilities was acknowledged and the HSE continues to explore the issue.  The HSE is not even aware of the number of people with severe disabilities who are currently on a waiting list for a residential placement.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, I was informed by the COPE Foundation in Cork that it has 168 people on a waiting list for residential supports.  It has divided these into three categories.  Priority level No. 1 involves 27 cases where two parents are deceased or the one sole carer is incapacitated in some way.  For priority level No. 2, it had 20 cases which involved the person living with elderly parents and with significant issues of concern for the family coping.  The remainder, 121, were priority level No. 3.  That is one service provider alone.  Has the Minister of State the overall data?  If he does not, will he get it because we need to know the extent of this problem?<\/p>  <p>  What really brought it home to me was one individual case on which I have been working for some time.  Unfortunately, it is ongoing.  This case involves elderly parents in their mid-70s providing full-time care for a profoundly disabled daughter in her early 40s.  She is non-verbal and wheelchair-bound.  They have to do absolutely everything for her.  They can be woken up several times during the night when she gets upset.  They have to do their very best to care for her.  I have taken them through the process.  They have raised their case with the service provider and the HSE.  Their daughter is on a waiting list but there is absolutely no light at the end of the tunnel for her.  According to the COPE Foundation&rsquo;s categorisation, she is not even priority level No. 1 because both her parents are alive.  They are elderly and have their own health issues but they are alive.<\/p>  <p>  A senior manager with the HSE said the problem is that it is not getting the funding from the Government to provide these residential places.  The parents in question literally have no hope.  They go to bed every night with one worry, namely, what happens when they die, whether it is one or both of them.  Their daughter will then be elevated to priority level No. 1 within the HSE&rsquo;s categorisation.  Even with that, there is no guarantee, however, that she will get a residential placement.  Presumably, some emergency support will kick in.  It is an appalling situation.  The fact the HSE does not even know how many people are on this waiting list beggars belief.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Minister of State will shed some light on it today and give some hope to families like the one in question who encouraged me to bring this issue to his attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900035#HH00400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1527615900,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for raising this important issue.  I am familiar with the issue of elderly parents looking after adults with intellectual disabilities.  It is an issue to which we must all give priority.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.  We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives.<\/p><p>As part of ongoing service provision, this year the HSE will provide over 8,300 residential places for families in need throughout the country.  Residential services make up the largest part of the disability budget.  Our policy on people with disabilities is to support them to achieve their full potential in order that, where possible, they can live ordinary lives in ordinary places doing ordinary things.  The need for increased residential facilities is acknowledged and I fully accept the point made by the Deputy on the issue.  The HSE will continue to work with agencies to explore various ways to respond to this need in line with the budget available.  Residential placements for adults with disabilities are considered following detailed clinical assessment by HSE services.  Access to places for those with the most complex needs is allocated on a priority basis and on the basis of the availability of appropriate services.<\/p> <p> A significant underlying challenge relates to the unmet need for residential and respite care in services as a result of the absence of investment during the economic downturn.  Part of the problem is the lack of investment in services for many years.  The HSE national database figures indicate an annual requirement of 400 residential places per year to meet identified needs.  That is the figure I have encountered as a Minister of State.  What we are really talking about is the need for 400 extra and new residential places per year.  The services are experiencing a high annual demand for emergency residential places and must respond to the most urgent cases on the waiting list.<\/p> <p> This year the HSE disability budget is over &euro;1.7 billion, an increase of &euro;92 million on the figure for last year.  We are particularly committed to providing a range of accessible respite supports for people with disabilities and their families.  This year the HSE will provide over 182,000 respite care nights and 42,500 day respite care sessions for families in need throughout the country.  We acknowledge the need for increased respite care services throughout the country.  That is why we secured an additional &euro;10 million to specifically enhance respite care services.  This funding will provide extra facilities.  We are also planning to provide a range of alternative respite care options for families.<\/p> <p> This is the core issue in the debate.  We need 400 new residential places every year to catch up and invest in the services.  Last year in the region of 235 places were provided and a further 170 were taken out of institutional care services.  The figure on which I will be focused in the coming weeks in negotiations on the Estimates is the need for 400 places.  The Deputy mentioned 27 on a priority 1 waiting list for Cope Foundation services.  I have come across this figure in St. Michael's House and other services.  The ballpark figure for which I will be pushing is 400 new residential places.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900035#HH00500","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527616500,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  That is a new figure.  Certainly, I was unable to extract such a figure by way of parliamentary questions.  It informs us that there is some level of co-ordination between the HSE and service providers.  The Minister of State should get an answer to the question of how many are on waiting lists if he does not already have the figure.  He has said there is an annual requirement for 400 places.  The HSE should contact each service provider.  It appears that waiting lists are administered at the level of the service provider.  Therefore, the HSE should contact all service providers and pull together the data for the numbers on waiting lists.  The Minister of State referred to 8,300 residential places.  That is the current number of places and they are taken.  The figure does not erode in any way the waiting lists.  Given that the waiting list is almost 170 for one service provider alone in Cork, the figure nationally must be in the thousands.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to bring it back to the example I gave.  The family in question have been trying for two years.  The parents are in their mid-70s and struggling.  I acknowledge that they receive a respite care service when they most need it, which is appreciated.  However, when it comes to a residential placement, they have been told by the service provider and the HSE that there is no hope because their daughter is not at priority level 1.  Priority level 1 status is afforded to drastic cases where both parents are deceased or where a sole carer is incapacitated in some way.  Essentially, they are cases where the HSE has no option but to step in and provide care.<\/p>  <p>  I call on the Minister of State to do more digging on this issue.

We need to build a new system that will respect people and look after senior citizens who are doing a fantastic job.

The effect on the city was tremendous.  The place was vibrant and hopping and had a festival atmosphere.  In the midst of it all, the people of Cork got a glimpse of what a world-class event centre, as envisioned and talked about for so long, could deliver for the city and county.  They got to see what it could do for local businesses, night life and so on in the city centre.  The concerts went off without a hitch and the extraordinary potential and good that could come to the city from an events centre could be clearly seen.  Unfortunately, when the conversation turns to having an events centre in Cork, many people roll their eyes.  There is a sense of whether we will ever see one and whether it will happen, as opposed to when it will happen.  That is because we have had false dawn after false dawn, delay after delay and missed deadline after missed deadline.  BAM won a competition in late 2017 for &euro;20 million in State funding from national and local government for an events centre.  At the time it was estimated that the project would cost &euro;50 million.  The cost has since soared to &euro;75 million to &euro;80 million.<\/p>  <p>  We heard that work was due to start in the summer of 2015, late 2015, after Easter 2016, late 2016 and so on.  In February 2016 the Taoiseach turned the sod in the teeth of a general election.  That is now almost universally accepted as being a complete stunt and nothing more.  It is two years and four months since the sod was turned and as of now nothing, not even a brick, has been laid for the events centre.  No planning has been finalised and there is no final design.  A total of &euro;633,000 has been spent without a brick having been laid.<\/p><p>The head of BAM, Mr. Theo Cullinane, accepts that will be tight and has even indicated that his company is willing to step aside for another contractor, notwithstanding the fact that it is fully committed to the contract.

The T&aacute;naiste was on local radio yesterday to inform us that the Government is fully committed and the project will be delivered.  That has been the tune, I am sorry to say, for quite some time.  Everyone hopes it will be delivered, but progress has been exceptionally slow.<\/p> <p> I recognise that some of the responsibility for this project lies with other parties, including Cork City Council and BAM, but the application for additional funding of &euro;10 million is with national Government.  Processing that application is one of the key steps to moving forward.  It appears, however, that the application process is tortuously slow.  The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Josepha Madigan, informed me in January that, on 27 September 2017, Cork City Council made an application to her Department for a further grant to assist with the development of the project.  She said the Department was assessing the application but that there were complex legal issues of state aid and matched funding to be considered.  She said the Department was engaging with the local authority on those issues.  The application for additional funding is itself dragging on.  It has been with the Government for nine months.  We were told three months ago that the issues had been resolved in principle, but we have no white smoke or certainty as to when we will get the grant.<\/p> <p> My questions to the Minister of State are simple.

It is envisaged that the event centre will be capable of accommodating a wide range of events including concerts, festivals, family entertainments, arts, cultural, sports, exhibitions, conferences and trade shows.  The project is led by Cork City Council with the development company BAM having been selected by the council as the preferred tenderer.  BAM, in turn, has engaged international events company Live Nation as the preferred operator.  The project is ultimately being developed and managed by Cork City Council.

There are two issues here with which we need to grapple.  The first is the law prohibiting the display of election posters within 50 m of a polling station.  Obviously, there were many instances last week where a massive array of &ldquo;No&rdquo; posters appeared overnight in greater proximity to polling stations than that.  However, there was a complete failure on the part of the Garda, local authorities or the returning officers concerned to take any action.<\/p><p>It was ironic in my area where the local authority early on in the campaign jumped the gun and took down a load of posters and then apologised for that, on the days of the election and the count its officials were nowhere to be seen and did not answer their phones.  Residents rang and asked them to come out.  Similarly, the Garda did not take any action either.<\/p> <p> I am wondering what we can do to enforce the law.  Can we have clarity on where the polling station is?  Is it the table or the desk where the voting is or is it the entrance to the building, and have we given any thought to getting rid of posters?  Particularly in this current climate of the damaging nature of plastics, we should be moving to a scenario where it is regulated, as in other European countries where, for example, one might have one big billboard in a communal area where people can go in a town or village on which everybody puts up their posters.  Something has to be done about the blight on our landscape.<\/p> <p> The other issue that caused even greater outcry was what could be deemed to be a devious manipulation of the election rules and an inappropriate display of religious iconography in close proximity to the polling stations.  Many of our voting stations are Catholic schools.  One would expect to see some symbolism in a Catholic school.  However, the reports we were receiving went way beyond this, involving the strategic location of religious iconography in order to, as residents put it to me, &ldquo;influence the vote&rdquo;.  For example, in Garristown, a rural part of my constituency, residents were outraged.  In 40 years voting in the same location, they had never seen anything like it.  There was literally an altar that they had to pass on the way in.  In Booterstown, we received reports of a religious statue placed at the entrance.  On the Navan Road, where residents normally walk in through the main door of the school, they were diverted around to a side entrance and they had to pass a display.<\/p> <p> In Galway, a resident found a Bible on the polling booth.  He was getting his ballot paper and when he objected to the two women, who said, &ldquo;Sorry about that&rdquo;, he went to the garda.  The garda agreed that should not be there but an hour later when his wife voted the same Bible was still there.  The garda&iacute; did not want to know.  The Returning Officer did not want to know.<\/p> <p> In Sallins national school, the same occurred.  Residents were very unhappy to have to go pass a wall full of hand-drawn pictures of the Virgin Mary.  When a resident contacted Kildare County Council, it sent them to the Garda.  The Garda sent the resident to the Referendum Commission, which stated it was nothing to do with it and sent the resident to the National Presiding Officer.<\/p> <p> There were so many accounts from different parts of the country that it could not have been a co-incidence.  There were just too many.  I have never heard that previously.  When, in Garristown, for example, the residents said to me there is a perfectly good gym hall where there would be no imagery, and asked why did they not put the desks there, it seemed to be quite strategic.  That seemed to me to be a manipulation of the law.<\/p> <p> I am wondering whether the Minister is looking at any way in which we could regulate this and ensure that this would never happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900037#KK01000","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527617700,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Clare Daly for raising the issue, which is of interest to us all.  As well as voting and participating on Friday, watching social media I would have seen some of the reports the Deputy mentions.<\/p>  <p>  The primary role of the Department in electoral matters is to provide an appropriate policy and legislative framework for a modern and efficient electoral system.  Within that framework, local Returning Officers in each constituency are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referendums, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law.<\/p>  <p>  Under electoral law it is an offence to interfere with or obstruct or impede an elector going to or coming from, or in the vicinity of, or in, a polling station.<\/p>  <p>  Electoral law also prohibits canvassing in any form in the polling station, in the building containing the polling station, in any grounds attached to, or in the curtilage of, the building and within 50 m of any entrance to such grounds or such building, or within 50 m of its curtilage.<\/p>  <p>  It prohibits any form of canvassing, including congregation or loitering by persons, display of posters or distribution of leaflets or cards.  It also prohibits the use of any loud-speaker within the area in which the prohibition applies.<\/p>  <p>  Guidance issued to local Returning Officers by the Department in advance of electoral events advises that they should ensure that presiding officers are aware of these provisions and of their duty to ensure that they are complied with within the polling station, the building containing the polling station, its grounds and at any entrance to the polling station or grounds.  In particular, presiding officers should have checks made through the day to ensure that the prohibitions are being observed.<\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s guidance further advises that the presiding officer should also ensure that posters are not displayed within the polling station or the building where it is situated, or its grounds or on the railings or walls of the grounds.<\/p>  <p>  The enforcement of these provisions is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The presiding officer is advised to co-operate with the garda&iacute; and ensure, as far as possible, that the provisions are complied with in the polling station and its grounds and should bring any breaches, whether within or outside the grounds, to the notice of the Garda.<\/p>  <p>  Further to that official response, I have been aware on many occasions over the years of situations where posters are too close and upon being brought to the notice of the presiding officer in the stations and garda&iacute;, they have always been removed.  That is the law.  That should have been implemented on this occasion.<\/p>  <p>  According to reports I received from across the country, generally speaking, there was positive action taken to remove posters that were within that 50 m curtilage.  In relation to iconography and the broader issue of where polling stations should be, the legislation places the responsibility quite clearly on the local Returning Officer to decide on the location as well as the staff and the training.  However, it has been the case over the past few years, and I believe it should continue to be the case, that in places where a suitable non-school facility exists, for example a community hall, there has been a growing tendency that those facilities are used now more than they would have been in the past.<\/p>  <p>  I made a few phone calls around the country and it is not only a rural issue.  In parts of certain large urban communities, primary schools tend to be located in situations where they are easily accessible and sporting facilities or community halls do not tend to be as evenly spread throughout urban areas and certainly not throughout the broader rural community.<\/p>  <p>  The points the Deputy makes in relation to the choosing of polling booth and polling station locations are issues that must be brought to the fore again with Returning Officers, in terms of directives and circulars from the Department.  Broadly speaking, while there were incidents around the country, in particular in relation to postering, the referendum seems to have been carried out in a full and open fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900038#LL00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1527617700,"counter":368,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has exceeded his four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900038#LL00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1527617700,"counter":369,"content":"<p>We will be taking on board some of the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestions with regard to training staff in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900038#LL00400","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1527617700,"counter":370,"content":"<p>There are a couple of issues.

Even though it was recognised that it should not have been on the table, it was not removed.<\/p>  <p>  The interpretation of the legislation was that the 50 m was not from the entrance of the building but to the desk buried in the middle of the building.

We cannot have a repetition of that.  It was regrettable.<\/p>  <p>  There needs to be considerable training of Returning Officers.  I have no problem with schools being chosen - they are a good location.  The point is there has to be an instruction to the school that if it is allowing its facilities to be used, we cannot have obvious religious symbolism in a sensitive issue such as this.  Particularly in the instances in my area, it could have been avoided.  The school could have been used.  The Catholic iconography in the school could have been protected in its locations where they normally have it.  The two did not need to conflict.  It was quite clear there was a deliberate conflict here.  Even in my polling station, the school shares the carpark with the church.  One drives in to the church and then turns right to the school.  There was a car strategically parked in the carpark with a sticker on the back, stating &ldquo;Vote No.&rdquo;  One could not drive in to the carpark without seeing this car that was there all day.<\/p><p>We need to look at the regulations and state that it is not just posters.

In recent years we have made considerable expansion in the provision for special education.  It has seen a 43% increase in the financial provision with similar increases in both the numbers of special needs assistants and in resource teachers.  One of the significant features in that time has also been the large expansion in the number of special units within mainstream schools.  They have increased from 548 in 2011 to 1,304 today.<\/p><p>The purpose of this amendment is to go beyond what was already in the Bill.  The Bill already allowed the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to designate a school to receive or accept a child with special education needs.  The NCSE could override objections or barriers to the placement of a child in respect of an individual school.  During the course of the debate on Committee Stage, a number of Deputies, in particular Deputy Thomas Byrne, were keen that we should move beyond that and also make provision that the NCSE could designate or require a school to open a special needs unit.  These are units that typically have six children.  They would be provided with one teacher and two special needs assistants, SNAs, which would be the typical profile.  They are provided by the NCSE and they have provided a very useful way in which we have been able to respond to the growing number of children who present on the ASD spectrum, in particular.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for that and it is quite a complex process, as Members will see.  There are a number of stages in it which start with the NCSE informing the Minister, then a report is prepared, then there are opportunities for people to make representations and then there is a notice of intent served on the school which is followed by the opportunity for comment.  That is followed by a notice confirming that the proposition will go ahead and the property arrangements that would be made for it.  That is followed by the opportunity for the school, if it so wishes, to go to arbitration in respect of the property arrangements.  If the school was not accepting of the direction of policy and the notice provided by the Minister, there would be a further move to provide an order to the board and a notice to the patron in the event of a refusal.  Finally, there would be an issue of direction by the Minister.<\/p><p>People may make comment on the stages involved but these were advised to us when we approached the draftsman.  In order to be robust and constitutionally secure, we needed to have these provisions because this raises issues of property rights.  That is the reason they are there.  That is the backdrop to the proposition.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1 amends the Long Title of the Bill.  Amendment No. 29 inserts a new section 37A into the Education Act 1998 that gives the Minister the power to direct a school to make additional provision in respect of children with special education following a report by the NCSE.  The provision is required to ensure that where there is a gap in provision for the education of children with special educational needs as identified by the NCSE and no school is forthcoming to make such provision available, the gap can be addressed effectively by issuing a direction by the Minister to the school.  Under this amendment, exercise of this power will be preceded by a number of steps, which I mentioned, of engagement between the Minister, the NCSE, the board of management and the patron or, where the owner is not the patron, the owner of the school.  The direction will require the school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs in the form of a special class or classes.  Once initiated, this process involves a number of stages, which I went through.<\/p><p>As outlined, the amendment will provide that based on a report from the NCSE, the Minister may take steps that will ultimately lead to the exercise of power to require a school to open a special class and increase the number of special classes in the school.  The provision also provides that where agreement is not reached with the Minister on the property arrangements, there is a provision for arbitration, as I mentioned.  Arbitration between the Minister and the property owner allows for an independent and effective resolution of any disagreement around the property arrangements required to give effect to a direction.  The property arrangements required for this purpose may not involve a new build in all cases.  These arrangements will differ from school to school, depending on local circumstances and having regard to the usual considerations of capacity, space restrictions and other local factors.  The amendment provides that the outcome of arbitration on the property matters will be binding on the parties in the event that the Minister issues a direction to the school.  <\/p><p>The amendment provides for the Minister to make that decision, following the conclusion of his or her further consideration and statutory engagement with the board of management and patron on the other matters - in other words, matters not related to the property arrangements relevant to whether the school should or should not make the provision.<\/p><p>The provision will apply to all schools recognised under the Education Act 1998.<\/p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The process will be transparent, with provision for all notices issued by the Minister and representations received by him or her at the various stages involved to be published on the Department's website within seven days of their issue or receipt by the Minister.  While the Department and the NCSE will continue to work with schools to ensure that appropriate provision is in place for children with special educational needs, this new statutory power will ensure that if there are gaps in the provision of special classes by schools, such gaps can be effectively addressed in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900039#MM02000","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527618900,"counter":392,"content":"<p>We welcome the spirit of this amendment and will support it.  I stated on Second Stage that we would require such a provision in this Bill in order to support it.  I am not going to be churlish; I welcome it.<\/p>  <p>  It is exceedingly complicated, however, and that is a worry because it seems the amendment seeks very carefully to protect the interests of the national council, the Minister, the board of management, the school and the patron.  Everybody&rsquo;s interests and constitutional rights are looked after, with one exception, those of the child or the children most in need of the special classes who cannot get them.  This is particularly a problem at second level in some parts of the country.<\/p>  <p>  The child should be at the centre of this.  If the Minister were to offer one of the schools that will not take a special class a new building, he would not need any arbitration clause or appeals mechanism because the school would take it with open arms.  It should be similar if the school is asked to take on a new unit.  Under US federal law there is often a way for the federal government to get around its powers by saying it will give the institution money if it does something.  Surely that is the way around it.  We can put the funding in question for schools that do not do this, rather than having a procedure that could take seven or eight months.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that if this provision is in the Bill it will send a signal to schools that the game is up and that if they are required to establish a special class for autism or any other disability, they will do it.

This is one aspect of the Bill that has been identified as a problem up and down the country.  We will be examining this between now and when the Bill is brought before the Seanad to see if we can improve on it and whether it can be whittled down a bit to make it less complex and to put the child with special needs, who needs to be in a special class, at the centre of our thinking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900040#NN00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1527618900,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Last June, I raised this issue with the Minister, having previously raised it when two Labour Party Ministers published legislation to provide for school admissions, which was later adopted by the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday morning I spent a couple of hours in two schools in my constituency, Dublin West, which are not untypical.  They are both delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS band 1.  Not only do they not have the kind of special facilities Deputy Thomas Byrne referred to but when new buildings were being built or total refurbishment of existing buildings was taking place in many other schools in Dublin West, the Department provided for a special unit.  Both of these schools received news recently in the reports of the special educational needs organisers, SENOs, on their allocations of special needs assistants, SNAs.  There seems to be a very variable allocation in the adjudication of the SENO requirement.  Both of these schools are junior schools and one had evidence on file, which was shown to me, of the applications regarding more children with special needs coming in this year.  Notwithstanding that some children were transferring into the senior school on the same campus it was getting a smaller allocation, down by approximately a third on the previous year.  I will be writing to the Minister in detail about this.<\/p>  <p>  The issue involves one I raised last year.  The Department has not clarified whether, in recognising children with special needs, it recognises behavioural disorders.  The people carrying out the SENO assessments do not seem to know.  Instead, principals, who have a lot do, now have extensive and elaborate forms to consider and fill in about children seeking enrolment, or already enrolled, who emerge as having a special need.  There is no clarity on how the SNA is being provided.<\/p>  <p>  I will not object to the Minister&rsquo;s amendment on this provision but he is running into serious problems.  His standard answer is that he is providing more SNAs on a countrywide basis.  As we know, they are in part being allocated to the whole school via the principal but the principals are cracking under the burden of extra administration that the Minister, through the Department, has imposed on them.  For instance, in one case an allocation for special needs was denied because the report referred to a potential hearing issue that the child with special needs had.  As the Minister knows, being a parent, children who have special needs often have multiple problems that must be addressed and which the school has to support.  Everybody has agreed that it really is the right thing, where possible, to mainstream children in their local primary school and, in particular situations, in a special unit, which has gone ahead under this Government and I am glad of that.<\/p>  <p>  The test of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is very simple.  Does this child require care over and above the level that a child who does not have special needs requires?  If the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; that child&rsquo;s parents will qualify for the domiciliary care allowance.  I do not understand why the Department of Education and Skills has not adopted that principle.  It would probably mean more parents qualifying.  During my time in the then Department of Social Protection many more parents qualified, with the agreement of all the parties in this House, for the domiciliary care allowance and that was seen as positive but it is not being translated into the education system.  Will the Minister explain to us how those two schools are going to function with more children with special needs in the junior school on the smaller quota of SNAs that the Department is allocating to them?  The appeals process is mired in bureaucracy which has grown extraordinarily and which makes it really difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900040#NN00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1527619500,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I welcome the amendment.  We should be constructive when discussing Bills and amendments and we should speak to the amendment before us.<\/p>  <p>  I could say a good deal about special education in general and about some teachers carrying out certain functions in that there is a belief they could perhaps require additional training and support.  This is a welcome provision, however, and it is good to see the dimension of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units specifically included in the Bill.  While there is always room for improvement and there is much we could say about that, we must acknowledge when a step has been taken and something good has been done.

Overall, it is welcome and good to see it included.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will be aware that I have raised several individual cases with him regarding the lack of availability of ASD units, particularly in Carlow-Kilkenny.  A school will now be compelled to deal with that.  This is partly related to a cultural and societal change.  I know from my time in school that we never heard of any ASD units or certainly that was not an option for people.  This will involve a change of mindset and we must acknowledge that we have to change the mindset of certain schools that simply regard this as a hassle.  There is nothing else to say about it.  They consider it is too much hassle and stress to go down the road of creating an ASD unit in their school.  It is welcome that schools will be compelled to do this.  There is always room for improvement.  The quality of teaching in some ASD units could be examined but that is not necessarily relevant to this debate.

Yes, they should.  The situation on the ground speaks volumes as to why that is a necessary step.  I cite the example of County Cork where we have 148 ASD classes in primary schools but a mere 55 ASD classes in secondary schools.  That gap, approaching the 3:1 mark, is growing year on year.  The situation in many other countries is worse than it is in County Cork.  Those statistics do not take into account in any sense the child who goes to primary school and is not in an ASD class but who needs an ASD class when they go to secondary school.  That includes a significant number of students.  The situation is added to by that cohort.  Currently, every special class in Cork city is in a DEIS school.  That is not a position that should be maintained.<\/p>  <p>  Do we support the idea that ASD units or classes should be provided with schools being compelled, if necessary, to do so?  Yes, we do.

A process which can play out over a period of seven or eight months is too long.  We are in agreement with the points that have been raised, namely, that there is provision for the schools, the patrons and the boards but sufficient care and attention has not been given to the needs of the child.  We agree also with the idea that linking this to funding can be an effective way to compel schools to do what needs to be done in the interests of the children.  We may tease out those points a little further before the Bill proceeds to the next Stage.  The basic point is that schools can be compelled to establish an ASD unit through an intervention, and we will support that provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900041#OO00300","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1527619500,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I generally support this amendment.  Its objective is very desirable.  I would express some concern regarding the fact that the process is very convoluted and could be drawn out over a very long period.  It again highlights the issue that we have schools that are fully funded by the State, with staff paid by the State and yet the State is not in a position to instruct the schools to open, for example, an ASD unit.  It highlights the problems associated with the farming out of responsibility for our education system, and many of those chickens are coming home to roost at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, in his contribution on the amendments, referred to property rights.  We have seen previously in legislation where attempts to facilitate people with disabilities were stymied where they have been trumped by property rights, even basic items such as the need to provide proper bathroom facilities, and an employer can claim undue hardship under property rights.  If we are serious about addressing the needs of people with disabilities, we should remove from our Constitution any of those obstacles that exist.  Property rights for that reason and for many other reasons need to be addressed and taken out of the Constitution in the format they are currently in.<\/p>  <p>  I also very much support the point that has been made about ensuring sufficient funding is provided.  Schools should be required to provide facilities and, for example, ASD units where there is a local need for such a facility, but they should not be faced with a situation where their resources are stretched because of that.  In requiring a school to provide any special facilities for students with disabilities, it is essential those services are fully funded.  We have a problem with special needs assistants and with other physical facilities in schools which are not necessarily always funded by the Department.  That has to go hand in hand.  The schools must on take their responsibility but the Minister and Department must also take on the responsibility for fully funding those services and supports.<\/p>  <p>  I endorse the point made regarding the problem that exists where the provision of ASD units at primary level seems to be close to being adequate but the big problem occurs at secondary level.  We are all familiar with that problem where students have had the necessary supports at primary level but there is a gap at that critical stage when they go into secondary school.  They find they have to deal with ten or 12 teachers and all the new subjects.  It is a challenging time for any teenager transitioning to secondary school but especially for a person with special needs.  There is a need for the Department to up its game to ensure an adequate supply of places is available at second level.  We are very far from that position at this point.  Otherwise, in terms of the general thrust of the amendment, I welcome it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900041#OO00400","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1527619500,"counter":397,"content":"<p>As the Minister will be aware, I put forward a series of amendments on Committee Stage to allow the National Council for Special Education to compel a school to open an ASD unit.

In management, leadership and learning, MLL, evaluations in a DEIS school I have heard that inspectors pose a question to the staff about whether the school has ever asked itself why it has so many students with special educational needs.  In turn, the inspectors are asked if they pose this question to other schools but rephrased as, \"Has your school ever asked itself why it does not have children with special educational needs?\"  I suggest that, for the purposes of equality and fairness, this question be added to the MLL evaluation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900041#OO00500","speaker":"1242","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527620100,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Most of the points have been made.  It is correct that we should be able to compel a school to make provision for children with special educational needs.  As Deputy Thomas Byrne indicated, the Bill seems to be a little convoluted in the way it proposes to do so.  It appears to focus on the school, the council, the rather lengthy process involved and the powers of the Minister but does not seem to emphasise the child enough.<\/p>  <p>  Is the process of reporting on the provision of capacity in the area a bit of a get-out clause that allows a school to state it does not have to make provision because somebody else can do it?  This argument is used by schools and one of the soft barriers in getting a child into his or her school of choice.  The school states, \"You would be better off going to the school down the road because it has the capacity to deal with you and we do not\".  The Minister should address that point to be sure the Bill does not allow for the continuation of soft barriers which discriminate against children with special needs in seeking to gain entry to a particular school.<\/p>  <p>  As I listened to the debate I was struck that it might also be useful to strengthen the Bill a little to give power to the Minister and place an obligation on a school not to take any action that would degrade special education provision in a school.  I say this and the Minister may remember because of the very strong case made by Clonkeen College in the fight to retain its playing fields.  I have raised this issue on numerous occasions in the House.  It was also one of the arguments put to the Minister when they met - that the decision of the Christian Brothers to sell the school's playing fields - essentially to benefit them - would significantly degrade the quality of the unit for children with mild and moderate disabilities that had recently been constructed in the school.  The school has testimony from agencies that cater for children with special needs in the area that the move to profit from a school site by flogging off playing fields to developers will impact significantly and badly on the children with special needs in the unit because of the proximity of the unit to the commercial for-profit development on the green space that surrounds it.  The agencies have pointed out that for children with special needs having an open green area is extremely beneficial and for it to be near the unit.  Now they will be boxed in with a private development because the Minister will not intervene to stop the sale.  In the Bill could we have the power to intervene on the basis of protecting facilities and preventing the degradation of special needs provision if anything was being done to degrade it and that would impact adversely on children with special needs?  That would be a useful addition for the Minister to make to his amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900042#PP00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1527620100,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their general support for the provision.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne is concerned that children are not at the centre of this provision.  It is important to see it in the context of the overall Bill which provides explicitly for the banning of discrimination in school admissions policies based on a child having special needs.  It also provides that the NCSE can compel a school to take an individual child.  In the amendment we are seeking to add an additional power that the NCSE can compel a school to open a special unit.  The child is at the heart of this provision.<\/p>  <p>  I take the point about complexity, but to be fair to the process, the first two elements, effectively, are the NCSE exchanging with the Department to establish that it believes there is a need, checking what the Department has planned to build and confirming that it is building it.  The first two stages of the process are entirely internal to the Department.  It is at that stage that a notice is served.  One can move very quickly to serving a notice where there is a need.  I accept that following these representations may lead to the possibility of arbitration, which may hold up the process.  We are, however, very optimistic that where a school is agreeable, we will considerably beat the seven-month fear of the Deputy.  We hope that in virtually every case the school will be agreeable and that it will be a reserved power, rather than a power we will continually have to exercise.  In a short space of time we have gone from a figure of 548 to 1,304.  Schools are responding.  We have made the arrangements favourable to them by the provision of investment and support.  It provides for additional teachers and SNAs and it is also recognised in other dimensions of support for the school.  It is not true to say we will need to compel a lot of recalcitrant schools to respect children's rights, but there may be cases and we need to be able to deal with them.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to putting funding in jeopardy.  It would, however, be the other children in the school who would carry the cost if one was to start cutting budgets because schools were not delivering in this area to the satisfaction of some.  Compulsion, direction and our making financial provision are all important elements because we are not asking schools to do it without their consent.  I thank Deputies for their support.<\/p>  <p>  I confirm the Department's policy on the allocation of SNAs, which is to ensure every child who has been assessed as having a need for an SNA will receive that support.  This policy has been in place since before my time as Minister and it has always been forthcoming.  The NCSE decides independently.  Admittedly, the decision is made on the basis of diagnostic tests.  That is the system in place.  There are diagnostic tests to establish need, but the decision also takes into account behavioural problems.  We have recently changed the resource teaching model which does not require all of the submissions on diagnostic tests.  We are profiling schools to make it easier and it is working.  Schools report that it is a better system.  The domiciliary care and SNA need tests are not the same.  The domiciliary care test is about the child's financial needs such as for the domiciliary care allowance, while the SNA need test is about the child being able to participate in and complete school.  The tests are different.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kathleen Funchion spoke about some elements of the amendment being cumbersome.  If there is a willingness, it will not prove to be cumbersome.  Should it be required, we have protections to deal with it.<\/p><p> While I take Deputy Barry's point about the larger provision at primary level than at secondary level, the latter is growing faster than the former, which indicates our success in retaining people in the education system.  It was heartening to see Ireland's rate of retention to completion of second level improve, with the drop-out rate halving in the past ten years.  The policy is succeeding in getting people to complete second level.  I expect to see even faster growth in autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units at that level.  Those units are determined by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, based on its own assessment of need.<\/p> <p> Deputy Shortall was right to state that property rights should not block reasonable provision for disability services.  Given that we are making provision for property that is not in State ownership to be allocated to a certain unit, we must be careful to show that what we are doing is properly grounded in the public interest and so on.  We are taking care to ensure that there is no potential for a challenge to what we are doing.<\/p> <p> Regarding Deputy Catherine Martin's point, need decides an allocation.  We are expanding, as the figures show.  We have had a 40% increase in special needs assistants, SNAs, and a similar percentage increase in resource teachers in the past six or seven years.  There is a large allocation.  This is not restricted by a budgetary factor.  That is remarkable, given the period we have been through.  The allocation is made where it is established that a need exists, and that will continue to be the case.  I anticipate that we will continue building capacity.  The new resource teaching model is proving its worth because it is giving greater flexibility.  The Deputy will have seen that we recently announced a pilot in community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 7.  Under it, 75 preschools and 75 schools will have speech and language and occupational therapists provided within the school network.  This will ensure that we not only have the appropriate supports, including SNAs and resource teachers, but that we also integrate them into the school.  That is the right direction of travel.<\/p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the Clonkeen issue, but I cannot comment on it.  I have received an application to dismiss the board.  I have a statutory role in this matter, which I will exercise with the care required under the legislation.  I welcome the Deputy's support for this approach.<\/p> <p> While I see the Deputies' point about the possibility of this proving cumbersome, that will not be the case where there is an acknowledgement by the school, which I hope will be the rule rather than the exception.  On the face of it, the amendment's other elements seem cumbersome, but they are designed to ensure that we meet the legal requirement to make orders robust where they are issued against schools' wishes.  The intent of the amendment is to ensure that a direction issued to a school, even where the school resists it, is not overturned should it be challenged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900042#PP00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527620700,"counter":402,"content":"<p>We will re-examine this amendment before the Bill goes to the Seanad to see whether we can do anything.

It has schools that are overflowing, to exaggerate slightly, with special classes and others that are not accepting their responsibilities.  I thank Mr. Manning for being involved in this legislative process, bringing his direct experience to bear and forcing legislative change.  He made an interesting point, one that I ask the Minister to clarify.  Is it the case that, in special classes at primary level, there is an extra capitation of &euro;682 per annum <i>per capita<\/i>while there is no extra capitation at second level?  That has been suggested to me.  It would be a further disincentive to provide for these classes.<\/p><p>I do not intend to delay the debate.  This amendment is welcome.

Any use of the procedure under amendment No. 29 would need to be careful, but it is welcome.  We are glad to support it and will, bar one or two elements, facilitate all of the Bill's provisions on the basis that this amendment is agreed, will work and will change things for children who need special classes.  ASD units are the commonest type of special class, but amendment No. 29's provisions do not restrict the Bill to them.

As the Minister is aware, the practice in Dublin West has been for the Department to offer ASD units at the time of a new build or, in many instances, a substantial rebuild.  The schools have been positive about this and welcomed it.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know whether the Minister got the point about the cases that I raised with him.  DEIS band 1 schools are often located in areas suffering multiple disadvantages and there may be issues at home for children.  While not necessarily on the autism spectrum, although a number will have elements of that, some of these children will have been referred by, for example, the special needs service of Barnardos.  By and large, Barnardos accepts children into a number of its facilities who have been referred to it by social workers and the like.  Therefore, the level of need is verified and significant.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister would have no difficulty with agreeing that when a child who has been identified as requiring significant special support moves from preschool to junior school at primary level, it is important that the school to which he or she is moving should be able to maintain that framework of support.  On Friday, the Minister published notifications and a list.  If people know their schools' numbers, they can see whether their DEIS band 1 schools have lost SNAs.  When the Minister made his announcement about 800 extra SNAs in schools, I presumed that, simply because of the age cohort of special needs children who were moving into second level, quite a lot of that provision was properly going to secondary schools.  Perhaps he will agree that, in DEIS schools, the principals face a significant educational challenge to do the best for every child.<\/p><p>They work hard at this in the city centre and the west of Dublin.  I know many of the people who work in this arena and they are totally dedicated.  I am saying to the Minister that they are finding the bureaucracy that now accompanies the new system quite difficult.  In some cases, the parents who are bringing their children to primary school may also need support.  This is critically important.  It does not just involve the completion rate which is important for both primary and secondary schools and which has become high.  It is also important that children who have a spectrum of special needs be in a position to receive a special needs assistant, SNA.  I am only taking the examples from my constituency.  On Friday's list schools were losing resources.  Will the Minister commit to publishing, for the sake of the principals involved who have to make appeals, the criteria?  The special education needs organisers, SENO, seem to be independent of the Department.  They are doing it to some extent on a whole-school basis.  There was much discussion of this issue some years ago when it was said this would give better outcomes.  I am disturbed when it is not doing so.  In the case of schools which have welcomed children with special needs, parents have approached them and they are now in a terrible quandary about what will happen in September when they will have more children than for whom they will have special needs assistants.<\/p> <p> The Minister is talking about the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units, many of which are extremely successful.  I support expanding them more generally into other schools.  I want the Minister to look at the issue and tell us if we can get the information on how SNAs are being supplied and what principals are supposed to do, having done everything to welcome children with a variety of special needs into schools.  Some children may not have an ASD, but they may need help in toileting and meeting a range of other needs.  However, they will not be in an ASD unit.  As the Minister knows, with the resource model directed at the school in general, many children will no longer have a dedicated SNA.  Instead they will have one for days or parts of days or the junior school day.  It might be helpful to principals and parents to have published the basis on which the decisions are made.  I was dealing with a significant number of people in distress who will appeal.  I have advised them to do so.  In September, if the additional resources are not forthcoming in a school that has many difficulties, having a withdrawal and a reduction of resources is incredibly difficult for the school staff who then have to manage an increased number of children and do not know why.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900043#QQ00300","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527621300,"counter":405,"content":"<p>To respond to Deputy Thomas Byrne, we provide that the publication of notices issued will happen within seven days of issue.

During the course of Committee Stage I indicated the direction we were taking in our thinking.  As Deputies know, in the intervening period I have had consultations on a number of options on which we did not reach consensus.  I am of the view and have said publicly that I think it is unfair that preference is given by publicly funded religious schools to children of their own faith who live some distance away, ahead of a child of a different religion or no religion.  I also believe it is unfair that parents should feel obliged to baptise their child simply to gain admission to their local school.  The amendments have been designed to make it easier for children to access their local school.  It is a complex issue because there are many contrary views and there are provisions in the Constitution that have to be respected.  I indicated to the committee that I intended to remove the capacity of recognised denominational primary schools, where they were oversubscribed, to use religion as a criterion in their admission process.  The amendments I am bringing forward seek to give effect to that intention.<\/p>  <p>  I have also been conscious of the need to ensure children of minority religions can continue to access their primary schools or schools of a similar minority religion.  Such minority religions add significantly to the diversity of the options on offer and I respect the desire of parents to have their children educated in their own faith, for which we should provide.  I do not believe that, where 18 out of every 20 schools in the primary education system are Catholic, there should be the operation of a provision that gives preference to a Catholic child living a considerable distance away over a local child.<\/p><p>Under the amendments, a recognised primary school will no longer have the protection of the Equal Status Act 2000 if it has as part of its admission policy a criterion that gives a preference to applicants of a particular religion or denomination.<\/p> <p> The amendments will, however, allow a student from a minority religion to seek admission to a recognised primary school that provides a religious instruction or religious education programme that is the same or similar to the religious ethos of the student concerned.<\/p> <p> In this grouping, amendment No. 137 is the specific amendment which provides for the amendment of the Equal Status Act.  The remainder of my amendments in this grouping are consequential to that amendment.  I will deal with them as follows.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 2 amends the Long Title to reflect that this Bill will amend the Equal Status Act 2000.  Amendment No. 22 is consequential to the amendment of the Equal Status Act and updates the references to that Act in the provision of the Bill that makes clear that an appeal under section 29 will not apply where the grounds of appeal relate to the Equal Status Act.<\/p> <p> Amendments Nos. 43 and 44 are also consequential to the amendment I am making to the Equal Status Act 2000.  They update the provisions in the Bill which require schools to reflect in their admission statement the relevant provisions of the Equal Status Act.  Accordingly, in line with the amendments being made to the Equal Status Act, the Bill will now provide that a denominational primary school will not be permitted to state in its admission statement that it does not discriminate where it gives preference to children of its own faith.  A denominational primary school that admits children of a minority religion in accordance with the amended Act will be required to state this in its admission statement.<\/p> <p> These amendments will not change the requirement on all denominational schools to set out that they do not discriminate where they refuse admission where such refusal is essential to maintain ethos and the requirement on denominational post-primary schools to set out that they do not discriminate where they give preference to children of their own denomination, as I am not making any changes to those particular provisions in the Equal Status Act.<\/p> <p> As I outlined, amendment No. 137 is the amendment which makes the changes to the Equal Status Act 2000.  In that regard, it removes, in the case of recognised denominational primary schools, the provision that provides that such schools do not discriminate where they give preference in admission to children of a particular denomination over children not of that denomination, that is, where they use religion as a selection criterion in school admission.<\/p> <p> However, it also provides that a recognised primary school does not discriminate where it admits as a priority a student from a minority religion who is seeking admission to a school that provides religious instruction or religious education consistent with the religious beliefs of the student concerned or a religion similar to that of the student concerned.  The detail of how this will operate is set out in a new section 7A in the Equal Status Act.<\/p> <p> The new section 7A will provide as follows: when making an application for admission to a school, the applicant may provide a statement confirming that the student is a member of a minority religion and wishes to be educated in a school that provides a programme of religious instruction or religious education that is the same or similar to the religious ethos of the student and provides evidence to support the above statement.<\/p> <p> A recognised primary school can decide to admit the student in respect of whom the application is made if it is satisfied that the student is a member of a minority religion and that the school provides a programme of religious instruction or religious education that is the same or similar to the religious ethos of the student.  In satisfying itself as to whether the applicant is a member of a minority religion, a school must only take into account the statement and any evidence submitted by the applicant.<\/p> <p> Schools that admit students of a minority religion in accordance with the provision in the amendment will not be permitted to rank those students according to the particular denomination or religion of the child concerned.  However, applicants may be ranked using the school's other selection criteria if the number of such students seeking admission to a school under this provision is greater than the number of places available.  For the purposes of this provision a minority religion will be defined as a religion whose membership is not in excess of 10% of the population, established by the census and published by the Central Statistics Office.<\/p> <p> In summary, these amendments remove religion as a criterion in school admissions in recognised primary schools while retaining a protection to ensure that a child of minority faith can access a school of his or her faith.  A school will be permitted to admit a student on that basis but will not be compelled to do so.<\/p> <p> As I stated previously, this is a complex area and there are no easy solutions to the problem.  However, I believe that the approach taken is reasonable and proportionate to balance the rights of the three affected groups, namely, minority religious communities, Catholics and non-denominational families and to ensure that no child is disadvantaged.  Minority religious communities because of their small size within the overall population could otherwise find it extremely difficult to access schools of their own religious ethos.  Unlike Catholic schools and Catholic families, these communities need this protection if they are going to continue to be able to access schools of their own religious ethos.  They represent just one out of every 20 schools.<\/p> <p> Catholic families will continue to be able to enrol their children in Catholic schools and Catholic schools will be able to protect their ethos, based on the fact that Catholic schools already make up 18 out of every 20 schools and Catholics make up 78% of the population.  Non-denominational families will now find that for well over 95% of primary schools, which accounts for all schools except minority religion primary schools which admit children of minority religions, they will be treated on the same basis as all other families in primary school admissions.  I hope this commends itself to the House.  It has been a difficult issue on which to develop a robust and workable legislative proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900044#RR01500","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527621900,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I do not know how much evidence we need of the requirement for us to separate church and State completely, but we have had plenty of it in recent days.  To my mind in 21st century Ireland it is just not acceptable to continue any form of religious discrimination in admission to schools or to continue a religious bias, which is imposed on children in a school of a particular ethos on children who do not share that faith or ethos.<\/p>  <p>  I submitted these amendments which allow for that discrimination and the continuation of essentially imposing a religious ethos on people who do not share it in our schools before the astounding result we had in the referendum at the weekend.  If evidence and support was required for the idea that people in this country want a different type of society, we certainly got it at the weekend when it comes to church diktat imposing on the lives, choices and rights of citizens.  Most obviously it was around the question of a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy but everybody knows it was about much more than that.  The exit poll carried out by RT&Eacute; was clear.  There was and still is a lot of debate about what it all meant but the exit poll clarified some of that.  A total of 62% of people who voted said for them the vote was about \"the right to choice\".  That is what people want, namely, the right to choose and to make their own decisions.  It was also about equality.  It was obvious from the preponderance of women in the campaign and its mobilisation that it was about a demand for equality, that they are not putting up with this anymore.  That was the feeling.  We all know it.  We saw a tidal wave of that sentiment demanding a change.<\/p>  <p>  That has obvious implications in terms of the legislation and all that has been discussed today but to my mind it is obvious that it has implications for the relationship between church and State, especially in the area of education and in the area of health, which we should discuss on another day given the unbelievable situation where a religious order will control the national maternity hospital.  However, we will deal with that on another day.  To my mind it is just not tenable anymore that in the aftermath of that vote we are not going to move to separate church and State completely in the education of young people.  Before getting into the detail, I refer to the point made by Deputy Clare Daly.  One of the schools she mentioned was in Booterstown.  I got calls about it.  People complained that when they walked into a national school to vote on the referendum they were confronted with Bibles and statues of the Virgin Mary.  They complained about them but they could not get them removed.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Frankly, they were intimidated by them when they were voted.  Thankfully, the vast majority were not so intimidated that they did not vote \"Yes\", but nonetheless they did genuinely feel that way.  Obviously, I did not know at the time that it was more widespread than that, but Deputy Clare Daly has confirmed that it was widespread throughout the country.  That is because we still allow Catholic domination of schools.  It even impacted on voting during the referendum.  I might mention in passing the statement made today by the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, about the Sisters of Charity and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900045#SS00200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1527622500,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Residential Tenancies (Student Rents, Rights and Protection) Bill 2018: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1527622500,"counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900046#TT00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1527622500,"counter":424,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>I am sharing time.  <\/p>  <p>  Students should not be hit with rent increases of 20% to 30%.  No student should be paying &euro;1,000 per month for student-specific accommodation.  No student should have to pay three times his or her Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, maintenance grant in rent.  Allowing these rents is not just unfair, it is also a barrier to accessing third level education.  From conversations I have had today not just with students but also with senior figures in university management, if it is allowed to continue, it will act as a barrier, forcing young people either out of third level education or into four-hour daily commutes which will impact on their education and student life.  The Bill before us is very simple.  It is about bringing this to an end.  When the Shanowen shakedown protest started in Dublin City University in March, the Government should have acted immediately.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who I note is not present, should have requested the Attorney General to clarify whether student licences were covered under the Residential Tenancies Acts and the rent pressure zone legislation.  Interdepartmental meetings between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Education and Skills were not necessary.  What was required was action.  Instead, as in so many areas, the Government did nothing.  What happened?  The student rent shakedown spread to Galway.  If the Government continues to refuse to act, it will spread to Cork, Limerick, Sligo, Waterford and elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  The solution is very simple.  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 should be amended to ensure student licences are included in the definition of a tenancy; students should be given access to the measures in the rent pressure zone legislation and both landlords and tenants should be given access to the Residential Tenancies Board for dispute resolution.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the important work of Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and his party colleagues on this issue.  From the outset, he has supported the students in DCU and elsewhere and has very similar legislation on the Order Paper which he introduced only recently.  Following conversations today, I welcome his support for this legislation.  I also welcome the public support of other Opposition Deputies and Government backbenchers for the student protests.  We have a great opportunity to speak with one voice and say we stand for fair play for students, that we are going to put an end to the student rent shakedown and that we are going to provide students and their parents with the protection they need.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the Government will not oppose the Bill, but that it has some concerns about the proposed wording.  That is okay.  The eminently more qualified officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government would do a much better job of writing this legislation than my support staff and I would.   If the Minister and his departmental staff do not believe they can support this wording, we have a very simple solution.  All they need do is take the sentiments which I hope will be approved by the D&aacute;il and work them in their own words into the residential tenancies (amendment) Bill which they are finalising and which all of us in the House will then enthusiastically support.  If the Minister does that, we could have the matter resolved by the end of July; students would have the protections they need and this Private Members&rsquo; Bill would no longer be necessary.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that lack of supply is a key part of the student accommodation crisis.  I welcome increased investment in student-specific accommodation, particularly by the European Investment Bank and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.   The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Education and Skills need to work together to lift the borrowing caps on universities to allow them to provide better quality affordable student-specific accommodation.  While private investment is not to be opposed, accommodation must be delivered at a genuinely affordable rate.  Let us not forget that many of the investment funds in the student market are benefiting from very generous tax breaks.  They are global funds that have developed a reputation for aggressively driving down their tax liabilities, while driving student rents ever higher.  That is not the way to resolve the student housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the students involved in the Shanowen and C&uacute;irt shakedown protests for forcing this important issue onto the political agenda.  I urge those students to continue with the protests.  I acknowledge the important work being done by the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and the students' unions in DCU, UCD, Trinity College Dublin, NUI Galway, the IADT and other colleges.  I urge all Deputies in the House to stand by these students and support the Bill.  I desperately urge the Minister to insert amendments into his own legislation to tackle this issue and end the student rents shakedown.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900046#TT00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1527622500,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin, for all of his work in this area.  Everybody knows that there is a housing crisis.  We speak about it regularly here.  Sometimes the fact that students also require accommodation is forgotten about.  A lot of the time students are in very substandard accommodation, as are many renters.  In many cases people are afraid to bring any issue to their landlord because they are always afraid of the dreaded notice to quit.  That is particularly the case for students because there is a theory or idea that students are not the best tenants.  That is an unfair assessment, but it has to be acknowledged that many landlords would say it.  That leads to some of the figures we hear such as that 60% of students have, at some point, had difficulty in trying to get their deposits back.<\/p>  <p>  In the short time I have available I want to focus on people who are coming from rural areas such my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny and many other counties which do not necessarily have a university campus.  Every year many students travel to Dublin, Galway, Cork and other areas.  Moving away from home is a big stage in a person&rsquo;s life.  Seeing one&rsquo;s children fly the nest, for want of better words, is also a big step for many parents.  To think one&rsquo;s kids are going to have to live in substandard accommodation in which they are afraid to raise any issue and for which they will pay extortionate rents is really unacceptable and puts added pressure on students from rural areas.  <\/p>  <p>  The SUSI grant has not been increased in the ten years since 2008.  Students who receive the grant really struggle as it is to live on it and meet the cost of living while staying in education.  Unfortunately, we see a huge number of students dropping out after their first year because they just cannot keep up with the cost of living.  Students from rural backgrounds and areas are doubly disadvantaged because, in addition to trying to pay their fees and meet the cost of living, they also have to pay for rent and are moving into areas they do not necessarily know.  There is a whole bunch of issues in that regard.  Focusing on that aspect, the Bill will help those students.  If they were able to access the services of the Residential Tenancies Board, they would be able to bring difficulties or issues to it.  It would also be a great source of reassurance for parents in sending their children away to know that they had access to the same rights as other renters.  It would also help them to be covered by the rent pressure zone legislation.  The reality is that if something is not done about the level of rent students are paying and the difficulties they have in getting deposits back, many students will end up dropping out.  We have already seen a huge drop-out rate.  Most people will not say it has anything to do with their course but that it has to do with not being able to afford to meet the cost of living and being forced into employment.  We all know that one&rsquo;s chances are increased with a better education; therefore, we should be trying to keep students in education.  <\/p>  <p>  The quality of the place in which one lives and having access to an affordable rented property are big issues, particularly for students from rural areas.<\/p><p>The CAO points will not come out until August, but students are already having to try to find accommodation, even though they do not know what courses they will be offered.  That is an indication of the level of pressure they are under.  I urge Deputies to support the legislation in order that students can be covered by the Residential Tenancies Board and the rent pressure zones and given the same opportunities as other renters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900046#TT00500","speaker":"1266","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527623100,"counter":427,"content":"<p>As we know, Ireland has an accommodation crisis which is particularly prevalent for students.  It is estimated that we need at least 25,000 additional units of student accommodation.  Each year we witness thousands of students scrambling for accommodation.  The lucky ones might be able to find something close to the university or college they are attending, but it is more likely that they will take whatever is available.  If they want to attend university and study for their degrees, they cannot be fussy in a restricted rental market.  Many students face the real prospect of missing out on their courses because they cannot find accommodation.  The demand for student accommodation is far out-stripping supply.  Each new academic year highlights the chronic shortage of rental accommodation for students.  Rental costs have sky-rocketed, particularly in cities such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  The shortage of student rentals is adding extra pressure to the existing problems across the entire housing market.<\/p>  <p>  Many students have a real and legitimate fear that they will not be able to find somewhere to live during the academic year.  Students whose families live near universities and college are considered to be lucky because they can live at home when they are going to college.  Last year, at the beginning of the new college year, it was noted that the level of available rental properties was one of the lowest ever to be recorded.  In the past two years there has been a marked decline in the number of available properties during the months of July and August, which are normally two of the busiest months for the rental market.  This chronic shortage of accommodation has led to escalating rents.  Students also have to struggle with increasing living expenses and third level costs.  The difficulty in finding accommodation, exacerbated by arbitrary and excessive rent increases caused by unregulated student tenancies, is deterring foreign students from coming to study in Ireland.  Students have enough with which to cope.  I have outlined some of the pressures they face.<\/p>  <p>  Last April students from Dublin City University staged sleep-outs to highlight the lack of stability and security in student rentals.  They also highlighted a clear injustice in the rental sector.  The Bill hopes to cover the anomaly in question.  There was significant controversy at Shanowen Square and Shanowen Hall near Dublin City University, in my constituency, when it emerged that rents were set to increase by between 20% and 27% from the last academic year to the coming academic year.  This would have seen monthly rents of between &euro;925 and &euro;966 being charged.  Since 2014 rents in Shanowen Hall have increased by over 100%, which is absolutely crazy.  The Bill has been designed to give protection and rights to students by limiting rent hikes through the use of rent pressure zones.  It is very important for students that Deputies support our Private Members' Bill because it is a signal that we support a rights-based approach to education.  Rents are already far too high.  It is time we stopped this escalation.  We need to protect the rights of students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900047#UU00200","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1527623100,"counter":428,"content":"<p>We are discussing what happens when children who are seeking to go to college, particularly in Dublin, encounter accommodation problems and their families at home try to pay for that accommodation.  We often talk about the presence of free education in our society, but even those who are fortunate enough to receive the maximum SUSI grant cannot afford to send their children to college, especially in Dublin.  Many people in my community in County Leitrim have told me about the cases of students who had their hearts set on a place in a particular college but could not go to it because accommodation was going to be too expensive.  Instead, they accepted courses in other places that were further down their lists because accommodation was somewhat cheaper.  That is a poor reflection on the society in which we live and on where we are as a country.<\/p>  <p>  We pride ourselves on having a highly intelligent and well educated workforce.  The future lies in having a good and intelligent workforce and an excellent education system.  I think everyone in this House and those who are looking in from the outside acknowledge that our efforts to achieve these goals are clearly hampered by the lack of availability of good accommodation for students, particularly in Dublin but also in other parts of the country.  The case of Shanowen Hall near Dublin City University shone a light on this problem earlier this year.  It is a disgrace that students are having to protest to try to find adequate accommodation in which to live.  If that is what we have come to as a society, we need to wake up and realise something serious is wrong.  The commodification of student accommodation, as something that can be bought and sold, is at the heart of what is wrong.  Large companies that have built huge blocks of apartments to use as student accommodation are using it as an opportunity to fleece families that are trying to put their children through college.<\/p>  <p>  I know that the Government will probably acknowledge that there is a problem, but acknowledging it does not go far enough.  It is clear that we need to come to a solution that will ensure tenants in student accommodation are treated with respect, just like any other tenant in any other accommodation across the country.  If we want this to happen, one of the first steps we need to take is to ensure the Bill will receive the full support of the House.  The Government should accept it and put it into law, thereby ensuring students will have the same rights as other tenants.

Cushman and Wakefield reported in their 2017 student accommodation report that there were 60,000 students chasing 35,000 spaces.

As an Teachta Martin Kenny said, this shows that student accommodation has become a means of profit - an opportunity for the private sector to increase profit.  It is a nightmare for students to try to find somewhere to stay and a means of paying exorbitant rents.  Most students at Dundalk Institute of Technology can expect student accommodation to cost almost &euro;500 a month, with many of them paying significantly more.  This is generally for a single room and does not include additional costs such utility bills and heating.  We know that costs are even greater in Dublin, with some students being expected to pay over &euro;900 a month in rent.<\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Student Rents, Rights and Protections) Bill 2018 is one way of tackling these problems.  It will do what it says on the tin.  It is about including\u00a0student licences in the provisions contained in the Residential Tenancies Acts.<\/p><p>This will ensure properties in the affected areas are covered by rent pressure zones and provide access for those living in student properties to the Residential Tenancies Board.  This is a commonsense proposal that has been welcomed by student groups.  It can assist students to stay in full-time education by ensuring they will not be charged exorbitant rents.  I commend the Bill to the House and ask all Deputies and the Government to give it their full support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900047#UU00400","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527623700,"counter":431,"content":"<p>The main objective of the Bill is to allow students the full protection of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2016 in terms of rent predictability measures and other protections specific to tenancy agreements.  The Bill has been introduced in response to the recent price increases in certain privately run purpose-built student accommodation complexes.  One in Dublin 9 has seen an increase of an exorbitant 24% and, more recently, a complex in Galway increased prices by 18%.  The Government understands the Bill is a genuine attempt to improve the position for students at a time of under-supply in the residential rental sector.  Recent excessive rent increases in student accommodation in Dublin and Galway are a cause of significant concern and I have met the DCU and NUIG students' unions to discuss the issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage on the basis that providing rent predictability within student specific accommodation is aligned with the Government&rsquo;s policy of actively addressing barriers to education.  The Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will consider the Bill&rsquo;s approach further as part of a comprehensive review of the student accommodation sector generally.<\/p>  <p>  As acknowledged by the expert group's report on the future funding of higher education, central to our economic well-being is the contribution human capital makes to national competitiveness.  The recognition of the contribution graduates make to the economic growth of Ireland sits alongside the recognition that accommodation costs are a key factor in enabling access to third level education.  The Government is determined to address any barrier to higher education and any limitation on the choice of location or course followed.<\/p>  <p>  Research undertaken by the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, indicates that approximately one third of students live in purpose-built student accommodation, with almost the same number living in the private rented sector.  In the current rental market significant competition for accommodation in the private rented sector is increasing the reliance of students on purpose-built student accommodation.  In light of this, I support the spirit of the Bill and that of Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien of Fianna F&aacute;il, Residential Tenancies (Rent Pressure Zones and Student Accommodation) (Amendment) Bill 2018, as genuine attempts to improve the position for students.  Ultimately, however, price is a function of supply and demand and the Government is working to increase the supply of student accommodation.  One of my first acts as Minister of State last July was to publish the national student accommodation strategy to increase the supply of student accommodation and increase the take up of digs.  It was delivered as part of the Government&rsquo;s housing strategy, Rebuilding Ireland, and is an important element of the housing strategy in ensuring increased levels of student accommodation are available to meet the needs of the growing student cohort.  This, in turn, will help to alleviate the overall shortage of supply in the private rental sector.<\/p>  <p>  Our strategy has set a target of an extra 7,000 bed spaces to be built by the end of 2019 and a total of 21,000 additional beds by 2024.  We are well on target to meet and exceed these numbers.  At the end of April this year 2,990 bed spaces were finished.  An additional 2,354 student beds will be available for the coming academic year, with over 2,800 the following year.  Some 8,445 have planning permission, while 917 are at planning application stage.  We should, therefore, meet, if not exceed, the Rebuilding Ireland targets of 7,000 purpose-built bed spaces by the end of 2019 and 21,000 bed spaces by 2024.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Education and Skills also jointly fund a student accommodation officer within the Union of Students in Ireland.  The USI and the Departments are working, through the interdepartmental working group on student accommodation, to promote and facilitate the provision of digs accommodation as an alternative to both purpose-built student accommodation and the general rental market for students.  I met the Residential Tenancies Board, with the DCU students' union, when the issue of a rent increase arose there.  The Residential Tenancies Board offered to examine any student licence contract submitted to it to ascertain its validity.  I have also asked the Attorney General for advice.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy; the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, and I are working on putting this advice in place.  We need a robust and legislatively sound solution.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal in front of us seeks to apply the protections afforded to tenancies under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to students living in student specific accommodation under licence.  In addition, the Bill aims to grant access to the Residential Tenancies Board's dispute mechanisms to students living in student accommodation under a licence agreement.  It does so by proposing to amend the definition of &ldquo;tenancy&rdquo; to include the phrase &ldquo;and a licence for student specific accommodation&rdquo;.  The Bill also seeks to introduce a definition of &ldquo;licence for student specific accommodation&rdquo;.  The Bill does not define &ldquo;student specific accommodation&rdquo;.  Rent predictability is important.  However, we must ensure we deliver the most appropriate solution to provide predictability for students and their parents, while ensuring the supply of new accommodation is not adversely impacted on.  Rent predictability measures were first introduced by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government under Part 3 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  Rent pressure zones regulate rental increases for tenancies within a rent pressure zone to a maximum of 4% per annum and hold their legal basis under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the annual rent increase limit of 4% does not apply to the following dwellings under tenancies in rent pressure zones: new rental properties, that is, properties that have not been subject to tenancy in the two years prior to an area being designated as a rent pressure zone; and rental properties that, during the period since the last rent was set, have been substantially refurbished or changed in nature.  In the main, it is understood seeking to bring student accommodation under the Residential Tenancies Act has the potential to impact on the wider rental market; thus it is imperative that in seeking to find a solution to this complex issue, we exercise extreme caution in order that we may ensure the longevity of the solution.<\/p><p>This is a difficult balancing act of ensuring the vital protection of our students and increasing the availability of affordable student accommodation, while ensuring the constitutionally protected rights of property owners.  Earlier this month, I met my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy English, to progress the issue of rent certainty in purpose-built student accommodation.  The interdepartmental working group on student accommodation is urgently examining all the issues around student accommodation types and pricing.  It will consider the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill as part of this work.  It will also consider whether bespoke legislation or amending existing legislation is the best way forward.<\/p> <p> The Government strongly supports and has taken important actions to seek to ensure sufficient supply of affordable student specific accommodation provided under licence.  It is important that legislation in this area is legally robust and does not give rise to unintended consequences with, for example, planned future provision of affordable student specific accommodation.  If this work finds that there is a policy-based case for legislation in this area, proposals will be brought forward either in a standalone Bill or in the context of two Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bills envisaged this year.  The first of these is expected in mid-June.<\/p> <p> For the reasons I have set out, the approach proposed in this Private Members' Bill will not be successful in achieving its objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900048#VV00200","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527624300,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Given the custom to circulate ministerial speeches, it might be helpful to get the Minister of State's speech to Members as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900049#WW00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1527624300,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Casey, Scanlon and Cahill.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1527624300,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I have discussed it in the context of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Residential Tenancies (Rent Pressure Zones and Student Accommodation) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill.  Somewhere between those two Bills, there is certainly a way forward.\r\n\r\nWe all agree there is a major issue with student rents.  I commend the USI and the student unions from DCU, NUIG and other universities which brought this to the fore.  It was initially brought to the fore in DCU and followed on in C&uacute;irt na Coiribe in NUIG.  It is incumbent on us to act.  That is why this Bill, if married with others, is useful.\r\n\r\nMuch of what the Minister of State stated is broadly positive.  However, her speech was missing specifics on delivery dates.  On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, I fully agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin&rsquo;s suggestion that the Government&rsquo;s Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill, which will be brought forward over the coming weeks, should contain a section to deal with student accommodation.  Not to speak on behalf of all Opposition parties, but if that is not forthcoming from the Government, the Opposition parties can bring forward and pass an amendment to that Bill.\r\n\r\nThe Minister of State criticised one aspect of the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, namely, the absence of a definition of &quot;student accommodation&quot; because the Bill refers only to &quot;a license for student specific accommodation&quot;.  To be helpful to all sides, the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill defines student accommodation.  I am not sure why we are waiting for the Attorney General's advice on student accommodation.  Our Bill stated &quot;tenancy under subsection (4) also applies to the use of student accommodation as defined in section 13(d) Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 during academic term times.&quot;  The Government and the law defines what purpose-built student accommodation is.  We can start with that.  That would be an eminently sensible suggestion.\r\n\r\nI discussed with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, some time ago what advice in particular we are looking for from the Attorney General.  Is it the treatment of a licence arrangement vis-&agrave;-vis a tenancy?  What we and Sinn F&eacute;in have proposed is to actually treat the licence as a tenancy agreement.  I am not sure what we are looking for from the Attorney General.  We have given a definition for student accommodation under the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.\r\n\r\nTime is of the essence.  There has been progress made in the provision of purpose-built units.  Deputy Adams rightly referred to 32,000 purpose-built units.  The Minister of State stated that, by way of the national accommodation policy document, there will be a further 21,000 units.  While this is all good, how do we regulate the price people will pay?  I disagree with the Minister of State that price is solely a function of supply and demand.  That basically is a Fine Gael mantra of leaving it to the market.  I accept supply does affect price.  However, it does not mean the Government cannot intervene.  In fact, the Government has intervened with rent pressure zones, an intervention which has worked to some degree.  We can try it with student rents.  I do not see why we need to wait.\r\n\r\nI agree with the spirit of the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill which we will support.  The Minister of State alluded to the fact that the Government will not oppose it on Second Stage.  That in itself is welcome.  The question is what we do next.  In June, when the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill comes forward, the Government should bring forward an amendment to it.  I do not believe that would be bad law.  We have definitions and there is an opportunity for everyone across the House to work on it.  It would show the student body that the Oireachtas is serious about dealing with students' problems.  I have met students who have had to leave or could not go to college because they could not afford rents.  No Member or the Minister of State responsible wants to see that.\r\n\r\nI respectfully suggest the Minister of State talks with the Department and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to bring an amendment forward.  If the Government does not do so, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party and other parties will work together to ensure the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill is amended to include student accommodation.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1527624300,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate tonight on the Residential Tenancies (Student Rents, Rights and Protections) Bill 2018 which reflects Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s policy on this often overlooked part of our widespread housing crisis involving student accommodation.  I am conscious there are students tonight in Wicklow and elsewhere busy finalising their preparations for the leaving certificate examinations.  The leaving certificate is the completion of many years of hard work for many to ensure the prospect of third level college will be the next phase of their lives.  I wish all the students and their parents the best of luck in the coming weeks.  I urge them to take time to enjoy the fine weather and to relax whenever it is possible during this period.<\/p>  <p>  The joy that many students and parents will experience when the results come out in August will, unfortunately, be quickly replaced by the reappearance of stress when the race to find student accommodation begins.  Every year in Wicklow this frantic and unfair race takes place at a time which should be filled with happiness and satisfaction as parents and students take the pleasure in the transition from second to third level education.  Instead, it is a frantic and sometimes fruitless search for safe, affordable and available accommodation.  Many students in Wicklow have been forced to become commuters before they even start a career as the lack of student accommodation in Dublin, Carlow, Waterford and elsewhere forces them to stay at home.  There must be a better way to address this.  Apart from increasing supply, which is an ongoing process, there must be measures to curb the unjustified rent increases which are currently up to 27% in some Dublin third level colleges.<\/p><p> It is astonishing for high-minded liberal centres of high learning to be so ruthless in taking advantage of students.  I have seen excellent expertise-based evidence generated for policy proposals from many academics at the housing committee and at Fianna F&aacute;il policy meetings.  They are ashamed at the management practices within some third level institutions.  They believe the accommodation crisis is being cynically exploited to extract more cash from students and their families.  In St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, student accommodation was raised by 43% from &euro;3,200 to &euro;4,572 in 2016.  The State and the Government funds third level colleges through fees and the Higher Education Authority and is, therefore, a passive partner in what is a totally unjust regime.  It is sometimes difficult to listen to Ministers speak of how they are solving the student accommodation crisis when in fact they are allowing third level colleges to exploit students and their families.<\/p> <p> The Fianna F&aacute;il Bill mirrors this Bill.  It would expand rent pressures zones to student accommodation units.  This would prevent and slow down the rack-renting that is occurring with the connivance of third level management.  Students and their families have enough pressures to cope with.  The financial strain caused by the vast increase in student accommodation rents is contributing further to the difficulties in access for families with lower incomes.<\/p> <p> Access to third level education for all in Ireland rather than only the select few is a core principle of Fianna F&aacute;il republican thinking.  I hope the Government wakes up to the needs of students.  After all, I know of too many Wicklow students who have to get up early in the morning to travel a long distance to college.<\/p> <p> We must ensure that the quality of student accommodation is maintained at a high level and that the outside of college term the controls are removed to allow other legitimate activities.<\/p> <p> I wish to make another remark in a personal capacity.  I am aware of many Bills that are similar, including, in some instances, Bills with Government support.  Given the spirit of new politics and a fragmented D&aacute;il with a minority Government, I hope that it will be possible to see if parties could agree on delivering those Bills with broad approval.  I welcome tonight's consensus among Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Minister of State.  After all, legislation should not be about claiming credit, but rather serving the citizens of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900049#WW00600","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527624900,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I wish to lend my support to the Bill.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Deputy Funchion for bringing the Bill to the House tonight.<\/p><p>I fully support the Bill to expand the provision of rent pressure zones to cover purpose-built student accommodation.  The Bill basically reflects an identical Fianna F&aacute;il measure brought in by Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  The measure would apply the provisions of rent pressure zones that limit rent increases to 4% per annum to student accommodation.<\/p><p>As of today, almost 19,000 have signed an online petition calling on the Government to work with universities to create more affordable accommodation and to prevent private companies and landlords from exploiting legal loopholes that allow them to charge whatever they wish to students.<\/p><p>Shanowen Square is a privately-owned student residence near DCU.  In common with all student accommodation it is rather basic.  The apartments comprise four single bedrooms and a shared living, kitchen and dining area.  I will outline the rise in the cost of this accommodation for the academic year, which is 34 weeks in duration.  In the 2016-17 academic year the cost was &euro;6,120 plus a deposit of &euro;350.  In the 2017-18 academic year, the cost is &euro;7,000 plus a deposit of &euro;350.  In the 2018-19 academic year, the cost will be &euro;8,695 plus a deposit of &euro;400.  The Minister of State will understand the widespread outrage of parents and students when she examines these figures.  This represents an increase of more than 40% since last year<b><\/b>in Shanowen Square.  This cannot be allowed to continue; there is no question about that.  Some people have contacted me to say that the accommodation does not even have working Wi-Fi.  Although Wi-Fi is very important for students, they do not even have that basic facility.  Similar accommodation in a nearby privately-owned student complex, Gateway Student Village on Ballymun Road, has increased to &euro;9,980 for 2018-19.  I understand that deposits are being retained as part of the fee and are not being returned.  They should be returned if there is to be any law in the country.  By comparison, on-campus accommodation is priced between &euro;5,729 and &euro;6,396 for the same academic year.  The numbers of students applying for this accommodation far exceeds the numbers of places available.  Thus, the accommodation is distributed in a supposedly random lottery system.  Students who are not successful in securing a place must resort to the privately owned complex in Shanowen Square.  They are forced into this situation.<\/p><p>C&uacute;irt na Coiribe in Galway recently revealed plans to raise rent by 18% for the next academic year.  It is most concerning and unfair that these rent increases are being announced around examination time as it gives people no time to gather or get a deposit in.  In a statement C&uacute;irt na Coiribe defended its decision on the basis that the rent hike was in line with wider student accommodation markets in Galway.<\/p><p>Student apartments in Cork coming on-stream for next term have prices greater than &euro;900 per month for one-bedroom units.  That is more expensive than a mortgage repayment on many family homes.<\/p><p>We have no wish to see students having to fork out outrageous rent costs for accommodation.  This is affecting rural families more than most.  When children reach third level the costs to families soar.  Students have no choice but to live away from home and so incur accommodation and travel costs.  All this coincides with the loss of child benefit.<\/p><p>People are infuriated each year to hear various politicians expressing outrage at accommodation costs for students.  This usually happens around the month of August but invariably nothing happens.  We want to see changes.  What we need is cross-party political pressure and action to put an end to the extortionate rip-off policies of these private companies.  The escalating cost of student accommodation is simply unacceptable.  The 2015 report of the Higher Education Authority shows that the number of students in full-time third level education is set to rise from 168,000 in 2014 to 193,000 by 2024.  That is a rise of 25,000 students.  Thousands of units of student accommodation are either being built or are in the planning stages in cities throughout the country, with the majority in Dublin where the demand is greatest.  The new units being built are generally high-end en suite rooms with shared spaces.  Generally they cost between &euro;220 and &euro;270 per week.  Purpose-built student accommodation is not covered under the Residential Tenancies Act and is not under the jurisdiction of the Residential Tenancies Board.  This means students staying in such accommodation are not classed as tenants and do not have many of the same protections afforded to tenants.  Our Bill addresses this anomaly.  Dublin city is covered by rent control legislation introduced in late 2016.  The legislation prevents landlords from raising the rents by more than 4%.  However, this does not apply to licensees.  That is what allows Shanowen Square to raise the rent in the buildings by over 25%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900050#XX00200","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1527624900,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Since it is some days before the examinations start, it is appropriate to wish all students who are sitting examinations in the coming weeks the best of luck.  The discussion relates to student accommodation in third level.  Many of the students sitting examinations will be entering that phase of their lives. <\/p>  <p>  The pressure on families to support their children in third level education is extraordinary.  Middle-income families who do not qualify for Student Universal Support Ireland grants are being bled dry by out-of-control student rents.  This must be brought under control.  The cost of student accommodation out-of-term is up to 40% cheaper.  While demand is obviously greater during term time, such a great difference in rent is unacceptable.  I have spoken to many families in my constituency of Tipperary whose children are studying throughout the country.  The story is always the same.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill to expand the provisions of rent pressure zones to cover purpose-built student accommodation.  The Bill reflects a similar measure brought forward by Deputy Darragh O'Brien recently.  Student accommodation is currently not covered by the 2016 Act as it constitutes a licence to reside similar to a hotel rather than a tenancy.  This Bill extends the rent pressure zones rent cap of 4% to student accommodation by extending the definition to encompass student accommodation.  The Bill comes in light of vast increases of up to 27% per annum in student accommodation.  Fianna F&aacute;il has also brought forward legislation to strengthen regulation of rental market by empowering the relevant authority to undertake investigations, expand rent limits and increase supply.<\/p><p>Our Bill applies the rent pressure zone system solely to purpose-built student accommodation during academic term times and will not impact on other rights or schemes, including the rent-a-room scheme.  Data from national student accommodation policy documents indicates that this would impact on approximately 33,000 current students in purpose-built student accommodation.  It will eventually cover the anticipated 21,000 additional student places due by 2024.  Fianna F&aacute;il has also put forward a suite of measures to strengthen protections in the rental sector.<\/p> <p> Ireland's student numbers are increasing significantly.  The number of students in full-time third-level education is set to increase from 168,000 in 2014 to 193,000 by 2024, or 25,000.  Taking this into account, the HEA concluded in 2014 that there was a deficit of approximately 25,000 student beds and that number was set to increase significantly.  Following this report, the number of private international companies providing purpose-built student accommodation has jumped significantly.  Currently, there are 33,000 student places with further increase of 20,000 additional units due to come on stream by 2024.  Thousands of units of student accommodation have been built or are in the planning stages in cities around the country.<\/p> <p> We must address the quality of accommodation by overhauling the RTB to provide it with new investigative powers and extra resources, stronger certification and inspection of rental properties and stronger rights to remove rogue tenants.  We must increase supply by financing new build-to-rent units, implementing an empty-property refurbishment grant and offering assistance to involuntary landlords in negative equity.  The new units which have been built are generally high end with rooms in shared spaces costing between &euro;220 and &euro;270 per week.  Purpose-built student accommodation is not covered by the Residential Tenancies Act and is not under the jurisdiction of the RTB.  It is covered by license-to-reside agreements similar to those for hotels or the rent-a-room sector.  Students staying in this type of accommodation are not classed as tenants and lack the protections afforded to others.  Our Bill addresses this anomaly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900050#XX00300","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527625500,"counter":442,"content":"<p>The Labour Party will support the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  We support fully what it intends to achieve.  While it is good that the Government is not opposing the Bill, I do not fully understand the issues raised by the Minister of State, including the definitions issue which Deputy O'Brien has addressed, but also the issue around constitutional property rights.  If we have created rent pressure zones without having a constitutional problem, notwithstanding the fact that they control the level of rent the owners of private property can get, I cannot see why there would be a constitutional problem in relation to student accommodation.  I support the suggestion that the Government should incorporate the Bill's proposals in its own Bill which is due to come before the House in mid-June.  We all want to make this happen.  If they can be included in a Government Bill, they are likely to be introduced sooner than they would by way of an Opposition Bill.  That is particularly so now that so many Opposition Bills are stacked up to be dealt with by the housing committee.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most serious issues arising here is the fact that there are many barriers to higher or further education, in particular for people who do not have as much advantage as others or a tradition of proceeding to third level, without adding accommodation being another one.  That is probably the most important issue in this case.  People who come from relatively well-off backgrounds may not have to skip college or drop out due to accommodation costs, but there are others who will face that scenario, which is the important aspect of this.  The problem has been articulated by others.  I attended the protest by DCU students outside the D&aacute;il a few weeks ago in relation to what has become known as the \"Shanowen shakedown\".  It has also become an issue at NUIG with C&uacute;irt na Coiribe.  The increases students and their parents face are huge.  Deputy Scanlon indicated that, for 2018, &euro;8,695 plus a deposit will be required while Deputy Ellis said accommodation would cost between &euro;925 and &euro;966 per week.  This is huge money.  Deputy Scanlon also referred to on-campus accommodation costing &euro;5,000 to &euro;6,000 per annum, which shows that we need a great deal more publicly-built student accommodation as well as to control the private sector.<\/p>  <p>  I notice that my own city of Limerick was not referred to when Deputy &Oacute; Broin was talking about this in the media earlier.  Part of the reason is that Limerick in general and the University of Limerick in particular have a much higher proportion of public student accommodation per head than the other university towns and cities.  In effect, that ensures we do not have the same cost problems in Limerick as one sees in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  I have statistics for 2014 which set out that there were 6,500 public units in Dublin, 813 in Cork, 764 in Galway, 446 in Waterford and 2,590 in Limerick.  One of the reasons is that the University of Limerick sits on a large campus that is not in the city centre.  Either way, the statistics show huge cost increases.  Trinity College Dublin's students' union carried out research in April 2016 which showed that the average rent for students totalled &euro;490 per month while the maximum was &euro;704.  There has been a huge jump from that to the &euro;900 per month and more in DCU now.  I assume that with TCD being in the centre of Dublin, the cost of private student accommodation is even greater again.<\/p>  <p>  We need to see control as well as more public student accommodation.  There is an onus on both the Department and the higher education institutions themselves to provide student accommodation where they are also increasing student numbers.  The proposal with which we are dealing, however, is about ensuring rent pressure zones are applied to student accommodation in the private sector, which is eminently sensible.  Otherwise, private providers will be able to charge whatever the market allows them to.  We have seen that grow exponentially over the past couple of years.  As such, it is imperative to control it.  Private providers will charge whatever they can get.  We have heard the statistics on the increase thus far as well as on the projected increase in the number of extra places by 2024.  That will happen and more students will come into the system.  Unless something is done quickly, those who provide private accommodation will charge whatever they can get.  Whatever they can get will be whatever hard-pressed parents and mature students paying for themselves can pay.  The alternative is that people cannot go to college.<\/p>  <p>  This is a serious issue, in particular in terms of ensuring that students and their families are not priced completely out of attending college if they are not lucky enough to live near a third level institution in the first place.  Students who have to live away from home while they are in college face exorbitant rents which are likely to increase further if a stop is not put to this.  The legislation is necessary.  I commend Sinn F&eacute;in for moving it and I express the Labour Party&rsquo;s support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900051#YY00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1527626100,"counter":443,"content":"<p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Deputy Barry is sharing his time with Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900052#ZZ00050","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1527626100,"counter":444,"content":"<p>We are discussing the issue of student accommodation and the rip-off of students by unscrupulous landlords.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor, acknowledges the need for change but states we must proceed with extreme caution and that we have a difficult balancing act.  I would argue that we must proceed with extreme urgency and must rebalance the respective rights decisively in favour of those students who currently face quite shocking levels of exploitation.  I will give some examples from Cork city to illustrate precisely what I am talking about.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Minister of State aware that this year, at least three students of the Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, study by day but sleep in their cars at night because they cannot afford the rip-off rents being charged by the landlords in the locality?  One sleeps in one's car, gets up early in the morning, goes into the gym, showers and brushes one's teeth.  One then goes and does a day&rsquo;s study and whatever one is doing in the evening, after which one goes back to sleep in one's car.  I refer to not one student but at least three students.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Minister of State aware, for example, that in the suburb of Bishopstown, Cork, where the Cork Institute of Technology is situated, some rents are a little bit lower?  The reason for this is that the bedrooms in the houses have been partitioned, not into spaces for five or six students, but for nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 students.  There are 15 partitioned spaces in one house and rent of &euro;400 per month for each space being charged.  There are at least 25 such houses.  Many of them are owned by one landlord.  If there are between nine and 15 students in each of those houses, that is more than 200 and possibly not far off 400 students.  The landlords have tried to comply with the law - to avoid being got at - by operating in the same way as a hostel would operate but this is completely immoral.  Someone who spoke to me today about that situation stated that one would not put an animal in those houses and yet those are the conditions for some CIT students in 2018.  I have plenty of other examples here but I do not want to eat into Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s time.<\/p>  <p>  There must be not extreme caution but extreme urgency and a real rebalancing of rights.  The rights that exist for other tenants should exist for students and be extended beyond that as well for both sections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1527626100,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for bringing forward this Bill.  Obviously, we will support it.  It is right that student accommodation should be brought under the remit of the RTB in order that the sector can benefit from some of the protections, in terms of the rent caps and other protections, that are available to tenants in the private rented sector.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin acknowledged, as did Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, who had brought a similar Bill forward, that students&rsquo; correct determined decision to protest against outrageous rent increases by private landlords who own student property, particularly the DCU Shanowen shakedown protests but also, more recently, the protests around similarly shocking rent increases in Galway, has forced the issue onto the agenda.  I should also mention that while the protest Trinity students held recently was to a large extent about the repeat fees, it had also been preceded by attempts by the college to significantly increase rents for the on-campus accommodation.  It is good the students are fighting back.  It is important that we here listen and do something.  Therefore, I absolutely support this move.<\/p>  <p>  However, I will go a little bit further and say that it is not enough.  The problem is that rents are already too high.  Limiting the increases, as would be done if we bring student accommodation under the RTB, to 4% is no good when student accommodation is already too expensive.  It is better than nothing - at least, it prevents totally extortionate further increases - but it does not deal with the problem that student accommodation is already way beyond what is acceptable in terms of affordability for significant numbers of students, leading, as Deputy Barry stated, to shocking cases where people sleep in cars or where students are simply dropping out of college because they or their parents cannot afford the rents which have been allowed to reach the present extortionate levels.<\/p>  <p>  Student accommodation, if one can get it, is averaging between &euro;700 and &euro;1,000 a month.  Student grants are a maximum of &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 a year.  If one is a less well-off student, or one of those who is not eligible for grants but whose parents might not have that much money, one is in trouble.  It is a real problem.<\/p>  <p>  It is a major problem that so much of the planned student accommodation the Government hopes will come on stream will be delivered by the private sector rather than the universities themselves building student accommodation that is set at affordable levels because, even if we bring it under the RTB, the providers can set the price of all the new accommodation at whatever they like.  After that, they might be limited, if this Bill is passed, to an increase of 4% but when it is first rented they can charge whatever they like, and they are likely to charge rents that are completely unaffordable for students.  Something has to be done to stop that from happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900052#ZZ00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1527626100,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in, and, indeed, Fianna F&aacute;il previously, for placing a spotlight on this area.  I have no hesitation in supporting this Bill and the limited protections being sought for student accommodation under the tenancy board.<\/p>  <p>  However, like the previous speaker, I would say that the crisis in student accommodation is simply a symptom of what is being allowed to happen.  I live in a city, Galway, where there are two third level institutions, as well as the Galway Technical Institute.  We have approximately 25,000 students.  If anything illustrates the emptiness, if I might put it like that and I could use a much stronger word, of repeated Government policy, it is the fact that right beside the GMIT on the Dublin Road, there is a hotel that has been empty for over ten years.  The hotel should have been used for student accommodation.  It should have never been sold by the State in the first place.  When it was sold, it was held in private ownership for a period and then left empty.  It still remains empty on the Dublin Road, if the Minister wishes to go to see it.  It highlights what has happened in Ireland with our reliance on the market.  That hotel should have been taken back into State ownership and used for student accommodation, which would have helped relieve the difficulties in Galway.<\/p>  <p>  Galway is a city that I have used repeatedly as an example because the crisis there is far worse than that in Dublin, in my opinion, based on the facts.  We have people waiting on a waiting list from 2002 who never once received an offer of accommodation.<\/p><p>That illustrates it.  We have somewhere between 13,000 and 15,000 people, depending on which statistics we use, on a waiting list.  The Simon report, &ldquo;Locked Out of the Market&rdquo;, a snapshot study in March of this year is really worth looking at.  They go through various towns and cities and they confirm the limited number of properties available.  Bear in mind that the Government&rsquo;s strategy is utterly reliant on the private market and we have twisted language to talk about social housing, which is really private accommodation with a housing assistance payment.  That is what we are reliant on and then we look at Galway and there was an average of 15 properties available to rent in Galway city centre over the three days of the study.  Much worse than that, not a single property was available within the four categories allowed under the housing assistance payment.  There was no property available under the single category, for a couple, for a couple with one child or for a couple with more children.  We are utterly reliant on the housing assistance payment and there are no properties available.  To make it even worse, the discretion allowed for an increase of 20% still does not allow anyone in Galway to access property under the housing assistance payment.<\/p> <p> We have to put this in context.  In addition, in Galway the figures for homelessness on 27 April, and I failed to get the more up to date figures, showed 21 families with children in hotels and bed and breakfasts.  We only have a population of something over 70,000.  There were two couples in bed and breakfasts, three single people in bed and breakfasts, two families in transition and a further large family was staying somewhere else.  Interestingly, this was in addition to the Fairgreen hostel and the Osterley hostel which looks after women.  Then we have the new language.  Throughout the winter, approximately ten county clients used the cold weather response bed.  We have another system called the harm reduction packs; that is a sleeping bag plus food.  That is what we are reduced to in Galway, giving out a harm reduction pack.<\/p> <p> I am not here to give out.  I am just over two years in the D&aacute;il and I have used that time to highlight issues and offer solutions.  We have any amount of land zoned residentially in Galway city bought at huge prices.  I am asking the Minister why we are not building houses.  I checked before I came in here and we plan to build 74.  We have not built one single house since 2009.  Some of the zoned land went back under the land aggregation scheme, some of it is in Galway and we are paying millions in interest alone, not to mention the loans, and the land is just sitting there.  We are not building on it so one has to ask the question &ldquo;what is going on here?&rdquo;.<\/p> <p> A number of things are going on.  First, there is absolutely no sense of urgency from what I can see between the city council and the Government on monthly reports and updates.  Second, a scandalous amount of that land, and I understand it is more than two thirds, has been set aside for a road that is most unlikely to go ahead but with the best will in the world will go ahead in 2024.  Residential land bought at a huge price is left sitting there for a road in the future that will certainly not help us to comply with our obligations under climate change.<\/p> <p> I live in the Claddagh.  I have spent the last two years trying to find out why one house remains empty.  Prior to it becoming vacant, it housed a family.  There was nothing wrong with the house but it has remained empty.  I do not wish to be parochial in any way but this illustrates the lack of urgency.  It is a lovely house in a residential area remaining empty for up to two years.  The latest explanation for that is that it now suddenly requires major works, which they did not seem to realise earlier.  That is one example out of approximately 70 properties that we know.<\/p> <p> I am listening to the Government talking about the provision of social housing when really it is talking about a housing assistance payment.  Here we have the students coming forward.  I really welcome the draft legislation but it is just a symptom.  How many more symptoms do we have to raise in this D&aacute;il before the Government realises that reliance on the market is simply making the problem worse?  If we keep paying for and propping up the market it will make matters much worse.  There has not been a single direct construction of student specific accommodation by either of the colleges in Galway.  That is an absolute disgrace.  They are now looking at building accommodation &ndash; after the horse has bolted.  We are now also in a situation where we have jumped from 2011 where we had 19% of our population in rented accommodation, that was approximately 305,377 households, which has now gone up to almost half a million households reliant on the private market and still the penny has not dropped.  I appreciate that the Government inherited difficulties but I see no urgency and I use Galway city and County Galway as an example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900052#ZZ00400","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527626700,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I support this Bill to give students in student specific accommodation under licence the full protections of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, including access to the Residential Tenancies Board and inclusion in the rent pressure zones.  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing it forward.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that it is an extremely expensive time for parents of college students.  We need to look at ways to ease the burden for parents.  I am aware that many parents would place more than one security deposit on student accommodation over the summer months ahead of the announcement of college places in order to secure accommodation for their child.  This is grossly unfair to parents as until college places are offered, they cannot say with certainty what accommodation their child will need.  These parents end up losing a substantial amount of money in these security deposits.  Landlords of these student lettings are not left out of pocket.  As we all know, there is such a high demand for student accommodation that once a parent withdraws his or her interest from the accommodation the place will be filled immediately.  We need to put in laws on protection of security deposits in student accommodation prior to college places being announced.  No parent should have to fork out multiple deposits in order to secure college accommodation for their child.  I recognise that the Student University Support Ireland, SUSI, grant system was introduced in 2012 and is a welcome support for parents and students but in the past there has been a delay in the time it takes for grant applications to be processed, thereby leading to a delay in payments which puts parents under major financial difficulty.  While I welcome the improvements which have been introduced by SUSI in 2016 to 2017, including an earlier application opening date, I still urge the Minister to ensure that grant applications are processed and payments are made on time for this year.<\/p>  <p>  As students rents have become so expensive and the availability unsuitable, more students have taken to commuting to college by means such as a public bus service.  I have heard first hand from my constituents who use the public bus service that it can cost them approximately &euro;66.50 for a five day student travel pass.  This is a huge cost for parents and students.<\/p>  <p>  We recognise that we have a housing crisis in the country and a lack of adequate student accommodation.  If more students were given the option to commute from their home towns to college this would take pressure off the current lack of student accommodation but these students need to be provided with a cost efficient bus service with suitable routes, coinciding with their college start and finish times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900053#AAA00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1527626700,"counter":449,"content":"<p> I am glad to get the opportunity to speak on this very important matter this evening.  I support the call that certainty and fairness be applied to rents for students in third level education.  Students and parents, especially those who cannot access SUSI - and many middle income earners are not entitled to a grant - find themselves under immense financial pressure to go through the third level education process.  Accommodation, college fees, living expenses and travel can easily exceed &euro;9,000 and even &euro;10,000 for each student.<\/p><p>Students from all around Kerry have long distances to travel to Cork, Limerick, Galway, Dublin and Waterford from places like Lauragh, Kenmare, Cahirciveen, Dingle, Tralee, Killarney, Listowel and all the places in between.  These are savage distances to reach their accommodation and their colleges.  I have seen students who work during their holidays and at weekends and who earned between &euro;3,000 and &euro;5,000, if they had a good job, at weekends, holidays and bank holidays to help their parents but that puts their parents over the threshold and deprives them of the grant.  This anomaly should be rectified because it is good for students and youngsters to work.  If they start off by working they will continue working.  They can easily go the wrong way, the easy way, if they do not start off by working.  It is vital that something be done to ensure that, whatever else happens, the money the student earns is not included in the assessment for the grant application.  I appeal to the Minister of State to consider that because I have seen it hurt them when it is taken into account in the parents&rsquo; assessment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900053#AAA00300","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527627300,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I compliment and thank Sinn Fein on introducing this Bill.  It is very important to acknowledge the trials and tribulations that students and their parents go through in trying to get, and better themselves through, third level education.  My brother has rightly outlined the enormous expense involved and the torture in the racket of trying to get accommodation, which can be quite frightening and extraordinarily expensive.<\/p>  <p>  It is right to say that students work very hard and diligently trying to make as much money as they can to help their parents with the massive costs but then it comes back on them.  I have seen numerous cases where the genuine hard and good work of the student has adversely affected the parents, in that all of a sudden they do not qualify for a grant, just because they put in that effort, because they worked on Saturdays and Sundays and did their level best.  They were up in the morning instead of not being out.  We want to encourage the young people of today to work at every opportunity.  We get only one shot at life and it is not a practice run, it is only right and proper to work at every level and in every way we can.  That is only the right thing to do and we want to encourage them to do it and not let them think that if they work now to earn their few bob and save, it will come back and hurt their parents.<\/p>  <p>  The other problem is the availability of accommodation.  Every obstacle is put in the way of the people who try to provide the accommodation.  That is wrong.  Before now there were incentives.  I am not saying every incentive was right because some of those incentives had an opposite effect by blowing into the bubble of increasing the value of properties and that was not right.  Surely to God there is some sensible and practical way to encourage people to make more accommodation.  It is a question of supply and demand.  If there is more good-quality accommodation available for students, it helps bring down the overall cost instead of people in a mad panic trying to get accommodation.  It is very difficult for parents.  It is a very stressful time when people do not have disposable money and are really struggling to save to better their children, to improve their lives.  I should have declared at the beginning that it could be perceived that I would have an interest in this type of business as well but my job now is to speak on behalf of the constituents I am elected to represent, their parents, the students and their grandparents.

I commend Sinn Fein and Deputy &Oacute; Broin on bringing it forward.  This Bill seeks to expand the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 to apply to students living in student accommodation.  It is not a complicated issue and seeks to extend rights to students, which they should not have to demand, the basic rights of any tenant be included in rent pressure zones and have access to the Residential Tenancies Board.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is sorely needed as in recent months we have seen several instances of enormous and frankly exploitative rent hikes in student accommodation.  In DCU, students in Shanowen Square last March were faced with the announcement of a 27% increase in rent for the academic year 2018-19.  Earlier this year students in C&uacute;irt na Coiribe in National University Galway, NUIG, were faced with an increase of up to &euro;1,000 for 2018-19.  That hike came in the middle of examinations, leaving students with huge decisions to make in a very short space of time if they wanted to secure accommodation for next September. The level of stress and anxiety this caused for students in the middle of an examination period is entirely and absolutely unfair in dealing with any tenants.  To put it simply, students are being exploited.  We, and many other parties on the left, have sought greater security of tenure for tenants and for more stringent caps on rent.  It is remarkable to think that none of these might be applicable to students without this much-needed legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  The lack of investment in student support has resulted in third level institutions pushing more and more of the burden onto students.  We saw this in the Trinity College Dublin protests at supplemental examination fees.  It is not right or fair and something needs to be done because students are feeling too great a burden through lack of investment and are being forced to carry the cost.  I welcome this move to bring students further into the fight to ensure greater rights for tenants of all descriptions and I call on the Government to move quickly to support this Bill&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas or, if there are definitional issues to be addressed, as the Minister of State has indicated, that it moves quickly to incorporate it into its own legislation to be enacted as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900054#BBB00300","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1527627300,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill and commend Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Funchion on bringing it forward.

Anybody who has recently visited the Liberties in Dublin will have seen large developments of student accommodation.  When we check the groups behind these developments and the people who intend to profit from them we find they are not always long-term investments where a rent increase of 1% or 2% a year would be appropriate.  These are people who are looking for a quick profit and want to squeeze the most out of students or their parents.  That is the reason we are seeing rent increases of 20% or 30%.  One of these groups is GSA, which is one of the largest groups developing student accommodation in Europe or perhaps in the world.  Another is Hines, the American group.  Even in my area, some of those whose names we have often heard associated with building works in this city have been also associated with these developments.  I urge the Minister to take on board this Bill and to act on it rather than merely listen to what we are proposing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900055#CCC00200","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1527627900,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Student accommodation in a new complex in Cork was advertised at an asking price for some units of &euro;210 a week and for others units the asking price was as high &euro;225 a week.

It stated, \"We have seen an increase every year in rent for student accommodation, and have seen other colleges take a stand.  Enough is Enough.\"  It refused to promote the accommodation.  That clearly illustrates the market and opportunities that exist for those who wish to make a very significant profit from the lack of student accommodation.  Where there is such a shortage, there always will be the potential to exploit the position.  As in any situation in any part of the rental market, there are good landlords but also bad landlords.  Where such inequality exists between tenants and landlords, it is important that protections are put in place.  That is the reason this legislation is very important.  It is right and proper that we address what is essentially a loophole.  The Government has already long conceded the principle, at least, of rent certainty.  That being the case, why would it not extend it to student accommodation?  An example has been already given of the 100% rent increase in the Shanowen student accommodation  since 2014.  There is the potential for that to happen on a much wider basis if we do not address this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also provides for protections with respect to the Residential Tenancies Board.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin pointed out, that applies equally to landlords but many students are living in accommodation that is appalling, lamentable, overcrowded, damp and in very poor condition and because of the inequality in terms of the situation they are in, they do not feel empowered to do anything about it.  This legislation would assist in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900055#CCC00300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1527627900,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I commend my colleagues, Teachta&iacute; &Oacute; Broin and Funchion, on bringing forward this important legislation.  Shortly before I was elected I was involved in a dispute with University College Dublin, UCD.  It related to a car park and the introduction of car parking charges.  At the time we were considering the demands placed on the car park by the students and the staff.  It became apparent during the course of that dispute that students were in some instances sleeping in their cars because they could not afford accommodation.  Students who could not afford accommodation in Dublin were travelling to college in the early hours of the morning, parking their cars on the premises and sleeping in their cars before lectures.  It is not easy to be a student.  My daughter is a student in UCD and it is tough enough.  Many students have to work and study, and they want to do their best.  On top of that, they are now falling victim to parasitic landlords.  I commend the students on their activism.  It is regrettable they have to take time away from their studies to protest, as they did in DCU and NUIG, but it is not surprising they have to do that because so much that can be achieved has to be achieved through protest, given the make-up and functioning of this Government.<\/p>  <p>  I urge support for this Bill on the basis that if we do not show our solidarity with those students, we send them the message that we think it is okay for them to be exploited, for their parents to be crucified to pay exorbitant rents, and for those students who cannot afford rents to continue to sleep in their cars.  That is really the choice; we stand with them or we stand against them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900055#CCC00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1527627900,"counter":458,"content":"<p>This has been a useful debate.  Previous speakers spoke about the scale of the problem, the way it is impacting on many of their constituents and we heard stories of students sleeping in cars.  It is important on the day that is in it, when a homeless man died in Newcastle, that we should mention the fact that there are homeless people sleeping in squalid conditions.  Unfortunately, that man has died.<\/p>  <p>  The only point that was out of sync in this debate was a point included in the Minister's script.  I do not blame him for that, as I do not know who wrote it.  His script states, \"This is a delicate balancing act of ensuring the vital protection of our students and increasing the availability of affordable student accommodation, while ensuring the constitutionally protected rights of property owners.\"  The point was made that we already have rent pressure zones.  I am concerned we are making this issue more complicated than it needs to be.  Certainly it is a difficult issue to address and we want to get it right, but we should not be trying to create barriers where none exist.<\/p><p>We are aware of people being exploited.  Traditionally the accommodation that many students lived in was squalor but we are in the 21st century today and things have not improved.  We can all give stories about students living in sheds and in accommodation with subdivided rooms and so on.  If one speaks to a welfare officer from any of the student unions he or she will tell of students who come to college hungry and starving.  They do not have enough money for food, never mind accommodation.  This is the reality we are dealing with.<\/p> <p> Deputy Darragh O'Brien's intervention was good when he asked the Minister of State where we are going from here.  That is the big question.  I agree with the spirit and the intent of this proposed legislation and it is a way forward.  It is really up to the Government now to follow through on this.  It is not enough for the Government to say that it will support the Bill.  If we get the dead hand and nothing happens on it, that is no use either.  Collectively, any Minister who sat in the Chamber tonight and listened to the debate will realise there is a crisis out there and we need to do this.  It is about urgency but it is also about responsible Government.  A responsible Government would respond immediately to this crisis which is affecting so many young people right across Ireland.  All Members may speak of their own constituencies but this is happening in every area where there are students.  Increasingly students are having to travel for longer distances and having to work longer hours.  This impacts on their studies.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan hit the nail on the head when she spoke of the students whose families are not wealthy and the barriers they face in getting an education.  We need to make things easier for students.  They should not have to protest outside the D&aacute;il.

While we might not agree on everything, the focus the Deputies bring to the area is important.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien of Fianna F&aacute;il also had a Bill in this space.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, has been working with students and others in this space over the last couple of months, along with her Department, in trying to see how we can intervene to help.  None of us wants students to be facing the situations such as they are.<\/p>  <p>  Members spoke tonight about sending the students a message of solidarity, and that we are aligned with them.  That is all very fine and it is important that we say this in the debate, but we also must ensure that we bring forward legislation that we believe will work.  While the intention of the Bill is right, the Government is not fully convinced that it can work in its current form to achieve the result that we all want.  It is not a case of us knocking the Bill back because it is not ours; it is about how we can work through it to make legislation achievable to give us the end result we need, and which will not present a constitutional challenge.<\/p>  <p>  While the Government cannot at this juncture endorse this specific legislation as it is premature until such time as the legal considerations and implications are more thoroughly evaluated, we can readily acknowledge and welcome the broad spirit and objective of the Bill as a genuine attempt to improve the situation for students at a time of under-supply in the residential rental sector.  I see this Bill and Fianna F&aacute;il's Bill as genuine attempts to do this.<\/p>  <p>  It is in the interest of Government to ensure student accommodation is affordable and not subject to excessive increases.  The existing Government financial support for students is finite in terms of taxpayers' money for educational grants and supports, and all the other aspects of provision of third level education.  This funding should not be exhausted by overinflated and unreasonable accommodation costs.  Equally, parents&rsquo; or students&rsquo; own resources are hard earned and should not be swallowed up either.  Students should not have to face entering the workforce with a massive debt to repay just to cover their accommodation costs.  We need affordable rents across the State and not just for students.  This has been the focus of our work over the past couple of years.  Unreasonable accommodation costs have the potential to prohibit individual students from pursuing studies in their preferred field because their choice of course might not be on offer close to where they live.  Location comes into play and for some, an educational course in Dublin is becoming less attainable for financial reasons, predominantly because of high accommodation costs.  This does not just apply to Dublin; it could also be in certain parts of Cork and other areas.<\/p>  <p>  We need to provide certainty to students whose finances are tight and finite, and help limit their financial burdens.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor, highlighted earlier that the Government published its national student accommodation strategy to increase the supply of student accommodation and increase the take-up of digs accommodation.  The Government has set a target to see an extra 7,000 bed spaces built by the end of 2019 and a total of 21,000 additional beds by 2024.  We are currently on track to exceed these targets.  The targets were set by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, working with the Department of Education and Skills, around the strategy some years ago, which was a specific action of the Action Plan for Housing.  We recognised the importance of intervening to provide more student accommodation and to make it more affordable.  Supply is the key issue.  If we can introduce more supply into the market it will help to provide students with the ideal accommodation that is specific to their needs, it will help us to tackle the price of it and it will free up some of the other accommodation that students use - due to no other available choices - which is better designed for families.<\/p>  <p>  There are different reasons for us wanting to intervene, so the Department is prepared to do this, working with the Department of Education and Skills.  Since our strategy has been in place we have worked with that Department.  I mentioned some figures earlier and supply has increased.  I appreciate that Deputy &Oacute; Broin acknowledged that in a radio interview this morning.  He was right to say that it has improved but it is still not enough, as we always say in these cases, to really have a step change in the supply.  The trends, however, are right.  If we can build on this and add in the affordability element, we will be in a much better place to deal with the situation.  The figures have improved in the context of what has been built over the last couple of years with nearly 3,000 new units into the system.  Some 8,000 units are going through the construction phase currently, and about 5,000 have planning permission but have not yet started construction.  I have just misplaced the actual figures but I will get the figures for the Deputies.  While there is movement in this area it does not guarantee that it is at the right price and this aspect should be brought into focus.  I acknowledge this and we are willing to work with Deputies on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  A greater supply of student accommodation to meet demand has the potential to ease overall pressures on the rental market, including moderating rent increases, on the basis of increased competition and choice.  The Department does not believe that Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Private Members' Bill will achieve the outcome of having all student accommodation subject to ongoing regulation.  I believe this is the intention of the Bill but it is not in the right order for that.  I believe that this is the right outcome to seek, but this Bill will not deliver it.<\/p>  <p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in Bill proposes to apply the protections afforded to tenancies under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2016 to students living in student-specific accommodation under licence agreements.  When one compares a tenancy agreement to a licence agreement they are very different.  I am aware that the Deputies have acknowledged this but they are very different.  We need more scrutiny in this space to make sure we have it right.  We have been working on some of this legislation also and have scrutinised some of the data.  We had a greater focus when we looked at this Bill and we have asked for advice from the Attorney General.  We analysed it to see how best we could bring a solution forward that combines all the ideas, which are good ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900056#DDD00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1527628500,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State say what specific item of advice he received?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900056#DDD00300","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1527628500,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I am happy to tease that through with the Deputy but the most important element is that different aspects of licensing versus tenancy have different rights.  I have a copy of the UCD licence and I am happy to give it to the Deputy.  There are very specific details contained in it about what a licensee is entitled to and the service he or she will get and can expect.  It is very different to a tenancy agreement.  This is about looking to make sure we have the right legislation to protect people and to make sure that if we intervene in this area we can give the students the protection they need.  We must ensure the legislation cannot be challenged and fail at a later stage.<\/p>  <p>  When we debated rent pressure zones and changes in that regard I recall that a lot of our work was based on scientific data to make sure we got it right, that we would not lose a challenge if it happened and by intervening in a positive way that we could defend.  We are not confident that the Bill put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in would put us in that position as there is still a bit of work to be done behind those ideas.  It is about more than the legislation being brought forward, it is also about the rationale behind it.  We are all aware that it is important and we all know what we have to do.  We still have to gather all the data and the evidence to show the necessity for intervening in this space.  We need to do this and add into the work we have been doing.  This work is ongoing with the Department of Education and Skills and my Department.  We have had several meetings, but this work needs to be added into the legislation - or whatever we bring forward - to try to make it work.<\/p>  <p>  A conversation is also needed on whether or not to amend the existing legislation as proposed in this Bill or to bring in a specific Bill to deal with this issue.  It might be better achieved if we have a specific Bill to deal with student-specific accommodation.  I will not say if that is right or wrong yet; it is for looking at and for involving Members.  It is not about taking over their work, robbing it and bringing it back in a month's time in another form.  That is not what we are about.  I believe that all Members genuinely want to bring about a solution.  This is why we will not oppose the Bill.  We cannot, however, accept it in its current form.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill focuses, in particular, on ensuring that the annual rent increase limit of 4%, as it applies to certain dwellings in rent pressure zones, will also apply to student-specific accommodation provided under licence.  A licensing framework, however, might best suit the business model of student-specific accommodation providers, rather than trying to bring them under the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Acts, which do not naturally fit with students who generally occupy their accommodation for around eight months of the year.  There is a lot more involved in the licence, depending on whether it is public or private.<\/p>  <p>  There is a risk that the expected supply of student accommodation coming on stream could be negatively affected by the proposed application of the Residential Tenancies Acts to student-specific accommodation provided under licence agreement.  It does not mean that we do not intervene.  It does not mean that we do not do anything, but we have to measure it and balance it to make sure we get it right.  There is a fair increase in accommodation being brought through the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900056#DDD00400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1527629100,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I am sure that there were business models for doing that.

Every Deputy has stories of family, friends and people whom we represent being left in the difficult situation of having to take up accommodation that is substandard compared with the price being charged.

While student accommodation is needed, we must ensure that there is regulation, especially of rents.  Recently, there were protests at DCU after two privately-built student accommodation developments near the campus announced that they were hiking their rents by up to 27%.  In the space of just four years, rent in some of the private student accommodation around the university has doubled, which is unfair.  It makes a mockery of RPZs that a loophole exists whereby students are the only ones who can face rent hikes of such large amounts.  This is placing a burden on young people and many of the rent increases will be shouldered by their parents.  We need one rule for all in RPZs.  Students cannot be discriminated against when it comes to the protection of tenants.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard many stories of students not getting their deposits back because of minor issues and not getting maintenance issues sorted.

Between registration fees and the cost of living, travel and rent, students and their parents are under significant financial pressure.  Free education has been eroded bit by bit, mainly through registration and other fees.  Ten years into austerity, we have reached the point at which the cost of third level education is acting as a deterrent for some students, with rent a significant contributor to that.<\/p>  <p>  Most ordinary people &ndash; workers, families, people in the private rented sector and those who want to buy their own homes &ndash; are struggling due to the chaotic housing market that the Government has created.  For example, rents in Louth have increased by 13.5% in the past year.  This is outrageous and shows that the Government's approach to housing has been a failure.  The housing list has gone off the charts altogether.  In Louth alone, more than 4,500 people are on the waiting list, many of whom have been waiting for upwards of ten years.  Homelessness is at an all-time high.<\/p>  <p>  Students are no different.  The scramble for accommodation every summer is beyond ridiculous at this point, and Fine Gael is seven years in government.  Not enough units are available in the rental market for workers or students, and student-specific housing is scarce and expensive and is not included in the flimsy protections that exist for tenants.  Dundalk Institute of Technology has more than 5,000 students, many of whom are under severe pressure seeking affordable accommodation, yet the Government is still refusing to include Dundalk in a RPZ.<\/p>  <p>  While we would like significant improvements in the overall protections for tenants, the Bill would at least bring those living in student-specific accommodation into line with other renters and offer them that basic protection.  The Minister of State does not need us to tell him time and again that student accommodation is at crisis point, with a gross undersupply in the housing and rental sectors and extortionate rents in student accommodation across our cities.

I also thank the Government for its support of the spirit of the Bill and its statement that rent predictability is in line with Government policy.<\/p>  <p>  I do not accept that this is a complex issue.  Either one believes students should live with 20% to 30% rent increases or one does not.  If one does not, then a range of legislative measures are available for application to student accommodation.  The question then is on the best wording, to which I will revert.<\/p>  <p>  It is remarkable that the Government still does not know whether the Residential Tenancies Acts apply to student licences.  It is three months since this issue first hit the headlines, and I cannot believe it would take the Attorney General that time to clarify this from the Government's point of view.  If and when he does clarify it, it would be good if the Government shared that clarification with us.<\/p>  <p>  As to unintended consequences, students withdrawing from courses is an unintended consequence.  Students being forced into long commutes, negatively affecting their education, is another unintended consequence.  Surely this should come before everything else.<\/p>  <p>  I have no idea what the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, meant when referring to the constitutional rights of landlords.  That matter has been dealt with in the RPZ legislation.  Otherwise, that legislation would have been unconstitutional.  Limited and all as that protection is, we would like it applied in this circumstance.<\/p>  <p>  I always get nervous when people say \"Proceed with caution\" because it really means \"Do nothing\" or \"Do nothing within an appropriate period\".  Maybe what the Government is really saying is that it is nervous that any restriction on the ability of these institutional landlords to increase rents would impact on investment.  Today, I referred to an increase in private sector investment.  If that increases affordable supply, it is a good thing, but the companies involved in the market are not just domestic.  They are global players with specific business models and resources.  They can make sufficient profits without having to screw students and their families.  As such, the idea that we need a comprehensive review of the student accommodation sector misses the point.<\/p>  <p>  If the central objection is to the poor wording of the Bill, I have no difficulty with that.  This is not about whose name is on the Bill.<\/p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> I would be happy if, after proceeding with this Bill today, we were to throw it in the bin and ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, his Minister of State and his very able staff, with David Walsh and his team, to come up with better wording and to drop that into the residential tenancies (amendment) Bill that is coming before committee in a number of weeks.  We already have given a commitment that we would progress that Bill because it contains other good elements.  I fully agree with Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  If, when that Bill is published, this issue is not dealt with, we will sit down as Opposition and will invite all others to craft an amendment that will have majority support in the committee and the House to insert it there.  The choice coming out of here today for the Minister of State, Deputy English, is simple.  It is either to draft his own wording for this so he does not have to complain that we are not doing it well, or face our amendment.  It is one or the other because students simply do not have the time for a comprehensive review before this is addressed.<\/p> <p> I accept that everybody who has spoken today accepts there is a problem.  Everybody is saying that something needs to be done.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is absolutely right.  What we are proposing here is not radical.  This is the most modest measure possible to prevent exorbitant hikes in the future.  The most effective way to deliver good quality, affordable student accommodation is to seriously look at increasing lending or removing the lending caps on the universities to allow them to directly supply good quality, affordable student accommodation on their land or on land near to them provided by the State.  That would cut out a significant amount of the additional profit and charges that come with the private sector delivery.  It is not that I am against the private sector delivery.  It delivers affordability but my preferred option and indeed the preferred option of many universities is to have greater access to funding, be that from the Housing Finance Agency, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund or the European Investment Bank to deliver the best quality affordable accommodation for students.  The &ldquo;Drivetime&rdquo; radio programme broadcast a powerful interview by a young student from an affected university.   Her family is now facing the reality of having to fund two students in two different universities who are unable to access any kind of accommodation at all, let alone anything affordable.  In the first instance, let us tackle the student rent shakedown.  Let us prevent landlords from jacking up rents by 20% to 30% and let us ensure that where universities want to borrow low-cost, long-term finance to build good quality student accommodation on university or public land, they are given every support by the Government to do so.

I do not think it ever was.  The &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote we saw at the weekend was part of a tide of public opinion welling up, an earthquake as some described it, against that sort of Ireland, which has not served us well.  It has not served women well and, in this case, it has not and is not serving the education of our children well.  We have had some significant evidence of this.  The &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote was about people saying that they did not want to be dictated to by the church or the State, having a particular moral view imposed on them.  We think people should be allowed to make up their own minds about those things, when it comes to women, pregnancy and so on.<\/p>  <p>  One sees further evidence of the need to make this shift, even with the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, today, about allowing what should be a State agency to be controlled by religious institutions, in this case St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild and the Sisters of Charity.  I just heard the announcement today.  Fair play to the Minister, Deputy Zappone, for contacting Deputies but I do not know if I am one of those children because St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild was the adoption agency that adopted me and I was adopted during those years.  I do not know whether I was properly registered.  I am lucky because my biological parent found me but had difficulty in doing so.  There are people who may not know that they are adopted.  This is unbelievable.  That is all because we allowed things that should have been public services to be outsourced to particular religious bodies with a particular ethos and attitude.  That very seriously impacted on the lives of real people and it is still impacting on them.<\/p>  <p>  This cannot go on.  It is still going on the area of education and the Minister intends, notwithstanding some moves to improve matters in this Bill, to allow that discrimination against people who do not share a particular religious ethos &ndash; the Catholic ethos in most cases &ndash; to be discriminated against if it impacts on the ethos of the school.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle should not get me wrong, as I think people are entitled to their religious views.  They are entitled to express them and to associate with regard to those ideas.  I would fight to the death for people&rsquo;s right to have freedom of religious expression but we are talking about schools, publicly funded for the most part, although it does not matter what sort of school it is.  Any school that is delivering the curriculum should not have a particular morality or religious view which is imposed on people who do not share that view.  It should not be allowed to persist.  The school should not decide to have any right to discriminate on admission to that school on the basis of people sharing or not sharing that religious ethos.  It is just not acceptable.  We have had a clear statement over the weekend and have evidence all the time that that should not continue and people do not want it to continue.  It is in that spirit that these amendments are proposed.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever one may have thought last week, the week before, or the week before that, something has changed over the weekend and the Government should reconsider.  To my mind, it is just a no-brainer.  The baptism barrier has to go and that means removing the ridiculous situation where the Equal Status Act says one will not be guilty of discrimination if one is discriminating.  How Irish is that?  We are not discriminating when we are discriminating because we are in a school that has a particular ethos.  It is Orwellian doublethink and the consequence is that it allows that discrimination to persist.  In many cases where schools are not oversubscribed, it is not an issue, and I fully accept that it is not an issue.  When there are places, most schools will take kids from whatever background.  It can still persist if the school is oversubscribed and says that, by not allowing in a child of the same ethos as the ethos of the school and not discriminating in favour of that child, it would impact on the school&rsquo;s right to maintain that ethos.<\/p><p>That is still discrimination and I do not think it is acceptable.<\/p> <p> I have another amendment on religious instruction in schools which I will come to later and the same point pertains there.  I have no problem with schools being used after school hours for religious instruction for people who share a particular religious view but I do not believe it is right that during school hours we have a particular religious view, which children have to either sit through even though they may not share it or they have to leave and are therefore made to feel different from everybody else.  That is not right.  For the school to have to say, following this legislation, that it will make other arrangements and state what they are is still not good enough.  A distinction should not be made for children whereby a child is made to feel different because we have a particular set of values and ethos and because someone does not share it therefore he or she will be treated differently.  That is discrimination.  It is not right.  It is not fair on children and it should not be allowed to persist.  For those reasons, the Government should take my amendments seriously.<\/p> <p> There are other aspects to the separation of church and State in education.  In passing I will again mention Clonkeen College, but the issue does not only concern Clonkeen College where the Christian Brothers are flogging off school facilities to pay their historical debts over child abuse.  I got a lengthy email from Waterford today where people are saying exactly the same thing.  The Sisters of Charity are flogging off real estate on school lands essentially to look after their religious order.  The writer of the email asks why the hell the State does not step in and take over the schools and that from now on schools will be non-religious as they are being divested from religious control and that we will have a fair system which does not discriminate on the basis of religious ethos.  We would then have a system where anyone who is in a catchment area would be taken by a school on a first-come, first-served basis regardless of his or her religious views or background or lack thereof or if he or she is of a minority religion.  The time has come for change.  There is no defence for fudging on this and for half-hearted measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900058#FFF00800","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527630300,"counter":480,"content":"<p>At this stage in the country's development it is time to get rid of section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>) of the Equal Status Act.  It is impossible to justify the retention of that discriminatory legislation on any grounds.  We talked about this over a long period last year.  It is almost a year since we had Committee Stage and there was a very strong view right across the committee that this measure needed to go.  There is no way one can support a fully State funded education system that is empowered to refuse a child access to a school solely on the basis of his or her religion.  That is what section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>) allows us to do at the moment.<\/p><p>Our schools should be inclusive places.  They should recognise the importance of diversity and ensure equal respect for all children, irrespective of their background or their parents' religious persuasion, but that is not what schools do.  It is what a very small number of schools do.  I refer to those schools in the multidenominational sector, specifically the Educate Together schools.  From the point of view of the majority of schools, namely, the 95% of schools which are church controlled in terms of patronage, the law, as it stands, allows them to discriminate between four and five-year olds on the basis of their parents' stated religion.  It allows schools that are fully State funded, the local school that is paid for by the parents and community in general, to refuse to take a child on the basis of him or her not being baptised.  There is no justification for that.  It is a shameful provision in our legislation and it should have been abolished long ago.<\/p><p>Schools are allowed to discriminate, which results in an outrageous situation where parents feel that they have no choice other than to get their children baptised into a religion to which they may not subscribe and in which they do not want their child to be brought up.  They have to go through this sham purely for the sake of getting a place in their local school.  At this stage, that should be utterly intolerable to everybody in the country.<\/p><p>Many of us have felt for a long time that this requirement is fundamentally unacceptable and should have been abolished.  It is undoubtedly anti-child, anti-education and blatant discrimination.  At the time the Social Democrats proposed a Bill to abolish section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>), I made the point that if we saw a law like this being proposed by Donald Trump, for example, or Marine Le Pen, we would be rightly appalled at the notion.  I do not think any one of us here would do anything but condemn such an approach by another jurisdiction, yet we allow it to continue in our country.<\/p><p>We need to move on this.  Notwithstanding the fact that 11 months have elapsed since Committee Stage, I acknowledge that the Minister has moved very substantially on this issue but he has still not gone far enough.  I have concerns about the approach he proposes to take.  Most of us would agree that section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>), which allows discrimination against young children is abhorrent, and should not be allowed.  What the Minister is proposing is that in the vast majority of schools it would not be allowed but it would still be allowed in some schools, namely, minority faith schools.  Either discrimination is wrong or it is not, and in this case most people would regard it as completely wrong.  On that basis, we need to remove section 7(3)(<i>c<\/i>).<\/p><p>To a large extent, the Minister is proposing an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  We should tackle this problem head on and deal with it in a comprehensive way, not in a particular way that deals with certain schools but not all schools.  Discrimination against children on religious grounds is wrong and it is wrong when carried out by any religious group or any type of denominational school.  For that reason, it should go completely.<\/p><p>I am concerned that if the Minister proceeds in the way he has suggested, he might leave the State open to legal challenge.  He might inform us of his legal advice in that regard.  It is hard to see how we can have one rule for one religion and another rule for other religions.  I would welcome clarification in that regard.<\/p><p>In terms of the three amendments I am proposing here, and which are listed, amendment No. 39 proposes to delete those particular lines that refer to what a school must do in its admission statement if section 7(3)(c) of the 2000 Act applies to it.  I propose, and a later amendment refers to, deleting section 7(3)(c).  If we were to do that it would make the section referred to by amendment No. 39 redundant.<\/p> <p> The part of the Bill referred to in amendment No. 52 deals with admission policies.  It sets down what a board can and cannot do when preparing an admission policy statement.  Included in this part of the Bill is a provision to allow a school the right to refuse admission to a child who is not of the same denomination of that promoted by the school.  This amendment would remove that right.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 138 mirrors the Private Members&rsquo; Bill which the Social Democrats introduced last year.  It would provide for the non-application of section 7(3)(c) in respect of publicly funded schools.  It would in effect end the baptism barrier completely.  It would stop almost all schools, bar the small the number of private schools, from discriminating against children on the basis of religion in school enrolment policies.  <\/p> <p> It is simply wrong that children are turned away from their local school on the basis of their religious beliefs.  Under the system the Minister is now proposing - while it is an improvement on the current regime - this will still be allowed to happen.  Children&rsquo;s rights should not be secondary to the rights of religious organisations.  The amendment also favours the option most favoured by several civil society groups in last year&rsquo;s public consultation.  That is an important point to make.  The amendment also mirrors wording that was used in the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 in respect of publicly funded bodies which was passed unanimously without a vote by the D&aacute;il, so it should be fully constitutional.  <\/p> <p> On that basis, while I recognise the progress the Minister has made, I believe that it is really important that we go further and eliminate all forms of discrimination, especially on religious grounds, against children in our State funded schools.  There is no justification for that to continue.  There are no grounds on which the Minister can say that it is acceptable.  It is wrong and we need to move on it.  There is a very strong sentiment within the country which has been growing over recent years.  In recent times and recent months in particular our country has come of age to a large extent.  People are facing up to the fact that they want to live in a republic, they want to be in a position to think things through for themselves, they want to have diversity and respect for diversity within our institutions and they want to move away from the past when the State and the Catholic Church were hand in hand in controlling our schools and hospitals.  People now reject that approach.  We are, or should be, a modern republic.  We need to ensure that our institutions reflect that ethos of general respect and diversity within our country.  Now is the time to take that step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900059#GGG00200","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527630900,"counter":482,"content":"<p>This whole group of amendments is really the crux of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 and it is where the pressure has been coming on legislators to act.  There is a difficulty.  I acknowledge that and always have.  I have come across constituents who have been refused admission to schools because they were not baptised Catholic.  I saw one particularly egregious example where somebody had been baptised in a Protestant faith and was told that, under church rules, they cannot be re-baptised into the Catholic faith despite the fact that they go to Mass every Sunday.  Still this constituent was not able to be admitted into a local Catholic school because there were not enough places.  <\/p>  <p>  I have seen every aspect of this.  It is a real problem.  Some people dismiss it but it is a real problem in certain parts of the country where there is a lack of availability of places.  As I am told by my colleagues in north Dublin, that lack of availability of places in certain towns in north Dublin applies not just to Catholic schools, but to all schools across the board.  Along with this, we need to make sure that we focus on resources.  The ideological battles and the issue of discrimination are very important  but the most important issue in education is that people want a good school to go to.  We cannot lose sight of the resource question.  We must fund our schools, provide the resources and actually build the schools which we say are needed in particular areas.  The Minister needs to keep a razor sharp focus on this as well as dealing with this particular issue.<\/p>  <p>  In our manifesto Fianna F&aacute;il put forward a proposal, which is reflected in the amendments which have been tabled, in terms of providing catchment areas for schools.  That proposal would have dealt with this problem to a large degree.  It certainly would have helped the minority faith schools, which was our main objective as expressed in this debate before now, however I acknowledge that there are difficulties with the catchment area approach, primarily that the act of drawing up catchment areas would be exceedingly difficult.  <\/p>  <p>  On the basis that the Minister&rsquo;s approach seems to be the best possible approach he can come up with that removes the baptism barrier but protects the minority faith schools, we will support the Minister&rsquo;s amendments on this issue and I will not be moving my amendments.  However, in a republic such as ours, where we have had a relationship between Catholic, Protestant and dissenter for better and for worse at different points in our history, it is important that we protect our minority religions.  In allowing the primary schools of the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church and the Jewish and Muslim faiths to ensure that adherents of their faiths can access their schools in preference to other people if they are oversubscribed we are actually helping those communities to sustain themselves, to maintain themselves in the country and to practise their faith.  It is essential that we allow them to do that because, in truth, the Protestant communities have historically been treated pretty poorly and pretty appallingly by this State, particularly post-Independence.  We at least owe it to them to allow them to have their schools if that is what they want to have.  It is open to Church of Ireland schools to divest if that is their wish but we have to protect them if that is what is required to allow them to practise their faith.<\/p>  <p>  This baptism barrier will go in Catholic schools.  That does not present any difficulties for Catholics who wish to practise their faith because invariably they will be able to find another Catholic school if their local one is oversubscribed.  We are happy to support the Minister&rsquo;s amendments on this.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are a few other issues in this area.  One concerns the surveys on ethos the Minister is carrying out at the moment.  They are a complete waste of administrative time.  No school that the Minister proposes to open in the future should be a religious-run school.  It just should not be.  We have enough.  Some 90% are under Catholic patronage at the moment.  I do not see where the demand for more religious-run schools could possibly be.  We do not need them at second level either.  We have excellent Catholic and Protestant schools already.  I presume that in opening up schools we are looking to diversify.  I do not see why we need the surveys.  <\/p>  <p>  We have our education and training boards, ETBs.  We have the community national school model.  Surely that is the way to go in providing schools for the future.  Nobody in their right mind would start a school system from scratch with the patronage model.  It really needs to be eliminated from the process of providing future schools.  In that process Gaelscoileanna and English-speaking community national schools run by the local ETB can also be provided.  The structure is there.  It would be better for many schools if they were to be run by ETBs because the resources, the administration, the expertise, the shared services and so on are already there.  If Fianna F&aacute;il were in power we would say that, unless there were absolutely compelling reasons otherwise, all schools would be patronised by local education and training boards.  It seems to be the sensible thing to do.  I am not sure what the survey of preschool students is going to achieve.  I suspect most of them will end up in the education and training board sector anyway.  In addition it is not just the parents of children who are currently in preschool who should be determining the schools in the community.  <\/p><p>It seems that having them with the education and training boards would get the most acceptance from the wide mass of the community.  I do not mean to rule out Gaelscoileanna when I say that because they could be provided for as well.  Perhaps that would be part of parental choice.  That can also be part of the Department's planning, rather than subcontracting it out to parents.  That would be more sensible than what the Minister is proposing.  Certainly, the schools in my community with which I am familiar and which are run by Louth and Meath Education and Training Board are excellent.  I hope this arrangement applies to the primary school that is envisaged for Dunshaughlin and the secondary school that is envisaged for the Laytown and Drogheda school planning district.  I have made a strong case to the officials in the Department that this planning area should include Duleek.  I have mentioned to them that a site has been made available - presumably not for free - by the Diocese of Meath, which has no interest in patronage.  This arrangement would simply involve the sale of land to the Department.  That is a matter for the Department.  As there is no appetite for church patronage, there is no need for concern.<\/p> <p> There is no issue with religious preference in primary schools in the UK because between 30% and 40% of primary schools are in the religious category.  There is a selection there.  If we ever get to that stage, it will be possible for people to say they need to have their Catholic schools or State schools.  It is simply not sustainable to have 90% of schools as Catholic schools, which is what we have at the moment.  There is no argument about that at this point.<\/p> <p> I have to say I think there are strong arguments for religion to be taught outside school hours, as proposed by some Deputies.  There is no doubt about that.  It happens very effectively with parental support in multidenominational schools.  My own children go to a multidenominational school because that is the model to which we subscribe as Catholics.  While I have no difficulty with this proposal, I suggest some type of consultation must happen first.  We should not provide for religious instruction to take place outside school hours in one legislative gambit here tonight.  It is something that will have to be looked at.  It is how things were done when the national schools were first established.  There was different religious instruction and things got in the way in the meantime.  Although I do not think this would present a threat to faith, I am not sure we should simply up-end the system in a D&aacute;il vote tonight or tomorrow.  Instead, there should be some element of consultation.  I am informed by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, that we cannot do anything that would upset the school bus system.  While he is right in this respect, I suggest such matters are easily managed.<\/p> <p> We are facing into a period of change in education.  I do not think we should be too dogmatic or ideological about it one way or the other.  We need to get it right.  There are issues being raised, but the focus must always be on having good schools that educate our children properly.  In general, parents want good schools beside them that they can access.  In fairness to the Minister, he has listened.  It is probable that two years have passed since the Labour Party or the Green Party proposed a Private Members' motion on this issue.  The Bill before the D&aacute;il this evening will have to go before the Seanad.  The sooner this gets done, the better.  It is obvious that it will not be in place for the school year beginning in September.<\/p> <p> I do not intend to delay the legislation for too long, but I would like to make a general point before I conclude.  It should be noted that complying with this legislation in general, including the provisions we have been discussing, will place a significant burden on schools over the coming years.  They will have to produce admissions policies and make sure everything is right.  I wonder whether the Minister for Education and Skills is proposing to give schools a one-off grant or some sort of help or assistance.  The shared services of education and training boards can certainly provide assistance to schools, for example when admissions policies that conform with this legislation are being written.  Schools will need some help as they seek to comply with their legal obligations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900060#HHH00200","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527631500,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's amendments because they go some way towards addressing the baptism barrier.  It is imperative, especially in the new Ireland in which we live, that we adopt a consistent and non-partisan policy response to this difficulty, which has gone on for too long.  Like many other Deputies, I have repeatedly called for the inequality of the baptism barrier to be addressed.  I have advocated for equality of educational access and opportunity to be secured for all our children.  Now, in a changing landscape, is the time to get our policy in this area right so that we do not have to revisit it.<\/p><p>I do not think we should single out any religion because this is about all religions.  If other religions do not face enrolment challenges right now, well and good.  We need to legislate in a dispassionate way that treats everyone - Catholics and those of other religions or none - the same.  This legislation must be applicable to one and all with no exceptions.  That is the best way to ensure our children's right to access education is at the heart of this legislation.  We must acknowledge, embrace and cater for the changing society we live in by ensuring all children are treated equally when it comes to education.<\/p><p>The solution to the current difficulty is very simple - the Minister needs to remove the baptism barrier from all schools that receive State funding.  It is much simpler than the Minister seems to be making it, or wanting to make it.  I disagree with his amendments in principle because ending discrimination based on one religion while continuing discrimination based on other religions is another form of inequality.  The serious problem with how these amendments have been drafted is that they are creating an overly complicated, convoluted and complex system that seems to leave out secondary schools for some reason I cannot understand.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to consider the amendments I am proposing.  Amendment No. 42 proposes to disapply section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000 from the admissions statement of any school that receives public funds.  Amendment No. 53 seeks to disapply section 7(3)(c) of the 2000 Act from the admissions policy of any school that receives public funds.  Amendment No. 140 seeks to amend section 7(3)(c) to provide that this exemption from discrimination cannot be applied to any school in receipt of public funds from the Department.  It is a simple as that.  We need to legislate in a dispassionate way that treats everyone the same.<\/p><p>I would like to ask the Minister about amendment No. 2.  The Equal Status Act 2000 prohibits discrimination across society on nine grounds, including religion.  However, religious-controlled schools were given a derogation to allow them to give priority to children of a certain faith.  Does this derogation now apply to secondary schools only?<\/p><p>I think there is a risk that the Minister's amendment No. 137, which is detailed and convoluted, will result in all sorts of unforeseen circumstances.  It allows all schools other than Catholic primary schools to discriminate on the basis of religion.  Therefore, this proposal discriminates against Catholic schools.  Regardless of whether 90% or 10% of schools in this country are Catholic schools, it is still discrimination.  It is bordering on sectarian.  Secondary schools will still be allowed to discriminate on the basis of religion.  This will be a major issue for the children living in the areas surrounding the 20% of secondary schools that are oversubscribed.<\/p><p>It is proposed that primary schools of minority religions will be able to apply for recognition as recognised primary schools under section 10 of the Education Act 1998.  Amendment No. 137 defines &quot;minority religion&quot; as:<\/p><blockquote>... a religion other than a religion whose membership comprises in excess of 10 per cent of the total population of the State based on the population as ascertained by the Central Statistics Office in the most recent census report published by that office setting out the final result of a census of population of the State (whether or not that is the most recent such census of population).<\/blockquote><p>When I looked at the most recent census, I learned that 9.6% of the population falls under the category of &quot;no religion&quot;.  Will &quot;no religion&quot; be considered to be a minority faith?  The lengthy, confusing and convoluted definition of &quot;minority faith&quot; that is being proposed in amendment No. 137 suggests that the minority religion of the moment could change with each census.  I think it would be more logical and simpler to accept amendments Nos. 53 and 140 as a means of ensuring children have equal access to all schools regardless of religious belief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900061#JJJ00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1527631500,"counter":485,"content":"<p>We are debating the baptism barrier.  There is no doubt that section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000 discriminates against young people.  State-funded schools that are in receipt of taxpayers' money should not be controlled by religious institutions.  They are paid for by the people and they should be controlled by the people.<\/p><p>The State should control the schools and there should be no discrimination against any child on the basis of religion.  That is our position.<\/p> <p> The argument is advanced that the people are not ready for that, and that in the most recent census, 70% of people polled said they were Catholic.  The exact same argumentation was used to say that the Irish people would never vote in favour of the legalisation of abortion when the Government had a proposal waiting in the wings for 12 weeks.  What did we see at the weekend?  Not only did a majority support it but the majority supported it decisively.  The people are way ahead of the politicians and the establishment parties on these issues.  The time has come for the separation of the church from the State.  Education is central to that.<\/p> <p> To see the kind of mess and tangle caused by the intertwining of the church and State, we do not have to look further than the events discussed in the House this afternoon.  At least 126 children were registered as being the biological children of their adoptive parents.  This was done via the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild, which became an adoptive society at the urging of Archbishop John Charles McQuaid, a famous man back in the day.  It was run by the Irish Sisters of Charity.  I understand that those false registrations were illegal and that this society was also involved in the secret exporting of more than 500 children to the United States.  Instead of taking a bold position on this, the Government has dragged its heels down through the years.  It excluded them from the mother and baby homes inquiry despite being told that the society had knowledge of several hundred illegal birth registrations.  It repeatedly rejected calls by adoption campaigners for an audit of all adoption files in the State.  That is a small example of the type of mess that the State gets itself into when it becomes tangled with the church and church institutions.  The time has come for the separation of the church from the State.  We must end the baptism barrier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900061#JJJ00300","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1527632100,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I agree with the principle enunciated by the last speaker, that there must be a complete separation between church and State.  It is timely and would be right and proper.\r\n\r\nFrom the 18thto the 20thcentury, there were schools where Christian Brothers, nuns and religious orders did a fantastic job to educate whole generations of people who would not have been able to have been educated otherwise.  I wish to acknowledge the tremendous sacrifice and work, and the good things that many of those people did.  Clearly there were very bad things done as well but I think the good outweighed the bad.  I very much recognise that.\r\n\r\nHowever, that Ireland is no longer there.  Ireland today is represented by multiculturalism.  All children, regardless of religion, colour or race, whatever they are, they are entitled to go to the nearest school, provided it has the capacity in terms of space.  Children are entitled through their parents to be educated in terms of their religion or belief system.  It is very important that this is separated completely and it would be a good and healthy thing for our society.\r\n\r\nThe changes that have taken place in Ireland have been magnified by the vote this week.  It is universally acknowledged that we have to be aware that no child can be made to feel less important or different because of his or her religion, colour or ethnic background.  That is greatly important in a modern democracy and a true republic.  All children are equal and in education they must be treated as such.  I support the views that have been expressed.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1527632100,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I am a bit torn on this one.  It is certainly not because I have any love for religious institutions.  I see where the Minister has come from and it is a massive step forward but, having listened to the debate, I agree with Deputies Boyd Barrett, Shortall and Catherine Martin on the complete separation of church and State.  I understand what the Minister is trying to achieve in terms of minority religions and it is a big step forward.  At the end of the day, though, if we are to have equality of access in education, it has to be all or nothing.  It is either equal or it is not.  I agree with many of the sentiments expressed in respect of changing times.  I want to put on record that I will be supporting Deputies Martin&rsquo;s and Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s amendments on this one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900062#KKK00300","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1527632100,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for participating in the debate.  Clearly, if we were designing an education system today we would not be designing one in which virtually 100% of our primary schools are privately owned and 95% of them are denominational.  We are working with the system that is in place and trying to reform it to reflect the new realities in Irish society.  That is what I am trying to do here.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that we need to respond to new diversity and that is why I am removing religion as a criterion from 19 out of every 20 primary schools today.  The only circumstance where I am leaving it is in respect of minority religions and allowing parents who are of Protestant, Jewish or Muslim faith to get access to a school of their ethos.  I agree with Deputy Thomas Byrne that our society has seen the difficulties of religious difference.  However, we should not seek to define equality as removing all religion in the way that is being proposed.  That is not equality.  I think equality of respect allows us to treat each of the groups in a fair and equal way, but not as absolutely geometrically equal.<\/p>  <p>  We are fair to minority religion children, who have only one in every 20 schools to access.  We are protecting those children to get access to that one school out of every 20.  We are not affording the same protection to a Catholic child, who has 18 out of every 20 schools to choose from and will not have a difficulty in getting into a school of Catholic ethos.  We are protecting children of no faith because we are ensuring that 19 out of every 20 schools will not use religion as a criterion in selection.  I think it is a fair and balanced way to deal with what has been a very thorny problem.  Everyone has articulated the unfairness of people feeling they are forced to baptise their children to get access.<\/p>  <p>  That is not the only thing we are doing to promote greater diversity, however.  In recent years we have opened 61 new schools.  All of the primary schools have been multidenominational or non-denominational; none has been denominational.  The only denominational new school in recent years has been at second level, where denominational schools represent only about half of all schools.<\/p><p>We are introducing an initiative to facilitate the transfer of patronage from schools of the Catholic ethos to other patrons.  The former Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, initiated a process in this regard but it was not as successful as he had hoped.  I have changed it to introduce a new alternative.  They are both running together and I believe they will do much better.<\/p> <p> We are strengthening the provision to meet the constitutional right of every child not to have to attend religious instruction.  This will be enforced by requiring it to be explicitly stated in the admissions policy of religious schools as to how they propose to honour that.  We are introducing a charter for parents and students to ensure that they will have more say over time in all of the dimensions of school policy.  In the case of multidenominational ETB schools at second level, we will ensure that religion is treated as an option and not as a compulsory subject.  We are making several changes which are going to give rise to a much improved environment.<\/p> <p> Unlike others, I do not believe that the response we should offer in the name of equality should be to remove religion from every school and thereby facilitate the demise of Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and Jewish schools.  I do not believe that is equality.  If that is equality, then it is a strange definition of it.  We have to respect diversity.  Diversity is a value in our school system.  We need to ensure that when parents have a desire to see their child educated in a school of their religion, they can do so.  I do not see why we should vote for the demise of minority religions.  In my area, as there are in other Members&rsquo; areas, there are Church of Ireland schools surrounded by large Roman Catholic populations.  If there were open admissions, these schools would be filled by Roman Catholic children or children of no faith.  They would then cease to be minority schools in any sense.  That would not be good for our society.  It would certainly not be welcomed in my constituency where those schools are valued and are seen as a respect for people who have those values.<\/p> <p> Several Deputies asked how one defends treating Catholic children differently to Church of Ireland children.  It is a question of proportionality where one is trying to achieve, in so far as is possible, a situation where parents get the choice they want.  One applies proportionate rules.  With this legislation, where a child has access to one school out of every 20, I give them protection.  Where they have access to 18 out of every 20, however, I do not give protection.  They cannot use religious rules to select children.  We are completely changing the position for children of no religion where they have a small number of largely Educate Together schools from which to choose.  Now they will have 19 out of every 20 schools to choose from because religion will not be a criterion within them.  The admissions policy of schools will state how they will cater for children of no religion.  To be fair, many schools seek to ensure that they respect this.<\/p> <p> Deputy Thomas Byrne indicated that he will not move his amendments.  I acknowledge that this was a policy Fianna F&aacute;il espoused.  For the reasons the Deputy outlined, the catchments do not exist and religion within the catchment would still be a criterion.  The proposal we are offering is a better one, having reflected on the consultations we had.  I do not agree that scarcity is the issue.  It may be that this is more acute in growing urban areas where there is more diversity.  However, there will always be popular and unpopular schools.  Choices will have to be made.  The important thing is that those choices are made fairly and not in a discriminatory way on the basis of religion.<\/p> <p> Deputy Thomas Byrne also referred to patronage.  There are two systems whereby we are introducing non-denominational or multidenominational schools.  One is in the case of new schools.  In that case, for a school to qualify and to win a competition, it has to be promoting diversity within the catchment and meet the needs of parents.  There are two tests, not just one.  Deputy Thomas Byrne might have thought that it will be the parents&rsquo; choice and that the majority schools will dictate the outcome.  That is not the case because they will have to deliver diversity as a key criterion in their selection.  In the other case where we are seeking transfer from the existing majority patron, the survey is of parents.  It is to establish if the parents want an alternative to the majority school.  That is the purpose of the survey.<\/p> <p> On the point raised by Deputies Catherine Martin and Shortall, I do not believe that this will represent discrimination against Catholics.  It is a proportionate way of ensuring that as many parents as possible will get the choice they want.  Second level is different because it has a much higher level of diversity.  That has not been an issue.  The consultation I had was always about primary schools where we have this problem.<\/p> <p> Deputies Barry and O&rsquo;Dowd argued that we should go for a complete separation.  That would, for example, exclude Educate Together schools because they are private and not State-run.  Irish people like the diversity and these different patrons.  The ETBs have a State-sponsored alternative for primary schools.  I hope we will see the growth of community national schools.  Incidentally, they celebrate all religions and welcome the diversity of religious expression.  If one goes into a community national school, one will see The Koran, the Bible and other religious symbols.  They celebrate them.  The strength of these schools is the diversity of religion which is invited in with all its richness.  That is a good model in itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900062#KKK00400","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527632700,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I do not think the Minister&rsquo;s senior officials share that view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900063#LLL00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1527632700,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I accept Deputy Funchion feels torn in two directions.

There are only two Presbyterian schools in Dublin, while there are nine in Donegal and three in Monaghan.  If we are looking for an agreed united Ireland, it is essential that we just do not go in straight away and take those schools from those faiths.  There should be no mistake.  If those schools are not allowed to prefer if they are oversubscribed, their communities would end up shattered.  Anyone would be allowed to go to the schools and there would be no sense of common identity.  If the Church of Ireland and Presbyterian communities told me they do not need it, then so be it.
