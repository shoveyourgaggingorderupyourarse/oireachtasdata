The Government, local authorities and others are making every effort to reduce homelessness. Key to this is the delivery of new social housing and boosting overall supply.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is investing significantly in social and affordable housing, with record\u00a0funding allocated for current and capital investment in housing this year alone. This year funding is in place to deliver 11,800 social homes, including 9,000 new build homes, thus building on the progress made last year when 9,183 new social homes were provided, a 17% increase on 2020.<\/p>  <p>  More specifically, I have established the National Homeless Action Committee with initial key\u00a0priorities being the advancement of\u00a0additional measures to prevent Homelessness and the Youth Homelessness Strategy. The Committee will meet again in early July to further advance these measures.<\/p>  <p>  I am working with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for an increase in the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) discretion rate to 35% and to expand the couple&rsquo;s rate to single persons for new tenancies. This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken a review of Housing Delivery Action Plans which were submitted by local authorities.\u00a0 These have included specific provision for one-bed units which are critical for exits for single homeless people, and for the delivery of 4-bed units, which are key in supporting exits from homelessness for larger families.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There will be a new Voids programme for 2022 with an emphasis on quick turnaround and re-letting of vacant social housing stock. In addition, the Government has recently approved a pilot expansion of the\u00a0Repair and Leasing scheme which will open the scheme to a wider range of owners, by removing the criteria that a property owner must be unable to fund or access funding to bring former vacant commercial and institutional buildings back into use. These measures\u00a0will make more properties available to be allocated to people on the social housing waiting list, including those in emergency accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, I also\u00a0reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions that meet certain criteria.\u00a0 This will allow local authorities more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are currently severe pressures on access to emergency accommodation in certain areas of the country, which local authorities are working to address. My Department are liaising with Regional Homeless Leads and local authorities, and resources will not be an obstacle to the urgent efforts required.<\/p>  <p>  We are providing more social homes, we are completing more homes in general and we have a strong pipeline of homes commenced. This supply activity, as well as targeted measures specifically centred on homelessness, will allow us to meet the challenge of eradicating homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300057#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":9,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 9 and 10 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300057#WRA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[32889\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300057#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if funding to local authorities for the adaptation of homes for older persons and persons with disabilities will be reviewed given the rising costs of construction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>My Department\u00a0provides funding to local authorities\u00a0for\u00a0the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability Scheme.

These structures include political oversight, via the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Housing, the Housing for All Secretary General Delivery Group, and dedicated Workstreams, all of which monitor delivery of the Plan and recommend any adjustments to priorities, as required, on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>Progress reports are published quarterly. The fourth of these reports, covering progress in Q2 2022 is due for publication in July. These reports can be accessed on www.gov.ie\/en\/collection\/9d2ee-housing-for-all-quarterly-progress-reports\/.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that the capacity of Local Authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects requires the resourcing of their housing services. In this regard, I have sanctioned over 250 additional Local Authority posts, which are in the process of being filled across housing delivery teams in order to deliver on Housing for All's ambition. Key supports are also being provided through the Housing Delivery Co-Ordination Office (HDCO), which has been established within the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), to provide co-ordination of Local Authority housing activities. In addition, The Housing Agency&rsquo;s Procurement and Delivery Unit is also being expanded to provide technical services and supports to Local Authorities, including in procurement, design and modern methods of construction.<\/p><p>Housing cannot be delivered unless we have the supporting critical infrastructure, including transport, communication services and utility connections. A sustainable housing system requires strong integration between housing developments and the surrounding infrastructure and the move to plan-led development in this Plan will support this integrated system.<\/p><p>Transport infrastructure and access to public transport services are a critical enablers of new housing supply. A well-functioning housing system should be supported by transport routes. Together, my Department and the Department of Transport, along with the National Transport Authority (NTA) and the LDA, aim to bring public transport to as many people as possible through better land-use and transport planning, to meet the National Planning Framework objective of &lsquo;compact growth&rsquo;. In this regard, a working group has been established to consider opportunities for transport-led development in major urban centres.<\/p><p>For their part, Irish Water are supporting the delivery of <i>Housing for All<\/i>through a number of actions, including the timely delivery of housing connections. Irish Water&rsquo;s Connections and Developer Services team is responsible for the end-to-end customer management of all connections to the Irish Water network. The team partners with industry and supports Government housing and planning policies to provide an efficient national connection service to all those developing property. Early engagement with the Irish Water Pre-Connection Enquiry service by those seeking connection to the Irish Water network is critical to ascertaining the capacity of the public water services to facilitate the proposed network connection.<\/p><p>Increasing housing supply is at the core of Housing for All. Indications of increased construction activity are becoming evident which will help increase the availability of homes across all tenures.  <\/p><p>This year, the Government&rsquo;s target under Housing for All is 24,600 new homes. In the 12 months to the end of March 2022, a total of 22,219 new homes were completed. In the past 12 months (June 2021 to May 2022), Commencement Notices for 30,233 new homes were received. In addition, latest CSO figures show planning permissions for all residential dwellings are up 22.7% in the year ending Q1 2022 (44,491) when compared to the same time period to Q1 2021 (36,252). Together, the figures point to a substantial uplift in new housing supply in the coming years, as we increase output to average of at least 33,000 new homes per year. This increase in supply will be key to meeting demand, moderating price inflation, and addressing affordability for those wishing to rent or buy their own home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300057#WRA04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[32960\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300057#WRA05100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his targets for new social and affordable housing in the east Cork area for 2022; and the progress that has been made in reaching those targets to date.","asker":"1516","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>Housing for All, is the Government&rsquo;s plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade.

It will improve access to newly-built homes by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes.

Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity. This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, including those relating to the installation of solar panels on the roofs of houses and agricultural structures, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions for apartments and educational\/community\/religious buildings. <\/p>  <p>  The draft regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. The draft regulations have also been screened for Appropriate Assessment (AA) under the Habitats Directive by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit (EAU) and the need for AA has been screened out. <\/p>  <p>  A public consultation on the draft solar regulations as part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) process was launched on 15 June 2022. The consultation will run until 13 July 2022.  Further information in relation to the consultation, including the full suite of documentation such as the SEA Environmental Report and details regarding how to make a submission, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following: www.gov.ie\/en\/consultation\/3813e-public-consultation-on-the-draft-planning-and-development-act-2000-exempted-development-no-3-regulations-2022-and-the-draft-planning-and-development-solar-safeguarding-zone-regulations-2022-solar-exemptions\/.

Accordingly, the process for finalising the solar panel planning exemptions will be completed in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  While these regulations are out for public consultation, my Department is concurrently examining the scope to draft supplementary regulations to further expand the exemptions by way of reducing the proposed solar safeguarding zones around airports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300057#WRA05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gaeltacht Policy","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300057#WRA05800"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[33208\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300057#WRA05900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the promised guidelines on planning matters in the Gaeltacht; the status of the working group established to examine planning policy in the Gaeltacht; the membership of the group; the terms of reference of the group; the dates of all meetings of the group to date; when the next meeting is scheduled for; if the group will produce a final report; the expected timeline for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>My\u00a0Department convened a working group in May 2021 of last year to examine various aspects of the planning process in all Gaeltacht areas. <\/p><p>Membership of this group is made up of representatives from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the eight relevant local authorities. <\/p><p>The Group&rsquo;s Terms of Reference specify that the Group shall:<\/p><p>-  Provide a forum for the discussion of identified issues related to the operation of the planning system within Gaeltacht areas.

The Government, local authorities, approved housing bodies (AHBs) and others are making every effort to reduce homelessness, and while significant work has been done there is still more to do.<\/p><p>I have established the National Homeless Action Committee, and I have asked them to prioritise the issue of homelessness prevention and to look at all further avenues of addressing this.

Under <i>Housing for All<\/i>, the Government&rsquo;s national housing plan to 2030, the Government is committed to providing 47,600 new-build social homes by the end of 2026, and 90,000 social homes by 2030. In terms of social housing delivery, last year, 9,183 new social homes were provided, a 17% increase on 2020.<\/p><p><i>Housing for All<\/i>provides funding and commits to delivering 36,000 affordable homes for purchase and 18,000 Cost Rental homes up to 2030. Underpinned by the Affordable Housing Act 2021, these affordable homes will be delivered through local authorities, AHBs, the Land Development Agency (LDA), the First Home shared equity scheme and the expansion of the Part V planning requirements. <\/p><p>Over 4,000 Affordable homes are targeted for delivery in 2022, with targets increasing incrementally in subsequent years. An average of 2,000 Cost Rental homes per year are targeted for delivery up to 2030. These will be delivered by AHBs, supported by the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL), the LDA and by local authorities supported by the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF). <\/p><p>50 purpose-built Cost Rental homes, with cost rents of &euro;1,200 per month for a two-bedroom apartment, have been tenanted by the Tuath and Respond AHBs at Enniskerry Road, in conjunction with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The tenanting and allocation process is underway for a further 123 Cost Rental homes across 4 sites in Dublin and Kildare which are due to be tenanted by the end of June. <\/p><p>Following the success of the Voids Programme which delivered over 6,000 units in 2020 and 2021, there is a new Voids Programme for 2022 with an emphasis on quick turnaround and re-letting of vacant social housing stock to those on social housing waiting lists, including those in emergency accommodation.<\/p><p>Significant progress is already being made under <i>Housing for All<\/i>to accelerate supply and recent commencement figures are encouraging. In the past 12 months (June 2021 to May 2022), Commencement Notices for 30,233 new homes were received. On a rolling 12-month basis, the total number of homes for which Commencement Notices were received is 18.5% higher than the previous 12-month period of June 2020 to May 2021. All additional measures that we can take to address the rise in homelessness are being actively pursued.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300058#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Urban Development","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300058#WRB01600"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[32979\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300058#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans for the regeneration of social housing and flat complexes in inner city of Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1555","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>My Department is committed to ensuring that tenants in social housing are provided with adequate housing that meets the standards most recently laid down in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019.\u00a0 My Department is actively engaging with the local authority sector to promote the preventative maintenance of local authority housing stock and provides significant funding for stock improvement works.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to funding provided by the local authorities themselves in respect of their own housing stock, my Department provides funding across a number of programmes to support the local authority work to maintain and improve their social housing stock.\u00a0 In all cases, it is the local authorities that identify priorities. <\/p>  <p>  Following on from reviews of the conditions of their older flat complexes and based on the need to modernise the living conditions and as part of their climate action plans, Dublin City Council are developing a long term strategy for the redevelopment and\/or refurbishment of many of these complexes.\u00a0 I also understand the Council  has identified 96 of these older flat complexes for redevelopment and\/or refurbishment in the years 2022 to 2030.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A large number of these flat complexes will be effectively rebuilt while others will be refurbished and in some cases will need amalgamations (i.e. two in one) due to the sizes of some homes.\u00a0 My Department is considering the most appropriate funding streams to enable these refurbishment\/ regeneration\/replacement projects and will work with Dublin City Council to progress.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has provided Stage 1 Capital Appraisal approval for the refurbishment\/replacement of Pearse House Phase 1, Constitution Hill, Matt Talbot Court, Bluebell Phase 1A, Liberties Cluster Phase 1 and Oliver Bond House, Glover&rsquo;s Court\u00a0 and Stage 2 Approval for St. Mary&rsquo;s Dorset St. My Department is also currently assessing a submission in respect of a Pilot Amalgamation Project in Ballybough House. <\/p>  <p>  My Department looks forward to working with DCC on these important projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300058#WRB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wastewater Treatment","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300058#WRB01900"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[32967\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300058#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the steps he is taking to assist communities in improving wastewater infrastructure.","asker":"1525","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government supports the uptake of Irish Water's Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme 2020-2024, which will provide water and waste water growth capacity in smaller settlements that would otherwise not be provided for in Irish Water's capital investment plan.\u00a0 I understand from Irish Water that an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for this programme was approved by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.

One of the ways that the Government is trying to increase the supply of more affordable homes to rent under Housing for All is through the introduction of a new Cost Rental sector, the legislative framework for which was set out in the Affordable Housing Act last year. It is a long-term rental model, under which tenants only pay the cost of providing, managing and maintaining their homes.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to growing this sector, and through Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), Local Authorities, and the Land Development Agency (LDA) under Project Tosaigh, approximately 1,500 Cost Rental homes are targeted for completion and tenanting this year alone.\u00a0Overall, some 18,000 Cost Rental homes are targeted for completion under Housing for All to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  From 16 July 2021, the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 restricts any rent increase in a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of the Consumer Price (HICP).

Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. The Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. This will provide the sector with the stability and certainty it needs. <\/p><p>Housing for All is set out across four pathways to addressing the most pressing housing challenges facing the State: <ol type=\"1\"><li>Pathway to Supporting homeownership and Increasing Affordability<li>Pathway to Eradicating Homelessness, Increasing Social Housing Delivery And Supporting Social Inclusion\u00a0<li>Pathway to Increasing New Housing Supply<li>Pathway to Addressing vacancy and Efficient Use of Existing Stock <\/ol>These pathways are underpinned by long-term actions to address systemic challenges. The Plan aims to create a housing system which has environmental, social and economic sustainability at its heart and which meets the needs of all.<\/p><p>Increasing housing supply is at the core of Housing for All. Indications of increased construction activity are becoming evident which will help increase the availability of\u00a0homes across all tenures.\u00a0 <\/p><p>This year, the Government&rsquo;s target under Housing for All is 24,600 new homes. In the 12 months to the end of March 2022, a total of 22,219 new homes were completed. In the past 12 months (June 2021 to May 2022), Commencement Notices for 30,233 new homes were received. In addition, latest CSO figures show planning permissions for all residential dwellings are up 22.7% in the year ending Q1 2022 (44,491) when compared to the same time period to Q1 2021 (36,252). Together, the figures point to a substantial uplift in new housing supply in the coming years, as we increase output to average of at least 33,000 new homes per year. This increase in supply will be key to meeting demand, moderating price inflation, and addressing affordability for those wishing to rent or buy their own home.\u00a0<\/p><p>With regard to public housing delivery, each local authority was required to prepare a Housing Delivery Action Plan, setting out details of social and housing affordable delivery in the period 2022-2026. This includes information on the locations where housing will be delivered in addition to information on the planned delivery streams.\u00a0 In September 2021, I issued social housing targets to each local authority, setting out build and long-term leasing targets over the next five years.\u00a0 The main focus under Housing for All is to deliver social homes through new build. In developing the Housing Delivery Action Plans, each local authority was required to assess the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment (HNDA) and plan provision accordingly. The Plans are currently being reviewed by my Department and will be published before the end of Q2 2022.<\/p><p>My Department published the Quarter 4 2021 Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR), which provides details of social housing developments that have been completed or were under construction in each local authority at the end of 2021. The report is available at the following link: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/af746-social-housing-construction-projects-status-report-q4-2021\/ <\/p><p>The capacity of Local Authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects requires the resourcing of their housing services. In this regard, I have sanctioned over 250 additional Local Authority posts, which are in the process of being filled across housing delivery teams in order to deliver on Housing for All's\u00a0ambition.<\/p><p>Affordability, for those wishing to rent or buy, is at the heart of Housing for All. <\/p><p>The delivery of Cost Rental homes at scale is a key affordability measure under\u00a0Housing for All, with State-backed rents that are in the order of 25% below what they would be on the private market. Approximately 18,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered between now and the end 2030 by Local Authorities, AHBs, and the LDA, with 1,580 such cost rental homes targeted for delivery in 2022. <\/p><p>To support Local Authorities in the delivery of affordable homes, the Affordable Housing Fund opened for applications from 1 September 2021. The homes that Local Authorities deliver under the Affordable Housing Fund will be sold at least 15% below open market value in respect of Affordable Purchase homes and in the order of 25% below open market value prices in respect of Cost Rental homes.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Land Development Agency (LDA) has a key role in the delivery of affordable homes and has recently lodged four planning applications for projects that will, if granted planning permission, deliver over 2,300 homes. In 2022, the LDA will also see construction commence on two sites, St Kevin&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork City (delivering 265 units) and Shanganagh, Shankill in conjunction with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council (delivering 597 units, comprising 306 cost rental and 91 affordable\u00a0purchase\u00a0homes). Under Housing for All, 20 additional sites were designated for transfer to the LDA. These lands have the potential to deliver up to 15,000 homes and, in many cases, form part of a major revitalisation of urban centres. <\/p><p>The LDA has also launched &ldquo;Project Tosaigh&rdquo; aimed at unlocking land with full planning permission that is not being developed by private sector owners due to financing and other constraints, to accelerate the delivery of up to 5,000 affordable homes. The first delivery stream of this LDA initiative was launched in November 2021. Details of the homes that will be made available under Project Tosaigh will be confirmed when commercial agreements are finalised.<\/p><p>In addition, the &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; affordable purchase shared equity scheme will support circa 8,000 households in acquiring new homes in the private market in the years 2022 to 2026. Subject to the necessary final approvals process of all founders to the scheme, which will see the State operate the scheme in a strategic partnership with participating mortgage lenders, I anticipate that First Home will become operational in the coming weeks.\u00a0 Full information, including full eligibility criteria and regional price ceilings for homes, will be available on the First Home website upon the scheme&rsquo;s launch.<\/p><p>Increasing the supply of housing, and delivering on our commitments in Housing for All, is the top priority for me and the Government and we have made a good start on our path towards this goal. Importantly, a comprehensive implementation and reporting framework is well established to assess how the actions under the Plan are progressing. These structures include political oversight, via the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Housing, the Housing for All Secretary General Delivery Group, and dedicated Workstreams, all of which monitor delivery of the Plan and recommend any adjustments to priorities, as required, on an ongoing basis. <\/p><p>Progress reports are published quarterly. The fourth of these reports, covering progress in Q2 2022 is\u00a0due for publication in July.

A pathfinder programme will be initiated as part of a Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) fund, to facilitate the making available of some 2,000 sites for homes by 2025.<\/p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme will be delivered via a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders and I can confirm that all parties are working with a view to deploying the scheme in the coming weeks. It will improve access to newly-built homes, below the median price point, by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes. \u00a0This measure, targeted at first time or fresh start buyers, will allow purchasers to exit the rental market, help to build developer confidence in realisable consumer demand, and contribute to the recovery of our construction sector following the Covid-19 emergency. This Scheme will be available nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  Engagement is ongoing with Mayo County Council\u00a0and my Department regarding the potential for development of an affordable housing scheme in Mayo.\u00a0 My Department,\u00a0together with the Housing Agency,\u00a0has offered assistance to any local authority where they are considering developing a scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300059#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300059#WRC02600"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[32945\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300059#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the funding that has been allocated for affordable housing projects in Cork; the status update on these projects; the envisaged timelines for these projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>Delivery of affordable housing, in accordance with the schemes set out in the Affordable Housing Act, 2021 and the funding being made available, will be underpinned by local authorities' Housing Delivery Action Plans. \u00a0Local authorities, including Cork City Council and Cork County Council, submitted their initial Plans to me last December. \u00a0Both Cork City Council and Cork County Council submitted revised Delivery Action Plans to my Department in May 2022.

The General Affairs Council this week took the opportunity to reiterate the full support of Member States for the Commission&rsquo;s approach. <\/p>  <p>  The tabling of this legislation marks a particular low point in the UK government approach to Brexit.  <\/p>  <p>  Brexit, and in particular the hard Brexit chosen by the UK Government, is the root cause of the uncertainty in Northern Ireland. The Protocol is the solution, jointly designed and freely chosen by the British Government to mitigate the challenges posed by their preferred version of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The situation on the ground backs this up. Northern Ireland is growing faster than any other UK region, according to the UK&rsquo;s own Office of National Statistics. The Protocol is a factor in helping protect Northern Ireland from negative effects of shortages and delays, as Northern Irish supply chains have added resilience thanks to its EU Single Market access. Foreign direct investment interest in Northern Ireland is at historically high levels. Northern Irish-based businesses consistently underline the importance of dual market access.<\/p>  <p>  The message I hear from business in Northern Ireland has been consistent. There is a real desire to make the most of the opportunities the Protocol brings. They want continued access to both the EU and GB markets. They want predictability and stability.\u00a0 The UK Government&rsquo;s unilateral actions undermine these objectives and create uncertainty for Northern Ireland businesses, as well as for their suppliers and buyers. <\/p>  <p>  People and business across Northern Ireland have been clear: they want an agreed solution between the EU and the UK. They want the EU and the UK to work together to address the genuine concerns that have been raised. <\/p>  <p>  A majority of newly elected Assembly MLAs have written to Prime Minister Johnson rejecting in the strongest possible terms the UK government&rsquo;s reckless approach, as it, and I quote, &ldquo;flies in the face of the expressed wishes of not just most businesses, but most people in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  Commission Vice-President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic, and his team have done commendable work engaging and listening to people and businesses in Northern Ireland. They have come up with practical and flexible means of implementing the Protocol that can address some of the real-world concerns that have arisen in relation to the movement of goods, and for enhancing Northern Ireland engagement around the Protocol. <\/p>  <p>  These are bespoke arrangements that further demonstrates the flexibility and compromise the EU is willing to show - including an openness to further change its own rules.\u00a0 And importantly, the EU&rsquo;s approach is not a take it or leave it one.\u00a0 The EU is willing to discuss these solutions with the British government.<\/p>  <p>  However, the UK has not engaged in any meaningful discussions since February. Their unwillingness to explore the EU&rsquo;s solutions in any real depth &ndash; taken together with their newly proposed unilateral legislation action &ndash; is the very disappointing and concerning.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have said many times that these issues can be resolved if there is political will to tackle the issues together. <\/p>  <p>  The UK Government continues to state that a negotiated solution is their preferred outcome. If that is true, the UK needs to demonstrate a show of good faith soon to avoid more polarisation on the ground in Northern Ireland and more harm to relationships between our two governments and between the EU and the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300061#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[32920\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300061#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the United Kingdom&rsquo;s use of necessity as a justification for abandoning the Northern Ireland Protocol; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[32936\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300061#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on whether the United Kingdom&rsquo;s legal rationale for seeking to override the Northern Ireland Protocol has any plausible basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 152 together.<\/p>  <p>On 13 June, the UK Government published draft legislation in the form of the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill.

Yet this is what the UK Government propose. Their approach is wholly inconsistent with international law. <\/p>  <p>  In its published &lsquo;Legal Position&rsquo;, the UK Government asserted that the doctrine of necessity can be invoked to lawfully justify non-performance of their international obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement and Protocol. <\/p>  <p>  Necessity as a legal justification for non-performance of an international obligation is an institution of customary international law now codified by the United Nations International Law Commission in Article 25 of its Draft Articles on State Responsibility. This provides that necessity may only be invoked when it is the only way to safeguard an essential interest of the state concerned against a grave and imminent peril, and when it does not seriously impair an essential interest of the party to which the obligation is owed, or of the international community as a whole.\u00a0Furthermore, it clarifies that necessity may only be invoked when there is no other remedy available, and that it may not be invoked by a state if the state has contributed to the situation of necessity. <\/p>  <p>  The British government&rsquo;s decision to table a Bill that sets aside international law and ignores the majority in Northern Ireland is deeply disappointing.

Ireland also expressed concern regarding developments in Masafer Yatta, urging Israel to cease evictions and demolitions, including of donor-funded structures, in line with its obligations under international humanitarian law.<\/p>  <p>  Following the Council meeting on 26 May, Ireland issued a joint media statement, along with France, Estonia and Albania, which strongly reiterated our position on these issues. <\/p>  <p>  As part of our role on the UN Security Council, Ireland engages actively with regional partners in relation to the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory.

It is the seventh time Ireland has held the Presidency and, in light of the war in Ukraine, a particularly important occasion to be at the helm of our continent&rsquo;s leading human rights body.<\/p>  <p>  The Council of Europe was the first multilateral organisation to expel the Russian Federation, following its unprovoked assault on Ukraine. In the wake of that unprecedented but essential step, the overarching goal of our Presidency term is to renew what we consider &lsquo;&lsquo;the conscience of Europe&rsquo;&rsquo;, ensuring the institution does all it can to support democracy, human rights, and rule of law in Ukraine and to hold Russian authorities to account.<\/p>  <p>  Within this framework, we have three particular priorities. First, as one of the Council&rsquo;s founding state, we aim to reaffirm its &lsquo;Founding Freedoms&rsquo;, protecting human rights across the continent, above all through the effective functioning of the European Court of Human Rights. Second, in the face of rising illiberalism, we have set out to promote deliberative democracy and youth participation in the democratic processes, drawing on our experience with Citizens Assemblies. Finally, under the rubric of 'F&aacute;ilte', we will strive to foster a Europe of welcome, inclusion, and diversity, building on the social change Ireland has experienced since we last held the Presidency in 2000. <\/p>  <p>  We are backing these priorities through clear financial commitments, significantly increasing our voluntary contributions to the Council across a range of projects, including supporting the work of the European Court of Human Rights, the Council&rsquo;s revised Action Plan for Ukraine and its world-leading efforts to combat child sexual exploitation and eliminate all forms of gender-based violence.<\/p>  <p>  We have also developed an extensive programme of engagement, with regular high-level visits to and from Strasbourg. On 7 June, the Taoiseach met leaders across the Council and called on the European Court of Human Rights to stress our commitment to the institution.\u00a0I addressed the Council&rsquo;s Parliamentary Assembly earlier this week, sharing a platform with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, leader of the Belarusian democratic movement. Minister Byrne will return to Strasbourg next week to address the Committee of Ministers&rsquo; Deputies, with other visits planned for the autumn. <\/p>  <p>  Here in Ireland, we have already hosted two major Presidency forums on democratic engagement, in UCC and DCU respectively, as well as meetings of the Assembly&rsquo;s Standing Committee and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities. A dozen other conferences are planned for the months ahead, of which three warrant special mention. In July, Minister Donohoe and I host the annual meeting of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Development Bank, which will focus on scaling the Bank&rsquo;s support for Ukraine. In September, Minister McEntee will invite the Council&rsquo;s 46 Justice Ministers to Dublin Castle to enhance our collective efforts to combat Domestic, Sexual &amp;amp; Gender-Based Violence across the continent. November will see Minister Brophy chair the European Conference on Global Education, where Member States will adopt a Dublin Declaration on how, through Global Education, we can build societal commitment to greater justice, sustainability, equity and human rights.<\/p>  <p>Our agenda is ambitious, but necessarily so, and complements our efforts at the UN Security Council, within the EU and across other multilateral fora to do all we can to support Ukraine and reinforce the values of democracy, human rights and rule of law which the Council of Europe embodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300062#WRF05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300062#WRF05200"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[32928\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300062#WRF05300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he expects any further sanctions to be agreed by the European Union against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>The EU has imposed the most significant sanctions in its history in response to the situation in Ukraine.

Over 623,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022. This is 105,000 more passports than were issued at this point of the year in 2019. In the past four weeks, the Passport Service has issued an average of 30,000 passports per week.<\/p>  <p>  99% of all child and adult online renewal applications are issued within the standard turnaround time and almost half of all adults who renew their passports online will receive their new passport in the post within 2 working days. <\/p>  <p>  Processing time for first time applications now takes 25 working days, down from 40 working days in March. In the space of three months, processing time for first-time applications has been reduced by almost 40%. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has been proactively planning for this significant increase in demand for many months and have made an unprecedented investment in the staffing and resources necessary to meet this demand.<\/p>  <p>  A major recruitment drive, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, has been underway since 2021.\u00a0In addition, the Passport Service has run its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs). \u00a0The Department has also been working with the HSE to provide opportunities to contact tracing staff to transfer to the Passport Service. As of 20 June, these staff have begun to be assigned to the Customer Service Hub, which will further increase the number of staff answering customer queries. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers at the Passport Service to over 900 which represents double the number of staff with the Passport Service in June of last year.<\/p>  <p>  Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff has been underway for several months to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of weeks the Passport Service has worked with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the Garda signature cannot be verified.  This new system assists in reducing the number of applications that are delayed due to a failure to verify witness details.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service continues to see a steady, but increasing demand for passports from citizens in Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is a unified service composed of three constituent offices located in Lower Mount Street and Balbriggan in Dublin and South Mall in Cork, respectively. Passport applications from all citizens - whether from anywhere in Ireland, North or South, or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices on the basis of the type of application rather than the place of residence of the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  87% of passport applications from Northern Ireland are submitted online. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.<\/p>  <p>  A paper-based, mail-in service is available at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and the postal application channel, very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport. Passport Service figures show that less than 1% of all applicants use the in-person Urgent Appointment Service available at the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Given the high percentage of applicants from Northern Ireland using Passport Online, I am confident that the range of service options available meets the current needs of passport applicants. While there are no plans to open additional passport offices, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300062#WRF05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":325,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 129 and 130 answered with Question No. 120.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East","counter":326,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300062#WRF06000"},{"type":"question","counter":327,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[33071\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300062#WRF06100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the engagement he has had at bilateral level with his counterparts in Israel with regard to halting the demolition of Palestinian homes in the Masafer Yatta area of the West Bank; his plans to increase Irish aid funding to Palestinian human rights NGOs, particularly in view of the increasing legal constraints faced by such organisations following the designation by Israel in October 2021 of six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":328,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to Question 27542\/22 on the Government&rsquo;s response to the proposed demolitions at Masafer Yatta.

Africa is experiencing one of the most severe droughts in at least forty years, pushing the region close to the brink of catastrophe. Food prices are rising as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 Responding, my Department through the Irish Aid programme has contributed over &euro;48 million in direct humanitarian support to drought-affected Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia over the past 18 months, working with partners on the ground who can act fast to provide life-saving critical assistance to those who need it most. These interventions complement the Irish Aid investment of over &euro;12 million in development funding last year to communities across the region, including in partnership with Irish NGOs.<\/p>  <p>In addition, communities in the drought-affected countries are being supported through Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to multilateral humanitarian action, such as the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) which reacts immediately to crises as they happen. Ireland is the 8th largest contributor to CERF providing &euro;11.5 million in 2022. Since 2021, the CERF has allocated almost $100 million to help drought-affected communities in Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia.<\/p>  <p>  We will continue to draw international attention to the crisis in our role on the UN Security Council. As informal focal point on hunger and conflict at the UNSC, Ireland has consistently shone a spotlight on the underlying causes of food insecurity and the links between conflict, hunger and climate change.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has supported a strong EU response to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Horn of Africa. In April, the EU pledged &euro;348 million for 2022 to provide both humanitarian assistance and longer-term support to tackle root causes of food insecurity, including climate adaptation and mitigation measures.<\/p>  <p>Ireland is a committed global leader on food and nutrition. In 2021 Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to food security and nutrition was reaffirmed with a pledge to spend &euro;800 million over the coming 5 year period for nutrition programmes and interventions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300063#WRG02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300063#WRG02900"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[32969\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300063#WRG03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if Ireland will use its place on the UN security council or call in the Israeli ambassador to raise the use of administrative detention by the Israeli state, and if  it can specifically raise the hunger strike of two detainees (details supplied) who have been held in administrative detention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":368,"content":"<p>As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question 898 on 14 June 2022, I am aware of the cases to which the Deputy refers.

Our focus remains on responding to the conflict, in particular through efforts to ease the plight of the Ukrainian people and to hold the Russian leadership to account. I also discussed with Minister Haavisto Ireland&rsquo;s position in favour of the strongest possible sanctions against Russia, and our support for Ukraine&rsquo;s application to join the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The visit also came following the application of Finland to join NATO, made alongside Sweden on 18 May 2022. This application is indicative of the wider change in the security situation across Europe. It is the clear right of every sovereign and independent State to choose their own foreign policy and to ensure the security and defence of their territories. I assured Minister Haavisto that Ireland supports Finland in making those choices.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and Finland are both committed to a well-functioning system of multilateralism and are committed UN member states. During our meeting we also discussed Ireland&rsquo;s current membership of the UN Security Council and the importance of the rules based international order.<\/p>  <p>  We also had the opportunity to discuss in more detail the EU-UK relationship and the current situation in respect of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, how we support the Commission in continuing to seek dialogue with the UK and we encourage the UK to respond with a similar approach.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and Finland are this year celebrating 60 years of Diplomatic Relations and this meeting was an opportunity to mark that anniversary in person, and to commit to ongoing strong and positive relations between our countries, including as Ireland implements the Nordic Strategy which was published on 1 June 2021. It was also an opportunity to thank Minister Haavisto in person for the assistance provided by Finland to Ireland during the evacuation from Afghanistan in late summer 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to my meeting with Minister Haavisto, while in Helsinki I also met with the Minister of Defence of Finland, Antti Kaikkonen and visited the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300063#WRG03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Neutrality","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300063#WRG04000"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[32927\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300063#WRG04100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the Government's position on neutrality; his plans to refer Ireland's position on neutrality to a Citizens Assembly for discussion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":379,"content":"<p>Ireland has a longstanding policy of military neutrality, meaning that we do not participate in military alliances or common or mutual defence arrangements. This policy, which has been implemented by successive governments, informs our active approach to peace support operations, crisis management, conflict resolution, and peacebuilding. There are no plans to alter this policy at this time.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, it is clear that the security situation in Europe has changed fundamentally.

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that\u00a0has the statutory responsibility\u00a0for the regulation of\u00a0fares in relation to public passenger transport services and for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.\u00a0 The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.\u00a0 The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost. \u00a0The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision. In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living. This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th\u00a0of April and nationwide from the 9th\u00a0of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations.\u00a0 As such, I would like to see the 20% fare reduction continue into 2023; however, I am acutely aware of the competing pressures across the system and the finite Exchequer resources. The funding implications of all measures must be considered in the round so I will work closely with Minister McGrath and other Government colleagues in the context of the 2023 Estimates process to see what we can do with regard to supporting public transport services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The 20% fare reduction comes on top of several other measures that we are progressing to encourage greater public transport patronage. For instance, the Young Adult Card, which provides an average 50% fare discount for those aged between 19 and 23 on both PSO and commercial services. As well as the TFI 90 Minute Fares scheme which means that adults now pay &euro;2, young adults pay &euro;1, and children pay just 65 cent to travel for up to 90 minutes on Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin.\u00a0In May alone, the number of people who had a Child Leap Card, Student Leap Card, or the new Young Adult Leap Card increased by over 16,000, which is very encouraging.<\/p>  <p>  While fare reductions are to be welcomed, investment in additional services is also critical. For this reason, I am committed to progressing core projects like BusConnects, Connecting Ireland and DART+ as well as improving existing services across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.\u00a0 Any\u00a0assessment of a proposed change to\u00a0public transport fare structures\u00a0would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in light of the Authority's responsibility in this area I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the cost of public transport, to the\u00a0NTA for direct reply. \u00a0Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300065#WRJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":442,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300065#WRJ01300"},{"type":"question","counter":443,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[33408\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300065#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to address the poor public electric vehicle charging network; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":444,"content":"<p>The Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle (EV) charging network over the coming years.

It is the chargeable gain that is taxed, not the whole amount you receive. The gain is usually the difference between the price you paid for the asset and the price you disposed of it for or the market value at the time of disposal.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of investment products which are subject to exit tax including life assurance policies, collective investment funds and ETFs. The normal tax treatment afforded to these products is that the funds invested are allowed to grow on a tax-free basis within the fund. This is known as the &lsquo;gross roll-up&rsquo; regime. The income is taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice. <\/p>  <p>  The general thrust of the regime is that there is no annual tax on income or gains arising to a fund. However, a fund has responsibility to deduct exit tax in respect of payments made to certain unit holders in that fund when a &lsquo;chargeable event&rsquo; occurs. <\/p>  <p>  Finance Act 2006 introduced the concept of a deemed disposal as a new chargeable event. A disposal is deemed to occur 8 years following acquisition of a fund and then every 8 years thereafter. Any gain on the investment which arises from the date of acquisition to the date of the deemed disposal is subject to tax. This ensures that income cannot be rolled up indefinitely in the fund without being taxed. On the ultimate disposal of the investment any tax paid which arose as a result of a deemed disposal is allowed as a credit against any final tax liability on disposal.<\/p>  <p>  Comparison of the rate of CGT and exit tax on a headline rate basis does not account for the fact that individual disposals within a fund are rolled up which allows the gross income earned or gains made to be reinvested by the fund until the occurrence of a chargeable event. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as with all taxes, both CGT and exit tax are subject to ongoing review which includes the consideration and assessment of the rate along with any associated reliefs and exemptions. Tax policy and legislation are reviewed by the Tax Strategy Group as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300066#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":466,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300066#WRK01000"},{"type":"question","counter":467,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[33302\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300066#WRK01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider an amendment to the Credit Union Act 1994 to permit credit unions to include a statement when issuing the notice of the AGM to each eligible member in the notice to the effect that the annual accounts may be obtained on the website of the credit union or at the registered office of the credit union (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1570","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":468,"content":"<p>The Credit Union Act (the Act) currently requires credit unions to deliver a copy of the annual accounts, along with the notice of the AGM, to every eligible member which must be delivered to each member, unless the member has specifically opted in to receive the notice electronically.<\/p><p><b>Notice of general meetings<\/b><\/p><p>Section 80(2)(d) of the Act provides that notice of a general meeting must be delivered personally or by post to the auditor and to each member of the credit union and, if delivered by post to any member, must be so delivered to the address of that member as recorded in the books of the credit union.<\/p><p><b>Annual accounts<\/b><\/p><p>In respect of the annual general meeting, section 78(5) of the Act requires, among other things, that a copy of the annual accounts for the financial year in respect of which the meeting is held be delivered, together with the notice of the meeting, to every person entitled to receive such a notice. <\/p><p>Some credit unions are issuing notices of annual general meetings, including a copy of the annual accounts, to members by email (where individual members have opted in to this approach). <\/p><p>In Issue 7 of its sectoral Credit Union News publication (June 2017), the Central Bank included an article on electronic communications, which noted that while credit unions have specific legal obligations with regard to member notifications, many of these may be undertaken through electronic means, subject to them being in compliance with all legal requirements.

The DRS operates on a sliding scale basis, whereby a partial rebate of MOT is available when the retail price of diesel exceeds &euro;1.00 per litre excluding VAT. The repayment rate increases gradually as the retail price increases, up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre\/&euro;75.00 per 1,000 litres. At current retail prices the repayment rate is at this maximum.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the effective MOT rate on auto-diesel must be considered in ensuring compliance with the ETD. The effective rate includes the maximum MOT rate repayable under the Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS), currently &euro;75.00 per 1,000 litres. The current MOT rate on auto-diesel is &euro;405.38 per 1,000 litres, which is &euro;75.38 above the ETD minimum. However, when the DRS is taken into account, the effective MOT rate is &euro;0.38 per 1,000 litres, or 0.038 cents per litre, above the ETD minimum, meaning that any material reduction in the effective MOT rate would be incompatible with EU law.<\/p><p>Any reduction in the VAT on fuel\/petrol would require the standard rate of VAT (23%) to be reduced. The estimated cost of a 1% reduction is &euro;542m annually. <\/p><p>In conclusion, I propose to keep the taxation of fuel under review as part of preparations for Budget 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300066#WRK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300066#WRK02200"},{"type":"question","counter":479,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[33552\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300066#WRK02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners will meet with a person (details supplied) in order to further discuss their qualification as a new business owner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":480,"content":"<p>Further to my reply to Question 31645\/22, the Deputy will be aware that the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), as provided for in Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, is administered under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.

The overall aim of the Directive is to maintain high and good status waters where they exist and to restore waters that do not currently reach these standards.  River basin management planning, structured in six-year cycles, is the tool prescribed by the Directive for achieving these aims.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the successful elements of the first River Basin Management Plans cycle, the Government introduced new structures for implementation of the Directive as part of the second-cycle river basin management plan that covers the period 2018-2021. These new structures include the Water Policy Advisory Committee (WPAC), which provides high-level policy direction and oversight of implementation. The National Coordination and Management Committee, formed under WPAC, ensures that the measures necessary to achieve our objectives are implemented in an efficient, effective and co-ordinated way. The National Technical Implementation Group, co-ordinates ongoing tracking of implementation and provides a forum for knowledge sharing. Finally, the regional local authority structures, comprising of 5 regional committees, drive delivery of supporting measures at local level.<\/p>  <p>  These structures are further supported by the Local Authority Waters Programme (LAWPRO). Funded by my Department, LAWPRO is responsible for;<\/p>  <p>  - Coordinating efforts by local authorities, public bodies and other stakeholders to achieve the water quality objectives of the EU Water Framework Directive<\/p>  <p>  - Supporting local communities to get involved in caring for their local waters and participate in decision making and river basin management plans, and<\/p>  <p>  - Applying catchment science to identify the issues impacting on water quality in a number of Priority Areas for Action and to refer them to the relevant bodies for action.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Directive in Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is charged with, inter alia, the monitoring of water status in order to establish a comprehensive overview of water status within each river basin district.  A full assessment of the overall quality and ecological status of Ireland&rsquo;s waters takes place every three years, with the most recent full report published in 2019. In the intervening years, the EPA publishes a report on the indicators of water quality. <\/p>  <p>  The latest indicators report for 2020 highlights that the main risk to water quality continues to be excess nutrients in our rivers, lakes and coastal areas, with the trends in some areas going in the wrong direction.  The oversupply of nutrients is coming from agricultural land and from underperforming urban and domestic waste water systems.<\/p>  <p>  However, I welcome the positive signs that some rivers are showing evidence of improvement, particularly in the Priority Areas for Action that were identified for targeted action in the current River Basin Management Plan for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Our water resources are facing complex pressures, and increasing demands, from population change; expected further growth in the economy; as well as from a changing climate.  As a result, we will need a cross-sector collective effort to protect Ireland&rsquo;s water quality.<\/p>  <p>  On agricultural nutrients, I am working closely with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on effective measures to address these issues through the River Basin Management Plan process, the Nitrates Action Programme and the CAP Strategic Plan.<\/p>  <p>  Our farmers, food producers and our agricultural system must work in harmony with our environment if we are to maintain our clean, green image.  We must carefully manage how we use nutrients on our agricultural land to both secure productivity gains and reduce the loss of excess nutrients to water.<\/p>  <p>  To do this we must continue to work together at a local catchment-scale using programmes such as LAWPRO and the Agriculture Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme (ASSAP) who work directly with communities and with farmers to protect and deliver improvements in water quality. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme is another key instrument in achieving good water quality. It is designed to prevent pollution of surface waters and groundwater from agricultural sources and to protect and improve water quality. Following the fourth review of Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme, the 5th Nitrates Action Programme was finalised and the Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters Regulations (SI 113 of 2022)  were signed in March. The new Action Programme came into effect on the 11th March and will run until the end of 2025, with an interim review taking place in 2023. <\/p>  <p>  To address waste water issues, Irish Water must continue to deliver its capital investment programme.  While progress is being made by Irish Water in reducing the number of waste water plants on the EPA&rsquo;s priority action list, continued and sustained investment is needed to reduce the impact from insufficiently treated waste water discharges and to meet our Water Framework Directive objectives. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the National Development Plan 2021-2030 commits to almost &euro;6 billion in capital  investment by Irish Water in the period from 2021-2025, of which over &euro;4.5 billion will be Voted Exchequer funded in respect of domestic water services. As part of Budget 2022, I secured funding of over &euro;1.57 billion to support water services. This includes &euro;1.459 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. <\/p>  <p>  This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and waste water services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine areas.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is also currently preparing the third River Basin Management Plan for Ireland, to cover the period 2022 &ndash; 2027. A key commitment in the Programme for Government, a revised and strengthened River Basin Management Plan will be published later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the work of the second-cycle, this plan will again describe the main pressures and activities affecting water status and set out the environmental objectives to be achieved up to 2027 and identify the measures needed to achieve these objectives, including those highlighted by the EPA. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300068#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":529,"content":"<p>Question No. 213 answered with Question No. 212.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":530,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300068#WRM01300"},{"type":"question","counter":531,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[33272\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300068#WRM01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the details of the senior executive officer roles that were assigned to both Drogheda and Dundalk in 2020;

This is at the initiative of the Local Authority concerned, though under the legislation the draft Schemes must be submitted to the Minister for consideration.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0For households and individuals more suited to renting a home, the Housing for All strategy also includes measures to improve security and affordability in the rental market, including the introduction of Cost Rental tenancies. The rent levels of Cost Rental tenancies are based on the cost of the provision of homes, rather than being subject to the pressures of the open market.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department has directed Cost Rental landlords to seek the efficient use of resources by allocating appropriately sized homes according to household needs. This direction is to ensure that landlords place tenants into homes of an appropriate size, in order to maximise the efficient use of the limited number of properties that have been available during the initial rollout of Cost Rental. Over the period of the Housing for All plan from 2021 to 2030, it is intended that 18,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered in our urban centres by Local Authorities, AHBs and the LDA. These Cost Rental homes will accommodate a range of different household types and sizes, including individuals living alone or in smaller households, as further developments are completed.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To date, approval in principle has been confirmed so far for 911 Cost Rental homes to be delivered by AHBs under the CREL scheme in the period to 2023. These will range in sizes from those suitable to smaller households to larger family homes and will include 110 one-bedroom residences. Up to 234 Cost Rental homes are expected to have been completed across the country by the end of this month, and within 12 months of the passing of the Affordable Housing Act to regulate this entirely new sector last July.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In addition to the schemes already mentioned,\u00a0Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 provides for the establishment of the &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; affordable purchase shared equity scheme to support purchases of new homes in the private market.\u00a0The Scheme aims to support c. 8,000 households in the private market in the years out to 2026.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  First Home will help applicants to afford new homes in the private market through the use of an equity share model, similar to that employed in the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme. The Scheme will primarily support households including single first-time buyers in the purchase of new homes within designated regional price ceilings, set with reference to the median prices for new homes purchased by first-time buyers in the area.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Subject to the necessary final approvals process of all founders to the scheme, which will see the State operate the scheme in a strategic partnership with participating mortgage lenders, it is anticipated that First Home will become operational in the coming weeks.\u00a0Full information, including full eligibility criteria and regional price ceilings for homes, will be available on the First Home website upon the Scheme&rsquo;s launch.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Other measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Local Authority Home Loan, are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All introduced the Local Authority Home Loan scheme as a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. The new Local Authority Home Loan commenced on 4 January 2022\u00a0and is available for families and single people on modest or low incomes who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial banks to purchase or build a home. The loan can be used by first-time buyers and Fresh Start applicants for both for new and second-hand properties, or for self-builds.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the Local Authority Home Loan scheme the income ceiling for a single applicant has been increased from &euro;50,000 to\u00a0&euro;65,000 in counties where the scheme's house price limit is\u00a0&euro;320,000 (Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow). In the rest of the country, where the scheme&rsquo;s house price limit is &euro;250,000, the income ceiling for a single applicant is &euro;50,000.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  More details on the Local Authority Home Loan scheme are available on the following link:\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  localauthorityhomeloan.ie\/.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>The Help-to-Buy incentive supports First-time Buyers in meeting the deposit requirements for newly-built houses or apartments, as well as self-build homes. Subject to the level of income tax and DIRT paid over the previous 4 years, the Help-to-Buy scheme provides a maximum benefit to First-Time Buyers of &euro;30,000 or 10% of the cost of the newly constructed home.\u00a0  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300068#WRM02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":539,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300068#WRM02200"},{"type":"question","counter":540,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[33330\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300068#WRM02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will clarify exactly when housing assistance payment rates will be increased; if he will acknowledge that an increase will help some tenants to remain in properties in which rents have risen and will also provide for others waiting to be housed to access more dwellings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":541,"content":"<p>I am working with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for an increase in the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) discretion rate to 35% and for new tenancies, to expand the couple&rsquo;s rate to single persons where required.

This will require the\u00a0completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and\u00a0the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes in response.<\/p>  <p>  As notified in Circular 18\/2022, a further &euro;5 million in funding has been ring-fenced for Planned Maintenance under this years Planned Maintenance\/Voids Programme to support an ICT asset management system for the LA sector and to provide a funding contribution for the commencement of\u00a0stock condition surveys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300069#WRN02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":576,"content":"<p>Question No. 230 answered with Question No. 207.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":578,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300070#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":579,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[33522\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300070#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the extent to which it is proposed to upgrade income qualification levels for local authority housing loans with a view to making such loans more readily available to suitable qualified applicants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":580,"content":"<p>The introduction of the Local Authority Home Loan was announced as part of Housing For All. \u00a0This is the successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme.

The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build.

320 together.<\/p>  <p>The Passport Service continues to outperform its previous busiest year, 2019, by over 20%. Over 623,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022. This is 105,000 more passports than were issued at this point of the year in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is continually working to deliver enhanced customer experience and service delivery to our citizens. This year the Passport Service is experiencing an unprecedented volume of demand for passports. This is as a direct result of pent-up demand for travel after two years of pandemic-related restrictions. <\/p>  <p>  This level of demand is not unique to Ireland. In countries such as the UK and United States, the turnaround time for all types of passports can be up to 10 weeks. The Passport Service has managed to decrease the processing times for first time online applications by 40% since March. Processing time for first time applications now takes 25 working days, down from 40 working days in March. In addition, almost half of adult online renewals are processed within 2 days. Our Passport Service is performing at its highest capacity ever and is producing an average of 6,000 passports per day. The current processing times are:<\/p>  <p>  - Online adult renewal - 10 working days<\/p>  <p>  - Online child\/complex renewal - 15 working days<\/p>  <p>  - Online first time application - 25 working days (from 6 June)<\/p>  <p>  - An Post Passport Service - 8 weeks<\/p>  <p>  In order to achieve these type of results and to continue to improve the service, my Department has made a huge investment in the Passport Service. In terms of staffing, over 400 staff have been assigned to the Passport Service since June of last year, including 120 in recent weeks. The addition of these staff has allowed the Passport Service to maintain its current turnaround times in the face of enormous levels of demand.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to significantly more staff being assigned, the Passport Service has made important improvements that will help to ensure that passport applications can be processed without delay:<\/p>  <p>1.   A large number of the new staff are being assigned to the Customer Service Hub. This will greatly increase the number of calls and webchats being answered and will assist with customers getting access to the information they need.<\/p>  <p>  2. In addition to this, the Passport Service released two online video guides that provide tips to ensure that passport photos and witnessed consent forms for children are correctly submitted. Passport photos and witnessed consent forms are some of the main reasons that an application may be rejected, so it is important the customers have all the information they need to ensure that these are submitted correctly. These easy-to-follow video guides are available on my Department's website and social media channels and I encourage all applicants to watch them before they submit their application.<\/p>  <p>  3. My Department is currently running a national radio and print public information campaign reminding our citizens to check their passports and to apply online. This campaign also offers tips for ensuring your application is correct and complete. This is running in 10 national newspapers and on national and local radio in Ireland, as well as in Northern Ireland. In addition to this, national radio interviews have been undertaken by Passport Service management. These interviews have helped to inform the public of the length of time it takes to apply for a passport and to promote Passport Online which is the quickest and easiest way to apply for a passport. <\/p>  <p>  4. Over the past number of weeks the Passport Service has worked with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the Garda signature cannot be verified. This new system assists in reducing the number of applications that are delayed due to a failure to verify witness details.<\/p>  <p>  5. Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff has been underway for several months to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service uses modeling software to monitor and predict levels of demand based on demand in previous years and taking into account renewal dates of passports already in circulation, as well as consumer demand for travel. We are currently seeing high volumes of applications due to pent-up demand following pandemic-related travel restrictions. Turnaround times are based on predicted levels of demand as well as resources available. The Passport Service uses workforce planning software to assign staff resources to the areas of highest demand. This is continuously monitored by Passport Service management.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of steps that passport applications must go through before being dispatched to the applicant:<\/p>  <p>  1. Registration of the passport application either online or through An Post Passport.<\/p>  <p>  2. Submission of the required supporting documents to the Passport Service (if applicable).<\/p>  <p>  3. Passport Service registers the documents and verifies their validity.<\/p>  <p>  4. The application is processed by an entitlement checker who confirms the applicant's identity and that they are entitled to Irish citizenship. In cases of children, the checker verifies the consent of the child's guardians with the witness.<\/p>  <p>  5. Application is approved or the applicant is contacted if additional supporting documents are required.<\/p>  <p>  6. Once approved, the passport is printed and dispatched to the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  All passport staff involved in checking and approving passports have their work spot-checked and audited.<\/p>  <p>  Many parts of the process are fully automated and there are a number of systems in place to ensure the integrity and security of the process. The Irish passport is rated 5th in the world in terms of security and offers our citizens visa-free access to 187 countries. <\/p>  <p>  If an applicant requires a resubmission link for a new consent form, the process can take up to 5 days due to the volume of resubmission links that are being requested. Resubmission links are valid for 5 days. Additional staffing recently assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce the number of days it takes for this process. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to checking of applications as soon as they are received, this is simply a question of the volume of applications currently being submitted. When applications are received, they enter a queue and are checked in order of the date they are received. If they are fully correct and complete they will be printed and dispatched to the customer as soon as they are checked. If there is an issue with the application, the Passport Service will alert the customer and any additional documents are processed in three weeks or less once received back from the customer. <\/p>  <p>  The Urgent Appointment service continues to operate successfully in both Cork and Dublin. Additional staff have been added to the public-facing areas to deal with high demand for this service during the summer months. Appointments are currently scheduled to be 20 minutes long and can only be processed using a paper application which does not have in built efficiencies of the online system. Currently only one applicant can be processed in one appointment.

No amount of vague language around protecting the Good Friday Agreement can deny the fact that the UK is planning to set aside a solemn agreement and to break international law. Far from fixing the challenges arising from the Protocol, the British Government&rsquo;s legislation will create a whole new set of uncertainties and damage relationships within Northern Ireland, across our islands, between our governments, and between the UK and the EU and its Member States.<\/p>  <p>  I am in regular and ongoing contact with the political parties and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland, both with regard to the Protocol and the restoration of Northern Ireland Executive. Following the Assembly elections in May, both I and the Taoiseach travelled to Northern Ireland to meet with the party leaders and with representatives of the business community. The Government has consistently sought to listen to and engage with the perspectives and concerns of everyone in relation to the Protocol, including those in the unionist community. The European Commission has done likewise and, in October, the Commission presented far-reaching proposals directly addressing these concerns. However, the UK has failed to seriously engage with these proposals.<\/p>  <p>  I have remained in contact with the business community, civil society representatives, and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland with regard to the Protocol. The clear message that we have heard first hand from people and businesses in Northern Ireland is that they want an agreed solution between the UK and the EU, not unilateral action. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s business community has a real desire to make the most of the opportunities presented by the Protocol, which requires certainty, stability, and predictability. The British Government&rsquo;s recent actions undermine this and create uncertainty for businesses in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In the period ahead, we will continue to engage with the political parties in Northern Ireland, along with business and civil society representatives, both to understand genuine concerns around the implementation of the Protocol and to support the full functioning of all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300078#WRW01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":779,"content":"<p>Question No. 319 answered with Question No. 318.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":780,"content":"<p>Question No. 320 answered with Question No. 247.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":782,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300079#WRX00200"},{"type":"question","counter":783,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[33537\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300079#WRX00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which Ireland continues to highlight at international level the atrocities carried out against the people of Ukraine by Russia; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":784,"content":"<p>The further invasion of Ukraine by the armed forces of the Russian Federation, commencing on 24 February 2022, is a gross violation of international law.<\/p>  <p>  There have been many reports of shocking acts perpetrated by the invading Russian forces in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  On 19 April, I de-briefed the UN Security Council following my visit to Ukraine and bore witness in the Council Chamber to what I had seen with my own eyes, focusing in particular on the town of Bucha. I described hundreds of family homes, shops and other civilian infrastructure: blackened, burnt, looted, damaged, and- in some cases &ndash; completely destroyed. I described how I stood at the edge of one of the mass graves, where the work of carefully exhuming bodies continued. 503 civilians had been identified at that stage - and just 4 soldiers.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, and our EU partners, are clear on the need for international justice mechanisms to assist in delivering accountability. Ireland is a strong supporter of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and is one of over 40 States Parties to have referred the situation in Ukraine to the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC for the purposes of investigating claims of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed in Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Prosecutor has now commenced investigation activities in Ukraine which are intended to lead to the prosecution at the ICC of individuals for the commission of crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court.<\/p>  <p>  Another important tool for rapid work on holding Russia accountable has been the use of the Organization for Security Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)&rsquo;s Moscow Mechanism. On 3 March 2022 the Moscow Mechanism was invoked by Ukraine, supported by 45 participating States, including Ireland. Consequently, a Mission of three experts was appointed on 14 March 2022, which delivered its report to Ukraine as the inviting state on 5 April 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Mission&rsquo;s mandate was to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding possible contraventions of OSCE commitments, and violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. It was also mandated to establish the facts and circumstances of possible cases of war crimes and crimes against humanity. On 2 June, the Moscow Mechanism was invoked again to build on the report of the first mandate.<\/p>  <p>  Holding Russia accountable for violations of international law must continue to be pursued by the multilateral system. Ireland has been strong and consistent in using its voice internationally to do so.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In line with our core principles for our term on the UN Security Council - Building Peace, Strengthening Conflict Prevention and Ensuring Accountability - Ireland continues to use our membership of the Council to hold Russia accountable, to urge it to end its war in Ukraine immediately, and to call out Russia&rsquo;s cynical attempts to use the Council and other UN bodies to spread disinformation.<\/p>  <p>  At a meeting of the Security Council on 12 May, Ireland called, in particular, for the protection of children and other civilians. At a meeting of the UN Security Council on 6 June, Ireland also highlighted our deep concern about reports of conflict related sexual violence and crimes of trafficking. On 21 June, at a meeting of the Security Council to discuss the issue of incitement to violence leading to atrocities, Ireland called for respect for international law, the protection of civilians, and for Russian withdrawal from Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to actively participate at the Human Rights Council and has repeatedly condemned reports of gross and systematic violations of human rights by Russia. Ireland co-sponsored a Human Rights Council resolution on 4 March establishing an independent Commission of Inquiry to investigate all alleged breaches of human rights and international humanitarian law, and related crimes in the context of Russia&rsquo;s invasion, and with our international partners, also supported the UN General Assembly&rsquo;s decision to suspend Russia&rsquo;s membership rights from the Human Rights Council on 7 April. <\/p>  <p>  On 16 June, at the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland delivered a strong statement condemning Russia's actions in Mariupol, highlighting the grave humanitarian and human rights consequences of these actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300079#WRX00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":786,"qnumday":322,"qnumall":"[33538\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300079#WRX00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the Ukraine application for membership of the European Union can be accelerated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":787,"content":"<p>On 17 June the European Commission recommended, in a formal opinion, that Ukraine be granted candidate status, on the understanding that certain steps are taken. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports the Commission's recommendation and the Taoiseach has stated that he will advocate for its endorsement by the European Council later this week.

We recognise the value of enlargement as a transformative driver for stability and peace in candidate countries.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently five recognised candidates for membership of the European Union: Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, and Serbia. Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina are recognised as potential candidates by the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina has formally submitted an application for membership, while Kosovo has a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, and has indicated an intention to submit a formal application for EU membership during 2022. Ukraine applied for membership of the EU on 28 February 2022, while Moldova and Georgia followed suit on 03 March. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, EU relations with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia are set within the framework of the Eastern Partnership. &lsquo;Association Agreements&rsquo; and &lsquo;Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements&rsquo; (DCFTAs) are in place with all three aimed at promoting deeper political ties, stronger economic links and ensuring respect for common values. While some progress has been made over the years towards closer integration with the EU, progress on reforms has been slow overall.<\/p>  <p>  Ukraine&rsquo;s application was discussed at the informal European Council meeting on 10 &amp;amp; 11 March 2022. This resulted in the &lsquo;Versailles Declaration&rsquo;, which acknowledged the &ldquo;European aspirations and the European choice of Ukraine&rdquo;. The European Council also invited the Commission to submit its opinion on all three applications in accordance with the established procedures, while noting that &ldquo;Ukraine belongs to our European family&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  On 17 June 2022, the Commission presented its Opinions on the EU membership applications submitted by Ukraine, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova as invited by the Council. The Opinions refer to three sets of criteria: political criteria, economic criteria and the ability of each country to assume the obligations of EU membership.<\/p>  <p>  In essence, the Commission has recommended that candidate status now be granted to Ukraine and Moldova, on the understanding that reforms are carried out in a number of areas. It was also recommended that candidate status eventually be granted to Georgia, once a number of priority reforms have been addressed, with the Commission to review progress on all three applicants by the end of 2022.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Opinions of the Commission in response to these three applications which align very much with our own public pronouncements and internal analysis over recent months. The Taoiseach has already made clear that Ireland wishes to see this week&rsquo;s European Council grant Ukraine and Moldova candidate status. Ireland further hopes that the positive signal given to Georgia by the Commission&rsquo;s Opinion will spur its Government to implement reforms and reverse the democratic backsliding of recent years.<\/p>  <p>  In the Western Balkans, current issues relating to the enlargement process largely revolve around the commitment to opening Inter-Governmental Conferences (IGCs) with Albania and North Macedonia. The main obstacle to agreement is Bulgaria&rsquo;s continued objection to moving ahead with opening accession negotiations with North Macedonia due to bilateral difficulties related to the Macedonian language, the Bulgarian community in North Macedonia, and the implementation of the 2017 Treaty on Good Neighbourly Relations.

Recipients of Irish Aid funding include Concern Worldwide, Goal, Plan International Ireland, and Trocaire, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and UN agencies and programmes. As an EU Member State, Ireland also contributes to the significant EU development and humanitarian response in countries affected by Boko Haram and al-Shabaab.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Since 2015, Irish Aid has allocated over &euro;36 million in bilateral funding to alleviate the conditions of people in distress across the Lake Chad region &ndash; including North-East Nigeria, where the numbers of people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection are at the highest levels recorded. In 2021, Ireland&rsquo;s funding in the region included &euro;1 million to support the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, which is managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and provides life-saving assistance to communities affected by the conflict in the north east of the country. In 2021, Ireland also provided an additional &euro;500,000 to UNOCHA to address increasing humanitarian needs in Niger. In 2022, Ireland also supported the ICRC with &euro;2 million in funding for its humanitarian work in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali and Niger to meet the needs of communities affected by conflict, including those affected by violence from Boko Haram. At the EU, Ireland supports a strong EU humanitarian engagement in the Sahel and Lake Chad Basin to address the need of most vulnerable communities. In 2022, the EU has allocated &euro;554 million to respond to the severe needs in the Sahel and Lake Chad region, particularly to address the deteriorating food insecurity and nutrition crisis. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;57 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Somalia, including to communities displaced by conflict from al-Shabaab-held areas. In response to the intensifying drought, Ireland made its contributions to humanitarian pooled funds early this year, to ensure that funding was available in a timely manner, with over &euro;5.1 million in direct humanitarian funding for Somalia so far in 2022. We have also contributed to the EU funding of &euro;348 million for Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, which includes humanitarian assistance and longer-term support to tackle root causes of food insecurity, including climate adaptation and mitigation measures. .

Ireland is penholder, together with Ghana, on the UNOWAS file at the UN Security Council. In its most recent Presidential Statement on peace consolidation in West Africa of 17 August 2021, the Security Council strongly condemned continued attacks against civilians in the region, and both attacks and threats of attacks against schools, children, and educational personnel, including abductions in Nigeria. Additionally, Ireland is a member of the International Support Group of the Regional Stabilisation Strategy for the Lake Chad Basin (ISG), and has observer status at the Sahel Alliance: both are forums which enable donors to coordinate support in addressing the challenges in Boko Haram-affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The UN-mandated African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), a follow-on mission to the African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which is primarily funded by the EU, assists the Federal Government of Somalia in its efforts to combat al-Shabaab. Ireland is supportive of plans to further transition security responsibilities to the Somali Security Forces. Ireland is Chair of the Somalia Sanctions Committee at the UN Security Council, which oversees an arms embargo and other tools to encourage a more peaceful and secure Somalia. This complements Ireland&rsquo;s role as an EU Member State supporting development and governance in Somalia, including the strengthening of its institutions. <\/p>  <p>  The EU has three Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) Missions in the Horn of Africa.

The incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK domestic law was a critical part of the Good Friday Agreement.\u00a0The rights protections afforded by the ECHR and the Human Rights Act have been essential in creating confidence in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s political, policing and judicial structures over the past 24 years.<\/p>  <p>  We are very concerned by any potential diminution of human rights protection in Northern Ireland that might arise from this, which may impact upon the crucial trust in the Agreement and the protections that it extends to citizens in Northern Ireland.\u00a0We have underlined that concern to the British Government in the context of the review established in 2020 to examine the framework of the Human Rights Act, including at the most recent meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference. We will continue to engage with the British Government to ensure that the rights and protections as guaranteed by the Good Friday Agreement are fully maintained into the future.<\/p>  <p>  The system of government at Stormont is at the centre of the Good Friday Agreement and it is paramount that the institutions of power-sharing are restored. It is for the parties now, and those representatives that have been elected by the people, to come together to get the Assembly up and running, the NI Executive established and the NSMC fully operational again, and the Irish Government will continue to work to support these vital goals. I have remained and continue to remain in regular contact with the parties in Northern Ireland following the Assembly elections, and have also been in contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that nothing is done to undermine political stability in Northern Ireland, and that we work collectively in support of all the institutions of the Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The UK Government&rsquo;s decision to table legislation to unilaterally dis-apply elements of the Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland is disappointing and deeply concerning. The Protocol was designed and agreed by the UK and the EU to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions and to mitigate the inevitable disruption arising for the island of Ireland from Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Protocol fully recognises the constitutional position of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. It protects North South cooperation and the all-island economy, the gains of the peace process which benefit communities North and South, and ensures &lsquo;no diminution of rights, safeguards, or equality of opportunity&rsquo; as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The fundamental purpose of the Protocol is to protect the Good Friday Agreement. Arguing that the Protocol and the Good Friday Agreement are incompatible is disingenuous and irresponsible. Taken together, they are a powerful expression of what negotiation and partnership can achieve.<\/p>  <p>  A constructive and solution-focussed approach is needed from all concerned, and the Government has communicated that message clearly and strongly to the UK Government.<\/p>  <p>  It is also a matter of real concern that the British government has chosen to introduce legislation on the legacy of the past, unilaterally, moving away from the process agreed in the Stormont House Agreement. We have profound concerns both on the substance of the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill and the process of its introduction, and are deeply conscious that it has been strongly opposed by victims, by the Northern Ireland parties, and by civil society groups. There are also serious questions with regard to the Bill's compliance with international human rights obligations.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has communicated our concerns and continues to engage with the UK Government and others on this most sensitive issue as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>The Government will continue to do all in its power to work together with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to work for lasting peace, deeper reconciliation and a prosperous future for all the people of Northern Ireland.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300080#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":825,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300080#WRY01400"},{"type":"question","counter":826,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[33551\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300080#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the trafficking of women and children or vulnerable persons continues to be combatted at international level; the countries cooperating or not cooperating in this effort; the actions taken or pending against the perpetrators; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":827,"content":"<p>Ireland is a strong contributor to European Union, Council of Europe and United Nations efforts to combat trafficking in persons. \u00a0This includes our work across the UN system, including at the UN Security Council, UN General Assembly, and at the UN Human Rights Council. <\/p><p>At the UN Security Council the issue of trafficking in persons is considered in the context of certain country-specific discussions.

The new assessment arrangements under the Framework for Junior Cycle on the other hand require all students to engage in an assessment of their oral skills through Classroom Based Assessment. This gives a greater opportunity for\u00a0<b>all<\/b>students to develop and enhance their oral language proficiency skills over the three years of Junior Cycle and to foster their ability to use the Irish language.<\/p><p>With effect since 2017, as part of the Framework for Junior Cycle, Junior Cycle provision for Irish in post-primary schools and settings comprises two new specifications. The L1 (Language 1, in Irish, Teanga 1) specification is targeted at students in Irish-medium schools and students in English-medium schools who learn one or more subjects (apart from Irish) through the medium of Irish. The L2 (Language 2, Teanga 2) specification is targeted at other students in English-medium schools.\u00a0<\/p><p>The new specifications (both L1 and L2) have a strong emphasis on oral language. This is particularly highlighted in the main strand of the specifications &ndash; Communicative Competence. This strand places an enhanced emphasis on Irish as the language of learning and communication in classrooms as well as an emphasis on the skills required to communicate effectively with other users of the language. Communication, opportunities for use and interaction are central to classroom tasks.\u00a0<\/p><p>The assessment of these skills forms an integral component of the overall language learning experience and occurs in a number of ways. As well as the completion of tasks where students use and demonstrate their oral language skills to achieve specific learning outcomes, their oral language skills are also formally assessed through the two new Classroom-Based Assessments (CBAs). The second Classroom-Based Assessment in particular is entirely based on students&rsquo; oral language competence. The CBA is linked to ongoing classroom exchanges and represents a more authentic reflection of students&rsquo; interests and competence levels in Irish. Importantly, the oral skills of all students are now assessed in classroom-based assessments and formally reported upon in each students&rsquo; Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement.\u00a0 Unlike the previous reporting format in which candidates receive one overall grade based on their achievement in Irish in the Junior Certificate, whether they undertake the optional oral or not, the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement allows students&rsquo; achievement in the CBAs to be recorded independently of the result in the state-certified examination.<\/p><p>These new arrangements provide a greater opportunity for students to develop their oral language proficiency skills.\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department remains committed to encouraging the use of spoken Irish.\u00a0 The development of the new curriculum specifications for Irish at Junior Cycle was informed by research and extensive consultation with the education partners including practising teachers and students. Extensive continuing professional development (CPD) provided to teachers is complemented by a range of other supports. The new approach gives better recognition to the development of students&rsquo; oral competence, including their ability to speak Irish, over the three-years of Junior Cycle.<\/p><p>As is the case with all of the specifications developed under the Junior Cycle Framework, the NCCA reviews the enactment of subject specification by conducting interim reviews once each subject specification has been experienced across the three-year span of their Junior Cycle. The purpose of such reviews is to capture feedback from teachers, students and stakeholders on their experiences of the new specifications. In February 2021, the NCCA opened a public consultation on draft L1 and L2 specifications for Leaving Certificate (established) Irish. In response to subsequent stakeholder requests, the NCCA extended the timeline for this consultation and also undertook to conduct and early enactment review of the specifications for Junior Cycle Irish.

(See Table 1 below). <\/p><p>An inspection visit is conducted in post-primary schools at least once in two years, on average. In 2018 and 2019, when the normal inspection programme was operating, a total of 1,264 inspections was carried out in the 730 post-primary schools in the country. (See Table 2 below). <\/p><p>During the pandemic, the Inspectorate continued to achieve a high level of coverage in its inspection and advisory engagements with schools in 2020 and 2021, notably through a customised inspection programme that included inspections to support the safe provision of schooling, incidental inspections and urgent inspections such as child protection and safeguarding inspections (CPSI). In 2020 and 2021, a total of 2,542 inspections was carried out in primary schools and special schools (Table 1).

As part of this process I published A White Paper to End Direct Provision and to establish a New International Protection Support Service. This White Paper outlines the proposed new model of accommodation and supports that will be offered to applicants for International Protection and is the result of an extensive consultation process with Civil Society Organisations, residents of Direct Provision centres, and other Government Departments and Bodies.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The new system is based on a series of principles which is centred on a human rights approach with a focus on dignity, respect and privacy for all. The new model will co-ordinate a two phase system of accommodation and supports that ensures people who are applying for protection are helped integrate into Ireland from day one, with health, housing, education, and employment supports at the core of the new system. All families will be offered own-door accommodation, while single people will be offered own-room accommodation. Congregated accommodation settings will be phased out and the accommodation will be managed by independent not-for-profit organisations operating on behalf of the State.<\/p>  <p>  Since the publication of the White Paper my department has placed a significant focus on delivering the new model of accommodation and supports for International Protection. The progress to date has included:<\/p>  <p>  - Establishment of a dedicated transition team within my department to drive implementation of the programme;<\/p>  <p>  - Development of a detailed implementation plan including inputs from other key stakeholders who have a responsibility for delivering services to International Protection applicants;<\/p>  <p>  - Governance structures established to oversee transition to the new model in the form of a Programme Board and an External Advisory Committee. The membership of the Programme Board includes a representative with lived experience of International Protection and representatives of non-governmental organisations. The Board has met regularly over the past twelve months to review progress;<\/p>  <p>  - Significant progress has been made on the establishment of the new accommodation model.\u00a0 This work has involved working very closely with the Housing Agency in the development of detailed policy advice papers including an acquisition policy, an ownership model and a funding model. Proposals in relation to the ownership model were brought to the Programme Board in November 2021 and approved by myself in January 2022. Work is also ongoing to develop a funding model for Approved Housing Bodies to support them in building a pipeline of Phase Two accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  - The County and City Management Association has developed and approved a Local Authority allocation key. The key allows for a distribution of applicants across the country according to population criteria.\u00a0 DCEDIY and the Housing Agency are using the allocation key to identify suitable properties for purchase for Phase Two accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  - The Housing Agency has proceeded to source a range of properties for Phase Two accommodation and has acquired an initial number to date. Work to source and acquire properties will continue for the remainder of 2022.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Work is also moving ahead on\u00a0developing\u00a0the system of income support that applicants will receive\u00a0when moving into Phase Two accommodation. A policy paper has been developed and work is now proceeding to design the operational structures for the payment.<\/p>  <p>  - The Transition Team is also developing an integration programme to support the principle of &lsquo;integration from day one&rsquo; as set out\u00a0in the White Paper. In collaboration with the Local Authorities there has been a focus on designing the supports that will be required at a local level.<\/p>  <p>  - Work is ongoing to launch an integration fund in the coming months which will fund civil society organisations to support the integration of International Protection applicants;<\/p>  <p>  - Development of a Communication strategy including in February 2022 the launch of a dedicated webpage where all members of the Public can find updates on the progress being made in implementing the White Paper. <\/p>  <p>  As will be appreciated, the war in Ukraine has had an unavoidable impact on timelines for implementation of the White Paper, as staff in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth were temporarily diverted to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s obligations including members of the White Paper Transition Team.

To date, more than 35,000 people have arrived in Ireland and just in excess of 25,000 of those have been referred to this Department seeking accommodation from the State. <\/p>  <p>  Arrivals continue on a daily basis, and the Government remains committed to delivering a humanitarian response to welcome people seeking protection in Ireland as part of the European Union's overall response, and within the framework of the relevant European Directives. <\/p>  <p>  Given the scale of the crisis the State is responding to with the large number of people looking for assistance it is not possible to facilitate requests for accommodation of a certain type or in a particular location except on specific medical or disability grounds. <\/p>  <p>  Refusals of suitable accommodation place significant additional pressures on the system, negatively impacts on the State's ability to provide accommodation for continuing numbers of new arrivals, and leads to inefficiencies managing a limited resource in a time of great emergency. <\/p>  <p>  The Refusals Policy which is now in place seeks both to respect an individual&rsquo;s right to opt out of the State-sponsored scheme and make their own accommodation arrangements, availing of supports provided by other Departments as appropriate, and to ensure equitable treatment of all arrivals to the greatest extent possible. <\/p>  <p>  Where an individual refuses an offer of suitable accommodation, they will be placed at the end of the queue and in due course will be made a second and final offer of accommodation. Where that second offer of suitable accommodation is refused, it will remain available but no further offers of accommodation will be made. It is important to emphasise that no one is left without an offer of accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  This Refusals Policy was developed in consultation with a range of stakeholders, including with the assistance of the Ukrainian Embassy in Dublin, is communicated in English and Ukrainian at various locations, and will be kept under review. Should an individual have queries or questions in relation to the policy, clarifications may be sought on site with officials, or via ukrainetempaccom@equality.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, this Refusals Policy in no way impacts an individual&rsquo;s entitlements to access other supports available to them under the BOTP (Beneficiaries of the Temporary Protection order) scheme e.g. social welfare payments, access to medical care etc.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300085#WRDD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":968,"content":"<p>Question No. 382 answered with Question No. 381.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":970,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300085#WRDD00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research Funding","counter":969,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300085#WRDD00700"},{"type":"question","counter":970,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[33332\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300085#WRDD00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the number of PhD researchers funded by Science Foundation Ireland; the Irish Research Council; the HSE and any other funding body; the number of persons in receipt of stipends directly from higher education institutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":971,"content":"<p>I can only respond to the Deputy&rsquo;s question in terms of the student numbers supported by my Department through Science Foundation Ireland and the Irish Research Council, and on student numbers as reported by the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the latest Higher Education Research and Development Survey (HERD) survey.

Validation is the process whereby hospitals contact patients on waiting lists in writing at pre-planned intervals during the year to ensure that patients are ready, willing, suitable and available to attend for hospital care or wish to be removed from the waiting list. For a number of years validation was conducted at individual hospital level in Ireland but in September 2018 the Minister for Health approved the establishment of the validation function within the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). The establishment of a centralised function has facilitated the introduction of a standardised approach to validation of waiting lists across hospitals and across Inpatient and Day Case (IPDC) and Outpatient (OPD) waiting lists. <\/p>  <p>  The NTPF have advised my Department that the following cohorts of patients are included in the Validation Programme for 2022:<\/p>  <p>  -  Active patients on Inpatient, Daycase (IPDC), GI Scope and Outpatient (OP) waiting lists over 6 months without a TCI or an appointment date.<\/p>  <p>  -  Active patients on Inpatient, Daycase, GI scope and Outpatient waiting lists over 6 months with a TCI or appointment date outside the six week timeframe from the date of the report.<\/p>  <p>  -  Patients who fail to respond to Outpatient Commissioning Offer letters.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the NTPF have advised that updated validation guidance was issued to hospitals to include patients in excess of 3 months in validation programmes where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The process, developed by the NTPF, HSE, and my Department, in consultation with stakeholders and experts, involves patients receiving a letter from their hospital, asking them to return the letter in the freepost envelope supplied or reply online, indicating whether they still require their procedure\/appointment.<\/p>  <p>  Those patients who still require a procedure or appointment will remain on the waiting list. Those who respond that they no longer require the procedure will be removed from the waiting list in accordance with the National Inpatient, Day Case, Planned Procedure (IDPP) Protocol 2017 and the National Outpatient Waiting List Management Protocol 2022. Where no response is received within two weeks, a reminder letter is sent and if there is no response within a further two weeks, the patient and the patient&rsquo;s GP will receive a letter advising that the patient has been removed from the waiting list. If the patient or GP considers the procedure or appointment is still required, the patient will be reinstated, maintaining their original place on the list.<\/p>  <p>  In an effort to improve efficiencies in the national validation process, and provide a convenient, secure response option for patients participating in validation, the NTPF developed and rolled out an additional Patient Online Automated Response option (POLAR). Patients can now go online via POLAR and provide up to date information in relation to their waiting list status; alternatively, they can still use the pre-paid envelope provided<\/p>  <p>  In terms of categorisation used for recording purposes, validation activity and statistics are recorded by the NTPF and shared to my Department as per the cohorts of patients validated, with patients listed based on the type of waiting lists on which they sit (IPDC\/OPD). For the purposes of responding to Parliamentary Question No.1814 of 14 June 2022, the NTPF provided an annual and year-to-date breakdown of validation by hospital and by IPDC\/OPD waiting list. The validation process is carried out through cycles where the NTPF works with individual hospitals, via specified waiting lists, in order to identify appropriate patient cohorts to validate, generate reports, contact patients, allow for response time, response collation, and patient removal. As such a breakdown of validation figures by hospital each month does not reflect the appropriate activity and removal rates of the validation cycle. In addition, to generate such a report would require significant manual intervention as it does not correlate with how the validation process operates in practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300087#WRFF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":1035,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300087#WRFF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1036,"qnumday":405,"qnumall":"[33336\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300087#WRFF01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children with autism and special needs who have been referred to an organisation (details supplied) for an assessment for the years 2021 and to date in 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1037,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[33337\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300087#WRFF01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children with autism and special needs who have been referred to an organisation (details supplied) for an assessment for the years 2021 and to date in 2022; the number of children for whom an assessment has been initiated; the number of children for whom an assessment has been concluded, broken down by CHO and children's disability network team; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1038,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[33338\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300087#WRFF01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total funding provided to an organisation (details supplied) for the carrying out of assessments and for the provision of other services to children with disabilities on children's disability network team waiting lists in each CHO for the years 2021 and to date in 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1039,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 405, 406 and 407 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy's questions relate to service issues, they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300087#WRFF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1040,"content":"<p>Question No. 406 answered with Question No. 405.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1041,"content":"<p>Question No. 407 answered with Question No. 405.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pharmacy Services","counter":1042,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300087#WRFF02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1043,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[33339\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300087#WRFF02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of community pharmacists employed in the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1044,"content":"<p>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland is the statutory regulator of pharmacists and pharmacies in Ireland and maintains Registers in this regard in the interest of delivering on its vision and mandate to assure trust in pharmacy services. <\/p>  <p>  I would not have access to the information relating to the number of community pharmacists employed in the State.

Interest in afforestation\u00a0has been impacted by the complexity of the legal and administrative system, judicial decisions, the efficiency of the forestry licensing system, the appetite among landowners to convert land to afforestation usage and, in some areas, complex societal attitudes and responses to afforestation.\u00a0Both myself and\u00a0Minister Hackett\u00a0are very conscious of the need to increase afforestation rates given the target of 8,000 hectares set out in the Climate Action Plan <\/p><p>We have focussed\u00a0on addressing the licensing issue and \u00a0on looking to the future of trees and forests in Ireland under \u00a0the framework of Project Woodland.<\/p><p>The licensing situation is improving as a result of increased investment in resources and a continual improvement in processes. We issued 4,050 licences in 2021 and intend to increase this to 5,250 in 2022. We aim to more than double the number of afforestation licences to 1,040 by year end. Last year\u00a0502 afforestation licences issued for 4,246 hectares, but\u00a0only 2016 hectares were planted. This low conversion rate is a challenge. There are currently 5,200 ha in the system, which have a valid approval, but have not gone ahead to planting. We have written to 451 applicants with unused licences to remind them that their licence is still valid and to encourage them to consider using them before their approval lapses. Of those, 28 have contacted us to confirm that they have\u00a0 commenced planting or have\u00a0 indicated that they intend to do so this year.\u00a0<\/p><p>Communication and positive messaging about the benefits of afforestation is crucial. On most farms, planting can comfortably co-exist with livestock enterprises and can significantly increase the net income from the holding.

A total fund of &euro;13 million is being made available for this voluntary scheme for pig farmers, to support the viability of this important sector.\u00a0 Details of the scheme, which is open for applications until 11 July, are available on my Department's website: <\/p>  <p> www.gov.ie\/en\/service\/0067f-pig-exceptional-payment-scheme-2\/<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300093#WRMM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":1209,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300093#WRMM00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Schemes","counter":1208,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300093#WRMM00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1209,"qnumday":463,"qnumall":"[33271\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062300093#WRMM00900","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the amount allocated to the town and village renewal scheme since 2016, by year; the amount returned to her Department by local authority; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1497","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1210,"content":"<p>The Town and Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS) is part of a range of measures to support the revitalisation of rural Ireland.
