There is no doubt that online safety has become one of the most significant challenges facing Irish society and, arguably, one of the most significant child protection issues of our time.  We face major challenges.  Many people, particularly parents, are concerned about what is happening in that regard.  It is hard to blame them for that when one reads reports of predatory behaviour, harmful material and online bullying.  This is an issue which legislators cannot ignore and must face up to.  A policy and educational response - along with strong regulation and a statutory office with real powers and teeth - is required.  It is generally accepted in most policy areas that self-regulation is no regulation.  The Internet and online safety are not particularly different in that regard.   Some providers have good regulatory mechanisms but others have none.  Legislation is needed to ensure that all providers step up to the mark and provide appropriate safeguards.  Among the primary proposed functions of the commissioner are to promote digital safety for all and to support and encourage the implementation of measures to improve digital safety, including oversight, regulation and a timely and efficient procedure for the removal of harmful digital communications.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the representatives from the various organisations, the Department and industry.  I note the commentary by organisations and industry on the Bill.  I welcome the fact that, at a previous meeting, Ms Sweeney and her colleague from Facebook, Ms Siobh&aacute;n Cummiskey, stated that they are not opposed to the idea of a digital safety commissioner and that they see great benefit in a single office having the ability to oversee and co-ordinate efforts to promote digital safety.  That view is widely shared, but we need to work collaboratively and constructively on the detail of what is involved.  I approach these engagements with an open mind in the context of amendments.  I am not precious in that regard.  I will work with the committee, departmental officials or representatives of industry or civil society organisations to improve the Bill in any way possible.<\/p> <p>  A key point raised at the committee's most recent meeting - and which may be raised again today - relates to the need for a definition of \"harmful communications\".  It may be appropriate for the definition to be provided by the office of the digital safety commissioner.  It should not be left to providers to define it.  On balance, as there is a legal requirement to be in compliance with sections 4 and 5, it would be appropriate to provide a definition.  I am developing a draft definition, which will be needed.  We should look to the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission which provide a description of a category of existing and proposed offences.  I do not propose to introduce amendments to make such offences criminal offences under the Bill.  However, those are the types of behaviours we must seek to address.<\/p> <p>  I will be making a submission to the committee and the Minister to inform the drafting of the scrutiny report.  I suggest that other interested bodies should also consider doing so in order to allow the committee to evaluate all viewpoints in advance of drafting its report and the Committee Stage debate on the Bill.<\/p><p> The issue of freedom of expression has also been raised.  I acknowledged this in my comments on the previous occasion.  It is correct that we must proceed very carefully.  Freedom of expression is a value we all treasure and is essential to a functioning democracy.  I do not believe, however, that this is a reason to prevent us proceeding.  It is not an absolute right, especially where harmful communications are damaging, hurtful or, in some circumstances, illegal.  There is a consensus.  We cannot simply allow self-regulation to be the only approach.  We need to show vision and be ambitious and imaginative.  In view of the fact that this has been done in other common law jurisdictions, there is no reason for not doing the same here.  We need to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#G00200","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.

As members are aware, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, expressed his preliminary views on the Bill at the committee&rsquo;s meeting on 25 October.  He outlined his view that if the Oireachtas is to pass a law in this area, it must ensure that it is robust, effective, and proportionate and that it properly meets the public policy need to protect children online.  The Minister has asked the Department to consider the Private Members&rsquo; Bill in detail.  He also asked the Attorney General for urgent advice on a range of legal issues which the draft legislation presents.<\/p> <p>   As members are aware, the action plan for online safety, which was published by the Taoiseach on 11 July, contains 25 actions to be implemented or substantially progressed by the six Departments involved by the end of 2019.  Since the publication of the plan, an interdepartmental sponsors&rsquo; group, chaired by the Department of Education and Skills, with membership from the other five Departments, has been established.  That group will report to the relevant Cabinet committee on progress in implementing these commitments.<\/p> <p>  The National Advisory Council for Online Safety has also been established.  Its secretariat is provided by my Department.  The first meeting of the council was held on 4 October and the next meeting will be held in the coming weeks.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, has succeeded the Deputy Kyne, who is now Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, as chairman of the council.  The committee may also be interested to note that the council has established two sub-groups, the first to consider the role of the council in relation to guidance material, and the second to consider the council&rsquo;s role in relation to research.  A wide range of organisations have accepted the Government&rsquo;s invitation to be members of the council, including the four other organisations represented at this meeting, as well as other bodies representing  parents and older people, academic experts, and State bodies including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Data Protection Commission and the Ombudsman for Children.<\/p> <p>  It is envisaged that the council will publish a report on its work to date to coincide with Safer Internet Day in February.  This will, in subsequent years, will become the council's annual report.  The overall focus of the action plan for online safety is to identify and deliver the activities that can be delivered over a period of 12 to 18 months and that will have the greatest impact on online safety for all our citizens, especially children.  Action 18 of the plan commits the Government, and specifically my Department, as well as the Departments of Justice and Equality and Business Enterprise and Innovation, to work with this committee to explore the issues arising in respect of this Private Members&rsquo; Bill.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of issues which the committee may wish to consider in the context of its scrutiny, a number of which were referenced by the Minister on 25 October, some of which I will now outline.  There is an absence of a definition of harmful digital communications.  It will be important to define what illegal offences will come within scope; whether the definition would also include harmful but not illegal communications, and, if so, of what nature.  Another issue is the definition of a digital service undertaking which appears to encompass a very wide range of undertakings, some of which may pose little or no risk in respect of harmful communications.  In the context of illegal content, would the Data Protection Commissioner have the power to seek the take-down of such material without consulting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  In the case of harmful but legal content, are there enforcement issues arising given that under the e-commerce directive 2000, notice and take down requirements relate only to the take-down of illegal content?  Is the enforcement mechanism envisaged for the take-down of harmful content by an undertaking located outside the State appropriate given that the speed of take-down would likely be the key outcome sought in such cases?<\/p> <p>  It may be helpful for the committee to be aware of some additional developments in the regulation of online content at European level.  It is expected that the final text of the revised audiovisual media services directive will be published shortly, with a requirement that it be implemented by member states within 21 months.<\/p><p>The original audiovisual media services directive, which was agreed in 2010, established the framework for regulating traditional television and on-demand services such as RT&Eacute; Player and Netflix.  While there are many aspects of the revision which will be of interest to the committee, of particular relevance to today's discussion are the new provisions that will apply to video-sharing platform services.  Aspects of services such as YouTube are likely to fall within the scope of these provisions.  The revised directive will require member states to introduce, by means of co-regulation, a system to ensure that these services have measures in place in order that minors will be protected from audiovisual content, including advertising, which may impair their physical, mental or moral development and that the general public will be protected from audiovisual content, including advertising, containing incitement to violence or hatred and from such content, including advertising, the dissemination of which is a criminal offence under Union law.  The latter covers terrorism-related offences, child sexual abuse material offences and offences of racism and xenophobia.<\/p><p> Ireland will be required to appoint a national regulatory authority which will monitor and ensure that video-sharing platforms have appropriate measures in place to meet the goals I have outlined.  Among the measures which may be appropriate are age-verification and parental controls.  This presents an alternative approach to the regulation of harmful online content, albeit only for video-sharing platforms.  The Department intends to commence a public consultation on Ireland's approach to the implementation of the revised directive before the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>There are two witnesses from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, Mr. John Church, chief executive officer, CEO, and Ms Fiona Jennings, policy co-ordinator.

We welcome the drafting of legislation to establish an office of digital safety commissioner and look forward to its progress.<\/p> <p>  Online safety is the child protection issue of our day.  I would like to share a typical example of a Childline case with the committee.  A 15 year old female contacted Childline's web chat service.  She stated that she sent nude pictures of herself to her boyfriend and that when they broke up, he sent them to his friends.  Now her friends and people in school are talking about her and calling her vile names.  She feels really embarrassed, stupid and ashamed.  She feels very hurt and betrayed by her ex-boyfriend.  She did not think that he would do such a thing.  She is terrified that her parents will find out and is scared about how they might react, especially her dad because he is so strict.  She is so upset that she wants to kill herself.  This example illustrates the fear and isolation children feel when something they do online goes horribly wrong and they perceive that the situation is out of their control to manage.<\/p> <p>  The ISPCC has been pleased to see the Houses of the Oireachtas take seriously the issue of online safety, with a significant increase in activity in Departments in the past year.  We would like to take this opportunity too, to acknowledge the work of the Office for Internet Safety and Webwise and the work they do with limited resources.  These structures need to be better resourced to make them more effective and for every parent, child and teacher in the country to become aware of them and embrace their resources and expertise.<\/p> <p>  The ISPCC broadly welcomed the publication of the Government's first action plan for online safety last July, particularly its provisions in respect of enhanced education measures and proposed law reform.  However, the ISPCC expressed its disappointment at the time that the action plan fell short of a commitment to statutory regulation.  Not long after the launch of the action plan, and indeed in recent times, the public has been presented with stark examples of self-regulation failing.  It is our experience that these failures can impact negatively on children and that there are positive actions that Ireland can take to better protect children online.  Notwithstanding the commitment to self-regulation in the action plan, and perhaps to reflect the fast-changing nature of this space, we were delighted to hear the comments of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, at the committee's detailed scrutiny stage where he stated it was time to move beyond self-regulation and highlighted the need for a regulatory body in the online space.<\/p> <p>  In 2016, the ISPCC carried out an internal case review of its Childline service and front-line services on the prevalence of online safety issues in our work.  The findings of this review, in conjunction with cases in the external environment, led to online safety being an integral part of our policy work, in turn giving us a clear mandate to advocate for change in this area.  In February 2017, the ISPCC made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs and shared its experiences regarding online safety issues.  These issues included access and exposure to inappropriate content, online grooming and cyberbullying.<\/p><p>Harmful communications among children can be compounded by the fact that they are children and perhaps do not realise the reach their actions can have online.  We are in no doubt that online safety is a major issue for children and young people in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In 2005 we launched the first text-based support service for children in Ireland.  We have seen a shift to our online and text service over the last decade, and we are in the final stages of development of a new online service.  The ISPCC has seen the use of its Childline online services jump from just under 4,000 conversations in 2007 to just under 30,000 conversations in 2017.  We know that children want us to be online, and to be more accessible to them in the spaces they inhabit.  Through listening to and engaging with more than 1,000 children a day on our Childline service we have been able to spot trends over the years and raise these issues in the media and with policy-makers and legislators.  Over the past two decades in particular we have seen how children&rsquo;s technological lives are becoming increasingly embedded in their lives as a whole.  The online-offline distinction for children is an unfamiliar concept.  Utilising technology and being online are no longer an add-on; it is how and where they live their lives. <br\/><br\/>Children make up one third of all Internet users globally.  One in two users in the developed world is a child.  Their participation and protection rights in the digital environment are widely supported across EU laws and policies.  Irish policy sets out ambitions for all Irish citizens to be connected and online.  ICT is broadly available and its use encouraged in many schools.  The Government&rsquo;s action plan for online safety recognises that children&rsquo;s specific vulnerability warrants greater protection.  The Net Children Go Mobile<i><\/i>report of 2015 found that one in five children in Ireland reported being bothered by something they saw on the Internet in the past.  The Internet was not created with children as users in mind, but they use it.  We know this, and we all have a role to play in keeping them safe online.  Therefore, it is imperative we recognise the need for a regulatory body, with a digital safety commissioner or equivalent, to champion children&rsquo;s online safety and seek remedies for them when they are unable to do so themselves. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The issue of defining harmful communications has been raised at the various stages of debate on this Bill thus far.  It is important that a definition is created to reflect the examples of harmful communications referred to in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report and elsewhere, and not be overly broad so as to render the definition unworkable and, in effect, useless.<br\/><br\/>While some of the suggested work of a digital safety commissioner is being carried out across other Departments and structures, we feel there is merit in co-ordinating this work in order to maximise its efforts and impacts for all concerned, under an office of the digital safety commissioner, or equivalent. <br\/><br\/>Children have a right to be protected, and this protection extends to being online.  Being online is the public space where children frequent the most.  They converse with their friends there, keep in touch with family there and shop there.  It is their go-to place for information, and, like any public space, it should afford them similar safety protections. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Church","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>CyberSafeIreland is the children&rsquo;s charity for online safety in Ireland.  We set up in 2015 and since then we have spoken to 14,000 children and to thousands of parents and teachers about staying safe online.  We also gather data on an ongoing basis which enables us to monitor trends and usage and to highlight risks.  We recently launched our annual report and published the data that we had gathered over the last academic year, based on responses from more than 5,000 children aged between eight and 13.  Some 68% of these children owned a smartphone and 70% were signed up to social media and messaging apps, despite age restrictions of at least 13 on all such services.  In short, the use of online services was pervasive among this cohort of children.  Our report further highlighted that many primary school teachers are seeing the consequence of children&rsquo;s online use in the classroom with 62% of teachers having dealt with online safety incidents over the last academic year.  More than a third of teachers had dealt with between two and five incidents last year.  Some of these incidences involved the uploading and sharing of harmful and upsetting material, including intimate images.<\/p> <p>  I am providing this data as a context to our position on the digital safety commissioner.  We believe that a digital safety commissioner will offer a level of co-ordination and oversight that we currently do not have in Ireland.  It will furthermore introduce a level of accountability by helping to ensure that social media companies are timely and responsive in their removal of any harmful material and consistent in their application of safeguards by providing monitoring, oversight and reporting on their performance in this regard.<\/p><p>As a charity that is often approached for help by parents, teachers and those working with vulnerable children, we are more aware than many of the reality of when things go wrong online, when harmful or upsetting content is either not removed or not removed quickly enough.  We also know that self-regulation means that online service providers get to be judge and jury in cases of troublesome and sometimes controversial content.  This is where a digital safety commissioner could play an important role in the review of materials and decision-making in respect of take-down procedures.<\/p><p> The Bill also proposes the introduction of a code of practice, which would mean that there would be greater consistency across platforms.  The office would also have an education and research remit and would offer an important level of co-ordination in these areas.  It is important to recognise that many of the leading social media platforms, including Facebook and Google, have worked consistently to improve safeguards on their platforms and have also provided some useful educational resources.  It is incredibly important that they continue to prioritise safeguarding practice and design into the future.  However, we need to go one step further by ensuring that all platforms are held to the same high standards and that there is a regulatory body that can provide oversight and step into the breach when needed.<\/p><p> In any discussion about a proposed digital safety commissioner, it is helpful to consider the precedents.  The Australian Office of the eSafety Commissioner was set up in 2016 as a result of the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015.  While this office is still new - and it is too early to fully assess its effectiveness - commentators such as Matthew Rimmer, professor of intellectual property and innovation law at Queensland University of Technology, think that it offers value and addresses \"genuine child safety issues in the digital environment which haven&rsquo;t been well dealt with by governments or IT companies or the community\".  The Australian Parliament's legal and constitutional affairs references committee also acknowledged the importance of this office in its review of laws relating to cyberbullying earlier this year.  It urged the Government to ensure that it was given appropriate levels of resources to carry out its mandate effectively.<\/p><p> While the UK does not have the equivalent of a digital safety commissioner, it is in the process of developing a new Internet safety strategy which will be introduced before the end of the year and which outlines some similar plans in terms of regulation.  The UK Government published the results of its public consultation on its Green Paper in May and one of the findings from the consultation was that users, including children, felt powerless to address safety issues online and there was insufficient oversight of technology companies, as well as a lack of transparency on their part.  The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, outlined plans to introduce a social media code of practice and transparency reporting as part of its digital charter and this may well become a legislative requirement in due course.<\/p><p> Given Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union, it is important to consider what is happening at a European level in order to put these proposals into the appropriate context.  In July, the Council of Europe made some recommendations to its member states regarding children&rsquo;s rights in the digital environment.  The recommendations acknowledge the importance of children being able to access the online world and include a wide range of measures and proposals around children&rsquo;s rights but also measures to protect them, including ensuring in-built safety by design, privacy by design and privacy by default as guiding principles for products and services, particularly those used by children.  The recommendations also recognise that children, and those who care for them, need guidance and education.  The document states that digital literacy education should be included in the basic education curriculum from the earliest years, taking into account children&rsquo;s evolving capacities.  While the recommendations are wide-ranging in nature and there is not the space to touch on all points here, I would like to highlight one other piece relating to them, namely, the need to identify and establish competent bodies with the responsibility and authority to implement actions in a timely and efficient manner, and that such bodies should be adequately resourced both in terms of funding and staffing.<\/p><p> The proposal for an office for a digital safety commissioner seems to offer several opportunities to meet the standards set out in the Council of Europe recommendations, although it could go further than the current proposals and include reference to the ethical and safe design of any new apps and games, as recommended by the Council of Europe.  We would also like an explicit reference to the need to embed digital literacy into the curriculum to be reflected in the Bill.  We must equip young people with the skills and know-how to navigate the online world in a safe and responsible manner.  Education is an important part of any prevention strategy and the need for digital literacy to be taught in schools is recognised in both the UK strategy and European Council recommendations.  The Bill includes many significant measures and, with some additions, it could provide a strong basis for our national strategy for dealing with online safety well into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Alex Cooney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Ms Niamh Sweeney is head of public policy at Facebook Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#L00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for asking me to be here today.  I will give a brief overview because I have been before the committee on a few previous occasions when I provided more lengthy explanations of our approach to safety.<\/p><p>Every day, more than 1.4 billion people around the world use Facebook.  They post everything from photos and status updates to live videos in many different languages.  Deciding what stays up and what comes down involves hard judgment calls on complex issues ranging from bullying and hate speech to harassment.  It is why we developed our community standards with input from outside experts, including academics, non-governmental organisations, NGOs and governments around the world.  Our community standards have been publicly available for many years and in April of this year, we published the more detailed internal guidelines used by our review teams to enforce them for the first time.  We decided to publish these internal guidelines for two reasons.  First, the guidelines aim to help people understand where we draw the line on nuanced issues.  Second, providing this detail makes it easier for everyone, including experts in different fields, to give us feedback in order that we can improve the guidelines, and the decisions we make, over time.<br\/><br\/>We also have a safety advisory board, which comprises leading Internet safety organisations on child abuse, domestic violence and Internet safety for children and women.  Facebook consults these organisations on issues related to online safety and keeping our community safe.<br\/><br\/>For the content review process, we use a combination of artificial intelligence and reports from people to identify posts, pictures or other content that may violate our community standards.  These reports are reviewed by our community operations team, who work 24\/7 in over 50 languages all around the world.<br\/><br\/>This year, we have doubled the number of people working on our safety and security teams to 20,000.  This includes more than 7,500 content reviewers specifically.  We are also investing heavily in new technologyto help deal with problematic content on Facebook more effectively.  For example, we use technology to assist in sending reports to reviewers with the right expertise to cut out duplicate reports and to help detect and remove known terrorist propaganda and child sexual abuse images before they have been reported.  Last month, we also announced thatwe have been increasingly using artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect child nudity and previously unknown examples of child sexual exploitation imagery.  Content review on this scale has never been done, as there has never been a platform where so many people communicate in so many languages across so many countries and cultures, but we very much recognise the responsibility we have to get this right.<br\/><br\/>I am here today in the context of the committee&rsquo;s detailed scrutiny of the Bill.  Members will recall that I gave an outline of our thoughts on this topic at the 1 August hearing I attended but I am happy to be here again today as the committee considers the Bill in detail.  We understand the motivation behind the establishment of a digital safety commissioner, particularly the appeal of having an independent, statutory body that is authorised to adjudicate in cases where there is disagreement between a platform and an affected user about what constitutes a harmful communication, or to provide a path to appeal for an affected user where we have, in error, failed to uphold our own policies.  We also acknowledge the Bill's efforts to ensure its scope is not overly broad, in that an appeal to the digital safety commissioner can only be made by individuals where the specified communication concerns him or her. <br\/><br\/>We very much see the benefit in having a single office with the ability to oversee and co-ordinate efforts on the promotion of digital safety throughout communities, much of which has been captured in the Government's Action Plan for Online Safety.  It is only through this multi-pronged approach, of which education is critical, that we can begin to see positive changes in how people engage and protect themselves online. <br\/><br\/>In its 2016 report the Law Reform Commission, LRC, in addressing the nature of harmful communications, stated the following:<\/p><blockquote>While there is no single agreed definition of bullying or of cyberbullying, the well-accepted definitions include the most serious form of harmful communications, such as ... so-called &ldquo;revenge porn&rdquo;; intimidating and threatening messages, whether directed at private persons or public figures; harassment; stalking; and non-consensual taking and communication of intimate images ...<\/blockquote><p>We agree with the LRC with respect to all of these types of communication, a very stark example of which was given by Mr. John Church in his opening statement.  The sharing of non-consensual intimate images, harassment, stalking and threatening messages are all egregious forms of harmful communication and are banned both by our community standards and, in some cases, the law.  We fully support the commission's proposals to create new criminal offences to tackle non-consensual sharing of intimate images and online harassment where those offences are clearly defined and practicable for a digital environment.  We have also taken steps to step up how we tackle non-consensual sharing of intimate images that are shared on our own platform, more information on which can be found online and with respect to which I have shared the link with the committee in our opening statement.  <br\/><br\/>However, as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire outlined in his remarks today and previously, the proposed Bill is currently unclear as to what precisely constitutes a harmful communication.<\/p><p>There is no definition included in the draft Bill but it does appear from the draft that this concept is intended to be broader than content that is clearly criminal in nature, much of which has been touched on.  The exact parameters are left undefined, which could lead to uncertainty and unpredictability.  I acknowledge Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's remarks about the need to include a definition.  We welcome the opportunity to work with him on that if that is possible.  Previously, on 25 October, he mentioned that he felt that there was a need for legal certainty and we very much welcome that.<br\/><br\/>As the LTC stated in 2016, the Internet:<\/p><blockquote>enables individuals to contribute to, and shape debates on important political and social issues and within states with a repressive regime the Internet can be a particularly valuable means of allowing people to have their voices heard.  Freedom of expression is therefore the lifeblood of the Internet and needs to be protected.  <\/blockquote><p>The report continues:<\/p><blockquote>...balancing the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy is a challenging task, particularly in the digital and online context.  Proposing heavy-handed law-based measures intended to provide a remedy for victims of harmful digital communications has the potential to interfere with freedom of expression unjustifiably, and impact on the open and democratic nature of information sharing online which is the internet&rsquo;s greatest strength.<\/blockquote><p>I am aware that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is alive to these issues and has referenced these in his earlier contribution.<br\/><br\/>I will shorten my contribution because the committee is under pressure and I will finish by pointing out that Facebook has put community standards in place for the reason that we want our community to feel safe and secure when they use our platform.  We are committed to the removal of content that breaches those standards, and we are keen to continue to engage with this committee and others as the Bill moves into the next phase in the legislative process.  <br\/><br\/>I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Sweeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I call our final witnesses now: Mr. Ryan Meade, public policy and government relations manager at Google Ireland and Ms Rachel Madden, public policy analyst with Google based in San Francisco.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#N00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to participate in this session. I work with Google in Ireland as public policy and government relations manager, based in our Europe, Middle East and Africa headquarters in Dublin. I am joined by my colleague, Ms Rachel Madden, who works as a senior public policy analyst, focusing on online safety and based in our San Francisco office but hailing from Dublin.  Ms Madden's remit is global and she works closely with our product team and I am delighted she is able to join us.<\/p> <p>  Google welcomes the committee&rsquo;s efforts to engage with stakeholders in its consideration of the Bill.  We appreciate this opportunity to outline our views on a number of the issues raised in the Bill which we feel merit deeper consideration by the committee.<\/p> <p>  Before I address these issues specifically, it might be helpful to outline Google&rsquo;s actions and approach to safety online.  Google believes deeply in technology&rsquo;s ability to unlock creativity and engagement.  We also believe that technology companies have a responsibility to their users; that what is unacceptable offline should be unacceptable online; and that all users should be empowered to manage online risks and make safe choices.  We work hard behind the scenes to ensure that our users have as positive as possible an online experience as possible.  Our approach to online safety and well-being falls into three main themes: strong community guidelines; technological innovation; and working in partnership. <\/p> <p>  We are a company fundamentally committed to access to information, yet our community guidelines and content policies offer clear rules on what we do not allow on our platforms.  These often go above and beyond what is in the law and we employ thousands of staff around the world who work 24 hours a day to ensure violations of our guidelines are acted upon.<\/p> <p>  On technological innovation, Google has aimed to be the industry leader in creating and developing products and tools which help protect and empower our users, and we will continue to invest the resources necessary to ensure families can make safety choices that are right for them.<\/p> <p>  We developed YouTube Kids to offer an alternative YouTube specifically designed for young children.  It provides a restricted version of YouTube for families with built in timers, no public comments, no option to upload content and the ability for parents to block or allow access to specific channels or videos.  Last year, we launched Family Link, which enables parents to create a Google account for their child and then helps them set and tailor the digital ground rules that work for their children including on-screen time, device bedtimes and approving or blocking specific apps or functions like the camera.  Ireland was the first country outside of the US in which we launched Family Link and it has since been rolled out in 170 countries.  <\/p> <p>  My colleague, Ms Madden, will be happy to speak more about these online safety products we have developed.  At Google, collaboration has been key to ensuring our products and services offer families a positive and secure experience online.<\/p><p>That is why we work regularly with NGOs, Government and industry partners to empower parents and children with the tools and skills they need to make the most of the Internet.  Companies like Google have a responsibility to ensure not only that products and services offer a great user experience but that we work with a wide range of stakeholders and industry partners to creatively and effectively raise awareness, offer support on how to navigate technology responsibility and share technological solutions to tackle some of the toughest problems we face.  Google has invested considerable resources in these efforts and has thousands of employees across the companies working in this regard.  More detail on each of these teams is included in the written submission to the committee which has been circulated.  The submission also includes views and suggestions on the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill which are drawn from this overall approach as well as from our knowledge and experience of the practical implications associated with these issues.  We are also happy to provide a more detailed written submission if that is considered appropriate.<\/p><p> In the time available, however, I can set out briefly some of the points we believe the committee should take into consideration.  In doing so, I echo some of the things other witnesses have mentioned already.  Google welcomes the recognition of the need for ongoing awareness and education on harmful digital content.  We support an approach which includes national initiatives to educate Internet users on what it means to be a responsible online citizen, the resources and tools available to protect their privacy online and how to deal with and report cyberbullying, inappropriate content and online abuse.  Google also welcomes the consideration of additional measures by Government to address the posting online of videos or images with embarrassing and intimate content, often referred to as \"revenge porn\".  This amounts to an egregious invasion of an individual's privacy as other witnesses have already said.  It is essential that any new legal framework in Ireland reflects and is consistent with the laws governing online services in the EU, in particular the e-commerce directive.  In particular, we highlight the need for national legislation to reflect the notice and take-down procedure specifically envisaged in the e-commerce directive at articles 12 to 14 together with the prohibition on imposing general monitoring obligations contained in article 15.<\/p><p> I will not repeat the point on the need for a definition of \"harmful communication\" which was made by every other witness except to say that we agree that a clear definition would provide legal clarity for all parties.  We welcome Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's comments in that regard.  The delineation of responsibility between the digital safety commissioner and the Data Protection Commissioner merits deeper consideration as the Bill progresses, in particular in light of the Data Protection Commissioner's responsibility for dealing with complaints by individuals related to their data protection and privacy rights under the GDPR.  As a general point, we ask the committee to ensure that any legislation is future-proofed by making it as technology and platform neutral as possible.  I will finish there except to ask the committee to take those points on board as it continues its deliberations on the Bill.  The suggested changes would make the legislation more effective and increase clarity in its application.  I thank the committee for its time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Meade","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>The committee would welcome any further written submissions and detail.  That goes for all witnesses as we progress through our discussions on the Bill.  Any input in writing would be very welcome.  I will start by asking a number of questions and then open questioning to members of the committee.  Witnesses might want to note the questions.<\/p> <p>  I note to the departmental witnesses that one of the issues raised last week by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, was the need to be conscious of the nexus between the ministerial responsibility and the role of the digital safety commissioner.  Are the witnesses in a position to elaborate on that?  My understanding of what the Minister said was that he is there to put forward policy and to ensure it is delivered which would not be the role of a statutory body.  I might be mistaken but perhaps the witnesses could elaborate on it.  Has the Department had an opportunity to review Australia's Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015?  Has there been any engagement with the Department's Australian counterpart as I understand the legislation there is working well?  Common law issues arise in that jurisdiction which may be similar to issues arising here.  Will the Attorney General's evidence be made available to the committee in respect of its work on this legislation?<\/p> <p>  I turn to the witnesses from Facebook.  Facebook has said previously that it is broadly supportive in principle of the creation of a digital safety commissioner role and we welcome that.  There are some issues around the definition of \"extraterritorial\" and the effect of that on the legislation.  What has Facebook's engagement with Australia's eSafety Commissioner been or are the witnesses in a position to expand on that today?  How is the process working?<\/p><p>It seems to be working very well.  There is very little conflict.  I heard an interview with the Australian digital safety commissioner in which she said that her engagement with social media platforms has been very good and quite effective, to the point that fines are not always needed.  I do not think she has ever used fines.  Her engagement with social media platforms has been very positive.  I would welcome the views of the representatives of Facebook on the company's interaction with the Australian setup.<\/p><p> I thank Mr. Meade of Google for his comments.  I ask him to expand on his request for the Bill to be as platform-neutral and technology-neutral as possible.<\/p><p> Do the witnesses from the ISPCC have a breakdown of the most common complaints?  Can they provide any figures for the complaints which are coming before them?  Do the complaints relate to cyberbullying?  It would be useful for the committee to get a breakdown.<\/p><p> The need to define what constitutes \"harmful communication\" has been a common thread throughout this discussion.  I appreciate that it would be difficult for the witnesses to formulate a definition here.  The committee would welcome any assistance that the witnesses who are in attendance today could provide with regard to the definition as we move forward with this legislation.<\/p><p> When Ms Cooney spoke on behalf of CyberSafeIreland, she referred to \"the ethical and safe design of any new apps\" and to \"digital literacy\".  I would be concerned that if this legislation is too broad - if the digital safety commissioner has too broad a role and too wide a remit - it may be less effective.  It might be preferable to limit our endeavours in this regard to the areas of online content focused on in this legislation.  A narrow focus is needed, certainly initially.  If we need to build on that remit in future years, that could be done.  I would be cautious about extending the remit in case it becomes too wide because it would not be effective in such circumstances.<\/p><p> I would like to get the witnesses' views on that.  I have also asked for their views on what constitutes \"harmful communication\" and for any data or information that might be available to them in this regard and could be provided to the committee.  After they have responded to my questions, I will bring in Deputies Stanley and Lawless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#O00200","speaker":"1315","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I will respond to the Chairman's questions about the policy area and the Office of the Attorney General.  My colleague, Ms Quill, will answer the Chairman's questions about engagement and cover off the Australian e-commissioner angle.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman has rightly said, the role of the Minister and the Department is to look at the policy context at national and European levels.  Our job is to set legislation in a broad policy context.  There are many examples of areas in which external implementation bodies have been established.  There is a great deal of European legislation.  Reference has been made to the audiovisual media services directive, which is coming down the tracks for us.  When that is finalised at the end of this month, our job will be to consult on the online safety aspects of the directive and on the co-regulation of video-sharing platforms.  We will look at what the Commission has set out and we will work with the Minister to figure how that will be transposed.<\/p> <p>  I will set out the choices here.  We must choose to have either secondary or primary legislation.  We have to decide what the national regulatory authority will be.  We have not made up our minds on that.  We will have to speak to the Minister.  He will make that decision.  That will be an important component of this process.  We will also have to decide how we will transpose the requirements of the regulation.  That is broadly how we will do things in this area.<\/p> <p>  Many speakers have alluded to the fact that there are many players in the area of online safety.  The Department of Justice and Equality has a role in respect of any content that relates to terrorism.  It manages the transpositions in that area.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has a role in respect of e-commerce.  The online world is fairly complicated.  The broad policy context is certainly put in place by Government Departments.<\/p> <p>  I can tell the Chairman in response to her second question that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, who is still relatively new in the job, asked us to write to the Office of the Attorney General to get its advice on certain aspects of the Bill.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has recognised, some of it is quite complicated.  We have sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General on aspects of the Bill that have been mentioned, including the definition of a \"digital service undertaking\".<\/p><p>We have considered how it interacts with the e-commerce directive and how matters involving entities outside the State would be enforced.  We have sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General in that regard but will have to ask it whether such advice could be shared as matters such as legal privilege must be considered.  We are happy to ascertain whether the advice may be shared and will revert to the committee in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>On the Australian office for digital safety, a key aspect worth bearing in mind is the different legal frameworks within which we operate, particularly in the context of our membership of the European Union.  The e-commerce directive 2000 sets out the limitations on legal liability that apply to digital service undertakings.  As Ms Cronin pointed out, that is an issue on which we have sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  It must be recognised that there are differences in the legal framework which may impact on the capacity of an office in this jurisdiction to operate in the same way as a similar office in Australia.  That is probably the key element to bear in mind when considering the system in operation there.  In addition, aspects of the Australian office for digital safety focus solely on children rather than the broader focus on all citizens - while recognising the particular vulnerability of children - as proposed in the Bill.

Ms Quill is correct insofar as the last update I received stated that the commissioner there has never used her official powers, although there is much consultation and ongoing work with the platforms.  When I last spoke to my colleague on this issue, I knew of early anecdotal evidence to suggest that the office was not necessarily operating in the way one might have anticipated.  For example, some reports regarded hacked accounts rather than specific instances of harmful communication.  In other instances, complaints were not first reported to the platforms, such as Instagram and Facebook in our case.  Rather, the affected user went directly to the commissioner.  Obviously, we would still work with the office on such complaints but the system there was not necessarily working as envisaged.  The numbers there were quite low in its first year.  I do not know the numbers for 2017, but they probably reflect how it played out in 2016.

I do not suggest that the Bill is running the risk of being too technology-specific.  It is important to bear in mind that when framing regulation one looks at existing practices and industry players and how technology is used.  However, by its nature, technology changes.  If we were discussing legislation such as this three or four years ago, issues such as the use of ephemeral content available through Snapchat and other apps which involves content that disappears after a time might not have been considered.  That is very much a general point.  I am not suggesting that any specific provision of the Bill will limit its usefulness in the future.  However, when considering regulation in this area, ideally one would have a framework that will stand the test of time.  I ask the committee to bear that in mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Meade"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked about numbers and trends.  The ISPCC has identified some trends in this area.  We run Childline, a confidential listening service, which will probably answer approximately 1,200 calls today from children under the age of 18.  Approximately 6,000 of the 350,000 calls received by Childline last year related to online bullying.  We very often deal with the issues caused by bullying in general and our categorisation deals with behavioural issues as well as issues such as domestic abuse, sexual abuse, body image, online abuse and other bullying.<\/p><p>It causes us to look at our statistics and how we categorise it.  If one considers the use of our online platform, last year we had just less than 30,000 conversations compared to just under 4,000 ten years ago.  This is going to become an issue and I believe we will have to look at how we categorise conversations.  When one looks at trends, we often use Childline figures but we also consult our child support workers in the community who do one-to-one counselling therapeutic interventions.  We also have voluntary children's advisory committees set up.

As Mr. Church said earlier, we would encourage the committee to create a definition that is not overly broad and which is workable.  In Australia, the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015 pertains to cyberbullying but it also has quite a niche definition that covers material that is seriously threatening, seriously intimidating, seriously harassing or seriously humiliating.  New Zealand has a Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015.  New Zealand does not have an entity such as our Digital Protection Commissioner.  It has an approved agency called Netsafe.  The New Zealand legislation looks communications principles, including where a digital communication should not be threatening, intimidating or menacing, and should not be used to harass an individual.  There are several other principles also and I believe they would be a good starting point when looking to create a definition of harmful communications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Jennings"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Would Ms Cooney like to respond to that same question on harmful communications?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#R00300","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I agree with my colleague that we should look at the existing definitions in the Australian and New Zealand context that have been approved and are working in practise, and that we should look to have something similar here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Alex Cooney"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Did Ms Cooney want to come in on something else?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#R00500","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Reference was made to digital education and safety design.

There is a feeling and a view being propagated out there that the Internet has empowered everybody now that we can connect with people all over the world.  According to Facebook there are 1.4 billion users on Facebook daily.  I believe the Internet has had a hugely disempowering effect in some ways.  CyberSafeIreland highlighted the UK survey where adults and children felt powerless to address online safety issues.<\/p><p>If they are powerless to address their own safety they are seriously disempowered.  It is useful that Ms Cooney highlighted that and the insufficient oversight today.  The example given by the ISPCC of the 15 year old girl is shocking.  That is a life and death issue because she feels she wants to kill herself.  Facebook and Google talk about their online communities.  There are no communities of 1.4 billion people.  Communities are a different entity and it is a misuse of the word by Facebook and Google.  In real communities we know, unfortunately, of cases like this where lives have been taken over issues such as revenge pornography and bullying of young people online.  That is the context for the important Bill that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has brought forward.  <\/p><p> Google highlighted the importance of education and said that it alone could solve the problem of online bullying.  That is what it seems to indicate in its presentation.  Education of itself will not stop somebody who wants to misuse the Internet.  That is a huge challenge for Google and Facebook and for us as legislators to deal with.  Will the witnesses from Google address that issue in more depth because stating that education alone could deal with this does not do justice to or deal properly with this?  We will need strict criteria and legislation and means of enforcing that.  <\/p><p> Facebook says it has 1.4 billion users every day.  On the last occasion it was here, in August if I remember correctly, it stated that it has 20,000 people moderating what is online.  I was surprised by that number but it shows the extent of the problem, the challenge and difficulty of trying to moderate what appears on the platform.  Does this show the witnesses that this problem is nearly impossible to deal with?  That is probably one of the biggest challenges facing the company, us as legislators and governments around the world.  Does that highlight the need for direct State intervention?<\/p><p> In its presentation Facebook highlighted the need for freedom of expression.  As somebody who campaigned against section 31 of the Broadcasting Act 1960 throughout the 1980s and 1990s which was repealed by Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, Michael D. Higgins, one of the best things he ever did, I do not think we want to limit freedom of expression too much.  A line, however, has to be drawn around safety and what should be allowed.  Do the witnesses from Facebook and Google believe that it should be left to private companies and corporate entities to define what should be tolerated in terms of freedom of expression or is it for government bodies to do that? <\/p><p> The Law Reform Commission's definition of offences refers to pornography, intimidating and threatening messages whether directed at public figures or private individuals, harassment, stalking or non-consensual taking and communication of intimate images.<\/p><p>What role should Facebook and Google have in addressing the issue of fake news and the spread of misinformation about individuals?  Politicians have been targeted with this type of misinformation in the past, and, in some cases, it has had detrimental effects.  Such misinformation included false accusations against public figures.  Should that be included in the definition of \"harmful material\"?  <\/p><p> The Department mentioned that certain minimum standards would be set.  As a member state of the European Union should we be entitled to add to that and threaten more stringent regulations?  Does the Department feel that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's Bill is in any way counter to EU law, and if so in what way?  <\/p><p> My final question is for Facebook or the Department.  Who should fund the office of the digital safety commissioner?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#R00800","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I hope I did not give the impression that we believe that education alone is a silver bullet in this case; I apologise if that impression came through in any of the presentations.

We do not allow abusive videos or comments on our platform.  Beneath every video and beside every comment on YouTube there is a \"flagging\" option which allows anyone to report content for review.

The Deputy is right that it is a big challenge because content review has never been done on this scale.  On the need for direct State intervention, we receive millions of reports every week and if the State were asked to step in and do what we, Google and others do, it would be challenging to say the least.<\/p><p> There was a question on freedom of expression and whether it should be for Facebook to determine what should be left up and what should be taken down.  That is an important part of the conversation.  As Ms Quill said, we operate within the e-commerce directive in the area of illegal content and if we are made aware of illegal content on our platform, we have to act expeditiously to remove it.  In other jurisdictions it is different, such as in Germany where the NetzDG Act covers illegal hate speech.  In Ireland, it is left to us to discover what is illegal and many people have an issue with being left in a quasi-judicial position in this respect.  We have a short period to determine what is illegal and there is a tendency to err on the side of caution, given the exposure companies have if they do not remove the content over time.  If there is legal exposure for companies for pushing the boundaries on what constitutes freedom of expression, we could end up with the mass removal of perfectly legal content which may offend, shock or disturb but is not necessarily illegal.<\/p><p> On false accusations against public figures, we were part of the high-level working group on false news convened by the European Commission over the summer.  This issue has travelled some distance since then and the focus now is more on electoral integrity.  We have made a number of commitments as part of that and the Commissioner, Vra Jourov&aacute; announced the agreed outputs in mid-October.  We have undertaken to introduce additional tools with respect to electoral integrity this side of the European elections and we are working hard on this, which is in addition to the tool for viewing ads which we rolled out in April.  This allows one to see any advertisement which an advertiser is running at the same time and addresses the idea of dark-outs.<\/p><p> If false accusations against public figures ever drift into defamatory territory, a clear process is in place.

There would not be anything preventing national law in this area but it would have to respect the European framework and the Irish legal framework.  One of the issues on which we have sought clarity from the Attorney General's office is in respect of the Irish legal framework with respect, for example, to whether a body such as the proposed office of the digital safety commissioner could exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction as a matter of general principle where there is not a universally accepted principle of international law.  In other words, in the case of something in respect of which there is not an international or a European norm, can the State reasonably impose its jurisdiction on a body that is established outside the State?  That would be one aspect to bear in mind in this regard.<\/p> <p>  In terms of adding extra national measures, we can do that but they would have to abide, as Ms Sweeney and others mentioned, by the European framework relating to the e-commerce directive.  If content is illegal, it is provided for under that mechanism.  If somebody brings to the attention of a platform a matter relating to illegal content, that platform has an obligation to take down the content.  If a matter is not illegal but might be considered to be harmful in some way - issues relating to cyberbullying might fall into that category in some instances whereby, for example, children are bullying each other online but that may be extremely harmful content, for example, revenge porn or whatever, that might be categorised as criminal in nature - it is tricker to deal with precisely because it is not a criminal matter.  It may be harmful but it is trickier to deal with because there is not a universally accepted definition and it is not provided for under the e-commerce legislation.<\/p><p>If the definition as set out in this Bill sticks to criminal acts that are provided for, or are going to be provided for, it is probably on clearer legal ground than if it is going into less clear territory.

This is one of three pieces of legislation to be dealt with in this Oireachtas term.  I congratulate Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on proposing, drafting and bringing it forward.  Deputy Howlin has a Bill on harmful offences and I have my Bill on social media regulation, on which some of the witnesses have been in attendance already and some are due to come before us in the near future.  There has been a focus on the online space in this Oireachtas which is welcome.  It is fast-moving and has been said already, some of the hearings that we had during the summer are almost obsolete now because of the events that have happened and moved on so quickly where steps have been taken both voluntarily and otherwise by the main stakeholders which is good to see.<\/p> <p>  It is a fast-moving space and one feature that those three pieces of legislation have in common is that they all relate to attempts at regulation.  We probably all agree - although the witnesses may not - that self-regulation is not desirable or ideal.  While it is welcome that attempts have been made at different times, it is always stronger if an independent third party body can try to impose that regulation.<\/p> <p>  On the specifics of the Bill, it looks  good, where I have read through it a number of times, as well as having followed the Second Stage debate.  Some of the feedback from today and previously goes to the heart of definitions and the devil is in the detail.  The trick with drafting is always to get it precise enough that it can be enforced but broad enough, as Mr. Meade has said, to be technology-agnostic or platform-agnostic, in order that it can be long-lived and robust enough that, in five or ten years time, it can still be applicable.  <\/p> <p>  There has been a lot of talk about the definition of harmful communications.  It is probably one of the main definitions that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has indicated he may want to draft or fine tune as we move towards the next Stages.<\/p> <p>  One interesting matter that also got a mention in the submissions to the Law Reform Commission's reports and in previous studies in this area - the commission's principal report on this issue was in early 2016, I believe, to which I made a submission - was section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  This is what we call the classic harassment, which is what we might call the pre-Internet harassment.  This would be the old stalking offence of knocking on someone's door or sending them postcards or harassing in more traditional ways.<\/p> <p>  There is a school of thought legally that section 10 could apply to the Internet as well.  The stumbling block to date has been that the offence or activity must be repeated to bring it under the definition of section 10.  Making a phone call or knocking on somebody's front door in a one-off action may not qualify in the traditional world.  Doing it ten times or 100 times would qualify.  There is a school of thought that says the nature of the Internet is something that is shared, so anything could be posted once, but it could be shared 100 if not 1,000 or 100,000 times.  That might bring it under the definition of section 10, which would mean the action was repeated which might be sufficient to bring a prosecution as it stands.<\/p> <p>  My first question is whether any of the witnesses has a view of this as to the existing legislation like section 10 of Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act or other legislation that may be out there, and are these sufficient or adequate?  Has the DPP or any other agency brought charges of this nature to date?  Have these types of issues come before the courts or received a sanction and, if so, under what legislation?  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' expertise.  If these issues have not arisen then what governance is in place?  Is it the case that there is a vacuum of governance?  If the existing legislation does not apply or has not led to any charges, what exactly is controlling the Internet space at the moment?  If the answer is nothing then that is very worrying but is all the more reason we need to accelerate this Bill and others like it.<\/p> <p>  Moving on and staying with the Bill, it is very positive, strong and a very good idea.  One thing that it does not appear to do is to create new offences.  This may be deliberate.<\/p><p>Deputy Howlin's Bill creates some offences.  Perhaps the legislation can be dovetailed so that the offences in other legislation would come under it.  In terms of sanctions, there has to be a carrot and a stick.  While there is provision in the Bill to seek an injunction in the Circuit Court, which is useful, the Data Protection Commissioner has powers to bring prosecutions in court as does the Companies Registration Office.  Perhaps that is something to be considered in Committee Stage amendments, if we get to that point.  There are many examples of statutory agencies which can bring a non-Garda prosecution.  Different Departments have similar powers.  I might come up with some amendments in that regard myself, but I could also work with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  It might be worth adding to it.  On the carrot and stick approach, the concept is that the digital safety commissioner role would not only involve enforcement but would also provide an independent and objective agency in debates like the one on the digital age of consent which raged a couple of months ago and which I do propose to reopen today.  It got quite controversial at times.  An external agency unconnected to any of the platforms or to any political party would have the status to make recommendations on issues like that.  It would receive a good hearing and get good traction across the board.  There is a great opportunity, as envisaged in the Bill, for the commissioner to perform that advocacy and expert role, which would be useful.<\/p><p> To recap, I ask about legislation.  There is a question mark over section 10 and whether it could be applied at the moment.  Are there existing legislative provisions which apply?  If not, are we in a total vacuum?  What is the current legislative framework around these kinds of offences, if they even exist at the moment, and whether they can be prosecuted?  What has been the experience to date?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#W00200","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Those questions are mainly for the Department.

We supported that Bill.  Section 10 is out of date and needs to be updated because it does not take account of the very significant changes which have happened.  In relation to offences, Deputy Howlin's Bill and mine had their origins in the LRC paper published in early 2016.  In drafting the legislation on foot of the proposals of the commission, I was conscious of the fact that this is a specific proposal to establish an office and provide it with a remit.  While I am open-minded about it, I am not sure this Bill is a suitable place to update section 10, notwithstanding my support for the principle of updating the law on criminal offences and on creating new offences.  However, doing so in this Bill might complicate the work of establishing an office, providing it with a remit, and creating codes of practice and national minimum digital safety standards.  While I am open-minded, my initial view is that introducing criminal offences in the Bill would enter into the area of creating criminal justice legislation.  As such, our work could become complicated.<\/p> <p>  The argument is also relevant to the view I take on the definition of \"harmful communication\".  I spoke on last occasion we met about what that might involve.  I outlined that in general it would include distribution or publication of an intimate image of another person taken without consent, or threatening to do so; taking or distribution or publication of an intimate image of another without consent; distribution or publication of intimate material where it seriously interferes with privacy or causes alarm, distress or harm to the other person; the distribution or publication of a threatening, false, indecent or obscene message to or about another person for the purpose of causing alarm, distress or harm to the other person, or where it is done persistently; and persistently communicating with a person in circumstances in which it seriously interferes with the other person's privacy or which cause alarm, distress or harm and any other inchoate behaviours related to the same.<\/p><p>I am working on the drafting with regard to how it would be structured.  We should be looking at behaviours.  I take on board the point made about consistency with the e-commerce directive.  When we ask the commissioner to take down material, we should outline to him or her, and the providers, the behaviours.  We should not ask them to adjudicate at the point of takedown on whether something is illegal because there are behaviours that are close to the line.  They might have to be removed quickly and for the person involved to get redress.  We should look at behaviours rather than seek to state that certain matters are illegal and that the illegal content should be removed.  They are required to do that anyway under the e-commerce directive.  We should target behaviours.  I agree with the point made about an independent external agency.  It is important and it is the principle on which we are all largely agreed.  I made the point at the previous committee meeting that the organisation is constantly in communication with the providers and platforms but it also receives complaints when they are unhappy with how the providers and platforms are addressing matters.  They will be the first to know of the changes in abuse and harassment and all these harmful communications.  They will be in a strong position to advise Government on any future criminal justice or policy approaches for example in the Department of Education and Skills.  All of that kind of stuff changes.  The curriculum might change with the NCCA.  It would be in a strong position to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#X00500","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Does anyone else want to comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#Y00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Before we move on, the representatives of the platforms would know if they have been before the courts.

As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, I think it was the ambition of the LRC, with its draft Bill which Deputy Howlin has moved forward, to make it more explicit.  As I said earlier, we would be supportive of it where it is clearly defined and practical for the digital environment.

Mr. Church gave the horrific example of the young girl whose images were shared by a former boyfriend.  It is shocking.<\/p><p>There is wider concern that during this ten-year increase in the demand for online services, there has also been a significant increase in the incidence of depression and other psychological problems among our young people.  A lot of reports I read, and I must admit I have spent the past hour frantically reading as much as I could on the Internet via my own device, show a correlation between the increasing levels of depression, anxiety and other mental health difficulties among young people and the increase in the time young people are online.  The harm might not come just from the obvious graphic terrible example but in all sorts of subtle ways, such as exclusion or other mechanisms that affect mental health.  Do the witnesses make this direct connection?  Everything I have read from the various psychology sources shows an increasing level of depression, anxiety and mental health problems, particularly among young girls it would seem, so that we can make the correlation with the increased use of online services particularly on mobile phones.<\/p><p> Things have developed a lot recently with the passing last month by the European Parliament of the revision of the audiovisual media services directive.  I presume it is a foregone conclusion and that the Council will approve it before Christmas.  I understand that approximately 80% of all online content is video.  Did Ms Cronin state in her contribution that we are looking for regulatory bodies to manage some of this?  Given that the BAI is involved in the audiovisual media regulatory environment, and given that the report from the European Parliament had similar issues of concern to what we have here and it very strongly focused on the effect of online media services on young children, if we are looking for an institutional body to house regulation, the BAI might be suitable.  We could look at the Data Protection Commissioner or creating an new agency but the BAI might be best placed, given that it is so versed in audiovisual media.  What is the difference between online media and broadcast media?  For young people the vast majority is online.  I am interested to hear the views of the witnesses on this.<\/p><p> I am keen to hear from the companies on last month's report of the European Parliament.  Paragraphs 20 and 21 of the report call for the use of encryption and much greater parental control mechanisms to protect young children.  Paragraph 21 states personal data of minors processed in the framework of technical child protection measures should not be used for commercial purposes.  Does this not call into question the companies' entire commercial approach in the processing of minor's data in particular?  It must change.  As Tim Berners-Lee said yesterday, the companies are damaging the Internet and causing a threat to it and all the immense benefits it brings, and their commercial model must change.  How can the companies live up to the direction from the European Parliament in the new audiovisual media services directive if they do not know with absolute certainty the age of the child being dealt with?  We have heard in previous evidence that the current mechanisms they have in place clearly do not do this and the companies cannot tell if a child is 13, 15, 16 or eight.  They can say they do but they do not have effective commercial mechanisms to do it.  Does the new directive mean they must set in place new mechanisms to guarantee knowing the age of the minors who are on their networks so they can live by the commitment not to use the data for commercial purposes?  How can they do this if they do not know whether the person is a minor?  In this regard, Ms Cronin said age verification looks like one of the key new regulatory requirements we will see.<\/p><p>I do not have the exact wording but if I read her submission correctly the inclusion of age verification may well be one of the new regulatory measures we will seek to put in place.  I would welcome that, given the evidence Mr. Church and others have presented here on the health implications of the use of some of these services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#Y00600","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I will respond first.  The short answer is that there is no research to prove that correlation.  However, as I said earlier, we take many calls every day.  It is 1.05 p.m. now and Childline has probably received over 500 calls today.  I am only three months in the job so I am new to this and much of my time was spent listening and shadowing some of the calls.  I only relayed one case example today but there are hundreds.  What we are seeing, as well as from talking to the volunteers online, are behaviours that are causing significant issues for the child.  As the Deputy described, they are subtle things such as exclusion by not being invited to a party or not being part of a WhatsApp group, which in effect is bullying.  I mentioned earlier that we will have to start considering how we should categorise those calls.  If a child mentions in a confidential call that he or she is subject to online bullying, that is categorised as online bullying but far more conversations we are having with children every day are about issues they are having relating to online issues.  We would certainly love to see far more research around that and whether it is a correlation.  Intuitively, I would agree with the Deputy but there is no research that I know of to show that.<\/p> <p>  I also mentioned that we are seeing a slight decrease in telephone calls.  Incidentally, it is young boys who are calling online, which is interesting.  One would tend to think it would be girls calling because they are sometimes better at conversing, but the boys appear to find the online calls a great source of support.  We are seeing a switch from calls to online chat and this has forced us to upgrade our online platform, which we are launching next week.  With the launch of that platform we can get into many more in-depth conversations and that is when we will start gathering a great deal of research around this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Church"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I regularly talk to teachers and principals and they are definitely seeing the fallout in the classroom, with children coming in tired or falling out over cyberbullying incidents or gaming.  There is a clear dynamic.  I spoke to a principal yesterday in preparation for anti-bullying week next week and he said that in the ten years he has been a principal the change has been stark.  Obviously, in the early years as a principal he was dealing with bullying but the amount of online instances he now has to deal with is just incredible.  That has an impact on the schools each day.  As our survey showed, teachers are dealing with this in the classroom all the time.  Anecdotally, therefore, there is good evidence.<\/p> <p>  A survey published in the UK this year found that girls who were using social media at ten years of age for an hour a day are far more likely to have social and emotional problems at 15 years of age.  That was a five year longitudinal study, so some evidence is starting to emerge.  The children we are talking to are all in primary school and they largely value popularity over privacy.  They do not really understand the ramifications of sharing all sorts of things such as dick pictures, intimate images and children being told to kill themselves because of the colour of their skin or because of the way they look.  There is a great deal of harmful communication and the online-offline balance - how one treats people in real life versus how one treats them online - is not well understood.

As he said it will either be a new one or an existing one.  Clearly the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, is in the frame for that.  Because this is such a new area, we in the Department are taking the opportunity to travel and meet with many other member states to get a sense of their approach.  It is a big area.  The audiovisual media services, AVMS, directive will clearly be of particular significance to Ireland because of the platforms we have here.  We are therefore keen to learn from other member states about how they are managing.  We met with representatives from the UK, which I know is about to depart.  We will also be going to the Nordic countries.  We really want to go very broadly on this to make sure that we get it right because how to regulate this space is a very significant decision.<\/p><p> On age verification, the directive itself refers to protecting minors and the general public from certain audiovisual content and about protecting the general public from content, including advertising, the dissemination of which is a criminal offence.  These offences are terrorist-related offences, child sexual abuse material offences, and offences of racism and xenophobia.  The model proposed in the directive is one of co-regulation between the platforms and a regulatory body.  Part of that means that we will have to look at age verification and parental controls, because the Deputy is right, the directive does refer to minors.

There is not a huge amount of research on the well-being front.  We recently commissioned some in the UK through a think tank called Demos.  One of the main findings coming out of that research and other research is that it is less about the amount of time than about what is done with that time.  Passive scrolling of content can be damaging in some cases whereas meaningful interactions can actually boost a sense of well-being.  There is, however, a dearth of research in the area and we are trying to address that.  It can be seen that Instagram in particular has a very strong focus on well-being.  It has a whole section dedicated to it.  It has introduced certain tools to help one limit one's screen time and to keep track of what one is doing.  Apple has a report which one might see flash up on one's phone if one uses an iPhone.  This report gives one a sense of how many notifications and how much screen time on average one has had per day.  Facebook is also looking to roll out tools based on time spent online and well-being.  I had thought that they would be rolled out by now.

That is the reason this legislation is largely focused on the principles, procedures, structures and so on rather than necessarily going into specific technologies or forms of communication with respect to defining - as we have to do - what is harmful communication and also in terms of the harm that it does.

The extra-territorial effect of this Bill is not particularly radical.  It is limited to situations where the communication affects an Irish person ordinarily resident in the State and the means of communication used in connection with such harmful communication is within the control of an undertaking or company established under the law of the State or where such harmful communications affect an Irish person ordinarily resident in the State where the means of communication are within the control of an undertaking established under the law of another state and where a court established in this State would have jurisdiction to give notice of service in that respect.

It would be desirable for any significant platform undertaking to be seen to be complaint and that users, and particularly parents, would be aware that it was compliant.  If an undertaking is based outside this jurisdiction and it wants people in Ireland to use it, it will have to develop standards to reach the level of a certificate of compliance.

The Traveller accommodation expert group was established by the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, earlier this year in order to review the Traveller Accommodation Act 1998 and other legislation which impacts on the provision and delivery of accommodation to Travellers.  The expert group met for the first time on 15 October.  It has been tasked with thinking about the best way of approaching the delivery of Traveller accommodation, as well as providing the Minister of State with suggestions and key actions in the next six months.<\/p> <p>  The background to the setting up of the expert group is that A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to the establishment of a special working group to audit the current delivery and implementation of local authorities' Traveller accommodation programmes and to consult with stakeholders in respect of key areas of concern.  On foot of this, the Housing Agency commissioned a report, on behalf of the Department, for an independent review of capital and current funding for Traveller-specific accommodation for the period 2000 to date.<\/p><p>The review had regard to the targets contained in the local authority Traveller accommodation programmes and units delivered, the current status of the accommodation funded and the funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.  On foot of this report, the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, NTACC, advised the Minister to establish an expert group to review the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and other legislation that impacts the provision and delivery of accommodation for Travellers.  The terms of reference were drawn up in consultation with the NTACC.<\/p><p> These terms of reference were to review the effectiveness, implementation and operation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 with a view to examining whether it provides a robust legislative basis for meeting the current and future accommodation needs of the Traveller community, which takes effective implementation into account in the context of the recognition of Traveller ethnicity in 2017; to examine national and international best practice in the provision of accommodation for nomadic communities to inform the legislative basis for meeting the current and future accommodation needs of the Traveller community; to review other legislation that impacts on the provision and delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation, including transient accommodation; to consult all relevant stakeholders at local and national level, including Traveller representative organisations and other stakeholder groups represented on the NTACC and the local Traveller accommodation consultative committees, LTACCs, with such consultation to include an invitation for written submissions and a series of meaningful national, regional and local workshops and focus groups; and to draft and present report and recommendations to the Minister within six months of commencement.  <\/p><p> The Traveller accommodation expert group comprises three members.  I will not go through the biographies, which are contained in the opening statement.  The membership consists of myself and my colleagues, Professor Michelle Norris and Dr. Conor Norton.  Dr. Norton sends his apologies this morning; he is out of the country on other business.  <\/p><p> In respect of the initial focus of the expert review group, the first step taken by the expert review group was to gain an understanding of the key themes, challenges and issues on which to focus.  To this end, the initial actions of the expert group were a desktop evaluation of research papers and reports considering the findings and recommendations, a desktop study and overview of planning code and planning issues and collation of planning statistics relating to Traveller accommodation and an understanding of current expenditure on Traveller accommodation, Traveller accommodation broken down, annual count, Census figures and Traveller homelessness.  Some initial themes and barriers to the effective provision of Traveller accommodation identified by the expert group to focus on are land use planning and the interaction of the legislation and systems with the legislation on planning for Traveller accommodation provision; social housing provision, particularly, the provision of Traveller-specific social rented accommodation, for example, halting sites and group housing schemes, accurately measuring Travellers' preferences for Traveller-specific social housing compared to standard houses and apartments and the role of approved housing bodies, AHBs, in provision of Traveller accommodation; the increased use of private sector accommodation by Travellers either rented or privately owned, the push and pull factors, advantages and disadvantages associated with this development and how Travellers who wish to secure private accommodation can be supported; and key gaps in data provision which impede effective policy design and implementation, for example, annual patterns of movement by Travellers.  <\/p><p> The next step the expert group intends to take is to complete the desktop evaluation, including a review of planning legislation, and to commence a consultation.  The expert review group is now planning face-to-face consultations.  Later this month, the expert group will meet with CENA - the Irish Travellers Movement, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, the Irish Council for Social Housing and Dr. Anna Visser of the Oireachtas Library.  A member of the expert review group will attend the next NTACC meeting with Offaly LTACC later in November.  Wider stakeholder consultation will take place in November and December with written submissions being requested from LTACCs, local authority social workers and other key stakeholders.  We hope this committee will afford the members an opportunity to participate in this consultation and we are look forward to hearing members' views on the expert review of Traveller accommodation.<\/p><p>I thank the committee for allowing me to make an opening statement.

I warmly welcome the establishment of the expert group.  This committee has had a lot of discussions on Traveller accommodation and the failure of local and central government to spend funds allocated and to provide the housing included in the local Traveller accommodation plans.  There is an openness among many of us on the committee to see significant changes and to consider good proposals to allow us to tackle that, mindful that we are going to have local government elections next year with a fresh round of Traveller accommodation planned for the five years after that.<\/p><p>Part of the reason we asked the expert group in today was not so much for it to report on its work, because we know it is only starting its work, but for the group to hear the committee members' views and give it a sense as to where this committee is at.<\/p><p>We tracked very carefully, both before the report was published last year and since then, the chronic underspends, particularly in specific local authorities.  There is a mixed picture out there, which we acknowledge.<\/p><p>We are also very aware from our own experience that often there is an unwillingness to provide land and there are politics around the approvals of the Part 8 planning process.  There are complexities around consultation.  There are local Traveller consultative committees that work well and there are others that hardly work at all or very poorly.  These are some of the key matters the expert group will be looking at.<\/p><p>Many of us in the Oireachtas would like to see quite radical recommendations coming back from the group as to options for Government.  If one looks at the figures, it is intolerable to think that in 2017, local authorities overspent their standard social housing budget by a factor of &euro;100 million and had to come back to the Oireachtas and Government and seek approval for that extra &euro;100 million while in that same year, the underspend in the Traveller accommodation programmes was the worst recorded at 45%, with a number of local authorities spending nothing at all.  At a time when local authorities are clearly able to spend, even with social housing projects that can sometimes be politically controversial, they can get over those humps.  Clearly, the problem is not the system<i><\/i>of delivering housing<i>, per se<\/i>, but there are other factors at play.<\/p><p>I have no doubt, and I will say it publicly, that while there are many reasons individual projects are slower to deliver, prejudice operating at a community, political and management levels is one of the key factors.  We have to be honest about that and where prejudice is clearly a barrier, we have to find mechanisms to take those decisions away from some of those people, or at least have the sanction of those decisions being taken away and handed for delivery somewhere else.<\/p><p>We had a lengthy discussion at the Committee on Housing and Homelessness on this matter and there was a proposal that where local authorities had a track record of not drawing down the money to spend in accordance with their Traveller accommodation programmes, that function would be taken away from them, even for a time-limited period.  The idea was not that we wanted to take those powers away from local authorities but if that threat was hanging over them, it might add an additional incentive to draw down that money and spend it and if it was not spent, we wanted to make sure it was spent through some other mechanism.  We could not get agreement at that committee, so this was not in its recommendations.  The committee was split almost 50-50.  Given that since then things have got worse, we have to revisit that, whether it is in terms of the section 183 land disposals, in the Part 8 planning proposals or otherwise.<\/p><p>We also need to look at the approvals and procurement process, and Professor Norris has considerable expertise in this.  These are also factors in the delay in some of these things.  Perhaps there are ways of speeding these up.  The Government, for example, is about to increase the financial threshold for the one-stage approvals process up to &euro;7 million, which would give a development of 20 units or so.  There might be an argument for looking at having a specific one-stage approvals process for Traveller-specific accommodation if that &euro;7 million figure is too low.  That is something the expert group could look at and it could come back with some proposals.<\/p><p>Some other smaller things might be useful.  We now get a very useful report, the social housing construction pipeline report, each quarter from the Department which gives us a project-by-project breakdown of where all the new build social housing construction by approved housing bodies and local authorities are at.  We need something like that for Traveller-specific accommodation so this committee can track on a quarterly basis where the projects are at, which ones are being held up and why they are being held up, which would add that level of transparency.<\/p><p>Spend is not the only issue.  As the Housing Agency report shows, while the overall underspend was 13%, the under-delivery of units was 31% so it relates to what it is spent on, whether that is new units, refurbishments and so on.  We are keen to hear ideas around that.<\/p><p> Consultation on this is so important.  There has been widespread misreporting and misinformed commentary on the situation regarding the housing units in Tipperary.  It is clear from that that whatever about the detail, the consultative process failed.  Had that been more effective, I do not believe that we would be in the situation that we are in.  How do we make sure that at all stages, pre, during and post-Part 8, for example, or any other planning process, that the Travelling community, and especially the people who will be living in sites or units that are being developed, are centrally involved from the outset?  <\/p><p> Should we consider sanctions for local authorities in other areas of their expenditure if they fail to spend Traveller accommodation budgets and meet their statutory requirements?  I am just throwing this out there but if a local authority knew that its roads budget, for example, might be withheld if it did not spend its Traveller accommodation budget, it might focus the minds of elected representatives to do what they are legally required to do under the Traveller accommodation programmes.  I am inviting the expert group to be as radical as possible and to put as many things on the table as possible, not because I want to see local authorities sanctioned or have powers removed but because at a time when Traveller accommodation budgets are finally beginning to increase, not a single euro of the post-recession increase in Traveller accommodation funds allocated to local authorities has been spent.  If one looks at the last three years, as budget started to increase modestly, this has been completely underspent.  I say modest, and we need much greater spending than that.    <\/p><p> I appreciate that the expert group has a great deal of work to do.  I am not telling it what its job should be because the three people here are far more expert on the issue than any member of this committee, however, we are about to enter into a local government cycle and getting legislation through the Oireachtas will become increasingly difficult the closer we get to that and we need to be honest about that.  Therefore, the earlier that recommendations come back to Government, even if they are only initial headline recommendations around some of the legislative reform, the more conducive the political environment will be to consider them rationally and progress them through the Oireachtas.  If we are looking at very significant proposals in changing things such as how section 183s or Part 8s operate within a couple of months of local elections, it will make it very difficult.  If we do not get some of these changes in either just before or immediately after the local election, they will not inform the next five years of Traveller accommodation plans and budgets.  I am not saying that the work should be done quickly at the expense of quality, but the working group should be mindful of the political timeframe under which we are operating.  Many of us here would like to get good things through and the Minister has attended this committee, and I think that he also wants to get things through, but the space to do this is limited because of how the electoral cycle impinges on it, so it should be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#H00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I echo many of the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  What specific work does the working group envisage in a root and branch examination of the role of local authorities?  Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to the underspend.  I wish to put on record the underspend in Tipperary, the local authority in the eye of the storm.  In the past 18 years they underspent by &euro;4.7 million.  That is a very significant underspend when the spin in the media was all about money being spent and people not taking up offers, not that the reporting was accurate.<\/p><p>It is important that underspending is examined in the work of the expert group.  The role of local authorities in those underspends should be outlined.  The review should refer to the political activities and discriminatory practices of elected members who oppose accommodation.  It is important the review does not avoid or skirt around it.  We all know it happens and it should be discussed.  The efficacy of local measures such as the LTACCs should be referred to in a root-and-branch examination of the role of local authorities in delivery.  I hear them criticised anecdotally as not being useful and as being talking shops.  Will the expert group take a view on whether we are talking about reforming local authorities and applying sanctions such as those Deputy &Oacute; Broin outlined such that if a local authority does not spend its Traveller budget, it will not get its other budgets?  Should we be looking at something far more radical and not wasting energy on reforming something that is not reformable given the latent prejudice among elected members representing their communities?  Is the working group open to examining the establishment of an independent national Traveller accommodation agency?  In its report back to the committee, will the working group be specific about addressing the issues of underspending, the crises in people's day-to-day lives, safety and overcrowding issues?  Will it provide an interim report so that, having regard to the political cycle, we will not miss opportunities to get any legislation on the books?<\/p><p> The consultation with stakeholders will be critical.  Groups on the ground have been doing an awful lot of work and research and it is important the expert group taps into it.  In north Cork they have been conducting extensive data gathering and research on concerns among members of the Traveller community about accommodation.  Rather than reinventing the wheel, we could take note of that work and research.  It should be done in addition to the LTACCs, which would also connect with local Traveller development groups because they have their finger on the pulse of the issues people face on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#J00200","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I welcome the establishment of the expert group.  It is time to get to the bottom of exactly what is stopping the delivery of Traveller accommodation, whether that is political blockages, administration blockages or critical infrastructure that is missing.  In Wicklow, while we were trying to identify a number of transient halting sites, the lack of infrastructure to deliver sites was an issue.  I acknowledge there is a lack of political will to deal with the Traveller issue.  In some local authorities, the administration does not want to deal with it.  It is probably the only budget in any local authority that is not spent.  All the other budgets are spent.  There is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with.  That is why I welcome the expert group.  I will welcome the report when it is published but the sooner the better.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, we are coming into a local election cycle so it will be difficult to get decisions made the closer we come to that date.  If local democracy is not working, we will sadly have to look at removing it from the remit of local democracy agencies.  I am an advocate of local democracy but if local authorities are not willing to make the difficult decisions, the decisions will have to be made somewhere else, possibly at national level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#K00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>When we have a conversation about Traveller accommodation or lack thereof, we are having a conversation about human rights and the denial of human rights.<\/p><p>The expert group clearly has important work to do and the recommendations it comes up with will be important for the Traveller community, society and human rights.  The discussion needs to be framed in this context.<\/p><p> I will use the example of the fire in Carrickmines.  In the immediate aftermath of the fire local authorities throughout the country generally moved to take some action under pressure of public opinion and with a spotlight on the inaction of the past.  What was done?  There was some signage and some fire-fighting equipment and smoke detectors were installed on sites and an element of training was given, but as the weeks and months rolled by less and less was done and at a certain stage it came to a virtual standstill.  Was the job complete when things came to a virtual standstill?  Very far from it.<\/p><p> I highlight in particular the question of overcrowding on sites.  I understand best practice, and what is meant to be achieved, is a 6 m gap between mobile homes, caravans and buildings.  There is overcrowding on Traveller sites in this State and in the city where I am a public representative, and the 6 m gap is not met by a long shot.  If we look at the halting site in Spring Lane in Ballyvolane on the north side of Cork city, if anything the overcrowding situation there is worse than it was a couple of years ago.  The fire safety precautions that were meant to be implemented nationally in the wake of the tragedy do not come close to applying in daily practice on the site.  Is it the only site in the country where this is the case?  I very much doubt it.  I have plenty of anecdotal evidence that it is not the only one.  I use this as one example of a situation that needs to be addressed with urgency.<\/p><p> There is an elephant in the room, which is the conversation and debate that was had in the recent presidential election and its aftermath.  It is not unusual to have wannabe politicians and councillors playing the Traveller card in local authority areas to big up their vote but this was on a level that had not been seen before in the State.  A candidate in national presidential election cynically stirred up and appealed to anti-Traveller attitudes in society to boost his profile and vote.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, that was done with some success by the candidate in question.  Against that backdrop, there could be a pressure or perceived pressure on the expert group to go easy or to soften the approach and come up with recommendations that do not rock the boat, but in the aftermath of that controversy I believe it is more important than ever that the expert group brings forward recommendations that are bold, radical and address the festering issues and problems that exist.  This issue has been pushed to the side for far too long, as shown by the lack of spend in so many local authorities.  It requires courage and proposals that match the needs of the situation, including addressing the human rights issues that are clearly present.<\/p><p> On the question of steps for consideration, a spotlight must be shone on the lack of both action and spending by local authorities, followed by proposals on how to address that.  Nine councils did not invest any funds in housing schemes last year and only seven drew down 100% of the funding.  In the Cork City Council area, despite the fact that there are at least 50 families living in overcrowded conditions, &euro;97,000 from a fund of &euro;1.1 million was spent.

That figure says a great deal about the reality.  Various ideas have arisen here.  One is the idea of having a sanction hanging over councils whereby if a council does not spend its budget, sanctions will be put in place against the council on other fronts.  There is also the idea that the powers be removed from the councils entirely and given to another entity whose job would be to do what is necessary and address the problems.  I believe there would have to be some form of democratic accountability and input in that regard, but if we are at the stage where we must consider that then let us do so.  The situation that has pertained for years has reached a point now where these issues must be addressed as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#M00700","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy Barry.  I wish to make some comments.  Notwithstanding the witnesses and the people in the Public Gallery, there is a great deal of experience in local and national politics in this room with regard to realistic views and options that could be pursued.  I have been through three development plans.  I am very aware of that TA sign, taking it on, taking it off and the problems we have around that.  It all comes down to clear communication and information in the local authority in that area.  It is about bringing people from all communities with us, not leaving them behind.  We do that through clear communication and leadership.  That leadership must come from the local authority.<\/p><p>I am loath to take it away from the local authorities because it will add another layer of bureaucracy.  They are best placed.  They know the demographics, the needs and the wants of their communities in those areas.  I am also loath to introduce sanctions because sanctions put up a wall.  It is better to bring people along than to put up a wall.  Introducing sanctions would be something I would do as a last call.  A solution can always be found; nothing is insurmountable.  I am also a realist.  We have 15 accommodation programmes for the Traveller community in D&uacute;n Laoghaire which are all well maintained.  There are issues with some; there are no issues with others.  We have some issues on private estates but we do not have issues on other private estates.  One tries to ensure balance and fairness in the system.  It is up to the local authorities to come forward with solutions and sites.  <\/p><p> A lot of information was made available to this committee.  Some of us took advantage of that.  I was delighted to meet with Anna Visser from the Library and Research Service who carried out a report.  She went through it with me in great detail in respect of different areas of the country.  It raised many issues that will need to be dealt with.  We have to look at the needs as opposed to wants at local level.  We also have to recognise that some Traveller families want to be in a permanent house rather than a Traveller accommodation programme, while others do not.  It is about the desktop study the expert group has spoken about and about getting that database together to find out the needs of the Traveller community.  Numerous other issues come up with regard to finding suitable land including objections from local communities.  Funding is clearly not the problem; drawing it down is.  There has to be a willingness, however, in the local authority to drive that.  Local authorities are under fierce pressure as of late in respect of the delivery of social housing but this issue has to be part of that.  I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy English, wanted to get this expert group together because he recognised that there is a problem that needs to be solved and that we have to recognise where those pinch points are and work on them together.  <\/p><p> We also have to be fair about it.  If there is a family on the side of the road for whatever reason, one has to be fair to the people who are living in that community.  They have to be kept informed of the situation.  We have to communicate with them.  We have to find out why that family has decided to be on the side of the road.  Is it because accommodation was not made available to them?  Is it because they were not included in the system?  Is it because the local authority is not aware of them?  Have all solutions been offered to that family?  If so, there has to be fairness for people who live in that area.  <\/p><p> There is a role for all sides to play in teasing through these solutions.  It is not about pitching local authorities against Government.  It is not about adding another layer of bureaucracy and asking another body to enforce this.  A group such as the expert group will come up with the radical solutions that are required and decisions will be made on the informed evidence which it will collate, rather than on the basis of one-liners such as those to which Deputy Barry alluded.  None of us agreed with the comments that were made during the presidential campaign but there has to be a fairness in providing Traveller accommodation.  It has to consider the need, want and demographic required in the area.  There has to be proper consultation, and that can be difficult at times, but there has to be bravery in doing that.  There also has to be a fairness.  <\/p><p> In my own area in Shankill, we have a family that is on the side of the road in a particular area.  There is no issue.  They are not causing any trouble in any shape or form but there has to be a fairness.  People are paying mortgages or rent.  There has to be a balance in the system.  It is hard to strike that balance and that is where the expert group will be pivotal.  By doing that, we will bring people with us.  Working together, I believe local authorities will play their role in delivery but that has to be done in a manner which we can all support, that local politicians also support and that delivers homes in safe communities for families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#M00800","speaker":"1246","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I thank members for their valuable contributions which we will take on board.  We are cognisant of their role and experience as public representatives in dealing with these issues on the ground and the valuable insights they can bring to the process.<\/p> <p>  They are correct on variable output.  The latest figures supplied to us by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government indicate 67% of the total budget for Traveller accommodation over the past ten years has been drawn down.  The drawdown levels are variable.  Some local authorities have drawn down almost all the moneys made available while others have a zero drawdown rate.  Senator Kelleher mentioned that in the past year, nine local authorities have drawn down no funding whatsoever, despite the fact that the Traveller population out of accommodation in some of these local authorities is high.  The nine in question are Laois, Mayo, Monaghan, Westmeath, Longford, Wexford, Kildare, Galway and South Dublin County Council.<\/p> <p>  The issue of Traveller accommodation provision is solvable considering the small size of the Traveller population compared to the national population. That is a starting point from which we need to work.  The policy and funding nationally has improved, been honed and reformed much over the past 20 years.  The issue is with the implementation of the policy, particularly the differences between various local authorities.  As part of our work, we have started to review the extensive volume of evidence collated on Traveller accommodation by the Department and the different Traveller bodies.  There is much research on Traveller issues and there is ample evidence of what the problems are.  It is an issue of collating the evidence, consulting with people and trying to identify solutions, particularly around the implementation side.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the points raised by the Chairman around trying to balance achieving output on the one hand, in many cases against opposition from local politicians and local communities, and bringing communities and local politicians around.  The system of LTACCs, set up following the recommendation of the task force on the Traveller community, has worked well in some areas but not in others.  There is learning we can bring from the areas where it has worked well.  That is a point we will examine.<\/p> <p>  In the local authorities where it has not worked, there is no doubt that needs to be some intervention at this stage.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the idea of a national body.  That has been recommended in policy since the 1980s but not acted on.  The challenge one faces is the particular local issues which operate regarding Traveller accommodation and the level of consultation with local communities.  The other side of this is that if we continue to work with the situation where there is such under-delivery and uneven delivery around the country, the problem will never be resolved.  In some ways, it creates additional problems for the local authorities that are meeting their responsibilities.  It is unfair treatment of the local authorities that are meeting their responsibilities while other local authorities are getting away with the problem.  Solutions such as sanctions are some of the issues we will examine.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of centralisation of the function.  Although, in view of the fact there has been success in some areas and the importance of local consultation, that would have to be a last resort recommendation.<\/p><p>Some of the other points raised relate to the need for leadership from local authorities and elected Members in particular, which I acknowledge.  <\/p><p> I will flag some other issues members did not raise in their comments that we plan to look at.  Local authorities are not the sole providers of social housing so we will definitely examine the role of AHBs, which have been the major source of social housing supply since the economic crisis in the late 2000s.  We will examine the potential role of AHBs in social housing supply, including speaking to a Traveller-specific AHB.  We will also examine the increased number of Travellers in accommodation in the private sector.  There are barriers to Travellers accessing private accommodation that we plan to look at.  The research commissioned by the Housing Agency shows that in many cases, Travellers are pushed into private accommodation against their will and actually seek social housing but in other cases, Travellers have a preference for private accommodation.  If they want to do so, they should be facilitated and barriers should be removed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#O00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Michelle Norris","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I welcome the views of members, some of which are very practical in terms of very straightforward things.  I like the idea of being able to monitor on project-by-project basis, something that does not occur currently with Traveller accommodation.  In terms of the work we intend to do, there is a significant interaction between planning, the planning process and Traveller accommodation provision and not just at the level of local authority development.  We should remember that many Travellers also seek to make their own provision, some of which could be considered specific provision in respect of sites or halting sites for themselves - essentially private provision.  That type of development is not open to Travellers under our current planning system - certainly not in terms of the decisions that are made regarding those sort of applications.  Clearly, there is a greater link between the objectives of a Traveller accommodation programme and that being a material consideration in the planning process.  I hear the comments of the Chairman in terms of a balance being struck.  Where there is a clear link in the planning process and Traveller accommodation, that need to address local concerns can be met in an objective way that prevents it being a political consideration.  Ultimately, the idea behind planning is that there is local consultation within it.  Currently, the provision of Traveller accommodation does not seem to be provided for within the entire planning process.  When I say that, I mean it in the context of families who want to provide for themselves.  It creates an issue so Traveller-specific accommodation rests with local authorities and the particular political issues that arise in that context.<\/p> <p>  We are looking at radical proposals.  Some of them may not be very radical but we are certainly taking on board what has been said by members of the committee as Members of the national Parliament.  They are ideas that will, hopefully, be reflected at some level within our report.  Trying to address that balance can be done by objective legislation and removing the political capital that can be made from objecting to any type of accommodation and putting it into a more objective process as opposed to the current subjective process.  Again, I welcome the comments made around the table this morning.  The concerns that have been expressed about the actual spend when it comes back purely to local authority provision are concerning to the committee.  They constitute one area that we hope to see addressed in our recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Are there any further comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#P00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I have two small points.  Obviously, there has been a very public debate about the more excessive language used by Peter Casey during his presidential election campaign.<\/p><p>One of the things that concerns me, however, is that in my experience much of the anti-Traveller prejudice that is most effective is the anti-Traveller prejudice that does not allow itself to be seen or heard publicly.  It is what happens privately between certain councillors and managers and it uses a language which is a world away from Peter Casey's language and would insist that it is not prejudicial or designed to prevent Travellers from getting access to the accommodation they need and deserve.  We need to be mindful also that the most dangerous anti-Traveller prejudice is that which vehemently protests that it is not prejudice at all, but is something else.  I only say that because that is the stuff that has a much more negative day-to-day impact on the delivery of projects.  That raises a challenge.  Quantifying and proving that is much more difficult but it is important to state that.  I am not at all disagreeing with Deputy Barry, who is right in what he is saying, but it needs to be named.<\/p><p> The second thing is a small bit of the picture but it is still worth noticing.  We have spoken here about the global spend but, for example, if one looks at the spreadsheet provided by the Department for the Traveller caravan loan scheme, it is the same picture.  One of the problems we are experiencing at the moment is that even in local authorities - South Dublin County Council is one example - where elected members, against some resistance from management, manage to push through a budget allocation for a caravan loan scheme, they get into all sorts of protracted arguments with management about the implementation of that scheme and the rules that are required.  South Dublin County Council agreed a budget for Traveller accommodation before this D&aacute;il was elected, and when a number of us were still members of the local authority, but not a single euro has been made available to people because of arguments over what is the best way to implement that scheme in terms of the financial rules and regulations.  This might an element the expert group might look at also because clearly there are implementation issues with the loan scheme even though it is only a small bit of the overall picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#P00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Peter Drucker is a well-known business guru who says culture eats strategy for breakfast every day and in the expert group's considerations and proposals on the law and policy, it is very important to be mindful of the kinds of things that undermine implementation at a very ordinary level, as alluded to by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  One may have the perfect structures and the perfect law.  The law on the face of it is not a bad law but the fact is it is not working.  We have to understand what is under the surface, although not as under the surface as has been the case since the presidential election.  What are those impediments?  How do they relate to the role of local government?  We have to be mindful of looking at alternatives if these things are ultimately going to be serial blockages to delivery because they reflect not just the prejudice of elected members but of the people the elected members represent.<\/p> <p>  One may have a fantastic suite of solutions but if they do not pay attention to those underlying factors and human rights, as Deputy Barry stated, then all that will be worth nothing because it will be undermined, delayed and peeled back.

It is important not to forget the work that is being done at national level in reforming the policy, the procedures and the approvals.  No doubt there is more work that could be done, but the information available to us indicates the key barrier is that projects are not being initiated at local level.  We sought information from the Department on applications for Traveller accommodation funding as opposed to approvals.  Some 100% of applications are approved.  We also sought information on the planning process, and the Part 8 process provided a relatively fast track planning solution to getting planning for Traveller-specific accommodation.  There is no doubt that there are problems and niggles with all these measures but the fundamental issue is that applications are not being initiated.
