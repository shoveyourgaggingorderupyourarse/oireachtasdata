There is no doubt that online safety has become one of the most significant challenges facing Irish society and, arguably, one of the most significant child protection issues of our time.  We face major challenges.  Many people, particularly parents, are concerned about what is happening in that regard.  It is hard to blame them for that when one reads reports of predatory behaviour, harmful material and online bullying.  This is an issue which legislators cannot ignore and must face up to.  A policy and educational response - along with strong regulation and a statutory office with real powers and teeth - is required.  It is generally accepted in most policy areas that self-regulation is no regulation.  The Internet and online safety are not particularly different in that regard.   Some providers have good regulatory mechanisms but others have none.  Legislation is needed to ensure that all providers step up to the mark and provide appropriate safeguards.  Among the primary proposed functions of the commissioner are to promote digital safety for all and to support and encourage the implementation of measures to improve digital safety, including oversight, regulation and a timely and efficient procedure for the removal of harmful digital communications.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the representatives from the various organisations, the Department and industry.  I note the commentary by organisations and industry on the Bill.  I welcome the fact that, at a previous meeting, Ms Sweeney and her colleague from Facebook, Ms Siobh&aacute;n Cummiskey, stated that they are not opposed to the idea of a digital safety commissioner and that they see great benefit in a single office having the ability to oversee and co-ordinate efforts to promote digital safety.  That view is widely shared, but we need to work collaboratively and constructively on the detail of what is involved.  I approach these engagements with an open mind in the context of amendments.  I am not precious in that regard.  I will work with the committee, departmental officials or representatives of industry or civil society organisations to improve the Bill in any way possible.<\/p> <p>  A key point raised at the committee's most recent meeting - and which may be raised again today - relates to the need for a definition of \"harmful communications\".  It may be appropriate for the definition to be provided by the office of the digital safety commissioner.  It should not be left to providers to define it.  On balance, as there is a legal requirement to be in compliance with sections 4 and 5, it would be appropriate to provide a definition.  I am developing a draft definition, which will be needed.  We should look to the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission which provide a description of a category of existing and proposed offences.  I do not propose to introduce amendments to make such offences criminal offences under the Bill.  However, those are the types of behaviours we must seek to address.<\/p> <p>  I will be making a submission to the committee and the Minister to inform the drafting of the scrutiny report.  I suggest that other interested bodies should also consider doing so in order to allow the committee to evaluate all viewpoints in advance of drafting its report and the Committee Stage debate on the Bill.<\/p><p> The issue of freedom of expression has also been raised.  I acknowledged this in my comments on the previous occasion.  It is correct that we must proceed very carefully.  Freedom of expression is a value we all treasure and is essential to a functioning democracy.  I do not believe, however, that this is a reason to prevent us proceeding.  It is not an absolute right, especially where harmful communications are damaging, hurtful or, in some circumstances, illegal.  There is a consensus.  We cannot simply allow self-regulation to be the only approach.  We need to show vision and be ambitious and imaginative.  In view of the fact that this has been done in other common law jurisdictions, there is no reason for not doing the same here.  We need to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#G00200","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.

As members are aware, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, expressed his preliminary views on the Bill at the committee&rsquo;s meeting on 25 October.  He outlined his view that if the Oireachtas is to pass a law in this area, it must ensure that it is robust, effective, and proportionate and that it properly meets the public policy need to protect children online.  The Minister has asked the Department to consider the Private Members&rsquo; Bill in detail.  He also asked the Attorney General for urgent advice on a range of legal issues which the draft legislation presents.<\/p> <p>   As members are aware, the action plan for online safety, which was published by the Taoiseach on 11 July, contains 25 actions to be implemented or substantially progressed by the six Departments involved by the end of 2019.  Since the publication of the plan, an interdepartmental sponsors&rsquo; group, chaired by the Department of Education and Skills, with membership from the other five Departments, has been established.  That group will report to the relevant Cabinet committee on progress in implementing these commitments.<\/p> <p>  The National Advisory Council for Online Safety has also been established.  Its secretariat is provided by my Department.  The first meeting of the council was held on 4 October and the next meeting will be held in the coming weeks.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, has succeeded the Deputy Kyne, who is now Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, as chairman of the council.  The committee may also be interested to note that the council has established two sub-groups, the first to consider the role of the council in relation to guidance material, and the second to consider the council&rsquo;s role in relation to research.  A wide range of organisations have accepted the Government&rsquo;s invitation to be members of the council, including the four other organisations represented at this meeting, as well as other bodies representing  parents and older people, academic experts, and State bodies including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Data Protection Commission and the Ombudsman for Children.<\/p> <p>  It is envisaged that the council will publish a report on its work to date to coincide with Safer Internet Day in February.  This will, in subsequent years, will become the council's annual report.  The overall focus of the action plan for online safety is to identify and deliver the activities that can be delivered over a period of 12 to 18 months and that will have the greatest impact on online safety for all our citizens, especially children.  Action 18 of the plan commits the Government, and specifically my Department, as well as the Departments of Justice and Equality and Business Enterprise and Innovation, to work with this committee to explore the issues arising in respect of this Private Members&rsquo; Bill.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of issues which the committee may wish to consider in the context of its scrutiny, a number of which were referenced by the Minister on 25 October, some of which I will now outline.  There is an absence of a definition of harmful digital communications.  It will be important to define what illegal offences will come within scope; whether the definition would also include harmful but not illegal communications, and, if so, of what nature.  Another issue is the definition of a digital service undertaking which appears to encompass a very wide range of undertakings, some of which may pose little or no risk in respect of harmful communications.  In the context of illegal content, would the Data Protection Commissioner have the power to seek the take-down of such material without consulting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  In the case of harmful but legal content, are there enforcement issues arising given that under the e-commerce directive 2000, notice and take down requirements relate only to the take-down of illegal content?  Is the enforcement mechanism envisaged for the take-down of harmful content by an undertaking located outside the State appropriate given that the speed of take-down would likely be the key outcome sought in such cases?<\/p> <p>  It may be helpful for the committee to be aware of some additional developments in the regulation of online content at European level.  It is expected that the final text of the revised audiovisual media services directive will be published shortly, with a requirement that it be implemented by member states within 21 months.<\/p><p>The original audiovisual media services directive, which was agreed in 2010, established the framework for regulating traditional television and on-demand services such as RT&Eacute; Player and Netflix.  While there are many aspects of the revision which will be of interest to the committee, of particular relevance to today's discussion are the new provisions that will apply to video-sharing platform services.  Aspects of services such as YouTube are likely to fall within the scope of these provisions.  The revised directive will require member states to introduce, by means of co-regulation, a system to ensure that these services have measures in place in order that minors will be protected from audiovisual content, including advertising, which may impair their physical, mental or moral development and that the general public will be protected from audiovisual content, including advertising, containing incitement to violence or hatred and from such content, including advertising, the dissemination of which is a criminal offence under Union law.  The latter covers terrorism-related offences, child sexual abuse material offences and offences of racism and xenophobia.<\/p><p> Ireland will be required to appoint a national regulatory authority which will monitor and ensure that video-sharing platforms have appropriate measures in place to meet the goals I have outlined.  Among the measures which may be appropriate are age-verification and parental controls.  This presents an alternative approach to the regulation of harmful online content, albeit only for video-sharing platforms.  The Department intends to commence a public consultation on Ireland's approach to the implementation of the revised directive before the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>There are two witnesses from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, Mr. John Church, chief executive officer, CEO, and Ms Fiona Jennings, policy co-ordinator.

We welcome the drafting of legislation to establish an office of digital safety commissioner and look forward to its progress.<\/p> <p>  Online safety is the child protection issue of our day.  I would like to share a typical example of a Childline case with the committee.  A 15 year old female contacted Childline's web chat service.  She stated that she sent nude pictures of herself to her boyfriend and that when they broke up, he sent them to his friends.  Now her friends and people in school are talking about her and calling her vile names.  She feels really embarrassed, stupid and ashamed.  She feels very hurt and betrayed by her ex-boyfriend.  She did not think that he would do such a thing.  She is terrified that her parents will find out and is scared about how they might react, especially her dad because he is so strict.  She is so upset that she wants to kill herself.  This example illustrates the fear and isolation children feel when something they do online goes horribly wrong and they perceive that the situation is out of their control to manage.<\/p> <p>  The ISPCC has been pleased to see the Houses of the Oireachtas take seriously the issue of online safety, with a significant increase in activity in Departments in the past year.  We would like to take this opportunity too, to acknowledge the work of the Office for Internet Safety and Webwise and the work they do with limited resources.  These structures need to be better resourced to make them more effective and for every parent, child and teacher in the country to become aware of them and embrace their resources and expertise.<\/p> <p>  The ISPCC broadly welcomed the publication of the Government's first action plan for online safety last July, particularly its provisions in respect of enhanced education measures and proposed law reform.  However, the ISPCC expressed its disappointment at the time that the action plan fell short of a commitment to statutory regulation.  Not long after the launch of the action plan, and indeed in recent times, the public has been presented with stark examples of self-regulation failing.  It is our experience that these failures can impact negatively on children and that there are positive actions that Ireland can take to better protect children online.  Notwithstanding the commitment to self-regulation in the action plan, and perhaps to reflect the fast-changing nature of this space, we were delighted to hear the comments of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, at the committee's detailed scrutiny stage where he stated it was time to move beyond self-regulation and highlighted the need for a regulatory body in the online space.<\/p> <p>  In 2016, the ISPCC carried out an internal case review of its Childline service and front-line services on the prevalence of online safety issues in our work.  The findings of this review, in conjunction with cases in the external environment, led to online safety being an integral part of our policy work, in turn giving us a clear mandate to advocate for change in this area.  In February 2017, the ISPCC made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs and shared its experiences regarding online safety issues.  These issues included access and exposure to inappropriate content, online grooming and cyberbullying.<\/p><p>Harmful communications among children can be compounded by the fact that they are children and perhaps do not realise the reach their actions can have online.  We are in no doubt that online safety is a major issue for children and young people in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In 2005 we launched the first text-based support service for children in Ireland.  We have seen a shift to our online and text service over the last decade, and we are in the final stages of development of a new online service.  The ISPCC has seen the use of its Childline online services jump from just under 4,000 conversations in 2007 to just under 30,000 conversations in 2017.  We know that children want us to be online, and to be more accessible to them in the spaces they inhabit.  Through listening to and engaging with more than 1,000 children a day on our Childline service we have been able to spot trends over the years and raise these issues in the media and with policy-makers and legislators.  Over the past two decades in particular we have seen how children&rsquo;s technological lives are becoming increasingly embedded in their lives as a whole.  The online-offline distinction for children is an unfamiliar concept.  Utilising technology and being online are no longer an add-on; it is how and where they live their lives. <br\/><br\/>Children make up one third of all Internet users globally.  One in two users in the developed world is a child.  Their participation and protection rights in the digital environment are widely supported across EU laws and policies.  Irish policy sets out ambitions for all Irish citizens to be connected and online.  ICT is broadly available and its use encouraged in many schools.  The Government&rsquo;s action plan for online safety recognises that children&rsquo;s specific vulnerability warrants greater protection.  The Net Children Go Mobile<i><\/i>report of 2015 found that one in five children in Ireland reported being bothered by something they saw on the Internet in the past.  The Internet was not created with children as users in mind, but they use it.  We know this, and we all have a role to play in keeping them safe online.  Therefore, it is imperative we recognise the need for a regulatory body, with a digital safety commissioner or equivalent, to champion children&rsquo;s online safety and seek remedies for them when they are unable to do so themselves. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The issue of defining harmful communications has been raised at the various stages of debate on this Bill thus far.  It is important that a definition is created to reflect the examples of harmful communications referred to in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report and elsewhere, and not be overly broad so as to render the definition unworkable and, in effect, useless.<br\/><br\/>While some of the suggested work of a digital safety commissioner is being carried out across other Departments and structures, we feel there is merit in co-ordinating this work in order to maximise its efforts and impacts for all concerned, under an office of the digital safety commissioner, or equivalent. <br\/><br\/>Children have a right to be protected, and this protection extends to being online.  Being online is the public space where children frequent the most.  They converse with their friends there, keep in touch with family there and shop there.  It is their go-to place for information, and, like any public space, it should afford them similar safety protections. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Church","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>CyberSafeIreland is the children&rsquo;s charity for online safety in Ireland.  We set up in 2015 and since then we have spoken to 14,000 children and to thousands of parents and teachers about staying safe online.  We also gather data on an ongoing basis which enables us to monitor trends and usage and to highlight risks.  We recently launched our annual report and published the data that we had gathered over the last academic year, based on responses from more than 5,000 children aged between eight and 13.  Some 68% of these children owned a smartphone and 70% were signed up to social media and messaging apps, despite age restrictions of at least 13 on all such services.  In short, the use of online services was pervasive among this cohort of children.  Our report further highlighted that many primary school teachers are seeing the consequence of children&rsquo;s online use in the classroom with 62% of teachers having dealt with online safety incidents over the last academic year.  More than a third of teachers had dealt with between two and five incidents last year.  Some of these incidences involved the uploading and sharing of harmful and upsetting material, including intimate images.<\/p> <p>  I am providing this data as a context to our position on the digital safety commissioner.  We believe that a digital safety commissioner will offer a level of co-ordination and oversight that we currently do not have in Ireland.  It will furthermore introduce a level of accountability by helping to ensure that social media companies are timely and responsive in their removal of any harmful material and consistent in their application of safeguards by providing monitoring, oversight and reporting on their performance in this regard.<\/p><p>As a charity that is often approached for help by parents, teachers and those working with vulnerable children, we are more aware than many of the reality of when things go wrong online, when harmful or upsetting content is either not removed or not removed quickly enough.  We also know that self-regulation means that online service providers get to be judge and jury in cases of troublesome and sometimes controversial content.  This is where a digital safety commissioner could play an important role in the review of materials and decision-making in respect of take-down procedures.<\/p><p> The Bill also proposes the introduction of a code of practice, which would mean that there would be greater consistency across platforms.  The office would also have an education and research remit and would offer an important level of co-ordination in these areas.  It is important to recognise that many of the leading social media platforms, including Facebook and Google, have worked consistently to improve safeguards on their platforms and have also provided some useful educational resources.  It is incredibly important that they continue to prioritise safeguarding practice and design into the future.  However, we need to go one step further by ensuring that all platforms are held to the same high standards and that there is a regulatory body that can provide oversight and step into the breach when needed.<\/p><p> In any discussion about a proposed digital safety commissioner, it is helpful to consider the precedents.  The Australian Office of the eSafety Commissioner was set up in 2016 as a result of the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015.  While this office is still new - and it is too early to fully assess its effectiveness - commentators such as Matthew Rimmer, professor of intellectual property and innovation law at Queensland University of Technology, think that it offers value and addresses \"genuine child safety issues in the digital environment which haven&rsquo;t been well dealt with by governments or IT companies or the community\".  The Australian Parliament's legal and constitutional affairs references committee also acknowledged the importance of this office in its review of laws relating to cyberbullying earlier this year.  It urged the Government to ensure that it was given appropriate levels of resources to carry out its mandate effectively.<\/p><p> While the UK does not have the equivalent of a digital safety commissioner, it is in the process of developing a new Internet safety strategy which will be introduced before the end of the year and which outlines some similar plans in terms of regulation.  The UK Government published the results of its public consultation on its Green Paper in May and one of the findings from the consultation was that users, including children, felt powerless to address safety issues online and there was insufficient oversight of technology companies, as well as a lack of transparency on their part.  The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, outlined plans to introduce a social media code of practice and transparency reporting as part of its digital charter and this may well become a legislative requirement in due course.<\/p><p> Given Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union, it is important to consider what is happening at a European level in order to put these proposals into the appropriate context.  In July, the Council of Europe made some recommendations to its member states regarding children&rsquo;s rights in the digital environment.  The recommendations acknowledge the importance of children being able to access the online world and include a wide range of measures and proposals around children&rsquo;s rights but also measures to protect them, including ensuring in-built safety by design, privacy by design and privacy by default as guiding principles for products and services, particularly those used by children.  The recommendations also recognise that children, and those who care for them, need guidance and education.  The document states that digital literacy education should be included in the basic education curriculum from the earliest years, taking into account children&rsquo;s evolving capacities.  While the recommendations are wide-ranging in nature and there is not the space to touch on all points here, I would like to highlight one other piece relating to them, namely, the need to identify and establish competent bodies with the responsibility and authority to implement actions in a timely and efficient manner, and that such bodies should be adequately resourced both in terms of funding and staffing.<\/p><p> The proposal for an office for a digital safety commissioner seems to offer several opportunities to meet the standards set out in the Council of Europe recommendations, although it could go further than the current proposals and include reference to the ethical and safe design of any new apps and games, as recommended by the Council of Europe.  We would also like an explicit reference to the need to embed digital literacy into the curriculum to be reflected in the Bill.  We must equip young people with the skills and know-how to navigate the online world in a safe and responsible manner.  Education is an important part of any prevention strategy and the need for digital literacy to be taught in schools is recognised in both the UK strategy and European Council recommendations.  The Bill includes many significant measures and, with some additions, it could provide a strong basis for our national strategy for dealing with online safety well into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Alex Cooney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Ms Niamh Sweeney is head of public policy at Facebook Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#L00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for asking me to be here today.  I will give a brief overview because I have been before the committee on a few previous occasions when I provided more lengthy explanations of our approach to safety.<\/p><p>Every day, more than 1.4 billion people around the world use Facebook.  They post everything from photos and status updates to live videos in many different languages.  Deciding what stays up and what comes down involves hard judgment calls on complex issues ranging from bullying and hate speech to harassment.  It is why we developed our community standards with input from outside experts, including academics, non-governmental organisations, NGOs and governments around the world.  Our community standards have been publicly available for many years and in April of this year, we published the more detailed internal guidelines used by our review teams to enforce them for the first time.  We decided to publish these internal guidelines for two reasons.  First, the guidelines aim to help people understand where we draw the line on nuanced issues.  Second, providing this detail makes it easier for everyone, including experts in different fields, to give us feedback in order that we can improve the guidelines, and the decisions we make, over time.<br\/><br\/>We also have a safety advisory board, which comprises leading Internet safety organisations on child abuse, domestic violence and Internet safety for children and women.  Facebook consults these organisations on issues related to online safety and keeping our community safe.<br\/><br\/>For the content review process, we use a combination of artificial intelligence and reports from people to identify posts, pictures or other content that may violate our community standards.  These reports are reviewed by our community operations team, who work 24\/7 in over 50 languages all around the world.<br\/><br\/>This year, we have doubled the number of people working on our safety and security teams to 20,000.  This includes more than 7,500 content reviewers specifically.  We are also investing heavily in new technologyto help deal with problematic content on Facebook more effectively.  For example, we use technology to assist in sending reports to reviewers with the right expertise to cut out duplicate reports and to help detect and remove known terrorist propaganda and child sexual abuse images before they have been reported.  Last month, we also announced thatwe have been increasingly using artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect child nudity and previously unknown examples of child sexual exploitation imagery.  Content review on this scale has never been done, as there has never been a platform where so many people communicate in so many languages across so many countries and cultures, but we very much recognise the responsibility we have to get this right.<br\/><br\/>I am here today in the context of the committee&rsquo;s detailed scrutiny of the Bill.  Members will recall that I gave an outline of our thoughts on this topic at the 1 August hearing I attended but I am happy to be here again today as the committee considers the Bill in detail.  We understand the motivation behind the establishment of a digital safety commissioner, particularly the appeal of having an independent, statutory body that is authorised to adjudicate in cases where there is disagreement between a platform and an affected user about what constitutes a harmful communication, or to provide a path to appeal for an affected user where we have, in error, failed to uphold our own policies.  We also acknowledge the Bill's efforts to ensure its scope is not overly broad, in that an appeal to the digital safety commissioner can only be made by individuals where the specified communication concerns him or her. <br\/><br\/>We very much see the benefit in having a single office with the ability to oversee and co-ordinate efforts on the promotion of digital safety throughout communities, much of which has been captured in the Government's Action Plan for Online Safety.  It is only through this multi-pronged approach, of which education is critical, that we can begin to see positive changes in how people engage and protect themselves online. <br\/><br\/>In its 2016 report the Law Reform Commission, LRC, in addressing the nature of harmful communications, stated the following:<\/p><blockquote>While there is no single agreed definition of bullying or of cyberbullying, the well-accepted definitions include the most serious form of harmful communications, such as ... so-called &ldquo;revenge porn&rdquo;; intimidating and threatening messages, whether directed at private persons or public figures; harassment; stalking; and non-consensual taking and communication of intimate images ...<\/blockquote><p>We agree with the LRC with respect to all of these types of communication, a very stark example of which was given by Mr. John Church in his opening statement.  The sharing of non-consensual intimate images, harassment, stalking and threatening messages are all egregious forms of harmful communication and are banned both by our community standards and, in some cases, the law.  We fully support the commission's proposals to create new criminal offences to tackle non-consensual sharing of intimate images and online harassment where those offences are clearly defined and practicable for a digital environment.  We have also taken steps to step up how we tackle non-consensual sharing of intimate images that are shared on our own platform, more information on which can be found online and with respect to which I have shared the link with the committee in our opening statement.  <br\/><br\/>However, as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire outlined in his remarks today and previously, the proposed Bill is currently unclear as to what precisely constitutes a harmful communication.<\/p><p>There is no definition included in the draft Bill but it does appear from the draft that this concept is intended to be broader than content that is clearly criminal in nature, much of which has been touched on.  The exact parameters are left undefined, which could lead to uncertainty and unpredictability.  I acknowledge Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's remarks about the need to include a definition.  We welcome the opportunity to work with him on that if that is possible.  Previously, on 25 October, he mentioned that he felt that there was a need for legal certainty and we very much welcome that.<br\/><br\/>As the LTC stated in 2016, the Internet:<\/p><blockquote>enables individuals to contribute to, and shape debates on important political and social issues and within states with a repressive regime the Internet can be a particularly valuable means of allowing people to have their voices heard.  Freedom of expression is therefore the lifeblood of the Internet and needs to be protected.  <\/blockquote><p>The report continues:<\/p><blockquote>...balancing the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy is a challenging task, particularly in the digital and online context.  Proposing heavy-handed law-based measures intended to provide a remedy for victims of harmful digital communications has the potential to interfere with freedom of expression unjustifiably, and impact on the open and democratic nature of information sharing online which is the internet&rsquo;s greatest strength.<\/blockquote><p>I am aware that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is alive to these issues and has referenced these in his earlier contribution.<br\/><br\/>I will shorten my contribution because the committee is under pressure and I will finish by pointing out that Facebook has put community standards in place for the reason that we want our community to feel safe and secure when they use our platform.  We are committed to the removal of content that breaches those standards, and we are keen to continue to engage with this committee and others as the Bill moves into the next phase in the legislative process.  <br\/><br\/>I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Sweeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I call our final witnesses now: Mr. Ryan Meade, public policy and government relations manager at Google Ireland and Ms Rachel Madden, public policy analyst with Google based in San Francisco.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#N00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to participate in this session. I work with Google in Ireland as public policy and government relations manager, based in our Europe, Middle East and Africa headquarters in Dublin. I am joined by my colleague, Ms Rachel Madden, who works as a senior public policy analyst, focusing on online safety and based in our San Francisco office but hailing from Dublin.  Ms Madden's remit is global and she works closely with our product team and I am delighted she is able to join us.<\/p> <p>  Google welcomes the committee&rsquo;s efforts to engage with stakeholders in its consideration of the Bill.  We appreciate this opportunity to outline our views on a number of the issues raised in the Bill which we feel merit deeper consideration by the committee.<\/p> <p>  Before I address these issues specifically, it might be helpful to outline Google&rsquo;s actions and approach to safety online.  Google believes deeply in technology&rsquo;s ability to unlock creativity and engagement.  We also believe that technology companies have a responsibility to their users; that what is unacceptable offline should be unacceptable online; and that all users should be empowered to manage online risks and make safe choices.  We work hard behind the scenes to ensure that our users have as positive as possible an online experience as possible.  Our approach to online safety and well-being falls into three main themes: strong community guidelines; technological innovation; and working in partnership. <\/p> <p>  We are a company fundamentally committed to access to information, yet our community guidelines and content policies offer clear rules on what we do not allow on our platforms.  These often go above and beyond what is in the law and we employ thousands of staff around the world who work 24 hours a day to ensure violations of our guidelines are acted upon.<\/p> <p>  On technological innovation, Google has aimed to be the industry leader in creating and developing products and tools which help protect and empower our users, and we will continue to invest the resources necessary to ensure families can make safety choices that are right for them.<\/p> <p>  We developed YouTube Kids to offer an alternative YouTube specifically designed for young children.  It provides a restricted version of YouTube for families with built in timers, no public comments, no option to upload content and the ability for parents to block or allow access to specific channels or videos.  Last year, we launched Family Link, which enables parents to create a Google account for their child and then helps them set and tailor the digital ground rules that work for their children including on-screen time, device bedtimes and approving or blocking specific apps or functions like the camera.  Ireland was the first country outside of the US in which we launched Family Link and it has since been rolled out in 170 countries.  <\/p> <p>  My colleague, Ms Madden, will be happy to speak more about these online safety products we have developed.  At Google, collaboration has been key to ensuring our products and services offer families a positive and secure experience online.<\/p><p>That is why we work regularly with NGOs, Government and industry partners to empower parents and children with the tools and skills they need to make the most of the Internet.  Companies like Google have a responsibility to ensure not only that products and services offer a great user experience but that we work with a wide range of stakeholders and industry partners to creatively and effectively raise awareness, offer support on how to navigate technology responsibility and share technological solutions to tackle some of the toughest problems we face.  Google has invested considerable resources in these efforts and has thousands of employees across the companies working in this regard.  More detail on each of these teams is included in the written submission to the committee which has been circulated.  The submission also includes views and suggestions on the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill which are drawn from this overall approach as well as from our knowledge and experience of the practical implications associated with these issues.  We are also happy to provide a more detailed written submission if that is considered appropriate.<\/p><p> In the time available, however, I can set out briefly some of the points we believe the committee should take into consideration.  In doing so, I echo some of the things other witnesses have mentioned already.  Google welcomes the recognition of the need for ongoing awareness and education on harmful digital content.  We support an approach which includes national initiatives to educate Internet users on what it means to be a responsible online citizen, the resources and tools available to protect their privacy online and how to deal with and report cyberbullying, inappropriate content and online abuse.  Google also welcomes the consideration of additional measures by Government to address the posting online of videos or images with embarrassing and intimate content, often referred to as \"revenge porn\".  This amounts to an egregious invasion of an individual's privacy as other witnesses have already said.  It is essential that any new legal framework in Ireland reflects and is consistent with the laws governing online services in the EU, in particular the e-commerce directive.  In particular, we highlight the need for national legislation to reflect the notice and take-down procedure specifically envisaged in the e-commerce directive at articles 12 to 14 together with the prohibition on imposing general monitoring obligations contained in article 15.<\/p><p> I will not repeat the point on the need for a definition of \"harmful communication\" which was made by every other witness except to say that we agree that a clear definition would provide legal clarity for all parties.  We welcome Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's comments in that regard.  The delineation of responsibility between the digital safety commissioner and the Data Protection Commissioner merits deeper consideration as the Bill progresses, in particular in light of the Data Protection Commissioner's responsibility for dealing with complaints by individuals related to their data protection and privacy rights under the GDPR.  As a general point, we ask the committee to ensure that any legislation is future-proofed by making it as technology and platform neutral as possible.  I will finish there except to ask the committee to take those points on board as it continues its deliberations on the Bill.  The suggested changes would make the legislation more effective and increase clarity in its application.  I thank the committee for its time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Meade","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>The committee would welcome any further written submissions and detail.  That goes for all witnesses as we progress through our discussions on the Bill.  Any input in writing would be very welcome.  I will start by asking a number of questions and then open questioning to members of the committee.  Witnesses might want to note the questions.<\/p> <p>  I note to the departmental witnesses that one of the issues raised last week by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, was the need to be conscious of the nexus between the ministerial responsibility and the role of the digital safety commissioner.  Are the witnesses in a position to elaborate on that?  My understanding of what the Minister said was that he is there to put forward policy and to ensure it is delivered which would not be the role of a statutory body.  I might be mistaken but perhaps the witnesses could elaborate on it.  Has the Department had an opportunity to review Australia's Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015?  Has there been any engagement with the Department's Australian counterpart as I understand the legislation there is working well?  Common law issues arise in that jurisdiction which may be similar to issues arising here.  Will the Attorney General's evidence be made available to the committee in respect of its work on this legislation?<\/p> <p>  I turn to the witnesses from Facebook.  Facebook has said previously that it is broadly supportive in principle of the creation of a digital safety commissioner role and we welcome that.  There are some issues around the definition of \"extraterritorial\" and the effect of that on the legislation.  What has Facebook's engagement with Australia's eSafety Commissioner been or are the witnesses in a position to expand on that today?  How is the process working?<\/p><p>It seems to be working very well.  There is very little conflict.  I heard an interview with the Australian digital safety commissioner in which she said that her engagement with social media platforms has been very good and quite effective, to the point that fines are not always needed.  I do not think she has ever used fines.  Her engagement with social media platforms has been very positive.  I would welcome the views of the representatives of Facebook on the company's interaction with the Australian setup.<\/p><p> I thank Mr. Meade of Google for his comments.  I ask him to expand on his request for the Bill to be as platform-neutral and technology-neutral as possible.<\/p><p> Do the witnesses from the ISPCC have a breakdown of the most common complaints?  Can they provide any figures for the complaints which are coming before them?  Do the complaints relate to cyberbullying?  It would be useful for the committee to get a breakdown.<\/p><p> The need to define what constitutes \"harmful communication\" has been a common thread throughout this discussion.  I appreciate that it would be difficult for the witnesses to formulate a definition here.  The committee would welcome any assistance that the witnesses who are in attendance today could provide with regard to the definition as we move forward with this legislation.<\/p><p> When Ms Cooney spoke on behalf of CyberSafeIreland, she referred to \"the ethical and safe design of any new apps\" and to \"digital literacy\".  I would be concerned that if this legislation is too broad - if the digital safety commissioner has too broad a role and too wide a remit - it may be less effective.  It might be preferable to limit our endeavours in this regard to the areas of online content focused on in this legislation.  A narrow focus is needed, certainly initially.  If we need to build on that remit in future years, that could be done.  I would be cautious about extending the remit in case it becomes too wide because it would not be effective in such circumstances.<\/p><p> I would like to get the witnesses' views on that.  I have also asked for their views on what constitutes \"harmful communication\" and for any data or information that might be available to them in this regard and could be provided to the committee.  After they have responded to my questions, I will bring in Deputies Stanley and Lawless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#O00200","speaker":"1315","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I will respond to the Chairman's questions about the policy area and the Office of the Attorney General.  My colleague, Ms Quill, will answer the Chairman's questions about engagement and cover off the Australian e-commissioner angle.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman has rightly said, the role of the Minister and the Department is to look at the policy context at national and European levels.  Our job is to set legislation in a broad policy context.  There are many examples of areas in which external implementation bodies have been established.  There is a great deal of European legislation.  Reference has been made to the audiovisual media services directive, which is coming down the tracks for us.  When that is finalised at the end of this month, our job will be to consult on the online safety aspects of the directive and on the co-regulation of video-sharing platforms.  We will look at what the Commission has set out and we will work with the Minister to figure how that will be transposed.<\/p> <p>  I will set out the choices here.  We must choose to have either secondary or primary legislation.  We have to decide what the national regulatory authority will be.  We have not made up our minds on that.  We will have to speak to the Minister.  He will make that decision.  That will be an important component of this process.  We will also have to decide how we will transpose the requirements of the regulation.  That is broadly how we will do things in this area.<\/p> <p>  Many speakers have alluded to the fact that there are many players in the area of online safety.  The Department of Justice and Equality has a role in respect of any content that relates to terrorism.  It manages the transpositions in that area.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has a role in respect of e-commerce.  The online world is fairly complicated.  The broad policy context is certainly put in place by Government Departments.<\/p> <p>  I can tell the Chairman in response to her second question that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, who is still relatively new in the job, asked us to write to the Office of the Attorney General to get its advice on certain aspects of the Bill.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has recognised, some of it is quite complicated.  We have sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General on aspects of the Bill that have been mentioned, including the definition of a \"digital service undertaking\".<\/p><p>We have considered how it interacts with the e-commerce directive and how matters involving entities outside the State would be enforced.  We have sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General in that regard but will have to ask it whether such advice could be shared as matters such as legal privilege must be considered.  We are happy to ascertain whether the advice may be shared and will revert to the committee in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>On the Australian office for digital safety, a key aspect worth bearing in mind is the different legal frameworks within which we operate, particularly in the context of our membership of the European Union.  The e-commerce directive 2000 sets out the limitations on legal liability that apply to digital service undertakings.  As Ms Cronin pointed out, that is an issue on which we have sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  It must be recognised that there are differences in the legal framework which may impact on the capacity of an office in this jurisdiction to operate in the same way as a similar office in Australia.  That is probably the key element to bear in mind when considering the system in operation there.  In addition, aspects of the Australian office for digital safety focus solely on children rather than the broader focus on all citizens - while recognising the particular vulnerability of children - as proposed in the Bill.

Ms Quill is correct insofar as the last update I received stated that the commissioner there has never used her official powers, although there is much consultation and ongoing work with the platforms.  When I last spoke to my colleague on this issue, I knew of early anecdotal evidence to suggest that the office was not necessarily operating in the way one might have anticipated.  For example, some reports regarded hacked accounts rather than specific instances of harmful communication.  In other instances, complaints were not first reported to the platforms, such as Instagram and Facebook in our case.  Rather, the affected user went directly to the commissioner.  Obviously, we would still work with the office on such complaints but the system there was not necessarily working as envisaged.  The numbers there were quite low in its first year.  I do not know the numbers for 2017, but they probably reflect how it played out in 2016.

I do not suggest that the Bill is running the risk of being too technology-specific.  It is important to bear in mind that when framing regulation one looks at existing practices and industry players and how technology is used.  However, by its nature, technology changes.  If we were discussing legislation such as this three or four years ago, issues such as the use of ephemeral content available through Snapchat and other apps which involves content that disappears after a time might not have been considered.  That is very much a general point.  I am not suggesting that any specific provision of the Bill will limit its usefulness in the future.  However, when considering regulation in this area, ideally one would have a framework that will stand the test of time.  I ask the committee to bear that in mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Meade"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked about numbers and trends.  The ISPCC has identified some trends in this area.  We run Childline, a confidential listening service, which will probably answer approximately 1,200 calls today from children under the age of 18.  Approximately 6,000 of the 350,000 calls received by Childline last year related to online bullying.  We very often deal with the issues caused by bullying in general and our categorisation deals with behavioural issues as well as issues such as domestic abuse, sexual abuse, body image, online abuse and other bullying.<\/p><p>It causes us to look at our statistics and how we categorise it.  If one considers the use of our online platform, last year we had just less than 30,000 conversations compared to just under 4,000 ten years ago.  This is going to become an issue and I believe we will have to look at how we categorise conversations.  When one looks at trends, we often use Childline figures but we also consult our child support workers in the community who do one-to-one counselling therapeutic interventions.  We also have voluntary children's advisory committees set up.

As Mr. Church said earlier, we would encourage the committee to create a definition that is not overly broad and which is workable.  In Australia, the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015 pertains to cyberbullying but it also has quite a niche definition that covers material that is seriously threatening, seriously intimidating, seriously harassing or seriously humiliating.  New Zealand has a Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015.  New Zealand does not have an entity such as our Digital Protection Commissioner.  It has an approved agency called Netsafe.  The New Zealand legislation looks communications principles, including where a digital communication should not be threatening, intimidating or menacing, and should not be used to harass an individual.  There are several other principles also and I believe they would be a good starting point when looking to create a definition of harmful communications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Jennings"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Would Ms Cooney like to respond to that same question on harmful communications?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#R00300","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I agree with my colleague that we should look at the existing definitions in the Australian and New Zealand context that have been approved and are working in practise, and that we should look to have something similar here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Alex Cooney"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Did Ms Cooney want to come in on something else?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#R00500","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Reference was made to digital education and safety design.

There is a feeling and a view being propagated out there that the Internet has empowered everybody now that we can connect with people all over the world.  According to Facebook there are 1.4 billion users on Facebook daily.  I believe the Internet has had a hugely disempowering effect in some ways.  CyberSafeIreland highlighted the UK survey where adults and children felt powerless to address online safety issues.<\/p><p>If they are powerless to address their own safety they are seriously disempowered.  It is useful that Ms Cooney highlighted that and the insufficient oversight today.  The example given by the ISPCC of the 15 year old girl is shocking.  That is a life and death issue because she feels she wants to kill herself.  Facebook and Google talk about their online communities.  There are no communities of 1.4 billion people.  Communities are a different entity and it is a misuse of the word by Facebook and Google.  In real communities we know, unfortunately, of cases like this where lives have been taken over issues such as revenge pornography and bullying of young people online.  That is the context for the important Bill that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has brought forward.  <\/p><p> Google highlighted the importance of education and said that it alone could solve the problem of online bullying.  That is what it seems to indicate in its presentation.  Education of itself will not stop somebody who wants to misuse the Internet.  That is a huge challenge for Google and Facebook and for us as legislators to deal with.  Will the witnesses from Google address that issue in more depth because stating that education alone could deal with this does not do justice to or deal properly with this?  We will need strict criteria and legislation and means of enforcing that.  <\/p><p> Facebook says it has 1.4 billion users every day.  On the last occasion it was here, in August if I remember correctly, it stated that it has 20,000 people moderating what is online.  I was surprised by that number but it shows the extent of the problem, the challenge and difficulty of trying to moderate what appears on the platform.  Does this show the witnesses that this problem is nearly impossible to deal with?  That is probably one of the biggest challenges facing the company, us as legislators and governments around the world.  Does that highlight the need for direct State intervention?<\/p><p> In its presentation Facebook highlighted the need for freedom of expression.  As somebody who campaigned against section 31 of the Broadcasting Act 1960 throughout the 1980s and 1990s which was repealed by Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, Michael D. Higgins, one of the best things he ever did, I do not think we want to limit freedom of expression too much.  A line, however, has to be drawn around safety and what should be allowed.  Do the witnesses from Facebook and Google believe that it should be left to private companies and corporate entities to define what should be tolerated in terms of freedom of expression or is it for government bodies to do that? <\/p><p> The Law Reform Commission's definition of offences refers to pornography, intimidating and threatening messages whether directed at public figures or private individuals, harassment, stalking or non-consensual taking and communication of intimate images.<\/p><p>What role should Facebook and Google have in addressing the issue of fake news and the spread of misinformation about individuals?  Politicians have been targeted with this type of misinformation in the past, and, in some cases, it has had detrimental effects.  Such misinformation included false accusations against public figures.  Should that be included in the definition of \"harmful material\"?  <\/p><p> The Department mentioned that certain minimum standards would be set.  As a member state of the European Union should we be entitled to add to that and threaten more stringent regulations?  Does the Department feel that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's Bill is in any way counter to EU law, and if so in what way?  <\/p><p> My final question is for Facebook or the Department.  Who should fund the office of the digital safety commissioner?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#R00800","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I hope I did not give the impression that we believe that education alone is a silver bullet in this case; I apologise if that impression came through in any of the presentations.

We do not allow abusive videos or comments on our platform.  Beneath every video and beside every comment on YouTube there is a \"flagging\" option which allows anyone to report content for review.

The Deputy is right that it is a big challenge because content review has never been done on this scale.  On the need for direct State intervention, we receive millions of reports every week and if the State were asked to step in and do what we, Google and others do, it would be challenging to say the least.<\/p><p> There was a question on freedom of expression and whether it should be for Facebook to determine what should be left up and what should be taken down.  That is an important part of the conversation.  As Ms Quill said, we operate within the e-commerce directive in the area of illegal content and if we are made aware of illegal content on our platform, we have to act expeditiously to remove it.  In other jurisdictions it is different, such as in Germany where the NetzDG Act covers illegal hate speech.  In Ireland, it is left to us to discover what is illegal and many people have an issue with being left in a quasi-judicial position in this respect.  We have a short period to determine what is illegal and there is a tendency to err on the side of caution, given the exposure companies have if they do not remove the content over time.  If there is legal exposure for companies for pushing the boundaries on what constitutes freedom of expression, we could end up with the mass removal of perfectly legal content which may offend, shock or disturb but is not necessarily illegal.<\/p><p> On false accusations against public figures, we were part of the high-level working group on false news convened by the European Commission over the summer.  This issue has travelled some distance since then and the focus now is more on electoral integrity.  We have made a number of commitments as part of that and the Commissioner, Vra Jourov&aacute; announced the agreed outputs in mid-October.  We have undertaken to introduce additional tools with respect to electoral integrity this side of the European elections and we are working hard on this, which is in addition to the tool for viewing ads which we rolled out in April.  This allows one to see any advertisement which an advertiser is running at the same time and addresses the idea of dark-outs.<\/p><p> If false accusations against public figures ever drift into defamatory territory, a clear process is in place.

There would not be anything preventing national law in this area but it would have to respect the European framework and the Irish legal framework.  One of the issues on which we have sought clarity from the Attorney General's office is in respect of the Irish legal framework with respect, for example, to whether a body such as the proposed office of the digital safety commissioner could exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction as a matter of general principle where there is not a universally accepted principle of international law.  In other words, in the case of something in respect of which there is not an international or a European norm, can the State reasonably impose its jurisdiction on a body that is established outside the State?  That would be one aspect to bear in mind in this regard.<\/p> <p>  In terms of adding extra national measures, we can do that but they would have to abide, as Ms Sweeney and others mentioned, by the European framework relating to the e-commerce directive.  If content is illegal, it is provided for under that mechanism.  If somebody brings to the attention of a platform a matter relating to illegal content, that platform has an obligation to take down the content.  If a matter is not illegal but might be considered to be harmful in some way - issues relating to cyberbullying might fall into that category in some instances whereby, for example, children are bullying each other online but that may be extremely harmful content, for example, revenge porn or whatever, that might be categorised as criminal in nature - it is tricker to deal with precisely because it is not a criminal matter.  It may be harmful but it is trickier to deal with because there is not a universally accepted definition and it is not provided for under the e-commerce legislation.<\/p><p>If the definition as set out in this Bill sticks to criminal acts that are provided for, or are going to be provided for, it is probably on clearer legal ground than if it is going into less clear territory.

This is one of three pieces of legislation to be dealt with in this Oireachtas term.  I congratulate Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on proposing, drafting and bringing it forward.  Deputy Howlin has a Bill on harmful offences and I have my Bill on social media regulation, on which some of the witnesses have been in attendance already and some are due to come before us in the near future.  There has been a focus on the online space in this Oireachtas which is welcome.  It is fast-moving and has been said already, some of the hearings that we had during the summer are almost obsolete now because of the events that have happened and moved on so quickly where steps have been taken both voluntarily and otherwise by the main stakeholders which is good to see.<\/p> <p>  It is a fast-moving space and one feature that those three pieces of legislation have in common is that they all relate to attempts at regulation.  We probably all agree - although the witnesses may not - that self-regulation is not desirable or ideal.  While it is welcome that attempts have been made at different times, it is always stronger if an independent third party body can try to impose that regulation.<\/p> <p>  On the specifics of the Bill, it looks  good, where I have read through it a number of times, as well as having followed the Second Stage debate.  Some of the feedback from today and previously goes to the heart of definitions and the devil is in the detail.  The trick with drafting is always to get it precise enough that it can be enforced but broad enough, as Mr. Meade has said, to be technology-agnostic or platform-agnostic, in order that it can be long-lived and robust enough that, in five or ten years time, it can still be applicable.  <\/p> <p>  There has been a lot of talk about the definition of harmful communications.  It is probably one of the main definitions that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has indicated he may want to draft or fine tune as we move towards the next Stages.<\/p> <p>  One interesting matter that also got a mention in the submissions to the Law Reform Commission's reports and in previous studies in this area - the commission's principal report on this issue was in early 2016, I believe, to which I made a submission - was section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  This is what we call the classic harassment, which is what we might call the pre-Internet harassment.  This would be the old stalking offence of knocking on someone's door or sending them postcards or harassing in more traditional ways.<\/p> <p>  There is a school of thought legally that section 10 could apply to the Internet as well.  The stumbling block to date has been that the offence or activity must be repeated to bring it under the definition of section 10.  Making a phone call or knocking on somebody's front door in a one-off action may not qualify in the traditional world.  Doing it ten times or 100 times would qualify.  There is a school of thought that says the nature of the Internet is something that is shared, so anything could be posted once, but it could be shared 100 if not 1,000 or 100,000 times.  That might bring it under the definition of section 10, which would mean the action was repeated which might be sufficient to bring a prosecution as it stands.<\/p> <p>  My first question is whether any of the witnesses has a view of this as to the existing legislation like section 10 of Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act or other legislation that may be out there, and are these sufficient or adequate?  Has the DPP or any other agency brought charges of this nature to date?  Have these types of issues come before the courts or received a sanction and, if so, under what legislation?  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' expertise.  If these issues have not arisen then what governance is in place?  Is it the case that there is a vacuum of governance?  If the existing legislation does not apply or has not led to any charges, what exactly is controlling the Internet space at the moment?  If the answer is nothing then that is very worrying but is all the more reason we need to accelerate this Bill and others like it.<\/p> <p>  Moving on and staying with the Bill, it is very positive, strong and a very good idea.  One thing that it does not appear to do is to create new offences.  This may be deliberate.<\/p><p>Deputy Howlin's Bill creates some offences.  Perhaps the legislation can be dovetailed so that the offences in other legislation would come under it.  In terms of sanctions, there has to be a carrot and a stick.  While there is provision in the Bill to seek an injunction in the Circuit Court, which is useful, the Data Protection Commissioner has powers to bring prosecutions in court as does the Companies Registration Office.  Perhaps that is something to be considered in Committee Stage amendments, if we get to that point.  There are many examples of statutory agencies which can bring a non-Garda prosecution.  Different Departments have similar powers.  I might come up with some amendments in that regard myself, but I could also work with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  It might be worth adding to it.  On the carrot and stick approach, the concept is that the digital safety commissioner role would not only involve enforcement but would also provide an independent and objective agency in debates like the one on the digital age of consent which raged a couple of months ago and which I do propose to reopen today.  It got quite controversial at times.  An external agency unconnected to any of the platforms or to any political party would have the status to make recommendations on issues like that.  It would receive a good hearing and get good traction across the board.  There is a great opportunity, as envisaged in the Bill, for the commissioner to perform that advocacy and expert role, which would be useful.<\/p><p> To recap, I ask about legislation.  There is a question mark over section 10 and whether it could be applied at the moment.  Are there existing legislative provisions which apply?  If not, are we in a total vacuum?  What is the current legislative framework around these kinds of offences, if they even exist at the moment, and whether they can be prosecuted?  What has been the experience to date?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#W00200","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Those questions are mainly for the Department.

We supported that Bill.  Section 10 is out of date and needs to be updated because it does not take account of the very significant changes which have happened.  In relation to offences, Deputy Howlin's Bill and mine had their origins in the LRC paper published in early 2016.  In drafting the legislation on foot of the proposals of the commission, I was conscious of the fact that this is a specific proposal to establish an office and provide it with a remit.  While I am open-minded about it, I am not sure this Bill is a suitable place to update section 10, notwithstanding my support for the principle of updating the law on criminal offences and on creating new offences.  However, doing so in this Bill might complicate the work of establishing an office, providing it with a remit, and creating codes of practice and national minimum digital safety standards.  While I am open-minded, my initial view is that introducing criminal offences in the Bill would enter into the area of creating criminal justice legislation.  As such, our work could become complicated.<\/p> <p>  The argument is also relevant to the view I take on the definition of \"harmful communication\".  I spoke on last occasion we met about what that might involve.  I outlined that in general it would include distribution or publication of an intimate image of another person taken without consent, or threatening to do so; taking or distribution or publication of an intimate image of another without consent; distribution or publication of intimate material where it seriously interferes with privacy or causes alarm, distress or harm to the other person; the distribution or publication of a threatening, false, indecent or obscene message to or about another person for the purpose of causing alarm, distress or harm to the other person, or where it is done persistently; and persistently communicating with a person in circumstances in which it seriously interferes with the other person's privacy or which cause alarm, distress or harm and any other inchoate behaviours related to the same.<\/p><p>I am working on the drafting with regard to how it would be structured.  We should be looking at behaviours.  I take on board the point made about consistency with the e-commerce directive.  When we ask the commissioner to take down material, we should outline to him or her, and the providers, the behaviours.  We should not ask them to adjudicate at the point of takedown on whether something is illegal because there are behaviours that are close to the line.  They might have to be removed quickly and for the person involved to get redress.  We should look at behaviours rather than seek to state that certain matters are illegal and that the illegal content should be removed.  They are required to do that anyway under the e-commerce directive.  We should target behaviours.  I agree with the point made about an independent external agency.  It is important and it is the principle on which we are all largely agreed.  I made the point at the previous committee meeting that the organisation is constantly in communication with the providers and platforms but it also receives complaints when they are unhappy with how the providers and platforms are addressing matters.  They will be the first to know of the changes in abuse and harassment and all these harmful communications.  They will be in a strong position to advise Government on any future criminal justice or policy approaches for example in the Department of Education and Skills.  All of that kind of stuff changes.  The curriculum might change with the NCCA.  It would be in a strong position to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#X00500","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Does anyone else want to comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#Y00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Before we move on, the representatives of the platforms would know if they have been before the courts.

As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, I think it was the ambition of the LRC, with its draft Bill which Deputy Howlin has moved forward, to make it more explicit.  As I said earlier, we would be supportive of it where it is clearly defined and practical for the digital environment.

Mr. Church gave the horrific example of the young girl whose images were shared by a former boyfriend.  It is shocking.<\/p><p>There is wider concern that during this ten-year increase in the demand for online services, there has also been a significant increase in the incidence of depression and other psychological problems among our young people.  A lot of reports I read, and I must admit I have spent the past hour frantically reading as much as I could on the Internet via my own device, show a correlation between the increasing levels of depression, anxiety and other mental health difficulties among young people and the increase in the time young people are online.  The harm might not come just from the obvious graphic terrible example but in all sorts of subtle ways, such as exclusion or other mechanisms that affect mental health.  Do the witnesses make this direct connection?  Everything I have read from the various psychology sources shows an increasing level of depression, anxiety and mental health problems, particularly among young girls it would seem, so that we can make the correlation with the increased use of online services particularly on mobile phones.<\/p><p> Things have developed a lot recently with the passing last month by the European Parliament of the revision of the audiovisual media services directive.  I presume it is a foregone conclusion and that the Council will approve it before Christmas.  I understand that approximately 80% of all online content is video.  Did Ms Cronin state in her contribution that we are looking for regulatory bodies to manage some of this?  Given that the BAI is involved in the audiovisual media regulatory environment, and given that the report from the European Parliament had similar issues of concern to what we have here and it very strongly focused on the effect of online media services on young children, if we are looking for an institutional body to house regulation, the BAI might be suitable.  We could look at the Data Protection Commissioner or creating an new agency but the BAI might be best placed, given that it is so versed in audiovisual media.  What is the difference between online media and broadcast media?  For young people the vast majority is online.  I am interested to hear the views of the witnesses on this.<\/p><p> I am keen to hear from the companies on last month's report of the European Parliament.  Paragraphs 20 and 21 of the report call for the use of encryption and much greater parental control mechanisms to protect young children.  Paragraph 21 states personal data of minors processed in the framework of technical child protection measures should not be used for commercial purposes.  Does this not call into question the companies' entire commercial approach in the processing of minor's data in particular?  It must change.  As Tim Berners-Lee said yesterday, the companies are damaging the Internet and causing a threat to it and all the immense benefits it brings, and their commercial model must change.  How can the companies live up to the direction from the European Parliament in the new audiovisual media services directive if they do not know with absolute certainty the age of the child being dealt with?  We have heard in previous evidence that the current mechanisms they have in place clearly do not do this and the companies cannot tell if a child is 13, 15, 16 or eight.  They can say they do but they do not have effective commercial mechanisms to do it.  Does the new directive mean they must set in place new mechanisms to guarantee knowing the age of the minors who are on their networks so they can live by the commitment not to use the data for commercial purposes?  How can they do this if they do not know whether the person is a minor?  In this regard, Ms Cronin said age verification looks like one of the key new regulatory requirements we will see.<\/p><p>I do not have the exact wording but if I read her submission correctly the inclusion of age verification may well be one of the new regulatory measures we will seek to put in place.  I would welcome that, given the evidence Mr. Church and others have presented here on the health implications of the use of some of these services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#Y00600","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I will respond first.  The short answer is that there is no research to prove that correlation.  However, as I said earlier, we take many calls every day.  It is 1.05 p.m. now and Childline has probably received over 500 calls today.  I am only three months in the job so I am new to this and much of my time was spent listening and shadowing some of the calls.  I only relayed one case example today but there are hundreds.  What we are seeing, as well as from talking to the volunteers online, are behaviours that are causing significant issues for the child.  As the Deputy described, they are subtle things such as exclusion by not being invited to a party or not being part of a WhatsApp group, which in effect is bullying.  I mentioned earlier that we will have to start considering how we should categorise those calls.  If a child mentions in a confidential call that he or she is subject to online bullying, that is categorised as online bullying but far more conversations we are having with children every day are about issues they are having relating to online issues.  We would certainly love to see far more research around that and whether it is a correlation.  Intuitively, I would agree with the Deputy but there is no research that I know of to show that.<\/p> <p>  I also mentioned that we are seeing a slight decrease in telephone calls.  Incidentally, it is young boys who are calling online, which is interesting.  One would tend to think it would be girls calling because they are sometimes better at conversing, but the boys appear to find the online calls a great source of support.  We are seeing a switch from calls to online chat and this has forced us to upgrade our online platform, which we are launching next week.  With the launch of that platform we can get into many more in-depth conversations and that is when we will start gathering a great deal of research around this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018110600002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Church"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I regularly talk to teachers and principals and they are definitely seeing the fallout in the classroom, with children coming in tired or falling out over cyberbullying incidents or gaming.  There is a clear dynamic.  I spoke to a principal yesterday in preparation for anti-bullying week next week and he said that in the ten years he has been a principal the change has been stark.  Obviously, in the early years as a principal he was dealing with bullying but the amount of online instances he now has to deal with is just incredible.  That has an impact on the schools each day.  As our survey showed, teachers are dealing with this in the classroom all the time.  Anecdotally, therefore, there is good evidence.<\/p> <p>  A survey published in the UK this year found that girls who were using social media at ten years of age for an hour a day are far more likely to have social and emotional problems at 15 years of age.  That was a five year longitudinal study, so some evidence is starting to emerge.  The children we are talking to are all in primary school and they largely value popularity over privacy.  They do not really understand the ramifications of sharing all sorts of things such as dick pictures, intimate images and children being told to kill themselves because of the colour of their skin or because of the way they look.  There is a great deal of harmful communication and the online-offline balance - how one treats people in real life versus how one treats them online - is not well understood.

As he said it will either be a new one or an existing one.  Clearly the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, is in the frame for that.  Because this is such a new area, we in the Department are taking the opportunity to travel and meet with many other member states to get a sense of their approach.  It is a big area.  The audiovisual media services, AVMS, directive will clearly be of particular significance to Ireland because of the platforms we have here.  We are therefore keen to learn from other member states about how they are managing.  We met with representatives from the UK, which I know is about to depart.  We will also be going to the Nordic countries.  We really want to go very broadly on this to make sure that we get it right because how to regulate this space is a very significant decision.<\/p><p> On age verification, the directive itself refers to protecting minors and the general public from certain audiovisual content and about protecting the general public from content, including advertising, the dissemination of which is a criminal offence.  These offences are terrorist-related offences, child sexual abuse material offences, and offences of racism and xenophobia.  The model proposed in the directive is one of co-regulation between the platforms and a regulatory body.  Part of that means that we will have to look at age verification and parental controls, because the Deputy is right, the directive does refer to minors.

There is not a huge amount of research on the well-being front.  We recently commissioned some in the UK through a think tank called Demos.  One of the main findings coming out of that research and other research is that it is less about the amount of time than about what is done with that time.  Passive scrolling of content can be damaging in some cases whereas meaningful interactions can actually boost a sense of well-being.  There is, however, a dearth of research in the area and we are trying to address that.  It can be seen that Instagram in particular has a very strong focus on well-being.  It has a whole section dedicated to it.  It has introduced certain tools to help one limit one's screen time and to keep track of what one is doing.  Apple has a report which one might see flash up on one's phone if one uses an iPhone.  This report gives one a sense of how many notifications and how much screen time on average one has had per day.  Facebook is also looking to roll out tools based on time spent online and well-being.  I had thought that they would be rolled out by now.

That is the reason this legislation is largely focused on the principles, procedures, structures and so on rather than necessarily going into specific technologies or forms of communication with respect to defining - as we have to do - what is harmful communication and also in terms of the harm that it does.

The extra-territorial effect of this Bill is not particularly radical.  It is limited to situations where the communication affects an Irish person ordinarily resident in the State and the means of communication used in connection with such harmful communication is within the control of an undertaking or company established under the law of the State or where such harmful communications affect an Irish person ordinarily resident in the State where the means of communication are within the control of an undertaking established under the law of another state and where a court established in this State would have jurisdiction to give notice of service in that respect.

It would be desirable for any significant platform undertaking to be seen to be complaint and that users, and particularly parents, would be aware that it was compliant.  If an undertaking is based outside this jurisdiction and it wants people in Ireland to use it, it will have to develop standards to reach the level of a certificate of compliance.

More importantly, it does not reflect the importance of the referendum vote that took place on 25 May.  This should be about access because that is what people voted for on 25 May.  As I said on Second Stage, the only reference to access in the Bill is in the offences section.  I do not think people voted for access to be an offence.  They voted for access because they want women to be in a position to avail of access.  The amendment will not materially change a word that comes after it but it will show the intention of the legislation and its purpose, which is to ensure that women have access to terminations.  I am interested to hear any arguments against it because, as is the case with all of my amendments - and I might as well say this at the outset - I believe it is very reasoned, fair, balanced and proportionate.

I understand what they are trying to do.  I also voted for access.  We all voted for access to a service that is not currently available to women who have to travel as a result.  I include in that regard the nine women who will travel and the three women who will access the abortion pill today.  Those of us who voted to repeal the eighth amendment in such large numbers voted for access and I fully accept that.  The Bill is entirely about access.  It is about ensuring that, within the regulated parameters the Oireachtas put in place and published in a general scheme before the referendum was held, access to the relevant services can now be facilitated.  That is the very reason we are trying to pass the Bill, which will enable women to have access to termination of pregnancy services in a safe manner in their own communities and free of charge as part of the universal Irish public health service.  The key provisions of the Bill are the same as those of the draft general scheme that was published prior to the referendum and the updated scheme published in July.<\/p> <p>  The legislation provides for terminations to be carried out in cases where there is a risk of serious harm to the health of the pregnant woman or where there is a condition present that is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth, and without specific indication up to 12 weeks.  The Title to the Bill has been drafted to reflect the language used in the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Act 2018, which amended the Constitution in order that provision may be made in law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.  The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill we are debating is the means by which the Oireachtas will now use its new constitutional authority under the provision.  Using the language of the new Article 40.3.3&deg; in the legislation that seeks to give effect to the provision provides the necessary consistency and clarity in our law.  Similarly, the Long Title has also been worded by the drafters to reflect the provisions and the purpose of the Bill.  This is a technical legal Title.  I accept that Deputy O'Reilly has said quite simply that she does not envisage it in any way changing the substance of the Bill.  I very much accept that argument.  I appreciate her intention in trying to change the wording but to do so would not be in line with the legal requirements and the advice I have received on the importance of keeping the Title to the Bill consistent with the wording in the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#B00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I will reflect on the point Deputy Joan Collins has made.  My only concern relates to not wanting to put wording in the legislation which, from her perspective and mine, would be an accurate reflection of what the people voted for but which would not tally with or match that contained in the Constitution.  I need to take very seriously the legal advice available to me.  None of us wants to do anything that would accidentally undermine the legal certainty of the legislation.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 3 refers to inserting the word \"abortion\" into the Bill.  We had quite a lengthy debate on this matter on Second Stage and people made the point that the Bill is about providing abortion in Ireland and asked why that word is not included in the Bill.  The word \"abortion\" is not in the Constitution either.  When the Oireachtas decided on the wording it wished to include in the Constitution, it decided- and then the people ultimately decided - to use the phrase \"termination of pregnancy\".  The legal advice available to me is that we need to align the wording in our legislation with that contained in the Constitution.  If we were to include the word \"abortion\", the time to do so was when we were amending the Constitution.  Providing absolute clarity and consistency between the words in the Constitution and those in the legislation is the legal advice available to me that I feel is important to share with the committee.  Obviously, the Bill will provide access to abortion services in Ireland that are not available today and that certainly would not have been available so long as the eighth amendment remained in the Constitution.<\/p> <p>  The wording and the definition have also been considered from a medical perspective and this is also important.  These are not just legal arguments, although the legal arguments from my perspective are deemed to be strong.  It is also about ensuring clarity for medical practitioners practising the field.  To define \"termination of pregnancy\" in any way other than as currently done in the Bill could have implications for obstetric practice.  To be very clear, the purpose of the legislation is not to regulate obstetric practice.  That is a much broader discussion.  It is simply to make sure that we regulate the provision of the termination of pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  In the context of references to ending pregnancy, on not all occasions that an abortion takes place is a pregnancy being ended because, of course, there can be multiple births.  We can have a situation where there are twins involved.  For a number of reasons, this wording has been considered very carefully.  The phrase \"termination of pregnancy\" matches the wording in the Constitution.  We have engaged with medical practitioners in respect of the wording, which provides them with a degree of certainty that other formulations might not provide in terms of multiple births.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#B00800","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>In order of indication, we will hear from Deputies O'Reilly, Br&iacute;d Smith, Durkan and Coppinger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#B00900","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I fully appreciate the point the Minister is making regarding the inclusion of the word \"abortion\".

I am struggling to understand why access cannot be part of it.  I accept the Minister's arguments - I do not necessarily like them - but it is about the inclusion of the word access.  Based on everything the Minister said, I thought by the end he would agree with me because everything he has said indicates that this is about access.  I honestly do not see why it cannot include it.  I do not want to put words in the Minister's mouth, but if I hear what he says correctly, there is not an outright refusal on the inclusion of the word access.  Is it possible for us to look at that or is it the case that he is saying flat out no to all of them?

This Bill will open up access to a range of abortion services in this country that our women need, deserve and have been denied for far too long under the eighth amendment.  That is what this Bill will do.  It means that the women who travel today, in many cases, will be able to access abortions in their own communities, from their own health service and as part of the universal health service, that is to say they will not have to pay for it.  There is no hidden agenda there.  However, when I have had conversations with some women, particularly on fatal foetal abnormalities, the sensitivity of language is important.  Some of these pregnancies were terminated.  Different people who have been through different experiences have a different perspective on the wording we use but there is no disputing at all what this Bill is endeavouring to do.  However, the word \"abortion\" is not in the Constitution.  We passed the wording termination of pregnancy and all I am trying to do is ensure that the law that we pass aligns with that wording because, God knows, there have been far too many grey areas in this whole area of law for far too long, which has resulted in an awful lot of pain, misery and court challenges.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#C00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>It is important that we stick as closely as possible to what we told the people when the referendum was put before them and on which they voted.

I hope that by the time we pass the legislation, it will include a review clause.  Including such a clause is prudent.  We will have different views on the timeline for a review, but we are starting a service that has not been provided in this country before.  We all know the legacy.  From a patient safety perspective, it is essential that in establishing a new or expanded service we provide for the highest possible standard of care from its initiation.<\/p> <p>  There is very limited access to termination of pregnancy in this country, which overwhelmingly is delivered in the hospital setting by a consultant obstetrician, a highly experienced, qualified medical person.  The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill does restrict the provision of the service to medical practitioners but on much expanded grounds.  It also expands the definition of medical practitioners who may be involved to all those registered on the Medical Council's register of medical practitioners.  Therefore, in the legislation we are expanding the range of doctors who may be involved.<\/p> <p>  From an international perspective, it is not an unusual requirement.  In Europe France, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland and Germany require a doctor to be involved in carrying out the procedure, but the Deputy is correct, there are other countries where that is not the case.  I do not disagree with her fundamental point that there are other countries where other healthcare professionals are involved.  However, at this stage of the legislation and in trying to embed a service and ensure we will have adequate numbers of doctors signed-up to get it up and running, medical practitioners are the most appropriate personnel to deliver the service.  Whereas in the future it may be possible to contemplate allowing termination of pregnancy services to be delivered by medical personnel other than medical practitioners, it is my considered view at this time that we are taking initial and significant steps towards expanding services and that the most appropriate personnel to deliver the service are medical practitioners.  Where the Deputy and I differ is that the Deputy would like to give the Minister of the day the power to do this without recourse to the Oireachtas.  I propose that the Minister of the day have the power, through the review clause which I hope will be passed by the committee later today.

A Google search would reveal a couple of hundred examples of it having been repeatedly stated that this would be a doctor-led service.  Last night, I spoke to a midwife about this issue.  She stated that there has been no consultation with midwives regarding the provision of abortion in Ireland.  If we were to go down that route, it would be logical and good governance and legislative practice that people would be consulted before being tasked with a role.  Indeed, the lack of consultation with doctors is also a difficulty.  Approximately 650 doctors have stated that they wanted to have proper consultation on this issue before the legislation proceeded.  On that basis, it would be better not to widen the range of medical professionals who can provide this particular service.

We are calling for it to be expanded to other professionals within the health system.  Such a practice is not unusual.  The point is that we are innovating and bringing in legislation that should be state-of-the-art and up to date.  For example, in France and other countries, midwives participate in abortions.  Scientific research has proven that one does not need a doctor in order to have an abortion.  Some ten people a day leave the country to procure an abortion but up to five others use abortion pills obtained through telemedicine sites.  We have heard testimony in that regard and I will not repeat the points that were made.  It is important because we need to emphasise that abortion is one of the simplest medical procedures.  Those who oppose it make out that that is not the case.  However, as members are aware, the majority of abortions take place in the first trimester.  Research has proven that abortions carried out using an abortion pill obtained through a telemedicine site and supervised by a doctor are as safe as other types of abortion even though the woman is not directly examined by a doctor.  The WHO has given its backing to that view.  That is important because we are bringing in legislation which is introducing levels of barriers and bureaucracy that may not be needed.  Some members who have spoken to the amendment are opposed to this aspect being broadened because they want to make out that abortion is harrowing and very complex.  However, all those who study these matters know that having an abortion is safer than having a baby.  It would be preferable for the Bill to be in line with what has been scientifically proven, which is that a competent midwife or other health practitioner should be permitted to perform abortions.  The five people in Ireland who will take an abortion pill in their bedrooms today will be carrying out a DIY abortion with advice from a doctor based in the Netherlands or another part of the world.  We do not need to over-complicate this.  Of course, we agree that the procedure should be carried out under the auspices of our health service.  Everybody should be able to go to their own doctor but that does not mean that a doctor must be present for the abortion.  I have often gone to a doctor's surgery and been seen by a nurse.  We should recognise that that is best practice worldwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#J00700","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Midwives for Choice and the Midwives Association of Ireland have made very comprehensive submissions on the matter which members may benefit from reading thoroughly.

Although I do not want to put words in his mouth, I assume that even if he rejects the amendment the Minister would not agree with that either.  Nurses and midwives very safely and competently deliver healthcare in a range of settings.  Our amendment does not seek to expand the provision of the service to nurses and midwives by tomorrow morning.  We are trying to make available the option for that to be done because they are a group of front-line healthcare professionals who feel that they have been left out of this debate to some extent.  It is about expanding the service once it is bedded in and ensuring that anyone who can competently provide a service that women need is empowered to provide that service.  It would not necessarily happen overnight but I am conscious that such practitioners are being precluded from providing such services.  The amendment aims to make that option available.

The reason for that was to ensure the highest level of medical expertise was made available at the earliest stage to a woman who might be in a crisis pregnancy or who had concerns about the pregnancy in whatever shape or form.  We should remain true to that.  We should not run off in different directions at this stage, improving what we said at the time.  We did not say it so we cannot afford to uphold it.

A GP-led service is a service where one rings up and makes an appointment at one's GP clinic.  As we move towards Sl&aacute;intecare, and hopefully we will, it will mostly be in primary care centres located in communities.  It could also be in an IFPA clinic or a Well Woman Centre.  The GP is the person with whom one makes the appointment but one might need a cervical smear, injection, flu jab or some kind of diabetes check-up and one will often see the nurse.  The practitioner runs the clinic and the nurse may deliver the service.  The GP still leads the clinical service but another practitioner carries out the administration of the service one has attended for.  We all get smears taken by nurses by and large and not by doctors but it is done in a doctor's clinic.  I understand, and I think the public understood, that a GP-led service will not necessarily mean one must see the GP.  I would have thought the Minister and the Department would welcome the broadening of that definition given the crisis in GP services.  There is a drastic shortage of GPs.  We also have nurses in clinics who can do this work.  Midwives work in Well Woman Centres and for the IFPA.  It is sensible to extend the definition now and not later so women can have access to abortion.

People should not make out that there will be a big change from the current regime.  In 1967 when the Abortion Act was being drafted in Britain, a provision relating to two doctors was inserted.  That is not necessary now because things have moved on so much.  With the abortion pill we knew it would be much more simple.  I will refer to the phrase \"surgical abortion\".

As I outlined when discussing the first grouping, Deputies have proposed changing the definition of \"termination of pregnancy\" contained in the Bill to include the use of the term \"abortion\" or to refer instead to the ending of pregnancy using a medical or surgical procedure.<\/p> <p>  On the language used in the Bill, the 36th amendment of the Constitution inserted a new Article 40.3.3o, which reads: \"Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.\"  This Bill is the means by which the Oireachtas exercises its new constitutional authority.  In this way, the Oireachtas is carrying out the will of the people as expressed in the result of the referendum.  Using the language of the new article in the legislation seeks to give effect to the provisions and provides clarity and consistency in our law.  By referring to \"termination of pregnancy\" rather than \"abortion\", the Bill seeks to maintain that consistency and avoid any potential doubt or unintended legal consequence that could flow from departing from that language.<\/p> <p>  This is not just a legal argument, although my legal concerns about changing the language are real and genuine.  The wording of the definition has also been considered from a medical perspective with a view to ensuring clarity for medical practitioners practising in this field.  I will reference a letter signed by many doctors that I know was sent to the committee last night.  It makes a number of constructive suggestions about how to improve the legislation.  I am sure that we will get to those.  In section 2, it specifically states that the proposal in the published amendments to change the definition of \"termination of pregnancy\" from ending the life of the foetus to ending the pregnancy further reduces the clarity on the medical and surgical procedures that will be able to be legally practised by specialists.  While I understand the good intention of the amendment, it is the view of the legal experts advising me and the view of the medical experts advising all of us that \"end a pregnancy\" does not provide the clarity for which our doctors are asking.  In my conversations with medical practitioners, I have not been asked to change this definition because they believe it provides them with clarity.<\/p> <p>  I detested the language of the eighth amendment as well.  That is why I was delighted to join with Deputy O'Reilly and others in asking the people of Ireland to remove the eighth amendment.  Its language was the language of the unborn.  It was not about rights, as the foetus has rights.  Rather, it was about the rights of the unborn equalling the rights of the woman.  The word \"unborn\" is different to the word \"foetus\" and \"foetus\" is a medical term.<\/p> <p>  The people of Ireland voted.  The Deputy is right, in that we will all endeavour to interpret and put our slants on how they voted, but we know that they voted to repeal the eighth amendment.  However, we also know that they voted to regulate the area.  As the Supreme Court suggested there would be, there are still protections for the life of the foetus.  The Bill is the only legislation in which reference to that life is made at all.<\/p><p>We all need to remember that outside of the circumstances regulated for in this Bill, the destruction of the life of the foetus will still be illegal, and, in my view should be.  There are broad parameters for women in crisis pregnancies under the four headings.  Reference to the life of the foetus is appropriate from a medical and legal point of view in respect of the balancing of rights.  It is different from the language of the eighth amendment, which provided for an equal right to life of the unborn.  While Deputies are doing this for a good reason and we are all eager to get this right and to make sure that we move away from the language of stigma that has dominated discussions in this area for 35 years, we have to take seriously both the medical and legal advice on amending this definition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#L02900","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I oppose amendment No. 7.

We have spoken a number of times this morning about respecting the will expressed by the people in May.  In keeping with that sense, we must constantly focus on who is the person at the centre of all of this, which is the woman.  The people voted for the woman to be placed at the centre and she is the person who is capable of carrying a pregnancy.  When a woman is pregnant she is not carrying a life, as such, but carrying a pregnancy.  Everywhere the legislation states \"to end the life of a foetus\", I have proposed that we change the words to \"end a pregnancy\" because the language is too foetus-centric or focused on the foetus rather than the woman or person carrying the pregnancy.  A woman may have a pregnancy and wish to end it.  She does not have a life that she wishes to end.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Donnelly's reference to the carrying over of language from the past into this legislation.  I am most concerned about that, notwithstanding the medical and legal advice that the Minister has received.  We can go around the houses forever, and we have done previously, defining when life begins and never agree.   I imagine that we would all agree when pregnancy begins.  Everyone can have different feelings about when life begins but we cannot have legislation based on feelings.  I accept what the Minister has said but I am uncomfortable with the language.  We should be able to reserve the right to have meetings with officials in the Department, law experts and medical people and consider the matter when we debate Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.

The short answer is \"Yes\".  Every formula of words has been examined in consultation with the Attorney General, my own officials and legal advisers in my Department.  The reason that I am satisfied with this language is the medical community is largely satisfied with it.  In a letter to all of us, which was sent to me this morning and, I think, sent to the committee last night, 24 maternal foetal medicine specialists, convened at the behest of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, which very much welcomed the introduction of this Bill, have come to us with a number of amendments.  They are critical of something in the legislation so there will be arguments on this that I will have to address later.  They asked us in their letter not to amend the definition from ending the life of the foetus to ending the pregnancy.  Long after we have passed this legislation, there will be obstetricians and gynaecologists in maternity hospitals.  They have been asking all of us - and they ask the people - to let them get on with their job and have clarity.  They are asking us not to change the wording because, in their words, \"it further reduces clarity on the medical and surgical procedures\".  This is not necessarily about my opinion or my view of the world.  Some of them, whom I know all of us hold in the highest regard, have asked us not to do this because they are worried that it will lessen the clarity.  As a committee, we have to reflect on that.  I am more than happy, as are my officials, to engage with members on this between now and Report Stage but I take seriously what they say.  I also take seriously the legal advice on changing it.<\/p> <p>  Everybody has worked hard, as did the cross-party committee and the Citizens' Assembly, on how this should be addressed, how to achieve the right wording, how to make sure it is legally watertight, and how to make sure it works.  I am just worried about reopening the debate on the definition when this has appeared in general schemes and been debated at length but I get what members are trying to do.<\/p> <p>  I would also make the practical point about ending a pregnancy.  There will be women, particularly in the space of fatal foetal abnormalities, who will have twins and they will not end their pregnancy.  The advice available to me is that there are multiple births.  It is not always the case that a woman who accesses an abortion is ending her pregnancy or that a woman who has a termination is ending her pregnancy.  It may be that one of the foetuses is unviable or both. This is a complicated area, which is why I am reluctant to deviate, but I am more than happy to engage with members between now and Report Stage, and to make officials available to engage with them as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#M00800","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#M00900","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I fully respect the legal advice and the Minister's expressions on same.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding that legal advice and having been a member of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which engaged in a long debate, and listened to the very impassioned positions held by people, I suggest that Deputy O'Connell's amendment No. 9 is much more accommodating of the sensitivities surrounding the debate on the procedures, whatever they may be.<\/p><p> I acknowledge what the Minister said about the legal advice.  I note the position in regard to twins.  The definition of abortion laid out by the Citizens' Assembly is that the intention is to deliberately enter a procedure which will terminate the life of the foetus or the unborn or whatever the case may be.  However, the support for that harsh language was not evident at the time we discussed those things during the course of the hearings of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  That is why we need to be a little bit sensitive to the issues that affect women.  During the course of the committee hearings we came across several cases of women who were unsure, uncertain, isolated, alone and fearful of what the implications were.  In some cases, it may be a greater assurance to women in those circumstances to have less terminal language, no pun intended language.  By stating what is legally acceptable and legally advised, it may well be that a woman or a girl in certain circumstances may not feel she has the entitlement, the support or is happy and free to proceed in the way she wants to.  Let us remember also that we spent a great deal of time during the committee hearings on the topic of counselling and the need to be supportive and helpful to the girl or woman who finds herself in a position where she feels she has to seek a termination.

This is an important question.  The Government itself is bringing in reviews of the Gender Recognition Act yet we are proposing legislation today that does not recognise transgender people.  This is not just cosmetic.  There is fear among trans people that they will be excluded should they go to their doctor.  I will give the Minister an example of something that has come up with a transgender person I know who has not physically transitioned but has changed their gender legally.  They used to play a sport and were told they could no longer play that sport in their former gender even though physically they were the same.  The reason I mention this is that it shows that the legal definition of our gender is critical, not just what we are physically.  Last Saturday, I met a group of transgender people and they also raised this.<\/p> <p>  I am finding it hard to understand how the Government has gone as far as this point because the issue was flagged during the summer.  We keep hearing these vague references to legal advice saying we have to do this but we have not been given the explanation as to why the legal advice cannot move with the times in 2018.  It just seems strange given that the Government is also bringing in something progressive in the introduction of non-binary as a gender.  LGBT and non-binary people played a sterling, lead role in this referendum.  Young people who are non-binary and LGBT people were at the forefront on the ground of this campaign.  They may not have been featured in the debates or at the large official events - lots of us were not at any of those - but people on the ground were the ones who led this, particularly young people.<\/p><p>It is a bit of a smack in the face.  I ask the Minister to please accept the amendments.  The best definition is important and not just for transgender people.  The definition of a pregnant person should be anyone who can become pregnant.  I also have a fear that the word \"woman\" could be used to prevent somebody who is a girl in legal terms from having an abortion as well.  It would cover all those aspects.  If the Minister wishes to include \"woman\" and \"pregnant person\", that would be fine, and I am not overly concerned about that.  This is something that is really exercising people and there is much fear because of it.  We must recognise the amendment and there should be a vote on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#O03600","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I get fully where the Deputy is coming from and I want this legislation to be inclusive.  I want it to be trans-inclusive.  I want a very clear message to go out from these Houses that this legislation is inclusive of transgender people.  There would be unintended consequences to this, and Deputy Coppinger has correctly asked me to explain what those are.  I will do that now.  I suggest that either with a delegation of the health committee or without such a delegation I meet a representative group of trans people to discuss this with them between now and Report Stage.  I also suggest amending the explanatory memorandum to the legislation to make it very clear that the legislation is inclusive.  The legislation is inclusive but as our President said very recently, words matter, and I get that.  When we put in words, we do not want to have unintended consequences that would entirely accidentally cause potential adverse consequences for trans people in accessing other services.<\/p><p>I very much and sincerely share the Deputy's aims and views on this but I cannot accept the proposed amendments.  The definition of &quot;woman&quot; in the Bill means a female person of any age.  It has always been my Department's policy position that a biologically female individual identifying as a male should enjoy the same rights as a woman for the purpose of this legislation.  That is the policy intention and we should be very clear that nobody needs to change the Department's policy intention.  It is the policy intention of this legislation, me as Minister and my Department.  Section 18(<i>b<\/i>) of the Interpretation Act 2005 is of pivotal importance in ensuring that rights contained in legislation of a gendered nature apply seamlessly to trans people.  It provides:<\/p><blockquote>(i) A word importing the masculine gender should be read as also importing the feminine gender;<br \/><br \/>(ii) In an Act passed on or after 22 December 1993, and in a statutory instrument made after that date, a word importing the feminine gender shall be read as also importing the masculine gender;<\/blockquote> <p>The Constitution, the Statute Book and statutory instruments contain many gendered provisions; somebody told me there are more than 600 from relatively recent years.  These are often in the context of providing protection to women in connection with pregnancy, childbirth or the elimination of gender-based discrimination.  Cumulatively, these sources contain hundreds of specific references to women and each of these references to &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;women&quot; seamlessly include trans men where appropriate in the context by virtue of the operation of section 18(<i>b<\/i>) of the Interpretation Act.<\/p><p>Section 18 of that Act and its effective operation are of particular importance to trans men in the context of pregnancy, childbirth, related employed rights and entitlements, maternity leave etc. under the Health Acts.  These statutes all refer repeatedly to women, mothers and motherhood without making specific reference to others to whom it is appropriate they would apply.  Whether they should is a much broader piece of work but as of today there are many pieces of legislation that mention &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;women&quot;, &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;motherhood&quot; that apply seamlessly to trans men.  It is vital they do to enable access to some services.  With the Interpretation Act, trans men are in a legally effective way included in the scope of the legislation without the need for intervening legislation.  That was the purpose of the Interpretation Act of 2005.<\/p><p>The proposal to define &quot;woman&quot; in this Bill to include a person whose preferred gender has been recognised via the 2005 Act would be a departure from the established and, it is fair to say, highly effective practice that ensures trans men can access services through legislation.  My Department has received advice on this and I have spoken directly with legal advisers on the matter.  It indicates that to define &quot;woman&quot; in the Bill would create significant risk, which is what I am worried about, that would have the potential to cast real doubt on other gendered provisions in other pieces of legislation.  It could open the possibility of somebody arguing that, by implication, references to women or other gendered references in the Statute Book did not appropriately include trans people.  This would be an obvious unintended consequence that nobody here would wish for.<\/p><p>There is a broader aspect to this and my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, is addressing the review of the Gender Recognition Act 2015, as Deputy Coppinger correctly mentioned.  That review is ongoing and there will be a review clause in this piece of legislation.  I will explicitly ensure that this is very clear in the explanatory memorandum, which would not have a legal consequence but would make it very clear to people that this legislation is trans-inclusive.  The legislation is today trans-inclusive and there is no legal doubt about that.  I take the point that words matter and the Deputy wants it to be very clear that the Act will be inclusive.  I would love to be in a position to say today that we will include &quot;pregnant person&quot; in the definition.  None of us has the luxury of doing so while ignoring the legal advice indicating that I would be causing a problem for trans men in doing so if they are to continue accessing other services that they can correctly access today.  That is the risk.<\/p><p>I am happy to engage between now and Report Stage with Deputies Coppinger, O'Reilly and other Deputies who have raised this.  I am happy to further tease out what I have articulated and meet the representative groups, which would be important.  I want them and the people of Ireland to know - nobody should be in any doubt - that this legislation is inclusive in its provisions for trans men.  Unfortunately, what seems like a relatively simple thing in a legislative process could have unintended consequences.  It is for those reasons and with a very heavy heart that I am not in a position to accept the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#P00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's comments but I support Deputy O'Reilly's amendment.  It sounds like many of us are on the same page in what we want to achieve and the 2005 Act is clearly very important.  I want to press this a little more.  One of the great problems with the eighth amendment was that it caused confusion for doctors.  There were several issues with it but one was that it caused confusion and a lack of clarity.  That is what the doctors told us.  I am concerned that if we do not amend this legislation, that same lack of clarity could be reproduced here.  We have not reached the sections yet but sections 5 or 6 relate to offences and there is still a reference to a 14-year jail term for straying outside the provisions of this legislation.  Doctors, nurses, midwives and everybody involved with termination of pregnancy services will be taking this deadly seriously and ensuring they are protected, as well as the pregnant people.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, having access to departmental advice and the Attorney General's office, can have a conversation with us about the matter referencing the 2005 Act and therefore seeing this as okay.  A GP in a surgery or an obstetrician or gynaecologist in an acute setting will not have that knowledge.  They will have the Bill, which references a pregnant woman, and they could be dealing with a trans man.  They could be dealing with a pregnant person who not only identifies as being male but who has been legally recognised as male and has an Irish passport stating that he is male, despite being pregnant.  The question is whether we are creating confusion in such circumstances for the doctor.  He or she may look at it and think that if he or she gets it wrong, he or she could be going to jail for 14 years.  The doctor would not want to get it wrong.  He or she might not know what the 2005 Act states but there is reference to \"pregnant woman\" in this legislation.  The patient in question may be a man, defined and identifying as a man with a passport that indicates he is male.  What would the doctor do?  My concern is there would be confusion.<\/p> <p>  I am supportive of the amendments.  Such circumstances may be at the margin.  The 2005 Act was highly progressive but we have moved on 13 years and other things have happened.  There has been recognition of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual people, as well as gay marriage and rights.  I support the amendments but I take in good faith the comments of the Minister.  He is not pushing against the spirit of the amendments.  I would like the Minister to address if he could the points I raised.<\/p><p>My concern is that a doctor will read the legislation, which will say \"pregnant woman\", and be unsure what to do.

There is zero policy difference between the Deputies and me on this matter and I want to provide for it too, but I am told I cannot do so legally.  Deputy Donnelly correctly said that the world has moved on considerably from what was definitely progressive legislation in 2005, but the world is a different and, in my view, better place in its understanding of these matters now, which indicates the broader work that must be done and that is being led by my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, to review the Gender Recognition Act in its totality, which I know is under way.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly made a separate point about clarity.  To return to our conversation earlier, there is nobody in this room or the Oireachtas who wishes to cause any confusion or lack of clarity for any doctor.

I fully take Deputy Donnelly's point but I hope it is not the law that doctors pick up but rather the clinical guidelines.

I do not know about other members of the committee but when many of us, myself included, read legislation, the first thing we tend to read is the explanatory memo to learn what the Bill is about and what it tries to achieve.  That tends to be the accessible way of reading and understanding legislation.  For all of us, and I am sure for the public at large, the explanatory memo is usually the first point of reference.

The scenario that Deputy Donnelly and I outlined is more likely, where somebody who has legally transitioned to being a trans man, but who could become pregnant, could go to his doctor and have that experience.

At a time when our health service is creaking at the seams, with September figures indicating 8,000 people were on trolleys, 718,000 people waiting to be seen or treated by a doctor and children having to wait 18 months for scoliosis treatment, the injection of &euro;12 million as a starting point for elective abortion services is unacceptable.

To put forward the idea that only someone whose life is at risk should have their termination paid for while that of any other person would not is cruel.  Bringing this down to brass tacks, this would include Savita.  Savita did not have an abortion because her life was not deemed to be at risk, it was \"only her health\".  Under this amendment, she should not have benefited in any way.  This and another stream of amendments have angered people over the weekend.  <\/p> <p>  On the general issue of cost, we could decide not to fund abortions and continue to send people abroad and ignore reality.  Could I, however, just make a case for how we will save money?  I was thinking about this over the weekend.  The cost of having an abortion if, for example, one travels to the UK is anything from &euro;1,000.  That money will now be in the pockets of working class and ordinary women.  That is a really important saving for them and their families because, contrary to what the anti-abortion crowd thinks, the majority of people who have abortions are actually mothers already.  They have other people in their families to look after.  We are not going to rehearse the referendum - we won it - but I am struck by the cruelty of some of these amendments.  People will have money in their pockets that they would not have if we continued to export them.  I look on this as one of the biggest victories for ordinary women in a long time in this country and make no apology for that.  The idea that any person who needed an abortion on health or other grounds would be deprived is cruel.  Recently, a relative of mine who was pregnant with twins with a fatal foetal abnormality had to have an abortion.

This section has nothing to do with eligibility.  That is section 25, which deals with the amendment to the Health Act.  This section is in every piece of legislation.  It allows the Minister of the day to administer the Bill.  Funnily enough, I will not be involved in the termination of services.  That will be done through the medical profession and through the eligibility section of the legislation, which is section 25.<\/p> <p>  To give the Deputy guidance, if she wants to do what she wants to do, and I will get onto the problem I have with that in a moment, she should be amending section 25 that deals with the Health Act and not this section of the Bill, which is a standard section in every Bill that comes before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Even if the amendment did what the Deputy wanted to do and was accepted it would not achieve what she is endeavouring to achieve.  For the Deputy's considerations on Report Stage, this is not the correct place in the Bill.  The correct place is the eligibility section, which is section 25.  This is the first flaw in the amendment.  Then there is the sheer humanity flaw in terms of why the Deputy wants me to ask hospitals to send bills to women who have had fatal foetal abnormalities in our maternity hospitals or to a woman who has been in a car crash and has almost died and has a serious risk to her health.  Why should I not care for these women in our hospitals today?<\/p> <p>  Here is some breaking news.  Women are taxpayers.  This is about providing services for women, so when we talk about taxpayers it is not a clear and distinct group of people that is different from the group of people who will benefit from the legislation.  Women are taxpayers and the people voted overwhelmingly for this legislation.  I thought it was the policy of the party of which the Deputy was a member, it is the policy of most people in the Oireachtas and it is certainly the policy of Sl&aacute;intecare, to which I believe almost all of us have all signed up, that we will move towards universality.  As we bring in new services usually in the House I get into significant difficulty if I am not providing it on a universal basis and if I decide cost is a barrier.

I do not get Deputy Nolan's problem with it.  I get that she is very sincere and I respect her right to have her view on abortion.  She and I disagree on it and that is fine, and she has every right to hold her view, but I do not get why she has a difficulty with the Irish health service providing support.  The idea of equating this with trolleys is a crass political attack on me.  I will come in here and debate my record on health any time with any person, and I look forward to doing so, but this is a crass political attack.  Approximately 80% of these procedures will be carried out in the community.  None of these women will be on trolleys or in hospital beds.  They will visit their GP or a family planning association.  I am not re-running the referendum either, but most of the women in this country who find themselves in crisis will be seen in primary care.  They will be nowhere near hospital trolleys or hospital beds.  Those who will be in a hospital setting will often be in some of the most tragic situations.  They will have a wanted pregnancy.  Perhaps they will have been told the baby they desperately wanted has only half a head.  I do not understand the Deputy's difficulty.<\/p> <p>  I really resent the phrase \"elective abortion\" because it goes back to the cheap connotation of abortion on demand.  No woman I have ever met has said that she really wants an abortion.  I do not know whether the Deputy has met any and perhaps she will tell us about them.  These are people in extraordinarily difficult situations.  It is not for Deputy Nolan or me to judge them.  Thank God, the people of this country decided in their wisdom it is not for any of us to judge them.  This legislation is about looking after them and caring for them in our own country.  We should be moving towards a universal health service.  This is my policy position and my ethical position.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Nolan fundamentally disagrees with the outcome of the referendum.  I am sure she respects it and she respects democracy and that the people voted in favour of it.  I accept some people voted against it and that is fine.  Think of it from a practical point of view.  If the idea here was that people voted by an overwhelming majority to repeal the eighth amendment and make these services available in our country at last, if we decide we are going to start charging people for the service cost will remain a barrier.  The young woman will use the Internet and access the pill without any doctor or medical support.  What the Deputy is trying to do here is to subvert the will of the people, which is to make sure women do not need to travel in these circumstances.<\/p> <p>  On a practical level the amendment is in the wrong place but that is for the Deputy to decide.  If she wants to stop me doing this she needs to amend section 25 of the legislation that allows us to do this.  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked where eligibility appears in the heads of the Bill.  Eligibility was not dealt with in the heads of the Bill and I accept this.  It is a policy decision I made.  I very much made it in line with what I felt were the views of the majority of the Oireachtas and the people.  That is my sense and the people can judge me on this decision.  Obviously it will come to an Oireachtas vote.  This is about the service being free, safe and legal.  If it is not free it will be legal but it will not be safe because women in vulnerable situations will have to travel and women in vulnerable situations will not seek medical consultation.  Whatever Deputy Nolan's view on termination, and I accept we have different views and I am respectful of this, if she found that a woman in her life was in crisis she would want that woman to have access to medical professionals.  Regardless of the Deputy's view, and we have different views on this, if that woman is going to proceed with an abortion surely the Deputy would want to know it will happen in an environment that is safe, regulated and overseen by medical professionals.  This is why I want to make sure that if women make that decision they can access the service.<\/p> <p>  We already have the maternity and infant care scheme.  Pregnant women in the country today access free medical care.  As the Chairman knows, it is a very successful scheme.  I accept the Deputies here want to expand it further and I welcome this discussion and debate.  Expectant mothers can already access their family doctor and the hospital obstetrician.  It is a universal service and has nothing to do with means or whether people have a medical card.  What the Deputy is asking me to do is discriminatory.  She is asking me to state that, if two pregnant women are sitting in the waiting room of their doctor's surgery, because she approves of one of those women's choices she can have the service free but because she dislikes her choice the other woman must pay.  Both pregnant women are deserving of access to the Irish healthcare system.  The only difference is one woman is making a decision the Deputy does not approve of.  Quite frankly, whether the Deputy or I approve of it is not the issue, it is the woman's choice.  I will not discriminate where the only difference between two women is their choice.  I will not say one pays for the doctor and the other does not.  That would be entirely discriminatory.  We already have a scheme that cares for pregnant women that is universal and provides free access.  All we are simply doing is stating the same fundamental policy principles should apply to all women regardless of their choice.  The Deputy has a different view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#W00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>There is no need for the Minister to behave like a frightened schoolboy.

If a woman had to pay for medical services and drugs provided in the case of early pregnancy, could that create a financial barrier to accessing health services?  It most definitely would.  A woman would have to attend a GP, which would cost &euro;50 or &euro;60, pay for drugs - I do not imagine they would be cheap - and then return to a GP, which would cost another &euro;50 or &euro;60.  She may have complications or require follow-up.  She could end up paying in the realm of hundreds of euro.  That potential cost creates a financial barrier to accessing healthcare services for women.  The Minister made an important point.  The unintended consequence of this is that women who cannot afford several hundred euro can afford to go online-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#X02100","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#X02200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":357,"content":"<p>-----to buy pills and self-administer without medical supervision or safety.  For those reasons, termination of early pregnancy under section 13 must be free because we are trying to provide this service to everyone.<\/p> <p>  The next section that is not exempted relates to fatal foetal abnormalities.  Perhaps this was a drafting error.<\/p><p>I would find it unconscionable that any pregnant woman faced with a fatal foetal abnormality at the end of all of the medical care that she needs could be faced with a bill.  Let us think about this.  One is talking about GP fees, hospital visits, surgical fees, specialist fees, and after-care because a woman could be in hospitals for days or weeks.  Were this amendment to be passed we would have a situation in Ireland where a pregnant woman faced with the tragedy of a fatal foetal abnormality could be faced with a massive bill of not just thousands of euro but tens of thousands of euro.  That, to me, would be utterly unconscionable.  Maybe it was not meant in the drafting but, as this amendment is tabled, that is what it would do.<\/p><p> I spoke to the Minister about the following during Second Stage and there are amendments later so I will not go into the details now.  It would be a perverse situation in our country for the termination of pregnancy services would be free but contraception to reduce crisis pregnancy and other maternity services not to be free.  I have tabled amendments, some of which have been ruled out of order, to discuss the issue that all contraception should be free.  Indeed, there is highly effective longer-acting contraception that can cost hundreds of euro which, again, is another barrier.  That cost should be removed.  Although Dr. Noel Browne brought in a groundbreaking policy called the mother and child scheme, and he was pursued after his political career and destroyed by the Catholic Church for doing so, all of maternity care is not free.  For example, there are some drugs for nausea and there are costs that can be incurred by pregnant women that we will talk about later.  In terms of the amendment leading to the racking up of potential costs of hundreds of euro during early pregnancy and charging anyone for any medical care for fatal foetal abnormality, both of those would be wrong.  It is for those reasons that I believe the amendment should be opposed.        <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#X02300","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I agree with the last speaker almost in the entirety, and I know that might be strange for me to do sometimes.  It would be a travesty, having regard to the debate that has taken place in this country over the past year, in particular, both in the Citizens' Assembly and in the special committee, if it were to emerge at this stage that we were to frustrate what was intended by withdrawing the financial support.  I note the case for competing demands.  There are always competing demands in the health, housing and educational services.  Having regard to the debate that took place, this demand is regarded by many in this country as a very serious demand.  It is no harm to remember that if we were to say to people, \"Well, okay, if you can afford to have all of these things done privately then that is your own business but for those of you who can't we are very sorry about that but you cannot avail of the services\", it would apply even in the most extreme circumstances or in the case of Savita Halappanavar and similar cases.  It would be a terrible tragedy if we were to allow ourselves to go down that road.<\/p> <p>  An opinion poll indicates that 44% of the people who voted \"Yes\" were opposed to public funding of the service.  I do not know how it was intended to fund the service in the first place since the general impression was that we are going to have a universal service eventually.  The idea was to protect the health and lives of women, and I mean the health leading to the lives of women.  It was deemed necessary to do that, as a matter of some considerable urgency, and the people very overwhelmingly came forward to make their decision.  I remind the House again that they made their decision on the basis of the information prevailing at the time - the information that was used by the committee and for the debates of the Citizens' Assembly - all of which was important.  <\/p> <p>  It would be unconstitutional if we were to introduce an amendment that rendered the provisions of the legislation being proposed unavailable to a large sector of the female population.  It would be morally wrong to go down that road.  There are lots of competing demands but a woman whose life is in danger is a competing demand as well.  One can say hard cases make bad law.  I contend that a lack of law does not make for good cases or a good ending in such situations.  I am strongly of the view that the people intended that the proposals would be funded in the normal way, as part of the health service.

We have further enhanced access by making sure it will not be discriminatory, as it will be free and universal and part of the public health service.

The council is the regulator and gets to enforce that.  I appreciate the Deputies care for those who will have access to services under the legislation.  I assure them, as I have on many occasions, that in drafting the legislation, it was genuinely my priority to ensure that it closely mirrored what the Oireachtas committed us to do and what we told the people we would do and ensure terminations are provided in a medically safe and regulated service.

If a woman goes to a doctor in the ninth or tenth week and cannot access the pill, for example, and has to go somewhere else, is that criminalising the woman?  This has to be clarified.  We are calling for those provisions to be taken out of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#AA01600","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Joan Collins for her amendment.  First, the woman seeking the abortion is never criminalised.  We are following through on the recommendation of the all-party committee that the woman seeking the abortion is never criminalised.  There is decriminalisation in that respect.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps we have different views on this, but if something is legal in certain circumstances it obviously needs to be illegal in other circumstances or else it is effectively legal in all circumstances.  This Bill does provide restrictions; its title refers to the \"regulation of termination of pregnancy\".  We can argue and debate, though I think the question was largely settled, that the grounds put forward are the grounds on which it is legal.  On other grounds beyond that, it is illegal.  If I were to delete the offences section in its entirety, there would be no offences for breaking that law, which I think could actually leave women in vulnerable positions.  In the area of illegal abortions, how could we protect women?  What about forced abortions or instances of coercion?<\/p> <p>  I want to say at this stage, because it is very much related to the amendments we are discussing, that I would like to work with colleagues and am already working with the Office of the Attorney General to move the offences section in the Bill.  A number of colleagues, including Deputies Joan Collins, Clare Daly, O&rsquo;Connell and others referred on Second Stage to the fact that the offences section is the first thing to hit people when they pick up the Bill.  That is not the policy intention.  It is due to a drafting precedent or template; that is where offences sections generally happen to be placed in legislation.  While not all Bills or Acts are picked up and read all that often, this might be one that is.  This legislation is about providing access to regulated termination of pregnancy services.  We are going to see if we can bring forward amendments on Report Stage to locate the offences section in a more appropriate part of the Bill so it is not the first thing a reader sees.<\/p> <p>  Section 5 sets out the substantive offences under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018 and provides that it shall be an offence for a person by any means whatsoever to intentionally end the life of the foetus otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  I remember that I was asked lots of times during the referendum campaign, as I am sure many Deputies were, whether the foetus has any rights.  Of course, the reality is that it does.  Outside the terms of this Bill, it is still illegal to destroy the foetus.  I know words in this area are emotive but I am using the word \"foetus\" because it is the medically appropriate word.  It will still be an offence to end the life of a foetus outside of these terms.  It would be inconsistent to say it was an offence yet to have no offence in the Bill. <\/p> <p>  Officials from my Department and the Office of the Attorney General did consider how to phrase that because a number of people raised the issue and indeed it came up earlier in our debate.  However, the key consideration in drafting any legislation must be to ensure that the intent of the law is as clear and unambiguous as possible.  In this case, this formulation was put forward after considerable thought and discussion.  It is the clearest formulation possible for the offence and I would be very nervous, for the reasons I outlined earlier in terms of legal and medical clarity, about moving away from it.<\/p> <p>  Under section 5 it is also an offence to prescribe, administer, supply or procure any drugs, instruments, apparatus or other thing which is intended to be used with the intent of ending the life of a foetus or being reckless about whether it might be used for that purpose.  I repeat that these provisions do not apply to a pregnant woman who has ended or attempted to end her own pregnancy.  This Oireachtas was quite clear in wanting to move beyond the criminalisation of the woman.  It is an offence for a person to procure a termination for a pregnant woman outside the provisions of the Bill.<\/p> <p> There needs to be a reasonable conversation in this area.  If we are at long last providing a way of accessing free, safe and legal medically supervised abortion, we need our law to be encouraging people to use the free, safe, legal and regulated abortion services.  When people ask what if a mother or sister does this for her daughter or friend, I would respond that we need everybody to be using the legal, safe, regulated service.  If there were no offences in this Bill, we would be saying it was kind of all right to continue to order the pill off the Internet.  It was a decisive factor in the campaign and in the committee&rsquo;s deliberations that the procuring of illegal abortion pills was a cause of concern.  It was certainly one of the reasons people gave in many of the conversations I had the length and breadth of the country for deciding to vote for change.  We need to be very careful; it would be highly irresponsible for me as Minister for Health to stand over a situation which could result in damage to a woman&rsquo;s health or even pose a risk to her life and for me to say there was no offence for that.  We are not having an offence for the woman but it would be highly unusual for there to be no offence at all.  I would not in any other area allow for unregulated medication from unknown sources for another person to proceed unchecked.  If a person ordered pain killers on the Internet for a friend who had a pain in their chest, rather than going to the doctor, I would be rightly criticised for not trying to stamp out the illegal use of that medication and not encouraging its safe, regulated use.  God forbid, if something went wrong, people would be asking serious questions about the Oireachtas and the Minister of the day in terms of why they did not think they needed to regulate.<\/p><p>I realise that some people want to change the name of the Bill, but its Title currently contains the word regulation.  We are regulating; we are saying in certain circumstances that it is legal, and we are also saying that in other circumstances it is not legal.  I understand that feelings run very high on this issue because there is a real chilling effect from the eighth amendment, from the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, and a sense that doctors and women will be fearful whether this will happen.  We want to move beyond that - I do too - but a termination of pregnancy is a medical procedure, it involves medical treatment and it is best carried out by medical practitioners in a safe and regulated medical environment.  If I have said it once, I have said a million times, as have many others in this room, that this is about women and their doctors.  Therefore the Bill must be about ensuring that the law is directing and supporting the provision of service in that direction.  Yes, there are penalties in the Bill, I know that there are concerns about some of the penalties.  I am happy to hear the committee's view on that and, indeed, work with the committee on this between now and Report Stage because there is no font of all wisdom on this, nor am I claiming to be it, so I am happy to work with colleagues.  However, it is worth pointing out that the specific sentence to be applied is a matter for the court.  People tend to refer to the higher end of the spectrum, the phrase \"up to\" is also in the Bill, but it is essential to ensure that a potential penalty does reflect the seriousness of a crime.  We could be talking about serious and violent attacks on women in some situations.  I am not deliberately picking the most extreme situation, but we do need to ensure that what is on our Statute Book gets the balance right, that if there is a violent attack on a woman and her autonomy and well-being that that is a suitably high offence.  <\/p><p> There are many examples, and in the interests of time I do not intend to go through them all now, of where a maximum penalty is in legislation but is very rarely applied.  The maximum penalty in Ireland under section 14 of the Criminal Justice (Thefts and Frauds Offences) Act is life imprisonment for robbery but that does not mean that everybody who robs something ends up in prison for life, far from it.  It is about trying to ensure that within our statutes, there is an ability if a woman is violently attacked to impose a hefty sentence.  It is in no way about trying to penalise women, in fact it is the opposite, we are not criminalising women.  It is about ensuring that when the Oireachtas provides for a service that is free, safe, legally and regulated, that that is the service that we support and encourage and that we collectively try to end the use of services outside of that safe space, namely, the unregulated use of medication.  I cannot think of another example as Minister for Health where I would, or the members would ask me to, turn a blind eye or ignore the use of unregulated medication, although I am not saying that is what anyone here is trying to do.  I expect there will be a great deal to discuss on this matter between now and Report Stage but again, I am not the font of all wisdom and am happy to work with the committee to ensure that we get this right.  I will try to move the offences to a more appropriate section of the Bill, which would be important.  It is not as simple as I had thought but it is doable and I want to do it, and, in fact, we will do it.  However, while I fully understand what Deputy Joan Collins is doing in proposing the deletion of the offence altogether and the motives behind that, there would be an unintended consequence that would leave some women vulnerable. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#AA01700","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I was struck by a couple of things.  Looking at the whole journey we made over the course of the eighth amendment committee hearings, one thing that was consistent throughout every session was the issue of criminalisation and the need to decriminalise.  I listened carefully to the Minister's remarks.  Every one of us is in favour of best medical practice.  Nobody wants rogue operators, everyone wants things to be carried out properly.  That is the same for abortion as a medical procedure as it is for every other medical practice. The committee recommended that all criminal sanctions that apply to women and girls should be lifted and that has been done, but the committee also recommended that doctors acting within the law within a clinical context should be decriminalised.  I do not think that the way the legislation is drafted, in the absence of our amendment, actually achieves that.  The Minister says that feelings are running high on this, but I am not sure they are.  That is looking at it the wrong way around.  We must look at this issue in the context of where we have come from and the chilling environment in which medical practitioners have traditionally operated.  The concern is that this wording has taken the wording of the very restrictive Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, maintained the sanction, albeit for medical practitioners, and it is completely unnecessary.  What we are saying is that the delivery of abortion must certainly be regulated but it should be regulated in the same manner as other medical procedures.  Therefore anybody who operates outside the law should be subject to normal criminal sanction, which they would be.  If a doctor removes someone's leg against their will or incarcerates them against their will, that person is open to criminal proceedings, on the one hand, and also to medical disciplinary proceedings.  Over the many months worth of deliberations that we had in the committee we said that this was a normal healthcare provision and that doctors should be enabled to carry out their medical judgement in a medical setting in the same environment that they would any other procedure.  Particularly given where we have come from in this State let us be clear, the likelihood of people trying to catch out doctors or make the legislation unworkable, something that is not in the interests of women or doctors, we do not need clauses in the legislation that would assist that happening.  Full decriminalisation was a consistent theme at those committee hearings and anything less leaves us open to having the legislation undermined.  It goes against the spirit of everything because consistently all the international and Irish studies show that in order to be compliant with international human rights, we should go for full decriminalisation.  The amendment is necessary in that regard.  By not accepting this amendment, we leave ourselves open to health providers being dissuaded from providing the best care to their patients than they otherwise would because they have this sitting on their backs.  It is probably the key part of this committee's discussion in coming days.  I strongly support the amendment and will press it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#BB00800","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I support the amendment.  We have also put down amendments opposing sections 5 and 6.  What is the purpose of criminalising abortion?  Presumably, it is to prevent people from carrying out dangerous abortions or charging people vast sums, which would be an incentive to work outside this Act.  However, what is being proposed is free and universal access so the danger of that happening is not likely.  There are two reasons this is wrong.  Its chilling effect on doctors has been noted, but while the Minister does not intend to punish women or pregnant people themselves, he will also punish somebody who helps somebody have an abortion outside of the Act.  Let us consider what that might mean in practice.  Take a person whose doctor tells them they have gone past the 12 week period - we will not get into how they estimate the 12 week period, because that might not be 12 weeks gestation - that person is faced with going abroad or accessing abortion pills from safe websites such as <i>Women On Web <\/i>that is currently used.<\/p><p>If at 13 weeks someone helps a friend, sister or daughter to have an abortion using medical abortion pills from the <i>Women on Web<\/i>site, which is an internationally recognised group of which there are also others, that person could be criminalised.  It has happened in Northern Ireland where a mother was prosecuted for helping her own daughter.  This is not preposterous.  It would actually be safe to have an abortion at 13 weeks using a medical abortion pill which can be used up to 14 weeks.  However, this would criminalise someone for doing that.  The British Medical Association has just voted, I think for the first time, to decriminalise abortion in Britain where it remains a criminal offence outside the regulations.  Doctors have also made that call in approximately 44 other countries.  People are citing the great levels of support they have, but polls show that the majority of people do not think it should be a criminal offence.  I echo that on the committee, this was not just about criminalising the person, it was about decriminalisation.  I agree completely that it should be an offence dealt with under medical regulations.  It can be done that way.  However, criminalising doctors, potentially, will definitely put some people's health at risk where there is uncertainty about serious harm.  There will be other cases that might be very dodgy too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#BB00900","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>The chill factor of the 14 years jumps off the page.  It looms darkly over all of this.  We favour removing the entire section on offences.  It may well have a great deal to do with how we define the legislation.  That is why we feel the Title is important with the reference to the regulation of women's health.  Let us say that we were regulating men's health, would we have to insert that it would be illegal and subject to 14 years imprisonment to force a man to have a vasectomy, which relates to his reproductive health?  One would not as that is already governed by legislation covering offences against the person, including grievous bodily harm and others.  Likewise, there is other legislation to cover the case where a woman is forced against her will by a nasty lunatic or dangerous person to have an abortion.  That legislation already deals with violence against the person and includes hefty sentences.  We are trying here to regulate for abortion, whether the Minister agrees to call a spade a spade.  As such, this should not be included as it provides for an offence of carrying out a procedure where that offence is already covered by other legislation dealing with violent acts against individuals.  I refer the Minister to the last debate and Deputy Nolan's amendment on making people pay for the services.  The Minister said himself that forcing women to pay for the pill meant making them go to the Internet.  Quite correctly, he opposed that.  If we can create a legislative framework around the regulation of women's health and the provision of full, free, safe and legal access to abortion, the need to go online will not need to be covered by the section.  We would like to see it removed entirely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#CC00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I reiterate the point that no woman should be criminalised with regard to abortion.  It is important to remember that most abortions are related to socio-economic issues and we should focus on resolving those issues.  It was stated that abortion was safe, but the Bill itself states that abortion is the ending of a life.  Safety and the ending of a life do not equal each other.  This is one of the most radical amendments for which one could provide because it will, by default, allow for abortion by failing to disincentivise it in a whole range of other circumstances.  Part of the argument before the referendum was that if one takes the right to life out of the Constitution, the issue becomes fluid with regard to where it ends up.

The use of language like \"to intentionally end the life of a foetus\" rather than to say \"terminate a pregnancy\" or, indeed, to use the word \"abortion\", which we seldom see or hear in this debate we have about abortion, represents a failure to confront language and deal with it.  The eighth amendment is the protection of life legislation being perpetuated all over again.  I am hopeful the amendments I suggest will be accepted.<\/p> <p>  My second amendment on the section focuses on offences.  I have tried to ensure that medical practitioners as well as those acting with the explicit permission of the pregnant person are excluded from all offences.  We need to assure medical professionals that if they act in good faith, there will be no sanction which inhibits them in their work.  If we fail explicitly to protect doctors, the chilling effect, about which we heard at length, not just at the committee on the eighth amendment but in the Citizens' Assembly and in the course of the referendum debate, will continue.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 26 seeks to ensure that where a pregnant person explicitly requests someone to help obtain abortion pills from the Internet or another source, that person will not be guilty of an offence.  We have seen the situation in the North, which was referred to earlier, where a woman was helped by her mother and now everyone involved is under investigation.  That is not what we want to see as part of this legislation.  We must remove the reference to a sentence of 14 years.  This is an echo of the eighth amendment and the protection of life during pregnancy legislation which we all want to see gone.  It is important to protect doctors by removing the chilling effect and to ensure that where a doctor acts in good faith, he or she is immune from criminal sanction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#CC00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":414,"content":"<p>My personal view is in direct conflict with my view of what the people have voted for on this.  Personally, I oppose strongly the section, which feels completely over the top.  It has a chilling effect, as we know.  Points have been made around no such penalty of 14 years ever having been suggested for men's reproductive health and, indeed, medical malpractice and so on is already covered in other legislation.  On a personal level, to frame legislation which carries a 14 year sentence is wrong.  However, what is in the legislation is almost word for word what is in the heads of the Bill.  If a mistake was made, it was to bring such punitive sanctions into the heads of the Bill, including that 14 year sentence.  However, it was brought in and it was in the heads of the Bill.  The Minister and I knocked on many doors in Wicklow.  My experience of talking to voters was that a material number who intended to vote \"Yes\" were doing so in the clear knowledge that this section existed.  An example which will be discussed later is the whole idea of disability and other matters not being permitted as grounds for termination of pregnancy.  As explained, disability is not allowable, including intellectual and physical disability and other syndromes.<\/p><p>The reason that is not allowable is because of these sections.  On a democratic imperative, it is absolutely clear to me that a reasonable number of \"Yes\" voters were voting with a clear understanding that this would be in the legislation.  The provision is pretty much transcribed word for word from the heads of the Bill.  I wish it had not been in the heads of the Bill.  I do not agree with it personally but in my opinion I am following a principle that basically says that if it is in the heads of the Bill, whether I agree with it or not, it is in the legislation.

Some people are using that definition today, with which many of us had an issue at the outset, to support this.  This is the consequence of that definition.<\/p> <p>  If we come to an agreement between now and Report Stage on the definition that will reflect the wording I propose in amendments Nos. 17 and 20, that will change the definition.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the front-loading of the offences, I proposed that in my amendments but I was informed by the Bills Office that it cannot come from a committee member, that the reordering of a Bill has to be done by the Minister and the Bills Office.  I think the Bill will be legislation that will be referred to and picked up and if it is humanly possible to reorder it, I would like it reordered.<\/p> <p>  There is also a chronological issue in that we should be moving through the gestation period of pregnancy as opposed to hopping from fatal foetal back to early pregnancy as I think there is a natural progression through pregnancy.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Donnelly because he made clear the connection between what was in the heads of the Bill before the referendum and what we are doing now.  Again many raised the issues of what could happen.  Deputy Coppinger, who has left the room, referred to abortion pills which are safe up to 14 weeks.  Yes, they are licensed for use up to 14 weeks, but between ten and 14 weeks, to the best of my knowledge, their use must be under the supervision of a doctor.  One could have a very complicated situation if, for example,  a mother ordered abortion pills for her 14 year old child who is pregnant with twins.  Were she to give them at 16 weeks, we would have a very dangerous situation.  I would not like to have any involvement in a situation where that 14 year old girl would bleed out for whatever reason.  This all goes back to our discussion on access, cost and barriers because these are the issues that would cause people difficulties.<\/p> <p>  I will not be supporting amendment No. 16 because we had said what we were going to do before the referendum.

I am looking at the report of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which called on the Minister to amend the law.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>The Committee recommends that the law be amended to provide that(a) surgical terminations may only be legally carried out in a hospital setting [which we have done and]<br \/><br \/>(b) medical terminations may only be provided for through the licencing of medications for that purpose and prescribed by a qualified practitioner acting in good faith.<\/blockquote> <p>We have done that.  It also states &quot;The Committee further recommends that where terminations occur in such circumstances ... no criminal sanctions should apply.&quot;  That is the case and there is no criminal sanction to a doctor operating in those circumstances, in good faith.  I believe we are in agreement that in all cases &quot;where a woman procures or seeks to procure an abortion for herself, the law should provide that, regardless of circumstances, she is not guilty of an offence&quot;.  I believe those four tests that were outlined by the all-party committee have been met in the legislation.<\/p><p>Deputy Donnelly rightly pointed out, and I agree with this point, regardless of our personal opinions, we had to put forward a general scheme of a Bill that we believed encapsulated the greatest majority.  We cannot all be looking into our hearts, guessing what the people of Ireland thought and perhaps we got some calls right and some calls not right, but this was the legislation that we largely put before the people, when we published the general scheme in March and the updated scheme in July after the referendum and when we published the Bill in September.<\/p><p>I think Deputy O'Connell is right to point out, particularly with her professional background, that there are risks.  I refer to her phrase, &quot;dangerous consequences&quot;, to operating outside of the legal framework and that is something that none of us can stand over.  There is a reason that we have set out matters and the reason is not just a moral or policy one.  There are reasons that outside the periods set out in the Bill, in certain circumstances it could be dangerous and we cannot stand over that.<\/p><p>We have come a long way.  All sanctions for women and girls have been removed.  There is no sanction for a doctor operating within the law.  We have purposely tried to word the law in such a way that it is not Members or the Minister for Health deciding what is the appropriate call for the doctor.  In some cases, it is the decision of one doctor, in other cases it is the decision of two doctors in their reasonable opinion, formed in good faith.  This language is empowering the doctor, to try to remove the chilling effect in order that the doctor does not have to dust down a copy of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann or the legislation or ask him or herself what do the politicians want him or her to do in the circumstances.  There are parameters in place that trust a doctor's clinical judgment and give a doctor's clinical judgment the protection of a decision based on their reasonable opinion and in good faith, which I think is important.  <\/p><p>Let us also remember that this is not just about medical practitioners.  Deputy Clare Daly raised the issue of someone removing one's leg illegally but we do not have a law about the removal of legs.  We do, however, have a law about the regulation of termination of pregnancy and when one is putting in place a law, one is obligated to put into law what is legal and what is not.  What I do not wish to do - the Oireachtas can do what it wishes - is deviate substantially from what we promised the people we would do.  Again one can argue whether that was right or wrong but we said to the people we will allow abortion to be legal, regulated and safe in these very specific circumstances.  I also said many times, as did many members, that outside of these circumstances it will continue to be illegal.  Deputy Donnelly gave a very honest appraisal of the situation.  Many people voted &quot;Yes&quot; in the knowledge that was the case, knowing the grounds on which they could vote &quot;Yes&quot; and support abortion happening, but in the knowledge that disability is not a ground and with limits beyond a certain period or beyond viability.  There needs to a legal and an illegal piece to this debate or otherwise we have gone significantly beyond what the aforementioned committee and its cross-party members committed to doing.<\/p><p>There is also another point.  The foetus has protection outside of these circumstances.  Abortion in Ireland will be legal under these heads and in these circumstances but there will be protection for the foetus outside of those circumstances and if one removes section 5, there will be nowhere on the Statute Book where there is protection for the foetus.  I genuinely do not think the Irish people voted for that.  They voted for a very broad range of parameters, whereby termination would be allow, but they did not vote for termination in every single circumstance and they did not vote for termination not to be regulated and they not vote for there not to be a legality and an illegality in respect of these situations.<\/p><p>The people and the Government support the idea that the woman or girl should never be criminalised.  <\/p><p> I am glad that Deputy O'Connell also made the point that the language in the Bill must be consistent.  It cannot be that the Bill states in one section \"end the pregnancy\", in another \"end the life of the foetus\" and in another uses the word \"abortion\".  If we do that, we will do a significant disservice to doctors and women because there will not be legal consistency.  Deputy O'Connell asked whether that definition would apply if it had been changed earlier.  The short answer is \"Yes\" because there must be consistency in the wording in all parts of the Bill.  The harder question is whether we can come up with a formula of words that meets the needs of the medical community in operating the Act with legal consistency, but that is our job between now and Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#DD00500","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":421,"content":"<p>We will try our best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#EE00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I have no doubt we will do our best.

There is a sense from the contributions that we can improve the section.  What I do not intend to do, however, is deviate from the fundamental grounds on which abortion is legal in Ireland to a new set of grounds on which the people did not vote.  I know they did not vote on the wording but they voted with knowledge of the general scheme.  I am endeavouring to get that balance right but also to ensure we make provisions to protect women in circumstances where there may be forced abortions and where women may be intimidated or forced into having illegal terminations of pregnancy in much more dangerous circumstances.  There could be a situation, for example, of domestic or sexual abuse where a vulnerable woman or young person could be coerced into agreeing an illegal termination of pregnancy without any medical assistance, perhaps for sinister reasons.  There is a need to protect women from these difficult situations.  I am happy to engage with people on whether we have got the balance right but this is how I am approaching the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#EE00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I fully accept the bona fides of the Minister when he says the Department has attempted to remove the chilling effect in balancing this legislation.  It has not achieved that objective, however, and I do not agree that the committee's suggestions were adhered to.  I accept the Minister's point about the legislation giving a protection to medical practitioners or providers who operate in good faith within the law and who have a reasonable opinion, but that is just a defence.  It still leaves them open to the possibility of a malicious prosecution, for example, or an allegation against them by people who want to be devious with this legislation.<\/p> <p>  Abortion should be fully decriminalised because there is ample medical regulation and other legislation in place to deal with people who break the law.  The Minister said that people did not vote for abortion in all circumstances, which is fully accepted.   The amendment we are putting forward does not alter that situation, nor does it say that abortion should not be regulated.  Rather, it says there should not be a specified criminal sanction in the legislation.  It does not throw out all the other stuff.  <\/p> <p>  I take issue with the points made by Deputy Donnelly, who said the criminalisation factor is included in order that terminations will not be carried out on the grounds of disability.  That is not the case and the law does not provide for terminations on the grounds of disability.  We are talking about a criminal sanction for breach of the law, where someone who breaks the law is still open to sanction.  In the circumstances the Minister outlined, such as a forced or coerced abortion, without the specific criminalisation provision in the legislation the medical practitioner involved would still be open to prosecution for a criminal offence such as assault causing serious harm or whatever, not to mention being open to severe disciplinary proceedings and possibly being disbarred from being a medical practitioner because he or she carried out a medical procedure against the law.  A specific criminal sanction is not needed, therefore.  Perhaps the voters in Wicklow are highly astute and have read every document.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#EE00400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":424,"content":"<p>They have good judgment and make good decisions anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#EE00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I am not being smart about it.  I am quite sure many of the voters in my constituency are incredibly sophisticated but I can guarantee I did not meet one person who said he or she was voting for the heads of the Bill because it provides for a 14 year criminal sanction.  It is just not true.  All the evidence from the studies carried out suggests that even people who strongly object to abortion, and who believe they themselves would never have one, do not believe a woman or any medical practitioner acting in good faith should be penalised.  That is not an opinion that is common only in Ireland but abroad also.<\/p> <p>  The problem with the wording \"good faith\" is that it might be a defence but it leaves the practitioner open to prosecution.  Given the background to this issue, there will be a slight barrier to access, and we all believe access is extremely important.  A criminal sanction is not needed to protect the foetus.  The foetus has rights, which grow as the gestational period progresses.  After the 12 weeks, the foetus has considerable protection.  A criminal sanction does not need to be specified for the foetus to have that protection and nor are the words \"ending the life of the foetus\" required to provide that protection.  I strongly agree that Deputy O'Connell's wording is preferable.  I am not saying that the Government has not tried to strike a balance but it has erred too far in the other direction.  <\/p> <p>  The Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, made good points in its observations that the only basis for having a specific criminal sanction is if there is a demonstrable public interest therein which would identify potential harm done to women that cannot be dealt with in the normal medical regulation and criminal justice system.  There is enough protection in the criminal justice system and medical regulation to do what we want to do without giving doctors, nurses or whomever at a later date that extra headache.  In fairness, the IFPA made the point well that if the Government believes there is something that causes potential harm to women, it should be listed as a potential offence and dealt with rather than being left vague in this context.  <\/p> <p>  While I recognise what the Minister says, he has not achieved the balance of what the Oireachtas committee recommended.  We were not referring to protection from a potential legal action but rather to the international community's recommendation of full decriminalisation.  It is necessary, especially when one considers our history on this issue.  I do not mean to be derogatory but some of the points made by Deputies are not really relevant to whether there is a criminal sanction in this section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#EE00600","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I suggest we work together on this section between now and Report Stage.

I may be incorrect but my interpretation is that someone who counsels a pregnant woman and recommends a termination in a conversation could be given a 14 year jail sentence for trying to get somebody to have an abortion, even when the woman does not take that advice and a termination does not take place.  I would like to have that clarified.<\/p> <p>  We are back to the language of criminalising and negativity, which is to approach the issue from the wrong angle.  The use of the term \"procure a pregnant woman\" is not ideal.  We need to work on the language to ensure it is fit for purpose.

We have already had a number of discussions today on a number of issues, including the future-proofing of legislation, medical developments and best international practice.  It seems to it would be wholly irresponsible for us as legislators to pass legislation on such an important issue to do with women's health and not keep it under review on the basis that our job is done.  It is good practice to keep legislation under review.  It is not uncommon.  The Data Protection Act of this year, for example, makes provision for a review to be carried out, as do the Gender Recognition Act, the Charities Act and the Disability Act.  Review clauses are also commonly included in European legislation.  The European Parliament is strongly committed to the concept of better law-making.  In this regard, it talks about the better law-making template, particularly the effective use of <i>ex post<\/i>evaluation throughout the legislative cycle.  Although provision for a review clause was not included in the original legislation, I am conscious that several members of this committee and the Oireachtas have proposals in this regard.  I hope there will be significant agreement that the inclusion of a review clause in the Bill would facilitate monitoring, including monitoring of the impact, operation and effectiveness of the legislation, in addition to monitoring of the delivery of services.  I propose to amend Part 1 one of the Bill to provide that the Minister shall, not later than five years after the commencement of the Act, carry out a review of its operation.<\/p><p>A number of members have other amendments to different sections, with references to a shorter period.  I ask that the committee consider passing this amendment but I am open to amending the time period on Report Stage.  To be very honest, I feel two years is probably too short.  I see references to two years.  It is too short simply because we are going to put new services in place in 2019 that need to bed down.  There are already many monitor and review notifications.  One could nearly be reviewing the legislation without all the information.  Perhaps one could argue five years is a little too long.  I am not wholly set on it but I have pitched the period at five years for the moment.  I ask the committee members to enable me to insert this review clause in the legislation.  I would be happy on Report Stage to engage in a discussion on the appropriate period for the review.  As I said, this arrangement is included in many Acts.  It would be a mistake not to include it.  It would also enable us, as legislators, to ensure that a number of the issues members raised today can be monitored.  It would allow us to address issues or challenges that arise in the review period.  I commend the amendment to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#KK00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":481,"content":"<p>It does not happen very often but I actually agree with the Minister on this.

Firstly, I welcome the fact that, even from a wide range of perspectives on the substantive issue, Deputies see the benefit of having a review clause.  I believe that is the responsible thing to do and it is what the women and doctors of this country deserve.<\/p> <p>  I should have stated the obvious at the outset.  Of course legislation can be reviewed at any time.  It is not the position that the legislation cannot be reviewed for five years.  Any Member can bring forward any legislation or motion at any time.  Moreover, the Minister of the day can make decisions at any time.  This is the constitutional authority we now have through the decision made by the people.  The difference is that we are including the word \"shall\".  It will not be discretionary for the Minister of the day or ultimately for the Oireachtas.  The review will be a legal requirement on the Minister of the day.<\/p> <p>  One of the Deputies correctly asked how it would work.  That is an important question.  It is about data &ndash; I agree with that &ndash; but it is about more than data.  It will also be about talking to people who have been providing services, including those consulting and visiting the front line.  It will be a comprehensive evaluation of the law, data and operations as well as how it is all operating and whether it is operating satisfactorily.  It will be external and independent.  It will not be an in-house job, if I may call it that.  We would commission someone external and independent to carry out detailed research, which would then be published.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Deputy O'Reilly's suggestion that the Joint Committee on Health should be involved.  That seems sensible.  I appeal to Deputies to pass this amendment now but, operating on the basis of the collective wisdom of this committee, I will amend it on Report Stage to insert \"3 years\" rather than \"5 years\".  I will give that commitment to Deputies today, but I would still like to put in the review clause on Committee Stage.

Others places were doing it better from a woman-centred point of view and from a doctor's point of view.  The point is to ensure we do not fall into that trap.

We were keen to ensure that it did not refer only to physical health given some of the worrying commentary we heard about mental health for many years in these Houses and elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  The definition in the proposed amendment, as Deputy Daly rightly said, refers to complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity.  I take the point that this corresponds to the World Health Organization definition.  However, I have a concern that the concept of social well-being is too nebulous for the purposes of the legislation.  Again, let us go back to the conversations members had at the all-party committee.  The committee sought to ensure that termination was available where there was serious risk or risk of serious harm to the health or to the life of the woman.  That committee wanted to be absolutely certain that the definition included mental health.  That committee also made a decision to exclude &ndash; I do not have the exactly wording from the committee report before me &ndash; socioeconomic grounds and so on.  My concern is that while the definition is well-intentioned - it is absolutely the World Health Organization definition - it is broader than what the Oireachtas committee charged me with doing in terms of defining health as physical health and mental health but not extending to social well-being.  The committee used certain wording in the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#LL02000","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>The term was socioeconomic well-being.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#LL02100","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I was advised from a legal point of view that this could be too nebulous for the purposes of the legislation and could inadvertently broaden the grounds.

We debated this matter at considerable length during the all-party committee's hearings and it has been a particularly moot point in discussions on the issue in recent years.  We were accused of being frivolous in some ways in allowing abortions to take place where they were not necessary.<\/p> <p>  We need to keep two points in mind.  First, a pregnant woman may suffer from a mental condition that leads to a serious impact on her health and well-being.  Second, she may suffer from a medical condition that is likely to have the same impact.  Both cases need to be borne in mind and we must try to cater for the eventualities.  For example, there are certain conditions that, while seemingly harmless initially, are not harmless if they are ignored.  It is important that they not be ignored.<\/p> <p>  The committee removed the question of socio-economic grounds as a basis for abortion.  That was the right thing to do.  It was in response to comparisons being made with jurisdictions where there was such ready access that people made the point - I am not referring to committee members, but to people throughout the country - that going a bridge too far might not necessarily be in the best interests of the proposed legislation that would arise as a result of the referendum or of its potential for success.<\/p> <p>  Even to this day, there are people who dismiss mental health as a basis for concern, but that is not true.  It has been proven to be a basis.  Similarly, there are people who strongly contend that a medical condition, including a pre-existing one, is not really a matter for concern and will be dealt with in the normal course of events.  That is not true either.  There have been several instances of women's pre-existing conditions accelerating at a particular stage of their pregnancies.  This puts the lives of those women, including some who already have children, in danger.  It was felt at the time that we needed to recognise the threat to the woman's life in such circumstances and make strong provision for it in a way that did not take a simple - this is a long phraseology - or frivolous \"Will I or won't I\" approach.  That would never be the case.  All of the evidence presented to us during the course of those hearings indicated that the women concerned, including those who had had an abortion, had not been frivolous about it.  Some research suggests that abortions were done on different grounds, but they were able to put forward at the hearings the strong view that they did not choose a termination lightly.  They thought about it and had considerable qualms of conscience about it.  It was at that stage that we concentrated to a significant extent on the degree to which supportive counselling would be available.  That still has to be the case.  The supportive element that comes from the third party is needed.<\/p> <p>  It is appropriate that we record at this stage the need to address the issue, which is already proposed in the legislation, and that it was never intended to be a simple or frivolous issue.  This is a serious issue affecting the lives of pregnant women who, because we in our legislative role might fail to recognise their vulnerability, find themselves in a difficult situation and have to make a serious decision in order to protect their own lives and ensure they do not leave their families behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#MM00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I am happy to leave it at that.

She might recall that when we published the general scheme in March, we defined this as \"shortly after birth\".  I think we all understood the policy intention - as a policymaker, I certainly did - that this was to ensure that the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities could be dealt with in our country and that arguments put forward by groups such as Terminations for Medical Reasons, TFMR, could be addressed.  Those of us who campaigned for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote very clearly and determinedly argued that there is a distinct difference between this and a disability.  I felt there was an effort on the part of some to muddy those waters.  We are talking about fatal foetal abnormalities, which is not the medical or legal phrase but it is the way that we all understand what is involved.  To have that, there must be a specified end period.  When I met clinicians - mainly after the referendum - and legal advisers in the Office of the Attorney General, it was clear that there were two periods from which to choose from a policy perspective, namely, the perinatal period or the neonatal period, that is the seven days or 28 days.  I opted for the 28-day period.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to speak for the Deputy, but I think this is from where she and others may be coming, namely, how can one know with absolute certainty that it is within 28 days and how a doctor might interpret that?  This is the key question that a number of us are trying to address.  I would answer by saying that the legislation includes the phrase &ldquo;in the reasonable opinion of&rdquo; and was formed in good faith.  These are clinical decisions and I am not going to do anything in legislation - nor is the Deputy asking me to - which means that I, as Minister, or we, as legislators, would prescriptively decide that.  However, I need to provide a period for guidance for our doctors.  We are saying that if, in his or her reasoned opinion, a doctor believes a baby which it is at this stage is not viable and would not live outside the womb for 28 days, it will be legal to provide termination services.<\/p> <p>  I genuinely do not believe that it is Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith&rsquo;s intention.  However, I am concerned that if there a specific period were not stipulated, we would have a very peculiar situation because we would be saying that this is only for fatal foetal abnormalities but also that it is for fatal foetal abnormalities that may not be that fatal.  We would be getting into a broader range of conditions.  I promised the people that disability would not be a ground &ndash; I am not suggesting that is the Deputy intention &ndash; but my worry is that this might be an unintended consequence.  We must provide our doctors with clarity.  I have not received any information to the contrary from any doctors, masters or clinicians to the effect that they are unhappy with this period.

Doctors understand what constitutes a neonatal period but they do not understand with as much clarity, nor should they, what &ldquo;shortly after birth&rdquo; means.  They wanted a sense from us as legislators as to what is the period in question, which is the neonatal period.  I take the point made by Deputy Smith, and I do so seriously.  It returns to the reference to the chilling effect and so on.  I do not believe that there is any chilling effect here, nor do I believe that medics think that either, although I am open to correction because the phrase &ldquo;in the reasonable opinion of&rdquo; is used.

We are trusting his or her medical, clinical opinion and that of a colleague in this situation because the opinion of two doctors will be required.<\/p> <p>  Another thing that we have not discussed much, but which is obvious, is the judgment of the mother.

I have sought to do in that section what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is seeking to do in the definition section.  I think the Minister has got this wrong.  I would like him to accept the amendments with a view to returning and potentially tightening up the position on Report Stage.  I understand that is a big thing to ask of any Minister but I will explain why I am making my request.<\/p> <p>  The Minister explained that the 28 days is the neonatal term and a length of time very well understood by medical practitioners.  However, the stipulation of 28 days will inevitably put doctors in an impossible situation.  What the legislation is going to state is that in a case where a fatal foetal abnormality is present and where the doctor involved believes the foetus will die before or shortly after birth - that is what was stated in the heads of the Bill originally - he or she will be obliged to make a decision.  If the doctor believes that the baby will live for less than 28 days, he or she will be operating within the law, and will be legally protected, and may terminate the pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#NN00800","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541502000,"counter":539,"content":"<p>If one believes the baby will live for 29 days or longer, one is no longer protected by the law and will be looking at sections 5 and 6.  These sections suggest that if one gets that wrong, a prison sentence of up to 14 years may apply.  That is an impossible situation to put any doctor in.<\/p><p>Where I agree fully with the Minister is on the need for absolute clarity for medics, including midwives, nurses, doctors and parents.  The place for that is surely the guidelines, which are reviewable and within the remit of the medical world.  I suggest the Minister could bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to provide for the presence of a fatal foetal condition.  That would allow the woman, or parents, and the doctor to talk about that.  They could decide case-by-case on the best way to proceed.  While the Minister is not trying to act incorrectly, he has got this one wrong.  The real application of this as the legislation begins to reach into medical decision-making and operating theatres will be wrong.  If 28 days is what medical practitioners want and is what the institutes are suggesting, that is great.  In that case, let them or us put that in the appropriate guidelines.  Putting it in the law, however, removes the protection of the law once the medical practitioner gets it wrong.  It will mean medical practitioners will err very much on the side of safety.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 36 and to accept my amendment No. 70, which does the same thing to the actual section.  I ask him to do so on the very clear understanding that he will come back on Report Stage with a view to placing the matter within the remit of guidelines and doing whatever else needs to be done to provide clarity and to avoid this very dangerous and impossible timeline or call for a practitioner to make in certain circumstances.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":540,"content":"<p>The amendment would allow a fatal foetal abnormality to be defined as one where a death occurs at any point after birth.

The wording should be changed to say \"will be provided for in the definitions and the terms will be provided for in the guidelines rather than in legislation\".  As 28 days is a set period inclusive of a set number of minutes, going over that may put a doctor in a situation in which he or she is risking his or her licence to practice.

It may not involve only one serious neural tube defect such as anencephaly, which is an obvious fatal foetal abnormality.  One could have a number of genetic and physical conditions overlapping and we could not legislate for every permutation.  We had those discussions at the committee on the eighth amendment.  I remember Fergal Malone speaking about viability at 500 g and twin pregnancies and all of that.  I can understand why this is here.  We need to get the best legal advice on it as we do not want to end up in the following situation.  If a woman has a fatal foetal diagnosis at her 23-week scan and that diagnosis is of a 100% fatal prognosis due to anencephaly combined with heart defects, and the family decides to go through with the pregnancy, it might happen that the child is born and survives for 29 days.  It could happen.  I am concerned, therefore, about defining the time period.  Could the people who advised that this was a fatal abnormality be sued because the baby lived 29 days?  What if the mother has the discussion with the doctor?  Do we have to bring the father into it?  We have to be very careful.  As a result of the committee's proceedings and while we will never cure anencephaly, I am against prescribing anything overly restrictive in legislation, especially with advances in other fields.

Different women and their partners will make different decisions in different cases.  The tragedy in Ireland at present is that the State will support and protect those who make one choice and send those who make the other to Liverpool.  That is what we are trying to end here.  As Minister, I brought forward the general scheme in March that tried to define this as \"shortly\".  That was clearly my preference.  The legal and medical advice on the 28-day period is very clear to me.  I am therefore not taking this decision lightly but, rather, on the advice of legal and medical minds that I highly respect.<\/p> <p>  I get the point as to whether it is better just to put this in clinical guidelines and I, too, have asked these questions.  The law of the land will always trump clinical guidelines, and I have no doubt but that people will challenge this legislation or endeavour to do so.  If \"shortly after\" is a vague term, I worry about family division on issues and about people in court deciding to define \"shortly after\".  Nothing in clinical guidelines will prevent this, so we must provide the legal clarity in which medics anchor their guidelines.  I was asked by them to do so, and that is what we are trying to do.  We have provided for maximum flexibility for clinicians here, as is appropriate.  We are not saying it must be within 28 days; rather, it is a matter of it being in their reasonable opinion, formed in good faith, that it is within 28 days.  We need to remember - and I appreciate Deputy Clare Daly's comments in this regard - that this is about fatal foetal abnormalities, not foetal abnormalities.  For it not to be about foetal abnormalities, there must be reference to a period of time.  That is what I am endeavouring to do here.  While I am sure I get many things wrong, this is a proposal on which I come to the committee with a very strong basis of both legal and medical opinion.  Because the matter of fatal foetal abnormalities is such a sensitive one for Deputy Donnelly, me and everyone else on this committee, we all want to get it right.  I am therefore absolutely happy and would very much welcome the chance to engage with Deputy Donnelly and others on this between now and Report Stage.  I am absolutely happy to be proved wrong on this, but my very strong view is that the phrase \"shortly after\" will provide far too much grey area and therefore, potentially, far too much pain.  That is where we are coming from in this regard.

It is not right for the Minister to try to have this both ways.

We are talking about legal and medical advice.  We need to look at section 12, \"Condition likely to lead to death of foetus\", subsection (1), which states: \"A termination of pregnancy may be carried out in accordance with this section where 2 medical practitioners, having examined the pregnant woman, are of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that there is present a condition affecting the foetus that is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before, or within 28 days of, birth.\"  This subsection is what we are talking about.<\/p> <p>  Because of the sections concerning offences, the Bill is structured to state that termination of pregnancy is illegal, with a long potential prison sentence, except in the circumstances referred to, and this is one of those circumstances.  Therefore, if we include this in the legislation rather than in the guidelines, any doctor making this call, sitting with a couple and telling them the foetus will not survive but, rather, will die either in the womb or shortly after birth must certify this and sign his or her name to it.  The couple then ask more precisely how long the foetus will live and the doctor saying he or she does not know, that it could be three days, 15 days or 30 days.  Every single case then gets written up and sent to Deputy Harris or whomever the Minister of the day is.  The doctor must be able to stand by the fact that the baby, if delivered, will die within 28 days.  In many cases the doctor will not be able to make that call.  He or she will know that there is a fatal foetal condition present, that the baby will die within days or weeks of birth, but will not be able to say, \"Yes, I can certify that it will be within 28 days.\"  That is the legal position that this creates.<\/p> <p>  The two points the Minister makes are based on the medical advice and the legal advice he has.  I do not know what medical personnel he has spoken to but I suggest that their advice is that we need clarity.  I doubt they are saying to anyone that the 28 days must be in the legislation rather than in guidelines.  What they are probably saying is that they need to know if the provision states \"shortly after birth\" or \"within 28 days\".  The issue of what they are saying can be dealt with by putting the 28-day provision in the guidelines.  I doubt medical practitioners, including obstetricians, are saying they need the provision in the primary legislation.  Perhaps they are.<\/p> <p>  The second point is the legal point.  The Minister says he has legal advice that he must give an exact time period.  If that legal advice is from the Attorney General, my understanding is he cannot share it with us as one cannot share the Attorney General's advice.  I have been trying to get that advice during my eight years in the D&aacute;il and the position is always \"Sorry, but the Attorney General's advice is privileged.\"  Therefore, if the advice from which the Minister quotes is from the Attorney General's office, which it must be, he is prohibited from sharing that advice with us.  The point of this committee is for us to tease out the legalities of legislation.  I accept in good faith that the Minister has advice from the Attorney General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#PP01000","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":557,"content":"<p>That is true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#PP01100","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":558,"content":"<p>It is also the case that the Minister cannot share that advice with the committee.

They have written a letter to all of us today in which they highlight the areas of this legislation with which they have difficulty.  Deputies will note that they are not talking about people swapping doctors and so forth.  The letter is from doctors involved in drawing up the clinical guidelines from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Physicians, including masters of our maternity hospitals.

However, the feedback I got from the medical community and the Attorney General was that this was too vague and that we should specify a time period.  There is a thin line here that we need to get right and the neonatal period is an understandable time period.  If we start going beyond the neonatal period, are we moving beyond fatal foetal into foetal abnormality?  That is where we are trying to get to.  I accept that there are people to whom we would all like to speak about this issue who could help cast greater light on it for us.  If there is a better way of doing this, I am more than happy to do it.

We are all trying to get to the same place but are coming at it from different directions.  We are all trying to make sure that doctors are empowered to know what they can and cannot do.  My approach to this is that it is of greater assistance to doctors if they know the time period.  In terms of the difference between 28 days and 29 days, as was mentioned by someone earlier, these are not exact sciences but are personal tragedies.  That is why we are saying, \"in your reasonable opinion\", knowing that we are talking about people who make these clinical calls already on a daily basis.  I should point out that these are doctors who are not unfamiliar with making these calls today.  The only difference is that today they are referring people to Liverpool.  They are making the calls, making the diagnoses and having these conversations already.  They are genuinely familiar with the time periods and with the concept of a fatal foetal abnormality and with the neonatal period.  The only difference under this legislation is that they will be able to then provide the service here rather than abroad.  In that sense, it is not a new departure for them, in terms of the diagnosis piece and the conversations with families piece.  It is the service piece that is new.  I am more than happy to engage on it further and I am not being stubborn for any reason other than my concern that if we take it out, we could accidentally cause a lack of clarity rather than what Deputies Donnelly, Br&iacute;d Smith and Clare Daly and others want to do, which is to assist doctors.

Have any other countries referred to \"28 days\" or \"29 days\" in their legislation?  This is important because I remember this being a significant topic for discussion.  There was discussion around this taking longer than anticipated and about mothers being very distraught because of what they had been told 16 weeks earlier and so on.  I understand the Minister's approach and support him but I am concerned about the emergence of this, about a definite line in the sand after which, as Deputy Daly has said, the 14 year period kicks in.

I am seeking this change because I was approached by quite a number of people who are very concerned about disability and other reasons for which people might seek terminations.  It hinges on viability and the fact that a termination is possible up to the point where there is a viable foetus and a potentially viable early birth.  There are three issues involved.  The first is a simple drafting issue, which is dealt with via the amendment.  The amendment simply states that we should take the definition of \"viability\", word for word, and move it to section 10.  In that way, when people read the conditions under which a termination is possible, they will state, first, that there is a risk to the life or serious harm to the health of the pregnant woman, second, that the foetus has not reached viability - the meaning in this regard is outlined in the section - and, third, that it is appropriate to carry out the termination in order to avert the risks to life and health.<\/p> <p>  In terms of where I believe there may be an error in the drafting, the definition of \"viability\" in section 9 states, \"\"viability\" means the point in a pregnancy at which, in the reasonable opinion of a medical practitioner ...\".  However, section 10 states, \"A termination [of pregnancy] may be carried out in accordance with this section where 2 medical practitioners ...\".  In section 9, \"viability\" is defined as one medical practitioner but in the main section where it is used it is defined as requiring two medical practitioners.  The first issue is around drafting to provide absolute clarity and to state that if this is the main section where \"viability\" is used, then it should be inserted here.  That is the first point I would like the Minister to address.<\/p> <p>  The second point relates to viability and delivery.  As I have been explaining this to people, my understanding of the legislation, with this definition of \"viability\", is that it states that a termination of pregnancy is possible if the woman's life is at risk, if there is a risk of serious harm to her health in the cases of fatal foetal abnormality and in early pregnancy, which obviously viability does not come into.  If the two medical practitioners say there is a viable pregnancy, meaning the foetus can live outside the womb, with or without extraordinary life-sustaining measures, which I know we will debate, the implication of that is once a foetus could be delivered and live, the option of termination of pregnancy is no longer available and, therefore, the foetus will be delivered.  That is my understanding of the implication of viability but it is not stated anywhere in the legislation that if one or two medical practitioners deem that the foetus can be delivered and live, then the foetus must be delivered and live.  In the context of viability, and it all hinges around the concept of viability, will the Minister say, because it is not explicitly written down, whether it is the case that the implication of this is that once the doctors believe the foetus can live, the option of termination is no longer available and there will be an early birth or an induced birth?<\/p> <p>  The third point - other amendments we will discuss shortly deal with the same issue - relates to the definition of \"viability\" in section 9, which states, \"the foetus is capable of survival outside the uterus without extraordinary life-sustaining measures\".  I have spoken to obstetricians about this and asked what would normally happen in terms of an early birth and whether they would normally use extraordinary life-sustaining measures to keep a foetus alive.  They said that they would.  They said the foetus would be resuscitated, that it could be in ICU, in incubation, and that is their non-legal understanding of the matter.  When asked if they would throw everything a hospital has at keeping the early delivered baby alive, they said they would.  Some clarification is required on that because \"viability\" means that the foetus can live outside the womb without extraordinary life-sustaining measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#RR01100","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I will take those questions in the order the Deputy asked them.  The first matter he raised relates to the drafting piece, if I may call it that.  The drafters inform me that when a word that should be defined is referenced more than once in the Bill, it then appears in the definitions section rather than the specific section.  As \"viability\" appears in section 9 but also in section 17 - and this is a technical issue in terms of what the Deputy is trying to do as opposed to a substantive one - if it was moved into section 10 but it did not appear in the definitions section, how would we define it in section 17?

From the point of view of drafting, we are satisfied with that.<\/p> <p>  The second part of the question was if the Deputy's understanding was correct that once a foetus - a baby - reaches viability, will that baby be early delivered rather than terminated.  The answer is \"Yes\".  I can say that because the legislation states: \"A termination of pregnancy may be carried out in accordance ...\", and it sets that out.

The March version of the general scheme of the Bill which was placed in front of the people defined viability as \"the point in pregnancy at which, in the reasonable opinion of a medical practitioner, the foetus is capable of sustained survival outside the uterus\".  Defining viability by reference to extraordinary treatment would be problematic, as it is vague and would give rise to a range of interpretations.  It could potentially lead to vast numbers of interpretations and experiences in different hospitals.<\/p> <p>  If I am correct, we are speaking about the 12-week period; therefore, the pregnant woman would be very sick if an entitlement to an abortion was being considered.  If I understand it correctly, she would be in a position where there was a risk to life or a serious risk of harm to health.  It could be interpreted in vastly different ways.  I was very happy with the March version, but the July version references extraordinary care.  As I do of a weekend, I just happened to be reading the catechism of the Catholic Church.  In the section which deals with respect for human life paragraph 2278 refers to extraordinary and disproportionate care.  If the Chairman will indulge me, I will read this brief part of the catechism.  It states: \"Discontinuing medical procedures that are burdensome, dangerous, extraordinary, or disproportionate to the expected outcome can be legitimate; it is the refusal of 'over-zealous' treatment\".<\/p> <p>  I accept that I will argue with the Minister about this, but I am concerned about the differences between the March and the later version of the Bill.  We have heard so many times this morning about what we told the people we would do and what we were going to do.  The logic has been used so many times to say we cannot do something because we told the people something else.  We told them something in March, but we are now looking to do it differently.  The only change is that bit of the catechism, which is a good read.  There is also reference to socio-economic circumstances, which is another day's work.<\/p> <p>  I think of Ms P in Mullingar.  If a woman is sick and a foetus can be kept alive by extraordinary means, the Minister could be allowing something similar to what happened to Ms P happen again in the way this is phrased.  I realise we are coming at the issue from different angles.  Perhaps there are people present who know something different, but I have spent hours looking at this provision.  The law clearly could be used to keep that woman pregnant until the stage of viability was reached.  We are talking exactly about such a case.  The woman could be unconscious and a caesarean section could be carried out, even if she did not consent to it.  To me, it smells of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, from which we are trying to move away.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned and would like an explanation for the distinct difference between what is in the Bill and what was placed before the people.  Perhaps it is a cut and paste job or whatever happens in Departments, but it is extraordinary that the catechism could just end up where one might not expect it to turn up.  It was not used before and I argue that it did not get in there by accident.  I know that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith recently mentioned the word \"sinister\".

When we questioned Dr. Boylan at the committee, the figure was approximately 0.1%.  The amendments vary in their wording, but, generally, the fear is the same.  This relates to cases where a pregnant woman needs a late abortion.  The fear is that there could be hesitation because in the legislation there is a reference to the point of viability.  The point of viability changes with medical technology.  The question is how much such technology should be employed.  I do not have the answer to that question and do not know if anyone does, but essentially a migrant rape victim was refused an abortion for three years and ended up having to go through the trauma of an induced pregnancy.  Serious concerns arise.  The girl was suicidal.  I know that this happened in the past, but it could happen again.  I do not know what happened to the baby which survived, but I do know about the possible physical and mental difficulties.  For example, approximately 25% of babies born at 23 weeks have massive problems.  There is a real danger that if the law is left as it is, with a push towards viability, very sick people will have their treatment delayed.  What will be the outcome of such action?  Who will look after such a baby which might never have been born, except for massive intervention?  We must find a definition of the point of viability.  We must delete the current wording as it could potentially lead to very difficult cases.<\/p> <p>  I am guessing that this might have been introduced around the time of the referendum because of the outlandish pictures and claims made.  I do not know what was shown in the pictures.<\/p><p>They purported to show late-term abortions at the extreme end of the spectrum.  There was perhaps something of a rush to reassure the public that that would not happen.  We must reiterate that these are life and death situations for the pregnant person.  Nobody wants to see such situations, but they are sometimes necessary to safeguard the life and health of the woman.  We should not allow ourselves to be emotionally blackmailed, rather we need to find an appropriate wording.

This wording would have been of assistance in the Miss P case.  All of the Deputy's arguments would be correct if the section stated \"with extraordinary life-sustaining measures\".  If I was bringing forward a definition of viability such that a foetus would be considered to be viable if extraordinary life-sustaining measures could keep it alive, we would be in the era of catechisms and so on.  However, I am saying a foetus is not viable if it cannot survive without these extraordinary life-sustaining measures.  Deputy Donnelly correctly pointed out that the legislation could state the foetus would be viable if ordinary life-sustaining measures could keep it alive.  However, it does not state that but, rather, that extraordinary measures would have to be used.<\/p> <p>  We do not want this to lead to normalisation of the very difficult and painful situation outlined by Deputy Donnelly where doctors would have to go beyond ordinary resuscitation measures and so on which, in the normal course of neonatal care, would be seen as keeping the baby viable.  This is an extra protection for doctors and women and a more compassionate approach to viability.  The formulation in the Bill specifies that a foetus would not be considered to be viable if extraordinary measures beyond those used in normal current neonatal medical practice would be required to save the life of the foetus.  This definition is included to try to provide clarity that this is not about the ordinary life-sustaining measures that could be used in a resuscitation unit or neonatal care but, rather, applies a higher bar of extraordinary measures in order that doctors will not find themselves in situations where, theoretically and technically, they could take certain steps to maintain the viability of the foetus but in so doing would only cause absolute agony and pain for the parents, which none of us wants to do.  That is where it came from and what it is trying to do.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to discuss individual cases too much, but in the Miss P case it would have been a good start if the eighth amendment had not been in place.  If this viability bar had been applied in that case, it would have been a very different set of circumstances because the question would have been as to whether the foetus could have survived without extraordinary, rather than ordinary, life-sustaining measures.  That is what we are trying to do.  It is a well intentioned definition.<\/p> <p>  I would be interested in hearing the views of the clinical community and our clinical leads.

What constitutes \"extraordinary measures\"?  What is extraordinary today might be very ordinary tomorrow and what is extraordinary in Crumlin hospital might be very ordinary in Tralee hospital.  I acknowledge that the Minister has tried to define it.  The legislation contains definitions of words and phrases such as \"obstetrician\", \"viability\", \"review\", \"relevant decision\", \"health\" and \"medical speciality\".  What are considered to be extraordinary measures today could be considered very ordinary tomorrow, depending on technological, scientific and clinical developments in the medical care of babies.  A friend of mine gave birth at 25 weeks.  The doctors did amazing, extraordinary things and the baby is now in good health and running around.  One of the nurses pointed out that they did such things every day of the week.  For them, it is quite ordinary.  The inclusion of the phrase \"extraordinary measures\" may be problematic, which is why we have tabled an amendment which would provide that viability was the point at which, in the reasonable opinion of the medical practitioner, the foetus was capable of survival outside the uterus.   The section, as it stands, is too open to interpretation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#TT01000","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":627,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Donnelly who will be followed by Deputies O'Connell and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#TT01100","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":628,"content":"<p>The issue which the Minister and I have been discussing is whether \"extraordinary life-sustaining measures\" can be used when a doctor is determining whether a pregnancy is viable.  The key issue is probably short term versus long term.  My understanding of the Minister's response is that the phrase \"without extraordinary life-sustaining measures\" was added to avoid a situation where, in theory, a baby born prematurely could be physically kep alive; it might be brain dead or have issues such that the foetus would not be not viable but, technically, doctors could use equipment to keep the heart beating.  That is not a situation we want to see in hospitals.  I am talking about the immediate term.<\/p><p>As the legislation is written, a doctor or two doctors will make a call and say: \"We can induce birth and keep the baby alive or we can't, and if we make the call that we could induce birth and have an early delivery, and keep this baby alive, then that is what we have to do, and we cannot terminate.\"  Essentially, that is what the section says.  In other words, for termination to occur then the pregnancy must not have reached viability.  However, viability has been defined as the foetus being able to exist outside of the womb \"without extraordinary life-sustaining measures\".  Now, a doctor makes a call saying: \"This foetus is at a point where if we induce birth we can keep this baby alive and the baby could be fine and healthy but we are going to throw everything we have at this and use extraordinary life-sustaining measures.\".  As the legislation is written I could see people interpreting it as saying: \"We have to let the pregnancy get to a point of viability where the baby can survive without resuscitation, incubation or the aid of a neonatal intensive care unit, ICU.\"  Therefore, I want the term \"viability\" clarified for obstetricians whereby a pregnancy has reached a point where if they take a foetus out they can use whatever they need to use to have a healthy foetus, and keep him or her alive, while he or she grows strong enough.  Obstetricians would do that for a premature birth anyway.  In terms of the legislation as written, I am concerned that it is not what the Minister intends and actually says that when doctors make a call on viability we are telling them that we are defining viability as survival \"without life-sustaining measures\".  I do not think that is what the Minister intends.  In fact, he has just said the opposite which is that they will throw everything they can at the problem.  Unfortunately, that is not what the legislation says.  It states that when one defines viability or makes a call on viability, we are telling doctors that it is viability without life-sustaining measures and that is my problem.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#TT01200","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":630,"content":"<p>The legislation states \"without extraordinary life-sustaining measures\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#UU00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":631,"content":"<p>Extraordinary life-sustaining measures.

I cannot see what the problem is with the March version as I imagine it was cleared with the Attorney General.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider the word \"extraordinary\" and, as Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has asked, what is meant by extraordinary versus ordinary.  I spent a long time in an intensive care unit with a neonate one time so I can attest to the fact that medical staff do extraordinary things in such units and throw the kitchen sink at such cases.  Sometimes when things get really bad they make a call to do something according to guidelines or whatever, and their actions often save the baby or improve life.  I have been there and seen that they make decisions on the hop, obviously the best clinically supported decisions.  We must focus on what is routine and normal medical practice.  If I may, I shall read the amendment.  If the legislation were to be amended, as I have suggested, then it would read: <\/p> <p>\"\"viability\" means the point in a pregnancy at which, in the reasonable opinion of a medical practitioner, the foetus is capable of survival outside the uterus with reasonable medical care\".  I believe that the words \"reasonable\" and \"ordinary\" are almost equal.  I do not want to fall out with Deputy Donnelly.  He explained the legislation very well compared with how I read it.  I would much prefer if my amendment were accepted and the words \"with reasonable medical care\" inserted.  If the legislation is as Deputy Donnelly has suggested then we should be very careful that the interpretation of \"extraordinary measures\" in the clinical guidelines is exceptionally clear.<\/p> <p>  In hospitals, service providers or wherever that have religious codes of ethics, we must ensure that under no circumstances can the religious codes of ethics of a particular organisation trump clinical guidelines.  I say that because we cannot have a situation where a woman in this situation ends up in a bad situation in a hospital with religious codes of ethics that use this sort of interpretation.  I know and accept what Deputy Donnelly is trying to do with his amendment.  I really do not see, if we went back to the March version, what the unintended consequences could be but I am willing to work with him on this matter to make things right.  We, or those of us who want this to happen, need to be assured before Report Stage that we will not end up in a situation where the legislation can be subject to misinterpretation because at the end of the day it is all going to affect the women who are pregnant.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#UU00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":633,"content":"<p>Many of us on this side agree with the difficulty but probably for different or polar opposite reasons.

We are all trying to land on the same point here.  There are things that we have to be prescriptive about in legislation, and we had that debate a few minutes ago when we discussed timelines and grounds.  There are other things that we should not be prescriptive about, and I do not think the doctors think we should be either.  For example, we have not defined on purpose what reasonable opinion is or in good faith because we have to allow doctors, who know what they are doing and are working with, which is probably the wrong phrase to use, to consult and make decisions.  They are consulting with the woman on her medical choices as well, particularly medical choices that are going to directly affect her health or life in a very serious way in these situations.  We are providing an opportunity here to define what we need to define and to not define what, quite frankly, the doctors are better to define.  I am sure we are going to continue to debate what is appropriate to define and not define.  In this case I think our doctors know what is meant by the term \"extraordinary\" because it above and beyond what they would do if a woman today, in her full health, walked into a hospital to have a birth and had a baby prematurely.

I suggest that we actually ask the people who are writing the clinical guidelines, the medical colleges, their views on this issue and on the word \"extraordinary\".  Perhaps Deputy O'Connell's wording or Deputy Donnelly's is better.  I am not precious about the wording.  I am trying to make sure that the doctor knows that this is not the normal or regular situation where a woman has gone in and is about to have her baby early.  This is a very particular situation in which there is a risk to the woman's health or to her life and in which doctors have to make decisions.

This defines viability in terms of the survival of the foetus outside of the womb \"without extraordinary life-sustaining measures\".  That is its definition.  We are telling the obstetricians that when they are making calls as to whether a pregnancy is viable, the foetus must be able to live without \"extraordinary life-sustaining measures\" after delivery.

Section 10(1)(b) provides that reassurance.  Quite frankly, even if it was not in legislation I believe that any master of any maternity hospital would say that is what he or she would do anyway.  That is what doctors do.  They try to deliver viable babies.  Obviously section 10(1)(b) is not replicated in section 11 because if there is an emergency risk to a woman's life or health, the viability test does not apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#VV02000","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":660,"content":"<p>To be honest, I was not actually going to say anything but the more people talk, the more confusing it gets.

The Bill as it stands does not allow a voice for the pregnant woman, the person most affected by this section.  That has to be corrected.  It could be done in a number of ways, for example by the Minister supporting the amendments which provide for the ascertaining of the views of the woman.  Amendment No. 54 is similar to amendment No. 44 tabled by Deputy Donnelly, and reads, \"to give effect to the pregnant person's wishes\".  The language in amendment No. 54 is much stronger.<\/p><p>This is necessary because it is up to the doctors and they can override the person.  There is a case, which I might consider it on Report Stage, for even adding a clause, after (a), (b) and (c), in reference to a risk to health, along the lines of \"and the pregnant person deems this risk unacceptable.\"  It came up in the committee hearings that different doctors have different views on what is a risk.  It is subjective.  It is good that we are not putting in conditions.  The patient, as we would say if it was in another setting, should also have a say.  We have seen this paternalistic attitude with cervical cancer.  If we are serious about that issue, then we should reflect it in the legislation.  An example is a woman with serious health problems.  We have all read about, and could cite, cases where a woman has said she was not prepared to take that risk.  The doctors should listen to what she has to say.  <\/p><p> I support these amendments and perhaps they could even be strengthened so that rather than saying \"consult\" or \"get the views\", refers to the woman being a factor in the case.  There is also the question of \"examined\".  This idea of two doctors examining the passive woman lying there speaks to that kind of paternalistic language.  If a woman's health is at risk, she will not get an abortion over the phone, just in case anyone thought that was possible.  The woman, of course, has to be physically there.  The point is that it is about a consultation or discussion on what that person feels.

The decision to have an abortion is a serious one, which people take seriously.  Our amendment does not seek to replace the examination; it proposes to add another.  Nobody says there should not be an examination but there are issues about what \"examination\" means.  It gives a connotation of that physical issue.  The views of the person at the heart of this, whose health is at risk and who is deciding that risk, are important.  Somebody aged 42 or 43 who has just found out about a wanted pregnancy late in years might be told by the doctor that if she goes ahead, there is a risk to her health.  That woman might weigh it up and decide it is a risk she is willing to take.  A younger woman, however, with children at home might think about it and decide she did not want to take it.

Deputy Coppinger pointed out that many Deputies have tried to do better in slightly different ways but we are all trying to arrive at the same landing point.  The amendments tabled by Deputies O'Connell and Donnelly are similar in that the idea that \"examination\" has a connotation that the woman's views will not necessarily be taken on board or that it is just a kind of a physical examination and that is all.  That is not the intention.  Without being pedantic or negative, because I support what is trying to be done here, there are some things we need to get right between now and Report Stage.  It would be excellent if we could try to agree, with the benefit of the legal advice I can offer, on improving the wording on \"examined\" so that it is much clearer that this is a consultation and a discussion and that, of course, the woman's views matter.  We are all entitled to our beliefs but not to our own facts.<\/p> <p>  Nowhere in these amendments, as Deputy Daly correctly said, is any Deputy trying to remove the idea that the doctor has a role to play and that he or she carries out the procedure.  As Deputy Coppinger said, this is not pick up the telephone and have a termination.  Truthfully, that is not what is happening.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputies Fitzpatrick and Mattie McGrath, this will still involve seeing a doctor, a consultation and all of the other stipulations.  It is more about seeing if there is a way of making the language more woman-centred.  In this case, it may also be more than just language.  It may also be about making sure there is a clear understanding as to how that engagement, if I can call it that, or that consultation is meant to work.   To state the obvious, much of this is implied.<\/p> <p>  The Medical Council's Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners, published in 2016, states on page 10 how any consultation is meant to work in taking on board the views of the woman - the guide uses the word \"patient\" - and that includes consent, etc.  The Medical Council regulates our doctors, not me and not the Oireachtas.  It tells our doctors how they are to behave and also provides for serious sanctions if our doctors do not behave in that way.  I thank the Deputies for the amendments which will improve the legislation if we can get this right together.  It is worth pointing out, however, that, while there is benefit in doing this, there is also a role for the Medical Council.  That would be helpful.  <\/p> <p>  I may have said this already because it has been a long day, but, if I did not, these amendments apply to head 11, which is important.  They need to apply to head 17 as well.  How the review process is carried out needs to be consistent with how the initial consultation is carried out.  I have spoken to colleagues about this and I acknowledge there will be issues in respect of some circumstances where a woman could be very sick or unconscious.  I do not suggesting that there are not ways of dealing with that but these are issues we need to tease out.  The three sets of amendments have all tried to do roughly the same.  Everybody might have their own preferred wording or version or feel that their version is stronger but everyone is basically asking if the legislation can be improved and made more woman-centred.  I am committed to working with all of the Deputies to do that by Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#AAA00800","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I am not here to scaremonger.

People watched those committee meetings, which they would not normally.  We are here, and people went on a journey and Deputies changed their opinions.

The terms are different and they are meant to be different if, for example, one puts the word \"or\" in front of it.  I will come back to the Deputy on that but I will seek a legal opinion and revert to the committee.  The sense was that the word \"avert\" was to clarify that the scale of risk of harm involved goes beyond that normally involved in a pregnancy and that an abortion would be allowed only where it is required to avoid such harm, but I will check out the reference to \"or mitigate\" which Deputy Kelly has brought to my attention through this amendment.<\/p> <p>  In terms of \"serious harm\", this was a point that was considered at some length during the drafting of the legislation.  I take Deputy Coppinger's point that this was not in the Oireachtas committee report, but to be fully transparent, it was in the heads of the general scheme of the Bill I produced in March.  I do not know about the Deputy but it was discussed by me and others when we were debating the issue.  We had many arguments thrown at us on the question of what is health.  What all of us campaigning on the \"Yes\" side were trying to do was to show that this was different from just an impact on one's health.  We are talking here about a situation where a pregnant woman is gone beyond 12 weeks and where the 12 week indication is available without specific indication and she needs a termination to protect her health.  We were trying to debunk some of the flippant examples that were given in relation to this situation.  The committee did ask me on page 8 in the definition of risk not to define risk, so what we tried to do was not put serious risk in but instead tried to define health.  Whether we got it right or not, that is what we tried to do.  Instead of saying \"serious risk to health\" we said \"risk of serious harm to health\" which is a different thing.  The qualification was included in section 10 to clarify from a legal perspective that the nature of the risk to a woman's health goes beyond the normal risk of harm to a woman's health which pregnancy would pose to even a healthy woman.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Coppinger rightly made the point earlier that pregnancy is a risk to one's health.  Being pregnant is more risky from a health perspective than not being pregnant, so we were trying to clarify that this is above and beyond the normal risk to health that comes with being pregnant.  For example, the risk would not include poor health from a respiratory tract infection or another easily treated ailment which could harm a woman's health while she was pregnant but which would obviously not have sufficiently serious consequences for that woman to justify a termination of pregnancy being carried out.  Unlike some, I do not believe women go through with terminations for easy reasons.  These are things people think through as they are very serious decisions so I am not in any way attaching a value, judgment or a view on the decisions women make but we felt at the time that there was a need, and we put it to the people, to differentiate between health and risk of serious harm to one's health.  That is what we were trying to achieve.<\/p> <p>  People are going to ask who will know what serious harm is, and again, if one looks at the legislation, we are not just talking about a random doctor, we are talking about two specialists, an obstetrician, who is someone directly involved in one's pregnancy care and a specialist in that condition which relates to one's health, so if it is a heart problem we are talking about an obstetrician and a cardiologist.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, we are also talking about the woman who finds herself in this situation.  Through clinical guidelines doctors will know exactly what this is.  These are specialist doctors who in consultation with the woman will be able to make the right decision for the woman.  I feel very strongly about the issue of serious harm because regardless of my personal views this was in the draft legislation that was debated extensively during the referendum.  People asked us what health means and we provided clarity in relation to it not being the normal risk to one's health that comes with being pregnant.<\/p> <p>  I need to take a more detailed look on the issue of avert or mitigate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#CCC00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":767,"content":"<p>We are straying a little from our brief.

We were scrutinising the 28 day period and while that was serious this is important because of Savita Halappanavar and others.  For example, we could all speculate, and I often have said that if she had been in another hospital she would be alive today.  I believe it was random.  My point is that the situation is subjective.  Women's health matters.  It is annoying that one has to justify to the public why people's health is important.  We should not be so defensive about this.  Health is health and it matters.  If there is a risk to somebody's health from being pregnant that person should have a right to have an abortion and we should not have to apologise for that.  It is a question of degrees of suffering to which women are forced to go, which happened with Savita.  The point is that we cannot intervene yet because someone is not seriously enough affected and I am fearful that something like that could happen again.<\/p> <p>  We have not specifically mentioned mental health.  As has been pointed out, serious harm to mental health is more difficult to measure.  One could say serious harm to physical health involves this condition or that condition but we all know that people who feel suicidal do not even bother arguing about it, they just go to England.  They do not have the discussion because they know it would be too difficult but it would be very difficult for people with mental health issues that are ignored or neglected.  There seems to be a stage that happened between the eighth amendment committee's report and the drawing up of the legislation.  I do not expect the Minister to be perfect and adhere to it but some things were changed and there is a question over who made those decisions and then brought them into the debate on the referendum.

The specialist has agreed it with the woman and agreed it with the obstetrician and he or she forms the reasonable opinion.

I specifically remember Dr. Mahony, the master of Holles Street hospital, make the point that when there is only life as the ground there is far too thin a line between a serious risk to health - these are not her words but my interpretation of them - and that risk to health being a risk to life.  In my view that was the cause of Savita Halappanavar's situation.  One could not make the intervention until one believed it was a risk to her life.  We are trying to clarify that it is not necessary to wait until the woman is about to die and that the doctor is able to intervene at an earlier stage when he or she believes there is a serious risk to her health.  What we are trying to do in this clause is ensure that medics can interact at an earlier stage, before waiting for a horrific situation where the woman is at risk of losing her life.  I am not being facetious but we are not trying to say that one can have a termination in Ireland on the broad ground of health.  We can all have health issues, particularly pregnant women, so it must be a serious risk.<\/p> <p>  We know what we are trying to do here.  There is a broad situation in early pregnancy, where there is no specific indication required and it is a woman's choice made in consultation with her doctor.  After that we are saying it is illegal in Ireland to have a termination beyond 12 weeks except where there is a risk to the woman's life or a serious risk to her health before it gets to that or there is a fatal foetal abnormality or an emergency.  That is where we are trying to go.  There is no broader ground in the proposition that was put to the people which referred to terminations on broader health grounds.  Our medics know what they are trying to identify, which is making sure they can make the intervention before the risk becomes a risk to life.  No woman in this country should have to wait until there is a risk to her life before a doctor can make an intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#DDD00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":778,"content":"<p>No woman should have to wait until there is serious harm to her health either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#DDD00700","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":779,"content":"<p>The Deputy can have that view.

I am not being facetious about this because I do not believe any woman decides to have a termination lightly and nobody should attribute that to what I am about to say.  However, I referred to the respiratory tract infection that could be treated satisfactorily in other ways.  Out of respect to women in this discussion, we also must note that these are women who wish to have their babies.  We cannot presume the default position here is, as some people did on the opposite side of the debate during the referendum campaign, that the woman would not want to have her pregnancy or would make these decisions lightly.  It is beyond 12 weeks and it is probably a very much wanted pregnancy, but something has happened which means that continuing the pregnancy will risk the woman's health and the best way of resolving that risk is, sadly, a termination.

We have had various discussions on these issues.  The amendment seeks to change the wording &quot;it is appropriate to carry out a termination&quot; to &quot;it is necessary to carry out a termination&quot;.  I have tabled the amendment is on behalf of others who feel very strongly about this issue.  They have a different view on it to mine but they hold it very sincerely and deeply.  This matters a lot to them.  It is one word but it matters a lot.  Their view is that we should state it is necessary to carry out a termination of pregnancy.  That is it.  My hope is it does not change the legal situation and that it respects many views throughout the country.  I hope it is quite a simple change that we can achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#EEE01800","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":817,"content":"<p>I note it is Deputy Donnelly who tabled the amendment and that perhaps it is contrary to his personal views but he has tabled it on behalf of colleagues of his.

It is largely the opposite to many of the conversations we had earlier about making sure our doctors have the flexibility and clarity to make clinical decisions.<\/p> <p>  I believe the word \"necessary\" to be too prescriptive based on my interactions with doctors and on the legal advice.  The word we are using in the Bill, which is \"appropriate\", has been considered from a medical perspective with a view to ensuring flexibility for medical practitioners practising in the field.  For the Deputies' colleagues who are coming at it from this perspective, flexibility does not mean no regulation.  I suggest the legislation is already very regulated in terms of what a doctor must do and consider.  To use wording other than that currently used in the Bill could have implications for obstetric practice and I believe that, intentionally or otherwise, it could have a chilling effect on the provision of the service or for medical practice in the area more generally because a doctor would have to ensure it is necessary as opposed to appropriate.  How will doctors be satisfied it is absolutely 100% necessary as opposed to trusting their clinical judgment and their interaction with the woman?  I am coming at this from a point of view which, in fairness, I believe is that of the Deputy also, of trusting the clinical judgment of specialists and experts in this area and trusting the clinical guidelines.  Legally, my advice is this would be too prescriptive and would not provide the flexibility for medical practitioners to do their job to make clinical decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#EEE01900","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":818,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 51 would require doctors to certify that it was necessary to save life or health.

Amendment No. 58 in my name would provide that, if the certifying medical practitioner was not available to carry out the termination certified as necessary or appropriate, another medical practitioner would be able to carry it out.  The Minister has referenced advice he has received from the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  They wrote a letter to him which they copied to the committee, specifically on this point, on which they were very strong and said the legislation, as it had been tabled, was completely unworkable.  This is a really serious issue.  They pointed out that a certifying obstetrician might not be available an hour, 12 hours, a day or four days later.  He or she might be called to another emergency, might not be working in the hospital later that day, might be on leave, get sick, work across multiple sites and so on.

From the advice I have been given, it is unworkable in a practical sense.  I know there are issues with one doctor certifying a patient and another doctor carrying out a procedure based on that certification.  Fundamental to being a registered medical professional, whether a pharmacist or doctor, is that one is in charge of one's own decision at that time.  It is not as simple to change it in the way Deputy Donnelly is suggesting but it needs to be addressed in a practical way that is workable for doctors and women.  We want to make sure that in any case where there is double certification or complications that we do not end up with women stacking up with three-day waits or being told that it has been three days but they are not certified, so they are really on day zero.

Deputy O'Connell is entirely correct that we cannot have a situation whereby an obstetrician is responsible for carrying out a procedure that he or she has not certified as appropriate in his or her reasonable opinion because he or she will then take on that responsibility.  We need to come up with a mechanism and we will.  We are talking to clinicians about this and I am happy to keep this committee briefed as to how the second doctor can take on that responsibility without, as Deputy O'Connell says, causing the clock to start again, which nobody wants to happen.  I am confident that we can resolve this.  I am conscious that it must be resolved.

Deputies have tried to get us there and they are trying to get us to a good place but we are not quite there yet with the language.  We need to consider this under a number of sections.  We need to link closely with clinicians who are drawing up the clinical guidelines on this, above and beyond anything else, about what will work, in order that we can get the issue of certification right.  There is a practical issue.  If a certain obstetrician certifies a patient in a nine to 12 week period in a hospital, there is a three-day wait, the patient comes back and the obstetrician is no longer rostered, is on leave or is sick, there is an issue.  I accept there is an operational issue to get right.  The Bill as it currently stands does not address it adequately and the amendments do not quite get there either but we can sort it out together.

I hope that if we make officials and advice available to members it will inform our decision-making process.

The Minister stated that one could have a situation whereby the procedure and certification are carried out by different doctors.  I am trying to think of all eventualities.  What happens if a doctor examines a woman and decides that there is a serious risk to her life but the doctor has a conscientious objection to carrying out a procedure?  Such a doctor would be very unlikely to certify that there is a serious risk to the life of the woman because the legislation would force him or her to carry out the procedure.  When does conscientious objection kick in?  A doctor may be afraid to certify that there is a serious risk to the life of the woman when the only way to avert or mitigate that is to carry out an abortion which the doctor would be obliged to perform.  However, another section provides that doctors with a conscientious objection are not obliged to perform such procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110600002#HHH00900","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":869,"content":"<p>The issue of conscientious objection will be dealt with in detail tomorrow.  There is an obligation on the doctor to notify the woman of a conscientious objection at the earliest possible opportunity rather than do so at the end of the decision-making process.  That is a somewhat technical point.  Contrary to the arguments being made by some people, institutions do not have a conscience and, therefore, there is no such thing as institutional conscientious objection.  The legislation provides that in a situation such as that referred to by Deputy O'Brien the procedure should be carried out by an obstetrician and in the case of a conscientious objection care would be transferred to another obstetrician.  Those who run our large maternity hospitals and tertiary centres will be able to provide for such circumstances.  Members should bear in mind that approximately 20 terminations a year are carried out in Irish hospitals on the grounds of a danger to the life of the mother.  Those charged with running our hospitals must ensure that they can comply with the law of the land.

The Traveller accommodation expert group was established by the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, earlier this year in order to review the Traveller Accommodation Act 1998 and other legislation which impacts on the provision and delivery of accommodation to Travellers.  The expert group met for the first time on 15 October.  It has been tasked with thinking about the best way of approaching the delivery of Traveller accommodation, as well as providing the Minister of State with suggestions and key actions in the next six months.<\/p> <p>  The background to the setting up of the expert group is that A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to the establishment of a special working group to audit the current delivery and implementation of local authorities' Traveller accommodation programmes and to consult with stakeholders in respect of key areas of concern.  On foot of this, the Housing Agency commissioned a report, on behalf of the Department, for an independent review of capital and current funding for Traveller-specific accommodation for the period 2000 to date.<\/p><p>The review had regard to the targets contained in the local authority Traveller accommodation programmes and units delivered, the current status of the accommodation funded and the funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.  On foot of this report, the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, NTACC, advised the Minister to establish an expert group to review the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and other legislation that impacts the provision and delivery of accommodation for Travellers.  The terms of reference were drawn up in consultation with the NTACC.<\/p><p> These terms of reference were to review the effectiveness, implementation and operation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 with a view to examining whether it provides a robust legislative basis for meeting the current and future accommodation needs of the Traveller community, which takes effective implementation into account in the context of the recognition of Traveller ethnicity in 2017; to examine national and international best practice in the provision of accommodation for nomadic communities to inform the legislative basis for meeting the current and future accommodation needs of the Traveller community; to review other legislation that impacts on the provision and delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation, including transient accommodation; to consult all relevant stakeholders at local and national level, including Traveller representative organisations and other stakeholder groups represented on the NTACC and the local Traveller accommodation consultative committees, LTACCs, with such consultation to include an invitation for written submissions and a series of meaningful national, regional and local workshops and focus groups; and to draft and present report and recommendations to the Minister within six months of commencement.  <\/p><p> The Traveller accommodation expert group comprises three members.  I will not go through the biographies, which are contained in the opening statement.  The membership consists of myself and my colleagues, Professor Michelle Norris and Dr. Conor Norton.  Dr. Norton sends his apologies this morning; he is out of the country on other business.  <\/p><p> In respect of the initial focus of the expert review group, the first step taken by the expert review group was to gain an understanding of the key themes, challenges and issues on which to focus.  To this end, the initial actions of the expert group were a desktop evaluation of research papers and reports considering the findings and recommendations, a desktop study and overview of planning code and planning issues and collation of planning statistics relating to Traveller accommodation and an understanding of current expenditure on Traveller accommodation, Traveller accommodation broken down, annual count, Census figures and Traveller homelessness.  Some initial themes and barriers to the effective provision of Traveller accommodation identified by the expert group to focus on are land use planning and the interaction of the legislation and systems with the legislation on planning for Traveller accommodation provision; social housing provision, particularly, the provision of Traveller-specific social rented accommodation, for example, halting sites and group housing schemes, accurately measuring Travellers' preferences for Traveller-specific social housing compared to standard houses and apartments and the role of approved housing bodies, AHBs, in provision of Traveller accommodation; the increased use of private sector accommodation by Travellers either rented or privately owned, the push and pull factors, advantages and disadvantages associated with this development and how Travellers who wish to secure private accommodation can be supported; and key gaps in data provision which impede effective policy design and implementation, for example, annual patterns of movement by Travellers.  <\/p><p> The next step the expert group intends to take is to complete the desktop evaluation, including a review of planning legislation, and to commence a consultation.  The expert review group is now planning face-to-face consultations.  Later this month, the expert group will meet with CENA - the Irish Travellers Movement, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, the Irish Council for Social Housing and Dr. Anna Visser of the Oireachtas Library.  A member of the expert review group will attend the next NTACC meeting with Offaly LTACC later in November.  Wider stakeholder consultation will take place in November and December with written submissions being requested from LTACCs, local authority social workers and other key stakeholders.  We hope this committee will afford the members an opportunity to participate in this consultation and we are look forward to hearing members' views on the expert review of Traveller accommodation.<\/p><p>I thank the committee for allowing me to make an opening statement.

I warmly welcome the establishment of the expert group.  This committee has had a lot of discussions on Traveller accommodation and the failure of local and central government to spend funds allocated and to provide the housing included in the local Traveller accommodation plans.  There is an openness among many of us on the committee to see significant changes and to consider good proposals to allow us to tackle that, mindful that we are going to have local government elections next year with a fresh round of Traveller accommodation planned for the five years after that.<\/p><p>Part of the reason we asked the expert group in today was not so much for it to report on its work, because we know it is only starting its work, but for the group to hear the committee members' views and give it a sense as to where this committee is at.<\/p><p>We tracked very carefully, both before the report was published last year and since then, the chronic underspends, particularly in specific local authorities.  There is a mixed picture out there, which we acknowledge.<\/p><p>We are also very aware from our own experience that often there is an unwillingness to provide land and there are politics around the approvals of the Part 8 planning process.  There are complexities around consultation.  There are local Traveller consultative committees that work well and there are others that hardly work at all or very poorly.  These are some of the key matters the expert group will be looking at.<\/p><p>Many of us in the Oireachtas would like to see quite radical recommendations coming back from the group as to options for Government.  If one looks at the figures, it is intolerable to think that in 2017, local authorities overspent their standard social housing budget by a factor of &euro;100 million and had to come back to the Oireachtas and Government and seek approval for that extra &euro;100 million while in that same year, the underspend in the Traveller accommodation programmes was the worst recorded at 45%, with a number of local authorities spending nothing at all.  At a time when local authorities are clearly able to spend, even with social housing projects that can sometimes be politically controversial, they can get over those humps.  Clearly, the problem is not the system<i><\/i>of delivering housing<i>, per se<\/i>, but there are other factors at play.<\/p><p>I have no doubt, and I will say it publicly, that while there are many reasons individual projects are slower to deliver, prejudice operating at a community, political and management levels is one of the key factors.  We have to be honest about that and where prejudice is clearly a barrier, we have to find mechanisms to take those decisions away from some of those people, or at least have the sanction of those decisions being taken away and handed for delivery somewhere else.<\/p><p>We had a lengthy discussion at the Committee on Housing and Homelessness on this matter and there was a proposal that where local authorities had a track record of not drawing down the money to spend in accordance with their Traveller accommodation programmes, that function would be taken away from them, even for a time-limited period.  The idea was not that we wanted to take those powers away from local authorities but if that threat was hanging over them, it might add an additional incentive to draw down that money and spend it and if it was not spent, we wanted to make sure it was spent through some other mechanism.  We could not get agreement at that committee, so this was not in its recommendations.  The committee was split almost 50-50.  Given that since then things have got worse, we have to revisit that, whether it is in terms of the section 183 land disposals, in the Part 8 planning proposals or otherwise.<\/p><p>We also need to look at the approvals and procurement process, and Professor Norris has considerable expertise in this.  These are also factors in the delay in some of these things.  Perhaps there are ways of speeding these up.  The Government, for example, is about to increase the financial threshold for the one-stage approvals process up to &euro;7 million, which would give a development of 20 units or so.  There might be an argument for looking at having a specific one-stage approvals process for Traveller-specific accommodation if that &euro;7 million figure is too low.  That is something the expert group could look at and it could come back with some proposals.<\/p><p>Some other smaller things might be useful.  We now get a very useful report, the social housing construction pipeline report, each quarter from the Department which gives us a project-by-project breakdown of where all the new build social housing construction by approved housing bodies and local authorities are at.  We need something like that for Traveller-specific accommodation so this committee can track on a quarterly basis where the projects are at, which ones are being held up and why they are being held up, which would add that level of transparency.<\/p><p>Spend is not the only issue.  As the Housing Agency report shows, while the overall underspend was 13%, the under-delivery of units was 31% so it relates to what it is spent on, whether that is new units, refurbishments and so on.  We are keen to hear ideas around that.<\/p><p> Consultation on this is so important.  There has been widespread misreporting and misinformed commentary on the situation regarding the housing units in Tipperary.  It is clear from that that whatever about the detail, the consultative process failed.  Had that been more effective, I do not believe that we would be in the situation that we are in.  How do we make sure that at all stages, pre, during and post-Part 8, for example, or any other planning process, that the Travelling community, and especially the people who will be living in sites or units that are being developed, are centrally involved from the outset?  <\/p><p> Should we consider sanctions for local authorities in other areas of their expenditure if they fail to spend Traveller accommodation budgets and meet their statutory requirements?  I am just throwing this out there but if a local authority knew that its roads budget, for example, might be withheld if it did not spend its Traveller accommodation budget, it might focus the minds of elected representatives to do what they are legally required to do under the Traveller accommodation programmes.  I am inviting the expert group to be as radical as possible and to put as many things on the table as possible, not because I want to see local authorities sanctioned or have powers removed but because at a time when Traveller accommodation budgets are finally beginning to increase, not a single euro of the post-recession increase in Traveller accommodation funds allocated to local authorities has been spent.  If one looks at the last three years, as budget started to increase modestly, this has been completely underspent.  I say modest, and we need much greater spending than that.    <\/p><p> I appreciate that the expert group has a great deal of work to do.  I am not telling it what its job should be because the three people here are far more expert on the issue than any member of this committee, however, we are about to enter into a local government cycle and getting legislation through the Oireachtas will become increasingly difficult the closer we get to that and we need to be honest about that.  Therefore, the earlier that recommendations come back to Government, even if they are only initial headline recommendations around some of the legislative reform, the more conducive the political environment will be to consider them rationally and progress them through the Oireachtas.  If we are looking at very significant proposals in changing things such as how section 183s or Part 8s operate within a couple of months of local elections, it will make it very difficult.  If we do not get some of these changes in either just before or immediately after the local election, they will not inform the next five years of Traveller accommodation plans and budgets.  I am not saying that the work should be done quickly at the expense of quality, but the working group should be mindful of the political timeframe under which we are operating.  Many of us here would like to get good things through and the Minister has attended this committee, and I think that he also wants to get things through, but the space to do this is limited because of how the electoral cycle impinges on it, so it should be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#H00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":906,"content":"<p>I echo many of the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.

The role of local authorities in those underspends should be outlined.  The review should refer to the political activities and discriminatory practices of elected members who oppose accommodation.  It is important the review does not avoid or skirt around it.  We all know it happens and it should be discussed.  The efficacy of local measures such as the LTACCs should be referred to in a root-and-branch examination of the role of local authorities in delivery.  I hear them criticised anecdotally as not being useful and as being talking shops.  Will the expert group take a view on whether we are talking about reforming local authorities and applying sanctions such as those Deputy &Oacute; Broin outlined such that if a local authority does not spend its Traveller budget, it will not get its other budgets?  Should we be looking at something far more radical and not wasting energy on reforming something that is not reformable given the latent prejudice among elected members representing their communities?  Is the working group open to examining the establishment of an independent national Traveller accommodation agency?  In its report back to the committee, will the working group be specific about addressing the issues of underspending, the crises in people's day-to-day lives, safety and overcrowding issues?  Will it provide an interim report so that, having regard to the political cycle, we will not miss opportunities to get any legislation on the books?<\/p><p> The consultation with stakeholders will be critical.  Groups on the ground have been doing an awful lot of work and research and it is important the expert group taps into it.  In north Cork they have been conducting extensive data gathering and research on concerns among members of the Traveller community about accommodation.  Rather than reinventing the wheel, we could take note of that work and research.  It should be done in addition to the LTACCs, which would also connect with local Traveller development groups because they have their finger on the pulse of the issues people face on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#J00200","speaker":"1430","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":908,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I welcome the establishment of the expert group.  It is time to get to the bottom of exactly what is stopping the delivery of Traveller accommodation, whether that is political blockages, administration blockages or critical infrastructure that is missing.  In Wicklow, while we were trying to identify a number of transient halting sites, the lack of infrastructure to deliver sites was an issue.  I acknowledge there is a lack of political will to deal with the Traveller issue.  In some local authorities, the administration does not want to deal with it.  It is probably the only budget in any local authority that is not spent.  All the other budgets are spent.  There is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with.  That is why I welcome the expert group.  I will welcome the report when it is published but the sooner the better.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, we are coming into a local election cycle so it will be difficult to get decisions made the closer we come to that date.  If local democracy is not working, we will sadly have to look at removing it from the remit of local democracy agencies.  I am an advocate of local democracy but if local authorities are not willing to make the difficult decisions, the decisions will have to be made somewhere else, possibly at national level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#K00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":909,"content":"<p>When we have a conversation about Traveller accommodation or lack thereof, we are having a conversation about human rights and the denial of human rights.<\/p><p>The expert group clearly has important work to do and the recommendations it comes up with will be important for the Traveller community, society and human rights.  The discussion needs to be framed in this context.<\/p><p> I will use the example of the fire in Carrickmines.  In the immediate aftermath of the fire local authorities throughout the country generally moved to take some action under pressure of public opinion and with a spotlight on the inaction of the past.  What was done?  There was some signage and some fire-fighting equipment and smoke detectors were installed on sites and an element of training was given, but as the weeks and months rolled by less and less was done and at a certain stage it came to a virtual standstill.  Was the job complete when things came to a virtual standstill?  Very far from it.<\/p><p> I highlight in particular the question of overcrowding on sites.  I understand best practice, and what is meant to be achieved, is a 6 m gap between mobile homes, caravans and buildings.  There is overcrowding on Traveller sites in this State and in the city where I am a public representative, and the 6 m gap is not met by a long shot.  If we look at the halting site in Spring Lane in Ballyvolane on the north side of Cork city, if anything the overcrowding situation there is worse than it was a couple of years ago.  The fire safety precautions that were meant to be implemented nationally in the wake of the tragedy do not come close to applying in daily practice on the site.  Is it the only site in the country where this is the case?  I very much doubt it.  I have plenty of anecdotal evidence that it is not the only one.  I use this as one example of a situation that needs to be addressed with urgency.<\/p><p> There is an elephant in the room, which is the conversation and debate that was had in the recent presidential election and its aftermath.  It is not unusual to have wannabe politicians and councillors playing the Traveller card in local authority areas to big up their vote but this was on a level that had not been seen before in the State.  A candidate in national presidential election cynically stirred up and appealed to anti-Traveller attitudes in society to boost his profile and vote.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, that was done with some success by the candidate in question.  Against that backdrop, there could be a pressure or perceived pressure on the expert group to go easy or to soften the approach and come up with recommendations that do not rock the boat, but in the aftermath of that controversy I believe it is more important than ever that the expert group brings forward recommendations that are bold, radical and address the festering issues and problems that exist.  This issue has been pushed to the side for far too long, as shown by the lack of spend in so many local authorities.  It requires courage and proposals that match the needs of the situation, including addressing the human rights issues that are clearly present.<\/p><p> On the question of steps for consideration, a spotlight must be shone on the lack of both action and spending by local authorities, followed by proposals on how to address that.  Nine councils did not invest any funds in housing schemes last year and only seven drew down 100% of the funding.  In the Cork City Council area, despite the fact that there are at least 50 families living in overcrowded conditions, &euro;97,000 from a fund of &euro;1.1 million was spent.  In fact, more than &euro;4 million of the funds allocated last year in the country generally were not spent.  I will not labour the point as the witnesses are aware of the information.<\/p><p> The information provided to the committee by Senator Kelleher contains a figure I had not heard about previously.

That figure says a great deal about the reality.  Various ideas have arisen here.  One is the idea of having a sanction hanging over councils whereby if a council does not spend its budget, sanctions will be put in place against the council on other fronts.  There is also the idea that the powers be removed from the councils entirely and given to another entity whose job would be to do what is necessary and address the problems.  I believe there would have to be some form of democratic accountability and input in that regard, but if we are at the stage where we must consider that then let us do so.  The situation that has pertained for years has reached a point now where these issues must be addressed as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#M00700","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":918,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy Barry.  I wish to make some comments.  Notwithstanding the witnesses and the people in the Public Gallery, there is a great deal of experience in local and national politics in this room with regard to realistic views and options that could be pursued.  I have been through three development plans.  I am very aware of that TA sign, taking it on, taking it off and the problems we have around that.  It all comes down to clear communication and information in the local authority in that area.  It is about bringing people from all communities with us, not leaving them behind.  We do that through clear communication and leadership.  That leadership must come from the local authority.<\/p><p>I am loath to take it away from the local authorities because it will add another layer of bureaucracy.  They are best placed.  They know the demographics, the needs and the wants of their communities in those areas.  I am also loath to introduce sanctions because sanctions put up a wall.  It is better to bring people along than to put up a wall.  Introducing sanctions would be something I would do as a last call.  A solution can always be found; nothing is insurmountable.  I am also a realist.  We have 15 accommodation programmes for the Traveller community in D&uacute;n Laoghaire which are all well maintained.  There are issues with some; there are no issues with others.  We have some issues on private estates but we do not have issues on other private estates.  One tries to ensure balance and fairness in the system.  It is up to the local authorities to come forward with solutions and sites.  <\/p><p> A lot of information was made available to this committee.  Some of us took advantage of that.  I was delighted to meet with Anna Visser from the Library and Research Service who carried out a report.  She went through it with me in great detail in respect of different areas of the country.  It raised many issues that will need to be dealt with.  We have to look at the needs as opposed to wants at local level.  We also have to recognise that some Traveller families want to be in a permanent house rather than a Traveller accommodation programme, while others do not.  It is about the desktop study the expert group has spoken about and about getting that database together to find out the needs of the Traveller community.  Numerous other issues come up with regard to finding suitable land including objections from local communities.  Funding is clearly not the problem; drawing it down is.  There has to be a willingness, however, in the local authority to drive that.  Local authorities are under fierce pressure as of late in respect of the delivery of social housing but this issue has to be part of that.  I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy English, wanted to get this expert group together because he recognised that there is a problem that needs to be solved and that we have to recognise where those pinch points are and work on them together.  <\/p><p> We also have to be fair about it.  If there is a family on the side of the road for whatever reason, one has to be fair to the people who are living in that community.  They have to be kept informed of the situation.  We have to communicate with them.  We have to find out why that family has decided to be on the side of the road.  Is it because accommodation was not made available to them?  Is it because they were not included in the system?  Is it because the local authority is not aware of them?  Have all solutions been offered to that family?  If so, there has to be fairness for people who live in that area.  <\/p><p> There is a role for all sides to play in teasing through these solutions.  It is not about pitching local authorities against Government.  It is not about adding another layer of bureaucracy and asking another body to enforce this.  A group such as the expert group will come up with the radical solutions that are required and decisions will be made on the informed evidence which it will collate, rather than on the basis of one-liners such as those to which Deputy Barry alluded.  None of us agreed with the comments that were made during the presidential campaign but there has to be a fairness in providing Traveller accommodation.  It has to consider the need, want and demographic required in the area.  There has to be proper consultation, and that can be difficult at times, but there has to be bravery in doing that.  There also has to be a fairness.  <\/p><p> In my own area in Shankill, we have a family that is on the side of the road in a particular area.  There is no issue.  They are not causing any trouble in any shape or form but there has to be a fairness.  People are paying mortgages or rent.  There has to be a balance in the system.  It is hard to strike that balance and that is where the expert group will be pivotal.  By doing that, we will bring people with us.  Working together, I believe local authorities will play their role in delivery but that has to be done in a manner which we can all support, that local politicians also support and that delivers homes in safe communities for families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#M00800","speaker":"1246","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":920,"content":"<p>I thank members for their valuable contributions which we will take on board.  We are cognisant of their role and experience as public representatives in dealing with these issues on the ground and the valuable insights they can bring to the process.<\/p> <p>  They are correct on variable output.  The latest figures supplied to us by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government indicate 67% of the total budget for Traveller accommodation over the past ten years has been drawn down.  The drawdown levels are variable.  Some local authorities have drawn down almost all the moneys made available while others have a zero drawdown rate.  Senator Kelleher mentioned that in the past year, nine local authorities have drawn down no funding whatsoever, despite the fact that the Traveller population out of accommodation in some of these local authorities is high.  The nine in question are Laois, Mayo, Monaghan, Westmeath, Longford, Wexford, Kildare, Galway and South Dublin County Council.<\/p> <p>  The issue of Traveller accommodation provision is solvable considering the small size of the Traveller population compared to the national population. That is a starting point from which we need to work.  The policy and funding nationally has improved, been honed and reformed much over the past 20 years.  The issue is with the implementation of the policy, particularly the differences between various local authorities.  As part of our work, we have started to review the extensive volume of evidence collated on Traveller accommodation by the Department and the different Traveller bodies.  There is much research on Traveller issues and there is ample evidence of what the problems are.  It is an issue of collating the evidence, consulting with people and trying to identify solutions, particularly around the implementation side.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the points raised by the Chairman around trying to balance achieving output on the one hand, in many cases against opposition from local politicians and local communities, and bringing communities and local politicians around.  The system of LTACCs, set up following the recommendation of the task force on the Traveller community, has worked well in some areas but not in others.  There is learning we can bring from the areas where it has worked well.  That is a point we will examine.<\/p> <p>  In the local authorities where it has not worked, there is no doubt that needs to be some intervention at this stage.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the idea of a national body.  That has been recommended in policy since the 1980s but not acted on.  The challenge one faces is the particular local issues which operate regarding Traveller accommodation and the level of consultation with local communities.  The other side of this is that if we continue to work with the situation where there is such under-delivery and uneven delivery around the country, the problem will never be resolved.  In some ways, it creates additional problems for the local authorities that are meeting their responsibilities.  It is unfair treatment of the local authorities that are meeting their responsibilities while other local authorities are getting away with the problem.  Solutions such as sanctions are some of the issues we will examine.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of centralisation of the function.  Although, in view of the fact there has been success in some areas and the importance of local consultation, that would have to be a last resort recommendation.<\/p><p>Some of the other points raised relate to the need for leadership from local authorities and elected Members in particular, which I acknowledge.  <\/p><p> I will flag some other issues members did not raise in their comments that we plan to look at.  Local authorities are not the sole providers of social housing so we will definitely examine the role of AHBs, which have been the major source of social housing supply since the economic crisis in the late 2000s.  We will examine the potential role of AHBs in social housing supply, including speaking to a Traveller-specific AHB.  We will also examine the increased number of Travellers in accommodation in the private sector.  There are barriers to Travellers accessing private accommodation that we plan to look at.  The research commissioned by the Housing Agency shows that in many cases, Travellers are pushed into private accommodation against their will and actually seek social housing but in other cases, Travellers have a preference for private accommodation.  If they want to do so, they should be facilitated and barriers should be removed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#O00100","nonspeaker":"Professor Michelle Norris","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541502000,"counter":922,"content":"<p>I welcome the views of members, some of which are very practical in terms of very straightforward things.  I like the idea of being able to monitor on project-by-project basis, something that does not occur currently with Traveller accommodation.  In terms of the work we intend to do, there is a significant interaction between planning, the planning process and Traveller accommodation provision and not just at the level of local authority development.  We should remember that many Travellers also seek to make their own provision, some of which could be considered specific provision in respect of sites or halting sites for themselves - essentially private provision.  That type of development is not open to Travellers under our current planning system - certainly not in terms of the decisions that are made regarding those sort of applications.  Clearly, there is a greater link between the objectives of a Traveller accommodation programme and that being a material consideration in the planning process.  I hear the comments of the Chairman in terms of a balance being struck.  Where there is a clear link in the planning process and Traveller accommodation, that need to address local concerns can be met in an objective way that prevents it being a political consideration.  Ultimately, the idea behind planning is that there is local consultation within it.  Currently, the provision of Traveller accommodation does not seem to be provided for within the entire planning process.  When I say that, I mean it in the context of families who want to provide for themselves.  It creates an issue so Traveller-specific accommodation rests with local authorities and the particular political issues that arise in that context.<\/p> <p>  We are looking at radical proposals.  Some of them may not be very radical but we are certainly taking on board what has been said by members of the committee as Members of the national Parliament.  They are ideas that will, hopefully, be reflected at some level within our report.  Trying to address that balance can be done by objective legislation and removing the political capital that can be made from objecting to any type of accommodation and putting it into a more objective process as opposed to the current subjective process.  Again, I welcome the comments made around the table this morning.  The concerns that have been expressed about the actual spend when it comes back purely to local authority provision are concerning to the committee.  They constitute one area that we hope to see addressed in our recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":923,"content":"<p>Are there any further comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#P00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":924,"content":"<p>I have two small points.  Obviously, there has been a very public debate about the more excessive language used by Peter Casey during his presidential election campaign.<\/p><p>One of the things that concerns me, however, is that in my experience much of the anti-Traveller prejudice that is most effective is the anti-Traveller prejudice that does not allow itself to be seen or heard publicly.  It is what happens privately between certain councillors and managers and it uses a language which is a world away from Peter Casey's language and would insist that it is not prejudicial or designed to prevent Travellers from getting access to the accommodation they need and deserve.  We need to be mindful also that the most dangerous anti-Traveller prejudice is that which vehemently protests that it is not prejudice at all, but is something else.  I only say that because that is the stuff that has a much more negative day-to-day impact on the delivery of projects.  That raises a challenge.  Quantifying and proving that is much more difficult but it is important to state that.  I am not at all disagreeing with Deputy Barry, who is right in what he is saying, but it needs to be named.<\/p><p> The second thing is a small bit of the picture but it is still worth noticing.  We have spoken here about the global spend but, for example, if one looks at the spreadsheet provided by the Department for the Traveller caravan loan scheme, it is the same picture.  One of the problems we are experiencing at the moment is that even in local authorities - South Dublin County Council is one example - where elected members, against some resistance from management, manage to push through a budget allocation for a caravan loan scheme, they get into all sorts of protracted arguments with management about the implementation of that scheme and the rules that are required.  South Dublin County Council agreed a budget for Traveller accommodation before this D&aacute;il was elected, and when a number of us were still members of the local authority, but not a single euro has been made available to people because of arguments over what is the best way to implement that scheme in terms of the financial rules and regulations.  This might an element the expert group might look at also because clearly there are implementation issues with the loan scheme even though it is only a small bit of the overall picture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018110600002#P00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541502000,"counter":926,"content":"<p>Peter Drucker is a well-known business guru who says culture eats strategy for breakfast every day and in the expert group's considerations and proposals on the law and policy, it is very important to be mindful of the kinds of things that undermine implementation at a very ordinary level, as alluded to by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  One may have the perfect structures and the perfect law.  The law on the face of it is not a bad law but the fact is it is not working.  We have to understand what is under the surface, although not as under the surface as has been the case since the presidential election.  What are those impediments?

We sought information from the Department on applications for Traveller accommodation funding as opposed to approvals.  Some 100% of applications are approved.  We also sought information on the planning process, and the Part 8 process provided a relatively fast track planning solution to getting planning for Traveller-specific accommodation.
