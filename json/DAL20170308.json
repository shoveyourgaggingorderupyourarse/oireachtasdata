As the centenary of the issuing of the 1916 Proclamation is still fresh in our memories and the stated aim of the Proclamation being a new Irish republic \"cherishing all the children of the nation equally\", there are few more stark examples of how the reality of life in the Republic has failed to live up to the ideals of the signatories of the Proclamation than the treatment of Grace.<\/p>  <p>  It is the solemn duty of the House to represent not only the concerns of citizens who are not present on the floor of the Chamber, but the concerns of those citizens who cannot for whatever reason speak for themselves.<\/p><p>That is why I welcome and commend this motion.  I consider it to be an opportunity to finally make things right for Grace.  It is a chance for this House to make an honest, collective pledge that what was done to her was wrong and that it is incumbent on us to get to the truth.  Grace is entitled to that, at the very least.  As a society, we owe it to Grace to be fully honest, to investigate fully and lay bare the facts of what happened, regardless of consequences.  To paraphrase an ancient Latin proverb, &ldquo;Let justice be done though the heavens fall&rdquo;.  <\/p> <p> The Conal Devine report, published last week, examined why Grace was forgotten for a period of 20 years and was unmonitored by the health services for long periods of time.  However, questions remain unanswered, the most fundamental being how the initial placement of Grace in the foster home at the centre of the abuse allegations was supposed to be a short-term arrangement, yet Grace remained there for 20 years.  <\/p> <p> This debate is not just about Grace, it is about the entitlement of every citizen in the care of the State.  It is incumbent on the State to ensure the safety and protection of all vulnerable people in its care.  Every person who uses disability services, every resident of a nursing home, every patient in a hospital or an approved mental health centre in this country is entitled to expect and to receive care of the highest standard and to live in dignity and safety.  Every family of a service user places their trust in the State to ensure their loved one receive the best possible care with kindness and compassion.  <\/p> <p> It is only right that the immediate focus of the commission should be the treatment of Grace.  However, I am pleased to note that the terms of reference provide the commission with the means to identify other issues to be investigated, including those regarding other individuals who spent time in the foster home in question.  <\/p> <p> This is a difficult topic for many of us to speak about because it is associated with one of the most painful, traumatic and heart-rending stories that we have heard in living memory.  At the end of the day, all most of us can do is try to imagine and sincerely try to understand.  We can never give Grace back those 20 years she lost but we can establish the truth.  It is the least that she deserves.  That will be Grace&rsquo;s legacy.  From the bottom of my heart, I wish the commission the best of success in its endeavours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800003#A00400","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488967500,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for bringing this commission of investigation before the House.  I will be supporting it, along with my colleagues.  However, I do have concerns.  I believe certain aspects of what has been put before us need to be looked into.  I understand timelines.  I understand the goals of the interim six month review.  Grace needs answers.  Grace's family needs answers.  We as a nation need answers.  We need to know it will not happen again.  We need to know how we can prevent it from happening again.  We need to know that balances and checks and procedures are in place to protect future Graces.<\/p>  <p>  Other people who lived in that foster home should be listened to after the interim report is published.  I understand that Grace is non-verbal.  I expect that as many people as possible who lived in that house will be engaged with as part of the report to hear their viewpoints.  Grace's voice needs to be heard.  We need the people who were there with Grace to speak and advocate for her.  We need her care workers to come forward for her.  She is like so many others who do not have a voice.  We depend on people in society to provide that voice.<\/p>  <p>  I have concerns about where the five files that went to the DPP ended up.  How come Grace was left in this care setting for 20 years?  I have a huge concern about that.  How did Grace find herself in this foster care which did not have a licence at the very beginning?<\/p>  <p>  I know how case conferences operate.  When a case conference is held there should be a whole team in the room, not one or two people.  At this case conference should have been the social care worker, their supervisor and their manager, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE, Grace and her family.  Why was it not fully discussed that Grace found herself back in that foster home?  I have a huge problem understanding how, when 12 or 13 people go into a room discussing one person, with all the balances and checks, that they come out and Grace goes back into that house.  I need to know, as the Minister of State said, that when there is a case conference for any person in a care setting, be it a nursing home or residential care for people with disabilities, that the person's voice is heard, be they verbal or non-verbal.  We need to make sure the right thing is done.<\/p>  <p>  As a woman, the part I find hardest to comprehend is that in 2009, after Grace presented with bruising at a sexual assault treatment unit, she ended up back in that care setting.  How did that happen?  It was not just one person making a decision.  How could everybody be so wrong?  How could there be such negligence?  Why was there no communication or protection?  Where were the balances and the checks?  <\/p>  <p>  This commission carries such weight and responsibility for us as a nation to go forward.  At the moment, we are not going forward.  We have 6,344 people in foster care in this country.  As spokesperson for children and youth affairs I need to know, as do all sides of the House, that our balances and checks, our policies and procedures are working, they are robust and they protect the most vulnerable in society.  All of us in this House are their carers.  We are their parents.  We have ultimate responsibility to protect.  I wish the Minister of State well with the commission of investigation.  We will be supporting it, but there are certain questions that need to be answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800004#B00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1488967500,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Grace is a victim of a series of appalling and shameful failures.  Back as far as 1992, allegations and concerns were first raised about the suitability of the placement in that particular foster home.  There were allegations of physical abuse and neglect.  There were further allegations concerning at least four other children in the same home.  Nothing was done.  Nobody was held to account.  Forty-seven other children were placed in that same foster home right up until 2013.  Again, nobody was held accountable.<\/p>  <p>  In 1995, day care staff raised serious concerns about Grace's distressed state and found bruising across her body.  There is no evidence that any investigation was ever carried out.  Nobody cared enough to investigate.  Again, nothing was done and nobody was held accountable.  <\/p>  <p>  In 1996, there was a review carried out by a three-person panel.  Despite the allegations and concerns of abuse and neglect, it was decided to return Grace to that same foster home and that she should stay there.  The HSE has said that this was a missed opportunity.  A missed opportunity.  There are absolutely no words for that statement.  It is devoid of all humanity.  Again, nothing was done.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2004 there was a failure to move Grace from the same foster home.<\/p><p>Not only was there a failure to remove her once again in 2004, but her name was actually removed from the waiting list of a residential care unit.  Who in God's name made that decision?  Who in God's name is responsible, knowing what they knew, for removing Grace's name from the waiting list of a residential care unit?  Five years later, in March 2009, after hospital staff had contacted the Garda and the sexual assault treatment centre, Grace was once again returned to the same foster home.  The buck has to stop somewhere.  Two reports were commissioned, one in 2012 and the other in 2015.  The first sat on a shelf gathering dust for years.  Apparently it was three years before the report was handed over to the Garda.  Who took the decision to stash the report on a shelf and not allow it into the public domain?  That was a decision taken by top management.  It was not a care worker who decided a commissioned report should sit on a shelf and go nowhere.  What was being hidden?<\/p> <p> The review of the two reports carried out made 40 recommendations.  Does the Minister of State know how many of the recommendations have been implemented and how many have not and, if not, why not?  In recent days, to add insult to injury, the HSE has stated disciplinary proceedings are to begin immediately with regard to staff implicated in care findings, but who can trust it?  This is the same organisation which not only failed to act but was complicit in the neglect and abuse of Grace.  It did not at any stage attempt to remove her from the foster home.  Why should we believe anything it says at this stage?  Does the Minister of State actually trust the same organisation which for 20 years ignored Grace's suffering?  Now, after 20 years, just when the case has come to the fore and is in the public domain, the HSE states it will carry out disciplinary proceedings.  Why did it not do so when Grace was suffering?<\/p> <p> It is clear the commission of investigation must not only establish what happened, and I mean the truth of what happened, it must deliver accountability.  This is the one thing that has been missing all along.  It was not just a systems failure, it also involved the failure of individuals.  We need to know who was responsible.  We need to know who made the decisions at the top of HSE management.  We need to know about the allegations of a cover-up.  We need to know whether files were destroyed and, if so, who requested those files to be destroyed.  The word is \"accountability\".  We need to know why nobody was ever disciplined.  Why was nobody ever sacked?  There was a criminal investigation.  Why was nobody ever charged?<\/p> <p> I am not directing the comment at the Minister of State personally, but the commission of inquiry will not be worth the paper it is written on if he does not, for the first time, go hell bent on stamping out the culture of unaccountability in State.  This is what needs to come from the commission of inquiry.  Stamp out the culture of unaccountability which is rife in HSE top management.  It is known the length and breadth of the State.  I wish the Minister of State well but it will not be worth the paper it is written on unless this culture is stamped out and those responsible for Grace's suffering held to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800004#B00300","speaker":"1333","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488968100,"counter":13,"content":"<p>It is difficult to stand here on International Women's Day to speak about such a topic.  I welcome the debate, if the word \"welcome\" is appropriate when the circumstances are so horrific.  I cannot agree to the motion as tabled, although I acknowledge there is a need for an inquiry.  The amendments tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace are reasonable and reflect the need for a proper investigation if we are seriously interested in learning from this scandal.  However, our ability to learn to date has been very limited, and the common theme in protection is the protection of institutions at all costs.  To highlight what I am saying, let me start with the 1993 Kilkenny incest report by Mrs. Justice McGuinness, who only two weeks ago spoke out again about a lack of resources.  The report was presented by Deputy Brendan Howlin, who was Minister at the time.  He stated everybody was horrified by the report.  Everyone expressed their outrage and horror and all of the other emotions being expressed now about the Grace case and the other children who are not being covered by the inquiry.  The then Minister also stated it was heartening to read the investigation team had concluded that an early diagnosis of such abuse would be much more likely.  That was in 1993.  Following this, in 1996, we had the report from Kelly Fitzgerald case, which made a number of recommendations.  Two years later we had the west of Ireland farmer case.  A year later we had the Monageer report.  In 2010 we had the Roscommon child care case.  All of these reports made major recommendations.  In the Roscommon case of 2010, Judge Reynolds stated the children had been utterly failed by everybody around them.  Conal Devine, in 2012, and Resilience Ireland, in 2015, made approximately 50 recommendations amounting with regard to the Grace case.  The Minister of State is present today but he has not told us which of these recommendations have been implemented, which I would have thought is a basic prerequisite to having trust in the system.  We are looking at terms of inquiry that will exclude people and that will push the issue down the road.  What we have with all of these is an utter failure to learn and I have a sense of wash, rinse and repeat.<\/p>  <p>  It might be difficult to listen to this but these are major reports from which successive Governments have utterly refused to learn.  There would be no need for inquiries if we acted on the recommendations of report after report.  The most basic requisite for the Minister of State today is to tell us what recommendations have been implemented and which ones have not been implemented.  The research on the Department's website, which examines all of the reports I have mentioned, states some of the recommendations have been implemented and some have not.  Very often, the way recommendations are written in reports is not conducive to clarity and carrying them out.  We are back here today looking at a situation where, simply, mistruths have been repeatedly told and the institution has protected itself at all costs, in this situation at the cost of Grace and other children.<\/p>  <p>  Sometimes in the D&aacute;il it is difficult to keep going, given the political games being played.  Today is International Women's Day and I am standing here speaking about a young woman called Grace who has been utterly neglected.  Moreover, so have other children and there is no report before Members to tell them whether the recommendations of the two previous reports prior to the one commissioned in November have been implemented.  By my reckoning, more than &euro;500,000 has been paid to private consultants to examine our ill system and an institution which cannot provide the service it is statutorily obliged to provide.  Will the Minister of State examine the amendments tabled if he is seriously interested in learning from this and from the other reports?  What review of foster care in each county throughout the country has been carried out?  In a previous life I was fully aware of difficulties in various foster homes, including a lack of monitoring and a lack of inspection.  Will the Minister of State confirm to me the status of the review of all foster homes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800005#C00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1488968700,"counter":14,"content":"<p>This is a difficult issue to speak about.  This week has been a very difficult time.  The mirror is showing us how we did not care for children, did not want certain children and let them die and that we did not provide due care for this child, this young adult, this person, Grace.  It reflects badly on all of us and our society.  We have an obligation to try to do our best to make sure the level of abuse that has been exposed does not happen again.  I was listening to an earlier contribution about conference calls.  I have personal experience as a parent of a child with a disability.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will know that experience as well.  I was thinking of and reflecting on our own experience when readying myself to speak on this case and it was not a positive one where State psychological services were concerned.  While I stand up for and celebrate our State in many ways, our own family experience regarding the provision of psychological services in assessing our son and in looking for placement, services and so on would not give great confidence.  One of the biggest concerns from our experience is something similar to what we are seeing here.  It is a sense that the system itself was going to cover the system.  We were in conference calls.  They were an incredible waste of time.  Some 12 people were paid significantly and because, in our experience, they were not really addressing the issues that we were facing, we felt that it was a waste.  There was also an acute sensation in the waiting room where other families were facing similar circumstances.  There was a sense that the family was not quite trusted, quite right or up to speed with the approach taken by the psychological and social services.  In our own family, we were strong enough to stand up for our rights and our son.  We thought in our heart and asked many times what happens if one is not so sure or confident.  Some might call this arrogant.  If one was not quite of that same strength, one might be treated in the way that we have seen Grace's mother being treated over all these years.  This is not an isolated incidence.  There is a culture within the State psychological and social care services that needs to change.  While I welcome a wider commission and investigation into the specifics of this case, it raises questions about the overall quality and culture within the care services for people with disability.  There are many good things.  It is not all bad.  We have subsequently found significant services for our son and brilliant people within the system.<\/p>  <p>  We need to create a system that really cares and is not a box-ticking exercise of protecting against legal or other regulatory rules and having everything be done by the book.  We need a system that is creative and caring to each individual in an innovative way.  We need a system where the abuses, as occurred in this case, are not covered up.  That is the real story.  One of the shocking things in Grace's case is the number of times it was drawn to the attention of the system but the system sought to protect itself and ignored the cries of, and in this case the bruises on, the individual.  The international reports and Garda reports were all ignored.  The first thing we need to change in our system is to stop it from trying to protect itself where it is not delivering to the high standards we would expect of it.  As a parent, and the Minister of State would know this experience personally, the real fear is about what happens after the child turns 18.  It seems to us, as parents of children who are approaching 18, that there is a cliff where one fears that many of the services, many of which are very good, will not be there as that child enters adulthood.  That is why Grace resonates with many people.  It is the sense of believing that the child, the young person, the adult was in safe care, when the opposite was the case.  It is that fear that every parent, everyone related and everyone with an interest in disability has and which chills them to the bone.  The care we hope will be there in community, foster care or other systems must be something in which we have 100% faith.  That faith has been lost in this case.  We need to restore it in everything we do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800006#D00100","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1488968700,"counter":15,"content":"<p>We are back on this particular subject again, sadly.  It serves us all to ponder how we got here and how we have got here on so many occasions in the past.  The question arises as to whether we can be absolutely certain that we will not have to visit a similar situation to this in the future.  There are lessons to be learned, which include the need for careful checking.  The protection system must move into place not to protect the system but to protect the vulnerable in the event of a report, from whatever source, to the effect that doubt is cast over an institution, whether it be a State institution, foster home or whatever the case may be.  We have lost our way somewhere along the line, in the sense that protecting the system has become more important than protecting the individual.  It is appalling that a vulnerable person could be subject from childhood to adulthood to the kind of abuse we have heard about in this particular case.  There was not an immediate response from the system to ensure that this did not happen, that it ceased and that appropriate action was taken to ensure that those involved were dealt with in a meaningful way.  We seem to have a reluctance as a society about this and there is a sense that in the event of there being a question raised, we should perhaps not pursue it at all and perhaps should allow it to go away of its own accord.  Things do not happen that way.<\/p>  <p>  Reference has been made and people in the House have spoken about first-hand experience with their own children.  Those people are in an enlightened position.  They know what it is like to be dependent on the system or on somebody else to ensure that their child or young adult gets fair play.  We are in dangerous territory once we start to forget about the vulnerable and move into the area of ensuring that nothing disturbs the peace and calm of the system.  I have to say, and go back to what other people have said, that any answer to a parliamentary question should extract the maximum amount of factual information every time.  There has been a tendency in recent years to dismiss the value of parliamentary questions and replace them with freedom of information.  Freedom of information is fine, but the parliamentary question is the ultimate avenue and key for any parliamentarian to extract information of a sensitive or valuable nature.  It can be done without the use of names or anything like that.  It can be totally anonymous and the effect can be dramatic.  I would like to see that in the future.  Every parliamentary question should be required to be factual, no matter where and when it is placed or for whom or whatever it is about.  It should be factually examined and all of the people who tick the box, from the person who drafts the reply right up to the top, need to recognise the importance of the job that they are doing and the necessity to ensure that we have factual information.<\/p>  <p>  Why do we have repeats and so much recidivism?  Why do we come back to the same place again and again?  Obviously because nothing happens after the flag has been raised and everybody has protested.  It then goes away and everything becomes quiet and calm again and it is all over.  That should not be the case.  We should learn a lesson from every single instance.  We should learn the harsh lesson that once the issue has arisen once, it can arise again.  Where was vetting and why did appropriate Garda vetting not take place in these situations?  As a result of such vetting, why was it not ensured that vulnerable people were not under the control of people who, for want of a better description, were predators?  Why should it be that in the most sensitive of services, it was possible for abusers to abuse children and adults?  I cannot understand how that could happen.  How did those immediately involved make it possible?  These things do not happen without somebody knowing it immediately in the next bay or next window, as it were.  I know that whistleblowers operated in this case but not as effectively as we would like, because there was reluctance and reticence from those in control.<\/p><p>In this particular case, we know that the whistleblower did not operate as effectively as we would have liked because there was a reluctance and a reticence all of the time in so far as those in control were concerned.<\/p> <p> I hope we will learn lessons from this case and that it will be the last time we will have this kind of debate as a result of tragic circumstances involving any individual, child or adult, being abused in the way this has happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800006#D00200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488969300,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Today is International Women's Day and it is ironic that we are discussing how the State failed another woman, called Grace.  There is no doubt about it that she was failed.  However, I want to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, for stepping up to address this matter because it has taken too long.  He is probably about eight months in his brief, but I appreciate the fact he has taken it on.  It is important to acknowledge that.  It has dragged on for long enough and reports have gathered dust following one excuse after another.<\/p>  <p>  I also compliment Deputy John McGuinness and Deputy John Deasy for all the work they have done to bring this case to the fore.  I am a new Deputy but I know the work that was done over the past five years and it is important to acknowledge it.<\/p>  <p>  The facts surrounding this case are harrowing.  Given the deep and dark history of child sex abuse in Ireland, people are shocked to hear that a child who was in State care was again left abandoned and abused while in foster care, particularly when other children were removed from the home due to concerns.<\/p>  <p>  Serious allegations have been made by a whistleblower that people in a position of responsibility with a duty of care failed to safeguard the security of vulnerable defenceless children and adults, a number of them with intellectual disabilities.  The whistleblower is to be commended on her bravery and there is an onus on us all as legislators to learn from this case in order that we can prevent it from ever happening again.  I sincerely thank her for bringing this case to light.  It cannot have been easy for a new social worker in a new job encountering such horrors.  This person had the guts, strength and common sense to report the matter to her employers.  Luckily, the employers supported and encouraged her.  Only for that social worker, Grace might still be in the foster home and we would not be discussing the case here today.<\/p>  <p>  Grace was 11 years old when she went to live with a foster family in the south east.  Her mother assumed she was safe.  There were meant to be six-month reviews, but this did not happen.  Why?  This is one of the questions I hope will be answered.  Why was a child with special needs put in a foster home and not checked up on?  She was left there to languish and be abused.<\/p>  <p>  According to the recently published Devine and Resilience reports, this is when the litany of abuse started.  The foster child, who cannot speak, was in that home for 20 years.  Apparently she was subjected to physical, mental, sexual and financial abuse.  What we need to remember here is that this was not an isolated situation.  It took place in a supposedly State-supervised setting.<\/p>  <p>  While the reports shed some light on the abuse itself, no one has taken responsibility for the unforgivable failings in the provision of State care to vulnerable children.  The hardest part for me to read was the fact that Grace was found with bruises by her carers and was taken to the sexual assault treatment unit in Waterford Regional Hospital, as it was then known.  Staff failed to find a safe place for Grace to stay, after being in the sexual assault unit for the entire day.  What did they do?  They sent her back to the house of horrors, which was classed as the least bad option.  How can so little be thought of a human being?  How could she have been so wronged in her life?  It is clear that the manner in which vulnerable children are cared for by the State needs to be reviewed.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment foster parents in Ireland who, in the main, do a fantastic job, opening their homes and their hearts to vulnerable children.  This cannot be forgotten.  However, we must be 100% confident that any child being cared for by the State, or agencies acting on behalf of the State, are safe and not at risk.<\/p>  <p>  While the commission is undertaking this investigation, why not include all who lived in this home?  Obviously other residents will have to be questioned about Grace and the abuses she suffered.  These other residents will be essential to come to a conclusion.  Does it not make sense to deal with all the residents together, because they will have to give their side of what happened?  Since Grace is non-verbal, they will certainly have a large role to play.<\/p>  <p>  The national safeguarding policy for vulnerable adults should be placed on a statutory basis.  All Members of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il have a duty to ensure the safeguards are put in place in order that nothing like this can ever happen again to any child or young adult like Grace, and all the other Graces that have been let down by our country.<\/p>  <p>  This is not about finger-pointing, it is about trying to get all the answers.  I commend the Minister of State on stepping up to ensure this investigation commenced, because it needed to happen.  This and other revelations in the mother and baby homes have shaken us all to the core.

Responding to a statement from a senior HSE official in the area of disability, Deputy Fleming said he accepted that there was no conspiracy within the HSE when it came to the issues surrounding Grace's foster home.  I am not sure how he came to make that sweeping judgment because I am not so sure that people understand what actually happened.  Members of the D&aacute;il should perhaps hold off from accepting anything said by the HSE on this matter.  Deputy McGuinness and I discovered that, in dealing with the HSE on this issue, the first casualty was always the truth.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to give some examples of what is, and was, a cover-up.  The legal advice to the HSE from day one was to make Grace a ward of court to protect her, but the HSE refused to do so.  That was because they had concerns about a judge asking awkward questions on the HSE's failings in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2008, at a HSE committee on vulnerable adults, three options were discussed: do nothing, make her a ward of court, or give the birth mother information under a freedom of information, FOI, request and risk her being made a ward of court as a result.  It was noted at the meeting that \"this would lead to a disastrous day in court, as it would appear the HSE had done nothing\".<\/p>  <p>  The HSE took the first option, did nothing and denied information to which the birth mother was entitled under FOI.  The agency caring for Grace was then refused any information, medical or otherwise, because the HSE did not want the agency to discover its failings.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Conor Dignam SC found that to be a breach in the duty of care to Grace because she suffered trauma needlessly and started to self-harm as a result.  The agency then went about making her a ward of court itself, which would legally mandate information to be imparted and would allow a solicitor to instruct for Grace.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE then told the agency not to do it, and said the agency could not take actions unapproved by the HSE.  It reminded the agency that the HSE was its sole funder.  When the whistleblower told the HSE that they were going ahead with wardship, the HSE contacted her manager and board of directors, and pressurised them not to proceed.  The HSE wrote to her line manager with fabricated information alleging poor professional conduct.<\/p>  <p>  The High Court then chose the whistleblower as the legal committee for Grace.  When she again asked for information regarding medical and psychological care, the HSE again refused.  The HSE then wrote to the High Court - this is my favourite part - saying the whistleblower was not fulfilling her duties because she did not have the proper assessments and information, even though they were the ones withholding the information.  It is pretty twisted stuff.  It is almost Kafkaesque.<\/p>  <p>  One HSE official then innocently gave the whistleblower a psychological report on Grace.  When her HSE bosses found out they accused the whistleblower, through a solicitor, of being aggressive and abusive, and not a fit person to represent Grace.<\/p><p>When the HSE official who had innocently provided the psychological report on Grace found out about this, she signed a statement setting out that it was a complete fabrication by the HSE.<\/p> <p> For five years, the Conal Devine report sat on a shelf and the HSE refused to give it to anyone.  On 5 March 2015, the Committee of Public Accounts announced it had received a disclosure about non-publication of the report.  The following day, the HSE wrote to the Garda for the first time seeking the go-ahead to publish the report.  That is a serious coincidence.  When HSE officials appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts they told members the protected disclosures had been fully investigated when they had not been fully investigated.  They told us there were no procurement issues when Dignam found there had been procurement issues.  They told us the people who decided to keep Grace in placement in 1996 had all retired when they had not all retired.  They told us the Garda had stopped them from publishing the report when it had not done so.  They also told us they had apologised to Grace and her mother when they had not done so.<\/p> <p> Was this a conspiracy and cover-up?  Yes, it was.  As I have stated previously, it was a concerted and organised attempt to hide information and conceal the truth by a clique of HSE managers.  It was an orchestrated attempt to protect officials who and an organisation which failed people in State care in a catastrophic manner on a number of levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800007#E00300","speaker":"1352","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488969900,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I understand the motion before us on the terms of reference of a commission of investigation cannot be amended.  It needs to be amended and, following our discussion last night with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the whistleblowers, it should be amended.  It will not be acceptable if the House passes the motion when we know so much about this issue that is wrong.  If we accept the terms of reference, we will heap further abuse on the families in question.  We will become the abusers in this case.  That is what will happen here and I will explain the reasons for that statement.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State is aware, the whistleblowers first exhausted every avenue available to them in the Health Service Executive.  They tried everything to highlight this case but they were not listened to.  They were forced to contact the Committee of Public Accounts to deal with a procurement issue relating to reports that cost the State almost &euro;400,000.  It was from this examination that the story emerged, not only of Grace - that is a neat way of packaging it - but of 46 others whose cases we also need to examine.  We need to find out what happened in the HSE that led to this scandal being covered up since 1982.<\/p>  <p>  We need to go back to the time before Grace and humanise this story.  What about the 12 year old girl who was taken out of the foster home in question before Grace because her mother was told that she was attending school bruised, beaten and neglected?  When she made complaints to the South Eastern Health Board in 1992, she was told to shut up and not to repeat the stories and she was threatened legally.  When she removed her child from care, she had to seek care for her in Northern Ireland because the health board would not support her.  How disgusting is that?  This girl's case will not be included in the commission of inquiry's remit.  Let us put real words on this case.  The child was battered, bruised, financially abused and sexually abused anally so that today, as an adult, she leads a life of pain and suffering.  Despite this, the Minister of State does not propose to have her case investigated.  We should be ashamed of ourselves.<\/p>  <p>  What about the young boy who was placed in the foster home in question and who stated, when he learned about Grace, that if only he had spoken up about what happened to him, the case of Grace may not have happened?  He carries that burden with him.<\/p>  <p>  Then we have the case of Grace.  When she turned up at a day care centre measuring 5 ft and severely underweight, she was described in a doctor's report as slim and well.  If that is not an attempt to cover up what was happening in the foster home, I do not know what is.  She was battered, bruised, sexually abused anally, deprived of her money and neglected.  Is neglect not abuse in itself?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State has listened to some of the parents concerned.  I listened to one of them this morning for one hour as she cried about the abuse her daughter suffered and the quality of life she now has.  I spoke to the carer this morning who cried bitter tears again because she was not being listened to.  This was a major cover-up by the HSE, an astonishing set of events that resulted in lives being destroyed.  The House is now discussing terms of reference that are inadequate and that were not recommended by Conor Dignam, who said we should stop covering up.  The Minister of State knows that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800008#F00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1488969900,"counter":21,"content":"<p>That is rubbish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800008#F00300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1488969900,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Mr. Dignam's terms of reference are far more robust than those the Minister of State has presented.

As previous speakers pointed out, however, the commission of investigation must not be hypocritical by failing to address the cases of other children who were failed and who suffered abuse.  It must bring fair retribution for Grace and all other children affected by the horrific treatment they received in the foster home in question.  Those responsible for the years of negligence and lack of oversight, protection, advocacy and care should be investigated and charged accordingly.<\/p><p>The most upsetting thing for people hearing about Grace is the repeated failures she faced in being rescued.  This is indicative of how the voiceless and vulnerable in society are treated.  It is disgusting to realise that we have a care system that not only allows for this, but systematically attempts to cover up its failures.  A commitment must be given to all the other families concerned that they will receive an investigation, rather than waiting for 12 months simply to learn if they will receive one.<\/p><p>The terms of reference do not go far enough.  The proposal to deal with the matter in modules means that many families who have been waiting for answers are expected to wait potentially for years.  That is not right.  Are the reputations of the HSE and the commission now deemed more important than the safety of children?  If that is the case, I worry that we have not learned anything.<\/p><p>I am also particularly concerned about my constituency of Kilkenny regarding revelations last week that St. Patrick's centre sent children on respite trips to the foster home in question.  The centre and any other homes that may have arranged similar visits should be included in the overall investigation.<\/p><p>A lesson must be learned from this case, which cannot all be in vain.  The HSE and Tusla must make sufficient provision for all children in need of a qualified social worker, not only for a basic minimum period.  There must be continuity and consistency in the treatment of vulnerable children and people with special needs.  The <i>ad hoc<\/i>system of plastering over issues with minimal resources must end.  Otherwise, as we have tragically witnessed time and again, the risk is too high.<\/p><p>While this commission of investigation is crucial, we cannot wait for its findings before rectifying other cases currently in the system.  If anything, there should be an immediate examination of all high-risk cases as a matter of urgency to ensure other &quot;Graces&quot; are not suffering in a similar way as we speak.  I have no doubt there are other vulnerable and voiceless children in the care system who are not being vouched for or receiving the care they need.<\/p><p>We know this in report after report from the HSE.  In light of all that has been revealed in past weeks, the HSE and Tusla must make those children who are at risk in the system a priority today.  More social workers must be employed immediately to seek out those on the waiting lists who could potentially be in precarious situations.  As is often quoted, the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members. <\/p> <p> The events of the past few weeks concerning Grace, the other 46 children sent to this home and the 796 children's bodies revealed at Tuam have us all feeling unimaginably disgusted.  In this context, let us not forget that there are modern-day issues such as child homelessness, child poverty, children currently in care with substandard help and children in direct provision, who could all equally be as vulnerable today as those in the past.  The direct provision issue is one we must consider very soon because in a number of years we will all hang our heads in shame over how the children in direct provision were treated.  Collectively as a society and as elected representatives we have a responsibility to hold those in positions of responsibility to account and to vouch for our citizens and children today who are voiceless.  That is our duty and is what we should be here for.  The commission of investigation needs to be broadened.  It must address all those who suffered and hold those responsible to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800008#F00900","speaker":"1266","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488970500,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Failt&iacute;m deis labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo sa Teach.  I begin by saying what a difficulty it is for all of us as public representatives in this House as we struggle to connect and to portray collectively the outrage of the people we represent at home.  It is at times like this that all of us struggle, first and foremost with language and with putting words on how we feel, in trying to put words onto the moods of the people who are reading these stories and the heartbreak that is felt by all of us.  We must get the balance right when we come to talk about a subject like this.  We must put our emotions and difficulties into facing what happened.  A child who was intellectually challenged and who could not speak was raped.  In trying to deal with that emotion, anger, hurt and shame and in trying to put together highly academic terms of reference to govern an inquiry to look into what happened, we must try to do some justice and make some sense of what has happened.  It is an extraordinarily difficult task for us to do.<\/p>  <p>  We can be political about it but there is no point in doing that as this is way beyond politics.  It is too far gone down that road.  The people out there are not interested in whether it is Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or Sinn F&eacute;in that are behind it.  They just want answers and they want them fast.  People want answers to the questions that are floating around.  I must declare an interest as a foster carer myself.  I mind children like Grace and others.  What do we owe them?  As a society and as legislators we must make sure there is not another Grace out there.  How do we do that?  We need to get to the answers as quickly as possible.  I have no beef to hold here in defending the Government line.  I have not been asked to come out here to defend the current terms of reference but I make the point on my own behalf that if we include another 46 children, along with Grace, and set up the commission to look for answers to 47 cases, then it will double, treble or quadruple the time it will take to get to the answers and the answers will all be the same.  The answers are the failings, corruption and rottenness at the core of the people who had responsibility for these children.  I am talking about the HSE at the time.  If we go through each one of the 47 cases they will all point back to the same failings, to the same State body and the same State organisation.  I believe that a first module needs to be concluded as quickly as possible because there can be other cases such as Grace's this very day.  We can all express our moral outrage, shame and indignation around what has happened in the past, but what about the 6,344 children who are in the care of the State today?  We owe it to them to get to the bottom of the system's failings.  Of course we all want to see justice for Grace and the others but I perceive the most pressing and urgent priority to be to get to the heart of what went wrong within the HSE.  There was a social worker who was in charge of this family - called the link worker - and who takes responsibility for the family providing the care.  I have one myself, that is, the person who is responsible for my actions and to see how I behave when I am caring for children who belong to very vulnerable families who cannot care for the children themselves and when that great honour is left with me, my wife and my children.  Why did the link worker involved in Grace's case not do his or her job?  We need to know whether this still potentially is happening today or whether we have enough robust systems, checks and balances in place to protect it.  I accept 100% the Minister of State's bona fides on this matter.  I urge him to get on with establishing the commission and to get it as narrowly defined as possible to get real answers about what happened within the system.  He should include in the same terms of reference a commitment to have a second module to look at the other 46 cases.  When we look at the first case, I believe we will learn an awful lot, which will guide us when looking at the next 46 cases.  We did the same with the McCabe commission and the other whistleblowers.  There are many people out there looking for justice but we also have a responsibility to the here and now, to what we can control, to what we can protect and to what we can check to ensure the most vulnerable children in the State are being cared for to the best of our ability.  We owe it to them and we owe it to them now.  I plead with and urge all Deputies to work collaboratively and collectively and to put aside their differences by getting behind one commission of investigation that will get to the rotten truth of why the system let us down so badly in the case of Grace, with a commitment contained therein to look at the other cases.  These investigations will not get justice for these people; there is a separate parallel process to get justice for these victims.  As a State, we need to answer the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800009#G00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1488970500,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

I believe that we are all struggling to find the language but first we must ensure that the commission gets up and running and that its terms of reference are as they should be.  As my party leader stated last night, the terms simply must be wider than Grace alone.  There were 47 other children in that house.<\/p>  <p>  Under the heading \"Care and Decision Making in respect of Others\", Mr. Conor Dignam SC has recommended that the commission should investigate a range of matters broader than the Grace case, including all claims made in the protected disclosures that gave rise to the inquiry, the care received by all persons placed in the foster home, including whether they suffered abuse and whether the HSE knew, as well as the use of this placement by another unnamed person.  Conor Dignam was initially given the job to make recommendations and these were his recommendations.  I believe we need to see the terms widened.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to pay tribute in the Chamber to Deputies John Deasy and John McGuinness, to the journalists and the whistleblowers and to those people who had the courage and tenacity to keep pressing on this issue until we got to the point where the Minister announced that he would be setting up this investigation.  We need to get it right.  I was in the Chamber last night when it was suggested and the message given out that it was not going to be possible to amend the terms of reference.  Some Deputies realised they could and they put in amendments.  Other Deputies did not table amendments because they believed they did not have the opportunity to do so.  A mechanism needs to be found to ensure the terms of reference for the commission are as comprehensive as they need to be.<\/p>  <p>  We are talking about something awful and how that girl and others were left in that situation without any intervention, despite all the signs and evidence that were there and despite the fact that she went to hospital with bruises.  There was no intervention for that vulnerable child, who was all the more vulnerable because she could not express what was happening to her.  There were other children in that house who could do so.  That is all the more reason why we need to hear from other children who were in that house.  We need to get to the truth of the matter for the sake of the children and everyone who is connected to those children, their families and anyone else that knows them and cares about their welfare.  We also need to do it for all the other children who are in care, foster care or otherwise, for all the parents who have placed their children in care in good faith believing they would be looked after properly and for all the foster parents who are looking after children and who in the vast majority of cases are doing a really positive and good job.<\/p><p>If we do not get to the truth of what happened in the home where Grace was, then there will always be doubts, a lack of confidence and questions.  We have to get to the truth of what happened and exactly why it happened.  We have to hold people responsible because there were people who made decisions that allowed Grace and many other children to stay in that situation.  If we do not get those answers, then we are not doing justice to all of those children and the people around them, as well as to others who are in situations of care.  We have to get back a confidence that the system works well and is properly organised and that when somebody does something wrong or makes a mistake, it is immediately brought to light and righted and things do not get pushed further underneath a carpet because people are afraid of what is going to happen if it all comes out.<br\/><br\/>It is good that it is all coming out now.  It is good that the awful other case we have been talking about this week is coming out, namely, the case of the babies buried in Tuam and other places, which has hugely traumatised many people.  If we do not get to the bottom of all of these cases, we cannot build a new system that will work for all children.  The Acting Chairman and I have just come from the Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, which was discussing the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>legislation, the importance of justice for children in the courts system and the rights of children in UN declarations, in EU law, in Irish law and in the Constitution.  Yet, these are children who are the most voiceless and the most helpless and whose rights in these cases were entirely unvindicated.  We to have to ensure we get things right and we will only do that if we get the foundations right.  The foundations will not be right if we do not open up what has happened in the past and build a system in which people can have confidence.<br\/><br\/>I wish to make a point about the current situation.  We are aware there are thousands of children in care at present who do not have an allocated social worker.  In answers I received to a recent question, it was stated the goal was to reduce that number by 60% by the end of 2016 but it was actually only reduced by 19%.  Again, I am not casting blame on anyone.  What I am saying is we need to ensure that every child who is in care has a social worker and, therefore, we need to back that with funding.  There is an issue around recruitment but we also need to ensure enough funding is allocated to ensure every child in care has a social worker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800009#G00300","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488971100,"counter":32,"content":"<p>In this country we do sorrow, shame and indignation very well.  I just wish that we did truth and justice every bit as well.  It is ironic that today is International Women's Day, where we celebrate the positive developments for women that have been made over the last 109 years.  Yet, this week we are debating both the Tuam situation and the issue of how Grace and other girls and mothers have been treated.<\/p>  <p>  I always thought the name Grace meant blessed in some way.  It is name one feels means a child is full of grace and will have a lot of positivity and blessing in her life, although certainly not in the case of this Grace.  It is incredible to believe that a young woman such as Grace could have remained with a family for more than 20 years despite repeated allegations and evidence of physical and sexual abuse, including black eyes, bruising and carpet burns, as well as the alleged defrauding of money.  Grace went for years without any medical attention.  Her general appearance was described, and people took the time to describe it, as poor and chaotic.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the terms of reference of this inquiry should be expanded to include the cases of the 46 other children who were placed with this foster family.  We know that at least four of them have alleged they were abused while staying with the foster family.  The Devine report has related very specifically to that.  Grace's mother herself sought files from the HSE under the Freedom of Information Act but was denied them for two years.  She deserves answers, as we all do, as to when, how and how often the home was monitored.  Did the HSE suppress or hide information about the facts of the case?  Why was the 1996 decision to move Grace overturned?  Why did it take another 13 years for her to be moved to a residential placement?<\/p>  <p>  State agencies failed in their job to keep vulnerable people safe and whistleblowers were ignored.  The people charged with protecting Grace failed to discharge their duty of care to her and, at this point in time, apologies are not enough for Grace, her mother and her family or for all the other children and all the other Graces.  We need to get the commission up and running straight away and we absolutely must ensure there is never another Grace.<\/p>  <p>  When I was elected to the House more than a year ago, I promised my constituents in Kildare South that I would be a voice for the vulnerable, those who did not have a voice and those who could not make their voice loud enough.  I cannot think of any other situation where I would want to say something only for Grace.  I am at present involved with the Care Leavers Network.  Shane Griffin, a young man from Kildare who went through 19 care homes, and Wayne Dignam are doing incredible work in terms of identifying the gaps and challenges for those 6,644 children who at present are in care in Ireland.  They are also working with Empowering People in Care, EPIC, to make sure we try to address this and put more supports in place for those in care.  Once they pass the age of 18, all of a sudden they are cast out into the big bad world without any level of support.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge all of the very good foster parents who provide wonderful homes to many of those 6,644 children.  We need to have the very best foster parents to be able to cater for children in very challenging situations and to be able to afford them the emotional, financial and supportive environment they need, given many have had a lot of trauma at a very early age.<\/p>  <p>  The work the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is doing is very welcome and I know he is extremely well intentioned in this regard.  As I have said, I believe we need to expand the inquiry to include the other cases.  If the situation arises that this does not happen, I believe we need to have an ironclad agreement and commitment from the Minister of State and the Government that, as soon as the case of Grace is openly and transparently dealt with and recommendations are made, this will carry on for all of the other Graces we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800010#H00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1488971100,"counter":33,"content":"<p>There is no doubt the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is a thoroughly decent person and in my book, he has always strived to do the right thing.  It is incumbent on him, the Government and all Ministers to make sure we get this right.<\/p>  <p>  We heard this morning from two former members of the Committee of Public Accounts who have examined many of these issues in great detail, namely, Deputies McGuinness and Deasy.  Both stated that what is at play here is a massive cover-up by the HSE.  It appears that is the case but obviously we need to establish the truth.  To enable us to establish the truth, however, we need to hear from all of the victims and their families and we need to make sure that all allegations that are being made are covered.  That is an absolute necessity.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's response to many of the issues which have been raised.<\/p>  <p>  Grace, as we know, was a victim of multiple failures across many different State and semi-State bodies and she is not the only one.  Unfortunately, as the Minister of State knows, it is not the first time we are here discussing people who were in the care of the State and who were victims of abuse.<\/p><p>In this case, there have been horrific levels of abuse against Grace and many others as well.<br\/><br\/>When the social workers identified as Ms D and Ms E first raised the allegations of a cover-up to the effect that there was a danger of the deliberate destruction of files and threats to their agencies funding from the HSE, what was the response of the authorities?  They passed on the allegations to the very section against which they had been made.  That is quite incredible.  It was an incredible systems failure if that is what happened.  When the Dignam report was first published, the HSE said that the report did not find any instances of wrongdoing or fault.  Ever since, it has had to backtrack almost with every passing day.<br\/><br\/>As we know, the report did find instances of wrongdoing or fault.  Legally, it was not possible for negative findings to be made.  The Dignam report identified several failures in the previous reports, including inadequate terms of reference, meaning that the reviews in question were hampered in terms of scope.  It also notes that these reviews did not contain the protected disclosures made by Ms D and Ms A.  The Dignam report states that allegations were made by Ms D, a social worker, regarding a cover-up, the danger of a deliberate destruction of files and threats to the funding of the organisation she worked for by the HSE.  These are extraordinary allegations.<br\/><br\/>The allegation of a cover-up is extremely serious, given the level, duration and scale of failings by the organisation, as well as the scale of the abuse of which we have been made aware.  The possibility that the evidence was destroyed is also deeply disturbing.  I quote the Dignam report:<\/p><blockquote>1.5: Substantive matters underlying those two previous Inquiries and matters related to those substantive matters are matters which have obviously been the subject of extensive public discourse and coverage in the media.  This Review came about because of specific process-type issues that were raised before the Public Accounts Committee.  The Review was clearly not established to investigate those underlying substantive matters and it would therefore have been wrong and inappropriate for me to have done so.  I have not done so.<br \/><br \/>1.6: Whether some of the concerns expressed in that public discourse prove to be correct and well-founded or not, it is indisputable that they have raised very significant public unease and questions of public interest.<\/blockquote><p>Of course, Mr. Dignam did not have powers of compellability.  He was entirely reliant on the HSE and any other party he sought or requested documentation from to provide him with all of the relevant or required documents and to ensure that the copies were complete.  In other words, Mr. Dignam was reliant on others to implicate themselves in wrongdoing.  The Minister of State knows that this was the case.  He knows that is unacceptable.  He knows that is not the way to establish the truth and, in my view, he knows now what needs to be done.  We need to have all of the matters contained in complaints by two of the protected disclosures to the Department of Health in 2014 fully investigated.  As the Dignam report recommended, we need to know the facts relating to any difficulties in the functioning of the relevant social work department, including any reasons underlying such difficulties, the facts relating to any steps that were taken to address these difficulties, the question of whether any such difficulties had any impact on the care and welfare of service users and, if they had such impact, how the situation was permitted to arise.  We also need to know the facts relating to the care received by all of those placed in foster placement.<br\/><br\/>I will finish with one very quick point.  I ask the Minister of State to assure the D&aacute;il that if we are to have a commission of investigation into the Grace case, any evidence of a criminal nature will not be exempt from any future court cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800010#H00300","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488971700,"counter":35,"content":"<p>As there are no other Members offering, I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to conclude the debate.

I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this motion.  I acknowledge their constructive input into assisting the Government's consideration of these highly sensitive issues.  I commend Deputies Murphy O'Mahony and Cullinane and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who are here at the moment, on their constructive and supportive ideas on how we should all deal with the Grace case.  This debate has demonstrated the complexity of the issues, which I am sure the commission of investigation will be eager to look in to.  We all have one thing in common: the protection of Grace and the other people as citizens of this State.<\/p>  <p>  The motion before the House deals with the arrangements agreed by the Government on 7 March in respect of the establishment of a commission of investigation into certain matters relative to a disability service in the south east and related matters.  It has become more commonly known as the Grace case.  In this House last year, the Taoiseach said that he felt revulsion at what had been done to Grace.  I am certain that no one in this House, or indeed in this country, would not concur with those sentiments.  I want to get to the truth of this matter.  I am supporting Grace and the other families as well.  I have been an advocate for people with disabilities for over 25 and I will continue to fight for truth, justice, quality services and accountability.  I will include everybody and let their voices be heard.  I do not do exclusion.  Anybody that knows me knows that I do not do exclusion.  I will listen to all voices and everybody will be listened to.  That is how we will get to the truth and justice for Grace and others.  I also believe that we need decisive action and accountability.  I ask the House today to trust me on this case and to trust me on these core issues.  Nobody will be left out.<\/p>  <p>  I also ask the House to trust the independent view of the commission.  I have confidence in our new chairperson of the commission, Ms Marjorie Farrelly, SC.  I have great confidence in her experience and her prosecution background.  With regard to some of the comments made about Mr. Conor Dignam, SC, and Ms Marjorie Farrelly, SC, they were consulted as part of the preparation for the terms of reference.  Ms Farrelly is fully satisfied with the terms of reference.  We need to get out there.  As I said before, I want to ensure that every single person in this debate is included.  I believe that is important.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the passion and feeling about Grace and others who have suffered so much in the care of the State when they most needed protection.  I share it.  We are all on the same side and share the same objective.  I say that particularly to Deputy McGuinness, who I met last night with the two whistleblowers.  I respect his commitment in respect of this issue and I do listen to his ideas.  It was always my intention that there would be a second phase to this commission to investigate the care and decision-making in respect of others as well as Grace.  Nobody will be excluded.  I will repeat that:  nobody will be excluded.  However, I have listened to the concerns of Deputies Howlin, Cullinane, McGuinness, Murphy O'Mahony and others expressed.  For the avoidance of any doubt, I have decided to recommend to Government that we make this completely explicit in the terms of reference.  My objective was to have a clear focus on the care of Grace as the first phase of this work.  I stand by that.  There have already been a series of reports into the care of Grace but the facts of what happened and the reasons for certain key decisions are still not clear.  I accept the Deputies' arguments on that.  The commission provides the means to call witnesses and hear the evidence in order that we can finally learn the truth.<\/p>  <p>  I am a very practical person.  I listen to constructive and sensible ideas from people.  I did not want this commission to continue its deliberations for years.<\/p><p>I want to have answers as quickly as possible to the case of Grace, who was resident with this foster family for so many years.  That has always been my position.  However, I have always been a listener when people have come into the Chamber to point out things having listened to others.  I have tremendous time, as Deputy McGuinness and Deputy Howlin know, for the two whistleblowers.  I have met them before and I met them again last night.<\/p> <p> I am supporting Grace 100%.  I want to get this moving.  However, I also wish to ensure and put down a marker in order that the other people will not be excluded.  However, as I have already said, I intend to circulate revised terms of reference to put at ease the minds of those concerned in respect of the imperative for the cases of others to be investigated in a second phase.  It is important that we say this in respect of the broader debate.  That is my clear position.<\/p> <p> Several Deputies raised a number of issues.  Considerable work has been done in respect of protecting vulnerable people in our society.  Since I took over as Minister of State, I have been in contact with over 5,000 people who are working in the disability services.  These include service providers, parents or people with disabilities themselves.  Every time I meet these people, I ask about safety and protection on the campus or in the residential centre in question.  My experience in the past seven or eight months suggests to me that things have improved.  However, that does not mean we should not be vigilant.<\/p> <p> I thank my colleagues for their views on this important debate.  We need to focus on Grace and vulnerable adults with disabilities.  They all deserve the truth and justice.  We also deserve accountability.  That is the message I want to send out to broader society.  We care about vulnerable people in our society.  We care passionately about people with disabilities.  That is where we are and that is my position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800011#J00300","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488972300,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Can I raise a point of order-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800012#K00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1488972300,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I am not too sure.

Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured and are in critical condition in hospital.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise the treatment of Grace and all those who were in the foster home in Waterford, which has shocked the nation.

I accept the good intentions of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, in wanting this investigated and I welcome the establishment of a commission of investigation.

They are genuinely concerned about the terms of reference and the lack of coverage, given that other cases will not be covered by this inquiry.  If one reads the precise language in the original motion there appears to be an intention to hold a further inquiry to deal with those, and the Minister of State was adamant that the other cases would be dealt with.  However, it must be explicit in the terms of reference that are brought before the House again that the other cases will be covered.  In addition, it has also emerged that, with regard to the suppression of information or the alleged cover-up, for some unknown reason the terms of reference include a timeframe from 2009 to 2016.  Conor Dignam's recommendation is that the issue of suppression or alleged suppression of information, essentially any cover-up, should date from 1996 to 2016.  There is no explanation for the variation between the Dignam recommendation and the terms of reference of the commission of investigation.  I ask the Taoiseach to examine that and to bring the date back to 1996.<\/p>  <p>  Third, the Dignam report recommends that all matters contained in the protected disclosures should be included in the inquiry, as well as the treatment of those who made the protected disclosures.  There are issues in that regard and there should be an indent in the inquiry covering the treatment of those who made the protected disclosures.  The overarching issue is that others who were in those homes would be included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800013#N00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1488972900,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I share Deputy Martin's sympathy, as I am sure the House does, on learning of the tragic circumstances surrounding the fire in Clondalkin last night.

Go nd&eacute;ana Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a n-anamacha d&iacute;lse.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to some of the debate on the Grace case.  As I said yesterday, with this inquiry we will get to the bottom of what happened to Grace.  The State makes a habit of talking about the past and legacy issues, but this involves the present, not the past.  Now, we must and will act on it.  Their personal pain cannot be anonymised, and it can become almost anonymised as a public issue.  It is the pain of Grace and her mother, two good women.  One of them gave up the most precious thing in her life, her child, to the care of the State because she believed she was doing right by her daughter.  When the television is switched off and the news of the day moves on, that pain does not cease.  Conor Dignam and the chair of the commission of investigation, Marjorie Farrelly, have been consulted on the terms of reference, which allow for another phase of investigation.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on his diligence in following through with this.  He has withdrawn the motion for consultation.  Let us be crystal clear about this - what we seek is an allowance for phase one and for phase two, to take into account others who were in that foster home and the other issues the Deputy has raised.  If we are to have a commission of investigation let it be conducted in such a way that it covers the issues people have legitimately raised.  I expect the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, following consultation with all the Members, to return to the House tomorrow with amended terms of reference which set out explicitly and clearly what we want in setting up the commission of investigation, that is, to have phases one and two which will allow for the issues that have been raised to be dealt with by the commission.  I hope that we can deal with this comprehensively and effectively in the consultations that take place today.  There is no reason that we should have to delay the process of getting the commission of investigation up and running.  However, I agree with the Deputy that it is important to be crystal clear that we are not only dealing with the Grace case, which has been the subject of statutory investigations, and then moving on at some time in the future.  We must make it clear that there is a phase one and phase two in the context of clarifying the terms of reference to deal with these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800013#N00300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1488972900,"counter":88,"content":"<p>They overlap, unfortunately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800013#N00400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1488972900,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Over the course of the day I hope Members will be happy that their suggestions are being incorporated in terms of reference that will deal with this inclusively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800013#N00500","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1488972900,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I welcome the Government's willingness to engage with the D&aacute;il on this issue and that the motion was withdrawn.

The first whistleblower came forward in 1992, and in that context it is unacceptable that the investigation would only examine the period from 2009 onwards.  It must examine the entire period from when the whistle was first blown.  The treatment of whistleblowers by the system, that is, by the health board initially and then by the HSE, must also be included in the terms of reference.  The Chairman must be given some flexibility in terms of the overlap of some of the issues between one case and other cases.

Our thoughts are with them and we wish all of those who were injured a full and speedy recovery.<\/p>  <p>  Today is International Women's Day.  It is a day for commemorating and celebrating the struggle for women's rights.  Here in Ireland and around the world, women have won many battles for equality but the struggle is not over, not by a long stretch.  To this day, the legacy of this State's mistreatment of women and children remains.  Issues like the gender pay gap and the eighth amendment have yet to be addressed.  We are also reminded of the shocking and disgraceful State-sponsored abuse of women in the not too distant past.  In that context, I wish to raise the issue of the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes.<\/p>  <p>  On Friday morning last, the commission outlined the details of excavations that have discovered a significant quantity of human remains at the site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam.  The remains discovered are the bodies of babies and children who were unceremoniously buried there without any recognition.  They were buried in a septic tank without any respect for their identity or dignity.  It is a cause of national shame.  However, none of this was accidental.  It was, as the Taoiseach knows, State policy.  I listened to the Taoiseach's words very carefully yesterday.  He said that the nuns did not kidnap children but that society gave them up.  That is so but let us remember that it was people who sat in this Chamber and on the Government benches over the years who facilitated that.  The State funded, regulated, oversaw and enforced a grotesque system that vilified and abused women and their babies and, to this day, the State refuses to afford the survivors justice.  Look to the case of Mr. Peter Mulryan, who was in court on Monday for the fifth time seeking access to files held by Tusla and the Bon Secours Sisters on his infant sister, Marian Bridget.  He believes that she died in Tuam and was buried there but he cannot be sure.  In the past, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na believed that the Tuam site was a famine plot - not so.  Now, as we discover the grim reality that the site is the scene of a mass grave and potentially a crime scene, where is the Garda response?<\/p>  <p>  The commission established by the Government in January 2015 is inadequate.  The Taoiseach knew that, as did the former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, at the time.  We told them so and, more importantly, advocacy groups made that very clear.  The commission's inadequacy is now crystal clear and this has been voiced by the United Nations, which has said that the investigation does not meet international standards.  Tuam, as we know, was just one of a vast network of institutions which systematically violated the rights of women and their children and facilitated an illegal adoption trade or child trafficking.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach now commit to engaging with the victims and survivors in order that the commission's terms of reference can be examined, amended and expanded?  That is the only way that we can have any hope of getting to the full truth.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, has had the second interim report of the commission from Judge Yvonne Murphy on her desk since September.  That report specifically examines the need to expand the terms of reference.  Will that report be published without further delay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800014#O00300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1488973500,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McDonald.  Today is International Women's Day, and as I have said on many occasions, if Ireland was declared by W.B. Yeats to be \"no country for old men\", then the legacy and more recent issues mentioned by the Deputy would suggest that it was positively dangerous for girls and women.  We have had the experience of the ignoring of the Magdalene women for many years.  We have had the Government's establishment of the surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme because of the treatment of women.  The Government also set up the statutory commission of investigation into mother and baby homes and related matters, as well as a commission to look into the case of Grace.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Catherine Connolly raised the question of the interim report with me previously.  There have been many calls to extend the commission's terms of reference in recent days.  I am conscious of these calls and the Government is open to examining what can be done.  There is no point in having commissions of investigation if they are not able to do what they are intended to do.  That said, we need to reflect carefully and give ourselves some time to get this right.  It is a serious matter.  I agree that the best approach is to have a scoping exercise, in consultation with the commission itself, to see if broader terms of reference covering more institutions would help to answer the many questions that arise.  I note that these and many other questions arose when the original terms of reference were being framed in 2014 and 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge was, and still is, how to balance sufficient coverage of institutions with completing the report in a reasonable period.  The commission is now two years into a three-year programme of work under its current terms of reference.  We need to be conscious that extending its terms of reference will inevitably have an impact on any timescale that has been set out.  The more we now add to its coverage, the longer the commission is likely to take to complete its work.  This is not to say that this cannot or should not be done.  However, we must be very clear about the implications for the commission's timescale and how long it will take to give us the answers that we very much want to have, particularly in the context of the feelings of those who are now in their senior years.<\/p>  <p>  The first issue is for us to be satisfied that any additional matters of concern are not already within the existing wide scope of the commission.  The commission has significant autonomy to follow wherever the investigation takes it and to make any recommendations it considers necessary in that regard.  In fact, the commission's terms of reference require it to submit a report specifically on this issue to the Minister.  Should a decision be made to examine further questions, there may also be a need to consider the appropriate legal vehicle to take that forward.<\/p><p>The commission was tasked with investigating a very specific issue and its report on this specific issue is still in preparation.  The commission has not made its formal findings yet, although we know the outcome of the specific analysis of the site in Tuam.

Prior to Leader's Questions, the debate concluded on the terms of reference for another inquiry into the State and its agencies presiding over the appalling treatment of a young vulnerable woman in the south east and what appears to have been collusion in the concealment of that treatment.  I am glad that new politics is working and we have forced a reconsideration of the terms of reference.<\/p><p>In addition, we have had the revelations from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs through the commission that revealed that human remains are visible in a series of chambers that may have formed part of sewage treatment works for the home.

However, those in Galway have been aware of this for a long time.  It was highlighted by Catherine Corless back in 2014 in her painstaking and self-funded research.  Many women went before the commission of inquiry into child abuse, which culminated in the Ryan report as far back as 2009, and told their stories about their experiences in mother and baby homes.  It was brought to the attention of Martin McAleese when he concluded his report on the Magdalen laundries.  None of this is shocking to the survivors.

We cannot attract jobs and investment into our county because we simply do not have proper access.  We have been waiting for the Macroom bypass for more than 40 years.  We do not have adequate broadband or mobile phone coverage in many parts of our county.  Many roads are substandard.  To mention just a few, the roads from Blackwater Bridge to Sneem, Killarney to Gneevgullia and those around Scartaglen are in a desperate state.  The Rathmore to Killarney road, a national secondary road, is in a desperate state.  Many roads in north Kerry around Ballyduff, Kilmoyly, Lixnaw and Abbeydorney are in a desperate state.  Many of our bridges are not fit for purpose, allowing only one lane for heavy traffic.  Listry, Curraheen and the Caragh bridges were built more than 200 years ago.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for local improvement schemes has been suspended since 2011.  Of these, 123 were approved in 2007 and there are in excess of 600 waiting to be assessed by Kerry County Council.  The people on these roads in Kerry are as much entitled to a good road to their doors as the people in Dublin 4.  These are all public roads, contrary to what the Department and others claim.  Many of them were actually built by the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  Seven years&rsquo; shortfall in funding for maintenance means that many roads are waterlogged and ponding makes many of them unsafe in wet weather.  We do not have enough money now to fill the potholes.  Many roadside hedges are not being cut and none will be cut until 1 September, meaning that all the spring and summer growth will not be touched until then.  It is a health and safety matter.  Whatever about the birds and inside the ditches, all roadside hedges should be cut all year round.<\/p>  <p>  Many areas have suffered huge job losses, such as Castleisland, Kenmare, Cahersiveen and Tralee.  All of north Kerry would benefit if the Shannon LNG project was allowed to go ahead by the regulator over whom nobody seems to have control.  Rural Kerry has been affected by cuts of 53% to the Leader programme.  Worse still, we have had no programme since 2013.  Restrictive planning guidelines are preventing young people from putting a roof over their heads.  Many towns and villages do not have any public sewerage scheme.  One third of Castleisland has been waiting more than 30 years to be connected to the public sewerage system.  Kilcummin has been waiting more than 20 years when it has been promised many times.  Scartaglen, Curragh, Caherdaniel, Castlecove and Cloghane all have no public sewerage systems with health and safety compromised.<\/p>  <p>  Many people are trapped in their homes due to rural isolation.  The proposal by the Government to reduce the alcohol limit further will impact adversely on people in rural areas.  It is a big difference for these people from those in urban areas.  Many people in rural areas would not get to know their neighbours were dead if it were not for Radio Kerry.<\/p>  <p>  In spite of all these impediments, Kerry and Kerry people are still the best in the world and everyone is still welcome to Kerry at all times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800016#Q00800","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1488974700,"counter":132,"content":"<p>That is a speech the Deputy should give outside Beaufort church.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800016#Q01100","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1488974700,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I will be giving it again there next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800016#Q01200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1488974700,"counter":134,"content":"<p>He covered the whole range there.

People are going blind waiting to have their cataracts removed.  I have asked the Taoiseach frequently about this matter here.  Before Christmas I gave a clear plan to the Minister for Health as to how for instance in County Kerry we could tackle the problem.

The Minister has the solution.  I ask the Taoiseach in the nicest possible way to please ensure that cataracts can be removed.  It costs &euro;2,600 to take a cataract away from a person's eye.  If it is not taken in time the person goes blind.  I have the names, personal public service, PPS, numbers and the dates of birth of two people in Kerry who lost their sight because they were on a waiting list.

The 1957 statute defines seven categories of limitation periods.  For example, the time limit for taking a personal injury claim is two years, whereas the time limit for taking a claim based on a contract debt, such as a debt owed to a financial institution, is six years.  A subsequent judgment taken by such an institution can be extended to a further 12 years.  This Bill seeks to amend two categories of limitation period within the Statute of Limitations legislation.  Its aim is to reduce the current time limit from six years to two years in the case of a civil claim based on a contract debt such as a loan from a bank.  The Bill also seeks to reduce the lifetime of High Court and Circuit Court judgments from 12 years to two, which would be in line with the most recent bankruptcy legislation.  In fact, judgments currently run well in excess of the Statute of Limitations - by six years or so - and are, therefore, well out of line with the statute as it applies to contract debt.  Strangely enough, the debts and judgments of a deceased person become barred under the statute after two years, which is the current objective of this amendment for both living people and corporates.  It seems that under current legislation, living people must face a worse fate than death and are expected to continue to exist in limbo for six to 12 years.<\/p><p>The Bill we are introducing is based on the experiences our offices have had over the past six years in dealing with people throughout Ireland who are in debt or have a debt hanging over them.  The legislation is also guided by a report produced by the Law Reform Commission in 2011, which recommended that the length of a civil claim based on a contract debt should be reduced from six years to two.  The commission queried why certain civil claims, such as personal injury claims, have a two-year limit while the contract debt limit remains at six years.  The current time limit of six years could be in breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is incorporated into Irish law under the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.  Article 6 of the convention states, &quot;everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law&quot;.  It seems to be a blatant breach of the Article 6 entitlement to a &quot;hearing within a reasonable time&quot; that it is possible for a civil claim to hang over someone for six years and then be initiated at the last minute.  Our State-owned and partially State-owned banks are currently wielding the 12-year judgment axe over considerable numbers of customers who, for one reason or another, do not wish to go through the insolvency or bankruptcy route but who are making their best efforts to settle with those banks.  The manner in which the last ounce of blood is being extracted from these people means they are suffering to a much greater extent.  The existing outdated legislation is putting them at a disadvantage, to say the least.<\/p><p>The recent influx into Ireland of vulture funds such as Cerberus, which has bought a substantial amount of debt from our banks and from NAMA, is adding to this problem.  To put it in perspective, Cerberus has bought &euro;13.5 billion of par debt loans from NAMA over the past three years.  It has bought well over &euro;20 billion of such loans in total when its purchases from Ulster Bank are included.  I reiterate that these vultures are wielding the 12-year judgment axe to frighten already distressed borrowers who have been sold out by the State in recent times.  A large slice of Ireland has been sold to these vultures at a fraction of its real value.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has said that the term &quot;vulture fund&quot; is &quot;a compliment&quot; because &quot;vultures provide a very good service in the ecology through cleaning up dead animals that are littered across the landscape&quot;.  It is not surprising that the Minister has become their cheerleader, particularly in view of the number of times he has had meetings with vulture funds.  He would do well to remember that the dead animals the vultures are cleaning up are the Irish people, some of whom are well into their 70s and 80s.  I am sure every Deputy will agree that we would not like to see our fellow countrymen treated in this way.  Two of the purposes of this legislation are to discourage plaintiffs - those taking cases - from delaying the initiation of proceedings and to protect defendants from having the cloud of litigation hanging over their heads for six years, or up to 12 years in the case of judgments.  More particularly, this Bill seeks to bring the timing of these outmoded statutes into line with recent bankruptcy and insolvency legislation, thereby providing a fair playing pitch for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U00400","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1488977100,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1488977100,"counter":234,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U00600","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488977100,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1488977100,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U00800","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1488977100,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U00900","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488977100,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions","time":1488977100,"counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1488977100,"counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U01200"},{"type":"question","time":1488977100,"counter":241,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[11420\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U01300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his engagement with first Vice President of the European Commission, Mr. Frans Timmermans, on 21 February 2017.","asker":"1330","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1488977100,"counter":242,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[11756\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U01400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his plans to include items, or if he has sought the inclusion of items, on the agenda of the next European Council meeting of the EU Heads of State or Government; and if he will report on his plans for this meeting.","asker":"1353","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1488977100,"counter":243,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[11784\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U01500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his meetings with EU officials in Brussels on 2 March 2017.","asker":"1294","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1488977100,"counter":244,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[12045\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U01600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his visit to Brussels on 2 March 2017.","asker":"1330","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1488977100,"counter":245,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[12050\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U01700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on each of the meetings he attended in Brussels on 2 March 2017 and the issues that were discussed.","asker":"1224","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1488977100,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Since the UK referendum last June, I have had an intensive series of bilateral meetings with my counterparts in EU member states and with the heads of the EU institutions.  I have attended all formal and informal meetings of the European Council.  At all my meetings, I have highlighted and explained Ireland&rsquo;s particular concerns arising from Brexit, including those relating to Northern Ireland and the peace process, the common travel area, our interwoven economies and the future of the EU.  I met first Vice President of the Commission, Frans Timmermans, in Government Buildings on 21 February last.  His visit followed those of other Commissioners, including Mr. Moscovici and Ms Vestager, which have served to underline the Commission's understanding of Ireland's particular concerns and support for our approach.\u00a0 The meeting was constructive, with Commissioner Timmermans demonstrating a good understanding of Ireland's concerns and offering strong Commission support for our approach in addressing them.  I visited Brussels on 23 February to meet the Prime Minister of Belgium, Charles Michel, and the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.  I also participated in a business event organised by the Ireland Belgium Business Association and supported by the Irish Embassy and Enterprise Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As I continued this strategic programme of engagement, I travelled to Brussels again on 2 March for separate meetings with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, the recently elected President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, a number of key Members of the European Parliament and the chief Commission Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier.  The focus of these meetings was on Brexit as well as the future direction of the EU.  In addition to setting out our concerns around the economic and trade implications of the UK departure, I again explained in detail the peace process in Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement and the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland that must be recognised from the start and reflected in the final agreement. \u00a0President Tusk, President Tajani and Mr. Barnier understood and acknowledged these issues and expressed their openness to working closely with us in the forthcoming negotiations.  It was useful to highlight these issues to key MEPs.  As the European Parliament will adopt a resolution on Brexit in the coming months and will ultimately have to approve the final exit deal, it is important that we continue to engage to seek support there.  With regard to the debate on the future of the EU, I underlined to all my interlocutors the need for unity and the importance of our core European values, which are central to our continuing peace and prosperity.  We must deliver for our citizens and, in that context, press ahead in areas of particular relevance, including jobs, growth, investment, the Single Market and the digital single market.  I will continue to make these points in the build-up to the summit in Rome at the end of this month and into the future.<\/p>  <p>  The next European Council meeting will take place on 9 March next.  The draft agenda that has been published by the general secretariat of the Council envisages that the Maltese Presidency will provide an overview of progress on the implementation of earlier European Council conclusions and that the European Council will look at a number of the most pressing issues, including those relating to jobs, growth and competitiveness; security and defence; migration; and external relations. Decisions are also to be taken on the position of the President of the European Council and the establishment of a European public prosecutor's office.  The agenda is in order from Ireland's perspective.  Therefore, I have not sought any particular items for inclusion on it.  I will be making a full statement in advance of the European Council meeting, as I always do, after Question Time this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1488977100,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I ask Deputies to keep within time if they can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800020#U01900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1488977100,"counter":248,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has indicated to my party leader, Deputy Adams, on several occasions that the Government intends to publish a White Paper on Brexit.

Has the Taoiseach had any sense in his discussions as to which of those five scenarios the Irish Government would see as our future?  I am conscious of his statement to the effect that he will press ahead in respect of areas of common interest and that these are all economic.  I have a slight concern that we are not looking at social, environmental or other issues, and that what the Taoiseach referred to all relates to one area.  Did the Taoiseach give an indication of what would be the approach of the Government in responding to the Commission's scenarios to set out our vision of our role in the future of Europe?<\/p>  <p>  I was shocked to see some VoteWatch analysis recently which identifies Ireland as probably the most negative country on just about any suggestion for the development of Europe.  It is opposed to economic integration, tax harmonisation and defence co-operation.  There was also a categorisation of the responses from governments to date.  Eastern countries are very nervous about a segregated or two-speed approach but western governments are possibly in favour of that.  Northern and Scandinavian governments are looking for neither of those.  Where did the Taoiseach place us when he spoke with either members of the Commission or President Tusk on the future of Europe White Paper?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800021#V01000","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1488977700,"counter":259,"content":"<p>With regard to Deputy McDonald's latter point, we have special status as we stand in that we are the only country with a peace process supported by the European Union and an international legally-binding agreement.

There is no evident move to go beyond very broad generalities.  British Prime Minister May has stated she wants a red, white and blue Brexit, which is not very reassuring to all those who do not share her British nationalist policies.  Mr. Tony Connolly spoke about the Border issue on RTE last night and he is among the correspondents who have made the consistent point that there has been comment in Brussels about how Ireland has been successful in raising concerns but that so far we have not offered concrete solutions.  For some reason, we have not finished an economic impact assessment.  At this stage, I am concerned we are not offering the level of detail needed to guide negotiations to a good outcome.<\/p>  <p>  The civil dialogue confirms that businesses on both sides of the Border are terrified of the impact of the new customs and trade regulations that are now inevitable.  With regard to supply chains, queuing at Border crossings is not the issue but rather the paperwork and multiple duties.  Mr. Connolly captured that well last night in discussing similar border issues in different parts of the EU.  The only way we can realistically tackle that is with some form of special economic zone or customs zone to be established for Northern Ireland, or at the very least for Border counties.

That is both from the perspective of the Commission and Parliament.

We need to know what we are dealing with so we can respond to it.  The negotiations are led by the Barnier task force and the Commission and we feed our concerns into it.  The Government will respond in detail when Article 50 has been triggered.<\/p>  <p>  No work is under way regarding the acquisition of land for Border customs posts.  There was some talk about it some time ago.  Our political position is that there will be no return to the Border of the past, and this is agreed and accepted by the British Government.  It is a political challenge.  It is not a technological or a paper issue.  It is a political priority.  I was in Kiltyclogher in County Leitrim recently.  During the Troubles, Leitrim was the only county from which one could not get to Northern Ireland.  Every road was blown up.  The people there who are in their senior years never want to go back to that situation, and neither do we.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned a special economic zone.  These are matters for consideration.  My starting point is that there would be no return to that Border.  There is political agreement on it that whatever will happen will be consequent on the nature of the relationship the UK wants with Europe from then on, clearly with implications for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  One of the four priorities set out by Michel Barnier, as head of the Brexit task force, is to deal with the question of Northern Ireland and the Border.

Ours is the subject of an international, legally binding agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey asked a good question about the multi-speed Europe issue, which has been around for a while.  Various ideas and proposals, so-called \"variable geometry\", have always arisen in discussion about future developments of the EU.  They are again being mentioned in the context of the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.  We have already had such a variable geometry regarding the euro and the Schengen Agreement.  Enhanced co-operation has been included in the treaties for this reason and the provisions can be used to allow a group of states to move ahead if they wish with co-operation without all members supporting it.  We want to stay in the vanguard, right up at the front.

This is a far from encouraging start, particularly given that it does not relate to the specific issue which brought down the Executive and on which the election was triggered.  There is no evidence, so far, of any significant changes in the positions of any of the parties, and the opening dynamic is not good, to say the least.<\/p>  <p>  The drift and growing tribalism in the Executive during recent years happened at exactly the time when London and Dublin took a decision to step back and leave it to the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in.

They can only work, however, on the basis of delivery.  The Taoiseach is the co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and the Fresh Start agreement - the list is very lengthy - but the fact is that Dublin and London are in default in respect of commitments entered into and this needs to be fixed.

We need to do some reflection - away from the issue of today - as to a template around the whole area of inquiries and how they are conducted.  It is not easy but I know there were proposals in the past.  In other jurisdictions there are specific departments to focus on this area.  Equally with regard to performance within organisations, all of these matters arise because they give rise to issues that have not been dealt with internally by organisations or by various other organisations that are meant to cover this.  For example, it is extraordinary the degree to which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission does not seem to have the capacity - and nor do people have any confidence in it - as one agency that is supposed to deal with all the issues that arise from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

We would need to consider the likelihood of a commission of investigation being able to get any further relevant information for the commission about the issues involved, bearing in mind the large amount of evidence it has already received from NAMA and from other interested parties.  It is an important point to bear in mind given the substantial funding involved.  There is &euro;4.7 million in the Department's Vote for 2017 and this includes provision for the Fennelly commission due to report at the end of March, as I have said, and the first element of the Siteserv module of IBRC, due by the end of this year.  While there was an element of &euro;10 million provided for the proposed commission of investigation into Project Eagle, based on the estimated cost of the IBRC commission it is not possible at this stage to be sure what might actually fall due for payment in 2017.  If the funding available is not sufficient, we will have to find the resources from within the Department or somewhere else.<\/p><p> I have referred before to the permanent structure.  The Law Reform Commission made recommendations on this and considered it was not appropriate.  However, it did consider there were some other valuable elements and I am considering those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800023#X02100","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488979500,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I want to raise two issues.  First, in respect of the commission on NAMA and Project Eagle, I hear a kind of reticence in the Taoiseach's presentation that there is somehow a question mark over whether there will in fact be a commission.  When we undertook our examination in the PAC, it was never understood or intended to be an alternative to the commission we had all agreed to and signed up to in principle.  I would like the Taoiseach to confirm for us that the commission will in fact go ahead.  I understand the Taoiseach needs the report from the PAC to be factored into the terms of reference and I think that reasonable.  However, he should not be using the PAC as a means of not carrying forward the commission.  I would like him to confirm that.<\/p>  <p>  Second, on the mother and baby homes, I earlier raised the issues around Tuam with the Taoiseach.  I think he made a commitment, although he might confirm this, that he would meet and consult with victims, survivors and advocacy groups.  As he does that, one of the core things that needs to be considered is the particular issue of legal representation for survivors because they are currently cast as onlookers or spectators in an inquiry that has had the most traumatic consequences for them and their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800024#Y00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1488979500,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I met on 4 October last year with the party leaders.  We agreed in principle that the Government will establish a commission of investigation under the Act of 2004 to investigate any significant matters of public concern in regard to NAMA.  The party leaders also agreed then that there will be limitations on the commission's work, given the location of potential witnesses, documentation outside the jurisdiction and ongoing criminal investigations.  Since then, the Committee of Public Accounts, which is not an alternative to a commission of investigation, has been holding hearings in regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  It received a very large amount of evidence from NAMA and many interested parties, including parties from outside this jurisdiction.  We await the report of the PAC.<\/p>  <p>  After the PAC report is published, we will see what it says, and the Deputy will know more about that than I do, given she is a member of the committee.  We will need to consider any findings, conclusions or recommendations that may be made by the committee.  For example, the PAC report may contain information that would need to be factored into the terms of reference that would be proposed for the commission.  As I said, we will also need to consider whether the commission of investigation would be able to find out other information beyond what has been considered by the PAC report.  If information or personnel are outside the jurisdiction, or if there are criminal investigations, that puts limitations on what a commission of investigation might be able to do.<\/p>  <p>  That is not resiling from the decision in principle to have a commission of investigation into this matter.  It is being realistic in the sense of what will be in the PAC report, what are the matters it has considered, what are the recommendations, whether all work would be replicated by a commission of investigation and where are the areas that neither the PAC nor a commission of investigation has been able to go into because of the limitations of jurisdiction, documentation or whatever.

In the Taoiseach's capacity as head of Government, can he give an assurance that Mr. Justice McCartan will be allowed to carry out his work independently, given there are suggestions previous scoping exercises were interfered with by the relevant Department.

It is important to say that the issue which was flagged very strenuously at Government by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, was that the scoping exercise of Mr. Justice McCartan is to investigate the new evidence that has come to light through the relatives of the victims of the Stardust fire.  Mr. Justice McCartan will be allowed to do his work completely independently and there will be no interference from the Department in his work.  I understand he will be able to do this pretty expeditiously.  If he decides and recommends, on the basis of that new evidence, that a commission of investigation is warranted, then that is the decision of Government.

Before addressing the agenda of tomorrow's meeting, I would like to recall the informal meeting of the European Council which took place in Malta on 3 February.  This dealt with the external aspects of migration, with a particular focus on the central Mediterranean route and the related situation in Libya.  We adopted the Malta declaration, which set out some concrete actions to be taken at EU level to improve conditions in countries of origin and transit in the first instance and to stop people risking their lives in trying to cross the sea.  Following this, the 27 member states met without Prime Minister May to exchange views on the future direction of Europe and also on preparations for the anniversary of the Treaty of Rome on 25 March.  I am pleased to report there was broad agreement that the EU should focus on unity, the importance of our core values and delivering for our citizens.  Our planning on this will be further progressed at another meeting this Friday.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit was not on the agenda at Malta, although it arose in discussions on the margins of the meetings.  I took the opportunity, as I do at all meetings, to engage with my EU counterparts and to explain our particular concerns arising from Brexit.  I also discussed these issues in detail in a separate bilateral meeting the following day with the Maltese Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, who currently holds the rotating EU Presidency.  Since then, I have travelled twice to Brussels for a series of meetings with the Presidents of the European Council, the European Commission, and the European Parliament, as well as the Commission's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier.  I also met with the Belgian Prime Minister, Charles Michel, during one of those visits and we had a very useful exchange of views on Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council will start tomorrow with the first exchange of views with the new President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani.  The European Parliament will play a significant role in the Brexit negotiations, not least in considering and approving the final agreement, and it is important that it is fully involved in the process.  I met with President Tajani in Brussels last week, and also separately with a number of key MEPs, to discuss these issues.<\/p><p>There was an understanding of Ireland's concerns, particularly about the Border and the common travel area, CTA.  However, we will need to continue to engage with the parliament to ensure our particular issues are addressed throughout the negotiations.  After the exchange with President Tajani, a decision will be taken, under the Maltese presidency, regarding the election of the President of the European Council.<\/p> <p> The Presidency will then deliver a presentation as a follow -up to European Council decisions which will lead into the item on migration.  Coming so soon after the Malta summit, I do not expect a lengthy exchange on migration.  However, the High Representative will provide updates including on the current situation along the migratory routes, the EU-Turkey statement and the migration compacts.  Ireland continues to play an active role in the context of the EU response and also at our own initiative.  More than 600 people have arrived from outside the EU since the start of 2016 as resettlement.  In relation to relocation from within the EU, more than 300 people have arrived, and we are expecting to receive up to 1,100 by next September.<\/p> <p> The next agenda item, jobs, growth and competitiveness, incorporates a number of issues, including the annual growth survey, national reform programmes, the economic policy of the euro area, growth, unemployment, the European Fund for Strategic Investments, Single Market strategies, trade policy, including agreements with Canada and Japan, banking union, and the social summit which will take place in Sweden later this year.  President Draghi will join the meeting for these discussions.  These are all extremely important issues but I would underline in particular the Single Market and free trade as having been fundamental to Ireland's development over recent years.  Deputies will recall that I led an initiative last December to push for greater ambition in the digital Single Market, which will be crucial to our economic prosperity in the future.  Free trade has also brought enormous benefits within the EU and externally, and we will continue to support this in the future.  I have asked the Minister, Deputy Breen, to address some of the items under this important heading in greater detail in his wrap-up remarks later.<\/p> <p> The evening session will begin with an exchange on security and defence.  The December European Council outlined proposals for further co-operation in this area, and foreign affairs and defence Ministers adopted conclusions last Monday on the implementation of security and defence aspects of the global strategy.  These conclusions will form the basis of the High Representative's input at tomorrow's meeting.  The EU common security and defence policy, CSDP, is designed to advance the role of the EU in crisis management and peacekeeping in support of international peace and security within the EU neighbourhood and beyond.  Ireland's approach to CSDP is constructive and realistic.  We are strong supporters of initiatives which improve the capacity of the EU to contribute to international peace and security, especially in support of the UN, and to delivering the necessary civil and military capabilities in this regard.  The EU global strategy commits to promoting peace, democracy and the rule of law.  It has a positive focus on disarmament, the UN, the Middle East peace process and multilateralism.  It also recognises the need to invest further in conflict resolution, tackling the root causes of instability, including socio-economic development, and supporting international peace and security through the EU comprehensive approach.<\/p> <p> Tomorrow's session is expected to provide direction for concrete measures to be assessed at the European Council in June.  Discussions will cover a decision to establish a new military planning and conduct capability for training and capacity building missions, designed to deliver greater synergies and increased co-ordination with civilian missions as part of the EU comprehensive approach; modalities for the development of permanent structured co-operation, PESCO; and the establishment of the initial parameters for an EU-wide co-ordinated annual review on defence and the development of civilian capabilities.  Formal proposals from the High Representative in these areas are being discussed in Council fora.<\/p> <p> Ireland acknowledges that the development of a military planning and conduct capability, appropriately configured and supported through an effective joint co-ordination cell, could deliver more effective CSDP operations.  The key objective is to plan and organise civil and military missions better to maximise efficiencies, delivering a holistic and comprehensive approach in EU conflict management operations in accordance with UN mandates.  Permanent structured co-operation provides a mechanism whereby military crisis management capabilities could be developed by member states in support of CSDP operations.<\/p> <p> Ireland can support the development of an inclusive PESCO which delivers essential capabilities for CSDP operations in the area of international crisis management.  Participation in PESCO is entirely voluntary as provided in the Lisbon treaty protocols and, in the case of Ireland, is subject to the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.  The co-ordinated annual review on defence will focus on capability development and the potential to address shortfalls.  Participation in the process is voluntary.  Defence policy, including spending plans and investment, is a national competence.  We will continue to consider proposals and developments in these areas carefully to ensure all decisions add value to EU international peace support efforts and are grounded in the EU treaties and related protocols.<\/p> <p> The last item for the European Council will be external relations, specifically the western Balkans, where High Representative Mogherini has just visited.  It is important to acknowledge the European perspective of the countries of the western Balkans and the transformative effect of enlargement in this region.  Foreign ministers adopted conclusions on this last Monday which outlined EU support for reforms in these countries, as well as the challenges they face, not least by Russian efforts to increase that country's influence.  Ireland believes that the EU must remain firmly committed to realising the European perspective of the western Balkans and that the future of the region lies in its relationship with the EU.<\/p> <p> The European Council will adopt conclusions on the European Public Prosecutor's Office.  No discussion is anticipated on this item.  I note that, under Protocol 21, Ireland will not be participating in this arrangement.<\/p> <p> On Friday, the Heads of State and Government of the 27 EU member states will meet to discuss the future direction of the Union and the summit planned for late March to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.  A declaration will be adopted in Rome which will outline the many achievements of the European project, which should never be taken for granted, the challenges we face and the approach we should take to respond to these.  This work will build on our discussions in Bratislava last September and in Valletta last month and will take account of the European Commission's White Paper published last week, which outlines a number of possible scenarios for the EU by 2025.  These range from taking no new action to making major leaps forward in terms of co-operation.<\/p> <p> Ireland has been clear in this debate that our core European values are central to our future peace and prosperity and that we need to remain united.  Rather than getting side-tracked in debates where there is no chance of agreement, we should focus on where we can work together and add value.  I have stressed the need to press ahead in these areas, especially in jobs, growth and investment.  As I said earlier, Ireland attaches particular priority to progressing work on the Single Market and the digital Single Market, and we will continue to push for ambitious approaches in these areas.<\/p> <p> Brexit will not feature on the agenda of these meetings until Prime Minister May has formally triggered Article 50.  Once this has happened - expected to be later this month - the 27 member states will meet again to discuss and agree guidelines for the negotiations ahead.  I look forward to reporting back to the House on the outcome of tomorrow's European Council meeting.  As mentioned earlier, the Minister, Deputy Breen, will focus in some more detail on some of the economic issues in his wrap-up remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800024#Y00900","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488980100,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has just left for Brussels where he will be meeting the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, to discuss Brexit and other issues.  He will be wearing the green jersey, so to speak, as he highlights the issues that are important to the country in the context of the forthcoming Brexit negotiations.  As has been said before, this is a moment of great uncertainty for the future of the EU, yet this week's summit involves no significant move to address any major challenge.  It is a business as usual summit in which all the items on the agenda appear to have been agreed in advance and no new ideas will be considered.  For all those who wish the EU well and want it to be more dynamic and effective, this summit is far from encouraging.<\/p>  <p>  Inevitably the decision of the UK to leave the Union has led to a huge amount of uncertainty about future policies.  The arrogant and blustering approach of the London Government over the past eight months has made a bad situation worse.  There is no clarity whatsoever on how relations with the UK will be conducted.  While Ms May has said she wants a \"red, white and blue Brexit\", she and her colleagues fail to understand that this is exactly the narrow, backward-looking type of approach designed to minimise the chance of a constructive deal.  Why on earth would any other country want to agree to a \"red, white and blue Brexit\"?  Mr. John Major&rsquo;s excellent speech in Chatham House made the case very persuasively that the London Government has to start showing some respect for the interests of others or the consequences will be grave.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have the time to discuss fully the details of Ireland&rsquo;s position on Brexit, but there are points that need to be made about developments in the past two weeks.  From the beginning, the London Government has claimed that Northern Ireland and Scotland will have their interests listened to in the negotiations.  They may have been listened to, but they certainly have not been responded to.  In fact, there is no case evident of a Northern Irish or Scottish concern being reflected in the Government&rsquo;s public position.  Prime Minister May has now said that she is not proposing to transfer any power repatriated from the EU to the devolved Administrations.<\/p><p>If we take this, along with the stated objective of the White Paper, that is to say, \"Strengthening the Union\", it appears Brexit is seen as a way of increasing London's control over the devolved Administrations.  Assuming that the DUP-Sinn F&eacute;in axis can re-establish the Northern Ireland Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive and that Northern Ireland has political leadership again, the powers of the Assembly and Executive are not to be decided on unilaterally in London.  The complex architecture of powers, as reflected in the peace settlement, is a matter for negotiations between the Governments and with the parties.  This explicitly reflects the position of policies currently decided at EU level.  The Northern Ireland Act, which was the product of negotiations, reflects this.<\/p> <p> I am putting it clearly to the Taoiseach that he has an obligation to say to the UK Prime Minister, Ms May, when he meets her on Thursday, that London is directly undermining the spirit and letter of the settlement by failing to negotiate on how the repatriation of policies will be treated for Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p> This reinforces the fact that we need to begin substantive discussions immediately on the impact of Brexit on the Agreement and the Northern Ireland Act.  The Article 50 negotiations do not have to be completed for us to proceed with these discussions.  The 1998 referendums reflect the established will of the people and they must be respected.  Unlike others, I fail to see how, legally, they can prevent Brexit.  However, they certainly prevent London from taking any unilateral action in a series of areas.  Human rights law is the most important of these areas.<\/p> <p> These matters are entirely distinct from the common travel area and potential special status for Northern Ireland.  The longer we go on without a definitive statement from London to the effect that it accepts the need to negotiate before changing past agreements on Northern Ireland, the longer we risk a major crisis.  The House should note that the Tory Government appears increasingly likely to use Brexit as an opportunity to squeeze regulations that protect workers and consumers.  Indeed, there is already a push to expand free trade greatly with lower wage economies.  All of this makes the support of Brexit on the part of the hard left here all the more striking.  Given that Sinn F&eacute;in has decided that it hates everything the EU does but is fully committed to keeping Northern Ireland in the EU, I hope it will work to persuade its uniformly anti-EU group in the European Parliament to change its mind.<\/p> <p> Last week, the European Commission President, Mr. Juncker, published the Commission document on where the Union should go from here.  It is called a White Paper but in reality it is nothing of the sort.  It is a short document that contains some useful perspectives but actually proposes nothing concrete.  A total of five general options have been presented.  Effectively, these are the same options that have been on the table for 30 years.  More helpful would be the presentation of hard evidence on how a reformed Union could help to a greater extent.  Instead of ratcheting up the rhetoric, we need to undertake the far harder work of identifying the areas where enhanced or reduced activity would deliver a quantifiable benefit to citizens.  If that document is the basis for further discussions, then we risk another return of the frustrating, technical and ineffective negotiations of the past.<\/p> <p> We must also be careful of the approach of deciding on something simply because it is possible to do.  A good example of this is in the area of security and defence.  The current arrangements are effective and allow member states to co-operate on a basis that respects the particular tradition of everyone.  The predictions of nuclear weapons being paraded down O'Connell Street that were made during numerous referendum campaigns have been shown to be bogus.  Instead, we have states working closely to serve humanitarian causes.  This co-operation has strengthened the wonderful work of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p> The case for change in respect of the security and defence agenda has not yet been made.  Before the agenda moves from generalities to specifics, we should make it abundantly clear that we are content with the current strategy.  The summit is due to discuss the outcome of the semester process and responses to country-specific recommendations.  The greater flexibility of the Commission is to be welcomed, as is the change of its tone.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, there has not yet been a change of policy on Greece.  Syriza has long since abandoned its original approach of demanding the right to abandon debts, receive more money and implement a vast expansion in spending.  Greece needs significant debt relief, whether by a freezing of debt or some other measure.  Greece cannot achieve sustainable growth without further relief.  Allowing this issue to continue to roll along risks a return to the debt crisis of recent years.  Its impact will be felt by all through rising costs of borrowing.  Ireland should speak against the drift and call for a new urgency on this issue.<\/p> <p> Donald Tusk has filled the role of President of the European Council excellently.  He has shown strength in moving the agenda forward as much as he can and he has shown an ability to speak hard truths.  I have been particularly impressed by how he has been consistent in speaking up for the rights of small nations, especially those threatened by outside aggression.  The Fianna F&aacute;il position is that President Tusk absolutely deserves a new term and that Ireland should actively support him.<\/p> <p> The summit will briefly discuss external affairs.  The humanitarian crisis caused by the Syrian Government, with the active aid of the Russian Federation, remains as acute as ever.  To read and watch families in Mosul under consistent attack is heart-breaking.  An entire generation of children will never be able to have a normal life after seeing indiscriminate bombings, shootings and random assassinations.  Historians will look back and ask why Europe did not do more to stop it at this time in our history.<\/p> <p> Given the position of the Trump Administration on refugees in the USA and its intention to cut overseas aid significantly, Europe must take a different route.  The case for a significant increase in direct humanitarian aid remains overwhelming.<\/p> <p> The awkwardness of holding an anniversary celebration at the moment when a member state begins the process of leaving is obvious.  I would hope that the Treaty of Rome events to be held on 25 March will have some substance and that they will be a demonstration of respect and solidarity.  Europe has achieved incredibly positive progress in the past 60 years and rejected the destruction of the ideological extremes.  It is worth renewing.  However, to achieve this we need leadership, urgency and ambition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800025#Z00200","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488980700,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Most of my remarks will be around the situation in the North of Ireland, the situation with regard to permanent structured co-operation and the whole issue of the militarisation of Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Last week's election in the North was historic.  The results have transformed the political landscape on that part of our island.  The Unionist majority in the Northern Ireland Assembly is gone.  The belief in the permanence of Unionist domination has been shattered.  The decision of Martin McGuinness to resign has been vindicated by the significantly increased turnout.  The process of restoring the political institutions will be difficult but not impossible.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants the institutions to be up and running on the basis of equality and respect and we are keen for the outstanding agreements to be implemented in full.  Does the Taoiseach intend to discuss this with his European counterparts?<\/p>  <p>  I understand the Taoiseach will meet Theresa May on the sidelines of the summit to discuss the North.  It is important to remember that the British Government is not a neutral party in the talks that started yesterday.  In fact, it is part of the problem, as it has continually refused to implement and honour its agreements and responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government can no longer stand back and allow the British Government to abdicate its responsibilities under a range of agreements.  In his meeting with the British Prime Minister, will the Taoiseach demand that the British Government honours the many commitments it has repeatedly broken?  I have in mind, for example, its failure to implement an Irish language Act or to deal with legacy issues.<\/p>  <p>  The election in the North was also about DUP arrogance and the alleged corruption inherent in the renewable heating scheme.  However, Brexit was a fundamental part of the debate and it shaped how people voted.  We all know the consequences of Brexit for jobs and the livelihoods of citizens throughout this island, especially in Border regions.  One group of workers will be immediately penalised by the introduction of a hard Border.  This group includes the hundreds of small farmers who travel back and forth every day across the Border.  Many of them live and work in my constituency.<\/p><p>The huge difficulty that an imposed Border will create is one of the major reasons the majority of people in the North voted to remain in the EU.  The EU is not perfect and, in fact, needs radical reform.  However, an arrogant and contemptuous Tory Government in London is preparing to trample over the Good Friday Agreement and the principle of consent by dragging the North out of the EU and introducing a hard Border on this island.  That is one of the reasons there was a huge increase in voter turnout in Border areas last Thursday.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s demand that the Irish Government must negotiate for special status for the North within the EU was backed by a majority of Deputies last month when a Private Members' motion on the issue was passed by the House.  This demand also strongly resonated with voters last week across the North.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in received the most first preference votes in every Border constituency and every Border constituency now has two or three Sinn F&eacute;in MLAs.  In contrast, the Tories did not seek election in one Border constituency and came last in every other Border constituency, except one.  The highest support they got for any of their candidates was 85 votes.  British Tories have no mandate, no support and no understanding of the reality of life in Ireland, yet Theresa May last week again emphasised her intention to centralise decision-making in Westminster following Brexit.  The Taoiseach must use this European Council meeting to inform his European counterparts of the pressing need for the North to be granted a special designated status within the EU.  If matters remain on schedule, the British Prime Minister will trigger Article 50 this month and the real negotiations for Britain&rsquo;s divorce from the EU will commence.  The Irish Government must state that it wants special status for the North and that it will not allow the British Government to impose a hard Border in Ireland.<\/p> <p> Last Monday, at a joint meeting of EU foreign affairs and defence Ministers, it was unanimously agreed to set up a new headquarters in Brussels for EU military training missions.  While it is only focused on training missions at present, it will be reviewed in 2018 and it may take charge of combat missions.  This is a further militarisation of the EU and an advancement towards the creation of a EU army.  The Taoiseach need not take our word for it.  Speaking after the meeting on Monday the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Affairs called the new headquarters \"a first step\" to \"a European army\".  The German Minister of Defence said, \"We took a very important step toward a European security and defence union\", while the foreign affairs representative of the European Commission said, \"The EU always takes a soft approach to hard security, but we also have some hard power that we are strengthening\".<\/p> <p> Irish neutrality was further eroded at this meeting and there does not appear to have been a whimper of opposition from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade or the Minister of State at the Department of Defence.  This is not surprising considering that Fine Gael has always tried to undermine and dismantle Irish neutrality.  The sheer support for neutrality among the Irish people is all that has prevented it from doing so in the past.  Fine Gael's policy is clearly to let the EU quietly create a standing army.  This is something that is feared by the people of the country.  There is a statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, about the meeting on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website.  It mentions a discussion about the EU's global strategy but, interestingly, there is no mention of this huge decision to create a military headquarters.  Strangely, there is also no statement about such an important meeting from the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, on the Department of Defence website.<\/p> <p> There are reports that there was a lengthy debate about whether the head of the new EU military headquarters should be called a \"commander\" or \"director\", before \"director\" was chosen as the more appropriate title.  That seems to have been the height of the debate, and the Government wonders why people are increasingly frustrated and fed up with the EU.  There are no reports of Irish Ministers standing up for Irish neutrality and against the further militarisation of the EU.  These issues must be discussed at the European Council meeting.  Will the Taoiseach confirm he will speak out against the creation of an EU army and that Ireland will play no part in its creation, or will he be honest with the Irish people, for once and for all and state his Government&rsquo;s support for an EU army?  It has to be one or the other, and it is time we were given the truth on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800026#AA00200","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488981300,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I noted a report at the weekend that the Taoiseach might be in line for the job of President of the European Council.  I wonder whether the possible job for Deputy Enda Kenny in Europe is the reward for the best-boy-in-the-class routine he has pursued in terms of implementing some of the misguided and cruel policies of the European Union directed against both the people of this country and millions of people across the wider European Union.  There was also the EU's brutal and inhumane treatment of desperate people trying to come to Europe and flee war, civil conflict and desperate circumstances in north Africa and the Middle East.  The Taoiseach has failed to speak out against the failures, cruelties and injustices for which Europe has been responsible and, worse, has enthusiastically endorsed the cruel, misguided and bankrupt policies that have been pursued.  I will cite a few of them and ask the Taoiseach what position he will take on them.  Will he speak out about what is right or will he continue to stay silent and toe the European line to secure the top job in Europe?<\/p>  <p>  The European Union has just concluded a deal with Libya, if one can describe Libya as a state.  It is a failed state.  It has collapsed and there are now three factions running it.  Incredibly, the European Union claims to care about women and children.  We heard the Taoiseach speak today about how much he cares about the women and children who suffered in the Bon Secours institution in Tuam.  Does he care about what human rights organisations are saying about the EU's deal with Libya?  They have described the deal as one in which the EU is ready to sacrifice thousands of vulnerable men, women and children to stop them reaching European shores by herding them into warehouses run by armed militias in Libya.  The EU will pay these Libyan forces - one could not call them a government - &euro;200 million to prevent physically 1 million refugees in Libya trying to get away from the disaster in Libya and these horrific warehouses where, according to those who reach Europe's shores, people are being raped, abused and starved.  The civil rights situation in Libya is horrific and it is the major incentive for people trying to flee across the Mediterranean, where many drown, to gain access to Europe, where the doors are closed.<\/p>  <p>  This is the second shameful deal the EU has made.  Previously, it made a deal with Turkey, whose regime also has a brutal human rights record.  Undoubtedly, these deals run counter to the European Convention on Human Rights in terms of their treatment of migrants by shoving them back into appalling conditions and into the hands of regimes that have no regard for human rights.<\/p><p>Why is the Taoiseach not speaking out on these matters, on the shameful treatment of desperate, vulnerable people? <\/p> <p> Incredibly, it appears that there has been a blanket ban operating for the past two years in this country on Libyans being granted family reunification.   In many cases, these Libyans are qualified professionals.  I know of one Libyan who has submitted a family reunification application.  He is a medical doctor and has been offered a job as a registrar in Galway University Hospital but his application has been turned down.  He has been told that it is okay for him to stay in Libya, where an horrendous situation pertains.  There seems to be a blanket ban for people like that doctor and other desperate people from Libya but with two notable exceptions.  If a Libyan is associated with the oil or beef industry, he or she can come here.  We all know how important oil is to Europe and beef is to the beef barons in this country.  Is that our immigration policy now?  Is that what the Taoiseach is doing in terms of speaking up for the human rights of desperate, vulnerable people in Europe?<\/p> <p> Europe often portrays itself as a defender of progressive social values.  However, a report published today, on International Women's Day, shows that the gender pay gap is widening and getting worse.  The gap between what men and women earn for doing the same job is growing in Europe.  Ireland is at the bottom of the league table in this deteriorating scenario of increasing gender inequality in paid employment.  Incredibly, the situation is getting worse.<\/p> <p> In stark contrast, as we speak we see scenes on O'Connell Bridge and all across the country, of a generation of young women demanding an end to their second class status as women and an end to the horrendous treatment that has been meted out to them by this State, from the Magdalen laundries, the Bethany homes, the Tuam Bon Secours scandal and so on.  These women want equality.  They are on the streets today, demanding equality but the European Union is not only failing to deliver that equality, it is actually presiding over worsening inequality in terms of the treatment of women.<\/p> <p> Does Deputy Paul Murphy wish to speak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800027#BB00200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488981900,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800028#CC00200","speaker":"1308"},{"type":"speech","time":1488981900,"counter":309,"content":"<p>The Deputy is late but I will give him my last two minutes.

It is also a reflection of the crisis of the so-called extreme centre which has borne within it the extreme right that we currently see.  The reality is that the EU is an institution that was founded, and which has acted, to enhance the interests of imperialism and big business on a global stage but none of that will be mentioned in this declaration.<\/p>  <p>  The road being pushed forward is a two tier or multi-speed Europe but the reality for ordinary people is that there have always been two speeds or two tiers in Europe, with the fast lane reserved for bankers, big business and privateers who take precedence over the victims of austerity, namely working class people and migrants.  We see this taking place in particular with regard to the militarisation of Europe, which this Government refuses to acknowledge.  In the last few months we have seen the speeding up of a process of militarisation and military co-operation in the EU.  In the last six months the EU has taken decisive steps towards militarisation with its proposals for a common military research and development budget and for 2% of the GDP of each member state to be spent on the military.  The Taoiseach has continually tried to avoid the issue by saying the D&aacute;il and the Irish Government have a veto on the deployment of troops.  That is a pathetic excuse which amounts to tacit support for the militarisation of the EU, in the context of the setting up of a common military headquarters.<\/p>  <p>  The other shame that I will not have time to deal with in depth is the racist, anti-migrant policy that has turned the Mediterranean into a graveyard for those who are trying to escape the horrors caused by imperialism.  Will the Taoiseach stand up to that?  Will he stand up to defend the right to asylum?  I seriously doubt it, given that he will be presenting shamrock to Donald Trump next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800028#CC01400","speaker":"1308"},{"type":"speech","time":1488981900,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.<\/p><p>When the Taoiseach goes to Europe I would like him to use his time there to defend the Palestinians who are at the mercy of Israeli military forces on a daily basis.  There has been much talk for a long time about the two state solution but that solution is actually dead now.  Its death began in 1967 when the Israelis took over so much of the Palestinian land.  After the Palestinian elections took place in 2006, which were fair and were monitored by UN bodies, the US and Israel, supported by Europe, refused to recognise the result because they did not like the fact that Hamas had actually won.  They decided to support the Palestinian Authority.  Sadly, the Palestinian Authority is now part of the problem rather than the solution.  The authority has been armed and trained by the Israelis and the Americans and its main task is to control the Palestinian people.<\/p><p>The two state solution never offered much to the Palestinians, even when there was a slim prospect of it happening.  It offered nothing to the huge number of Palestinians living in Israel under an apartheid system.  They have no human rights and there is no justice for Palestinians living in Israel.  The two state solution offered nothing for the more than 2 million Palestinians living in refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan either.<\/p><p>The European take on Palestine and Israel is really important.  The US has had no problem with supporting Israel's attempts at genocide in Gaza in recent years but the EU could play a positive role.  However, when the EU refused to recognise the results of the 2006 election, it removed the pressure on Israel to stop building settlements.  It also gave Israel <i>carte blanche<\/i>to continue building its wall and it ended any possibility of a genuinely independent Palestinian state.  That is not feasible anymore.  It is not socially, economically or geographically feasible any more.  That possibility is now gone and we must face up to that.  What does that mean?  Where are we going now?  We are heading for a one state solution and what we want is a state where Israelis and Palestinians live together on equal terms; a state where there are human rights, civil rights and democracy for all.  Of course, that would mean an end to the Zionist dream of the Jewish state which is currently operating in Israel.<\/p><p>We pay lip service in this country to caring about Palestinians.  If we really cared about them we would not allow Israel to do what it does.  We would be a very strong voice in Europe, trying to get Europe to change its position on Palestine.  Two weeks ago myself and Deputy Clare Daly were invited to Iran to speak at a conference on Palestine which was attended by representatives from 80 countries, mostly in Asia and Africa.<\/p><p>An opinion poll within Palestine between the West Bank and Gaza indicated that two thirds of Palestinians now realise that the two-state solution is not possible and they want a one-state solution where they will get equal rights and justice because they are a long way from it at the moment.  One of the biggest disgraces of the past 50 years has been how Europe has allowed Israel to engage in crimes against humanity and genocide against the people of Palestine.  It is horrific.  It is very disappointing that our Government is not taking a strong position on it.  We have no problem doing business with the Saudis who probably cut off more heads in a month than ISIS does.  Ireland used to be a neutral country until we allowed Shannon Airport to be used to bomb the living daylights out of so many homes in the region.  We used to be proud to be a neutral country, but it is gone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800028#CC01500","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488982500,"counter":323,"content":"<p>T&aacute; c&uacute;pla rud gur mhaith liom caint faoi san am at&aacute; agam.  T&aacute; dh&aacute; rud i gceist agam at&aacute; ag cur imn&iacute; ar dhaoine.  An ch&eacute;ad ceann n&aacute; CETA.  We know CETA will apply provisionally from April, but we are told it will not be brought before the D&aacute;il for ratification until a judgment has been handed down by the European Court of Justice on another trade deal.  The concern is that this is only on one deal, the Singapore one.  Under CETA a commercial tribunal will adjudicate - not an Irish or EU court - when a company takes legal action against a state.  There is a glaring absence of a cost-benefit analysis and due diligence.  Another concern is that this commercial tribunal will remain in place for 20 years even if future governments do not want it.<\/p>  <p>  We claim we are committed to European values.  One of those is surely the right to trade without recourse to investor-court systems by foreign-based companies.  Therefore, will Ireland seek a reference to the European Court of Justice on the legality under EU treaties and law of the investor-court systems?  I asked that question of the Taoiseach some weeks ago and he said he would get back to me on it but he has not done so to date.  Such legal clarity on the investor-court system is required before any ratification vote.<\/p>  <p>  The second area of concern is migration.  We know the figures on migration and internal displacement.  One in particular is very striking.  The number of registered Syrian refugees in countries such as Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan is the same as Ireland's population.  There are challenges regarding humanitarian needs and the threat from radical terrorism.  We need to ensure that we continue our commitment to protecting the human rights and dignity of all.  We all need to be aware of our obligations under international law.  Under the Geneva Convention we are required to protect those fleeing war and oppression.  Under the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we should support and protect one another regardless of race, religion, nationality or economic circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  However, we are increasingly hearing the growing securitisation narrative.  Security-related language is starting to penetrate the human rights area.  It is a shift from the humanitarian paradigm to the security paradigm.  The UN special rapporteur pointed out how, instead of deterring terrorism or radicalisation, the securitised approach is having the opposite effect.  It polarises us and feeds into the narrative of terrorism.  That report states that efforts for education, employment, inclusion and respect for human rights represent the most effective approach in countering the spread of terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  We know the root causes of migration are land grabs, war, famine, extreme poverty and rights displacement.  Those root causes need to be tackled in order that people do not feel they have to leave their country of origin.  While the EU has been a major contributor when it comes to development aid, two recent approaches are very alarming, namely, the EU migration partnership frameworks and the EU emergency trust funds.  The alarm is coming from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, institutions and civil society, which claim there has been minimal if any involvement from them in designing the trust funds or in allocating the funds.  There are concerns over the heavy persuasive methods being used to get African countries to comply and the sanctioning of African countries if they do not comply.<\/p>  <p>  There are concerns that those approaches are diverting from the real aim of development aid, which is to tackle the root causes of poverty.  There are concerns that these trust funds are going to countries where there are serious human rights violations.  For example, Sudan is being seen as a partner in addressing migration.  It is a country that fails to respect international refugee law.  It has a repressive regime that forcibly returns refugees to Eritrea.  It is a country of forced displacement and there is also evidence of cluster bombs.  We know about the problems in Libya.  We must ask where people will be sent if they are caught by the Libyan authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Oxfam has pointed out that the EU is now bargaining with countries that it previously would have held at arm's length due to their abuse of human rights.  Returning to European values, there is supposed to be inclusion, respect and dignity from all the European countries that have signed up to the sustainable development goals.  Very alarmingly, the EU is using distorted figures, particularly from Niger, to claim that these new policies are working but they are not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800029#DD00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1488982500,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Glaoim ar an Teachta Michael Healy-Rae, at&aacute; ag roinnt a chuid ama leis an Teachta Mattie McGrath.

I wish to concentrate on the effect of Brexit on our trade and our citizens generally.  I thank members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, such as Deputy Haughey, who have really applied themselves to a very serious job of work to try to minimise the negative effects Brexit will have on our tourism, exports and citizens.<\/p>  <p>  More than 30,000 people travel between the North and the South each day.  Many businesses interact across the Border every day.  I appreciate the Government's efforts in trying to ensure we will not have a hard border.  I appreciate the efforts of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, the Taoiseach and others from all sides of the House.  We have to stick together on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  A few weeks ago the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs met Michel Barnier and others leading the team on the Brexit negotiations.  I appreciated very much what these people told us.  For instance, the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, left us in no doubt that he was very well aware of the situation in the North of Ireland.  He knows how precious the peace process is to us.  He understands what it is like on the ground, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows more than anybody else.<\/p>  <p>  Do I have confidence in the negotiating team that is in place?  Yes, I do.  They are people, like the Leas-Cheann Comhairle himself, of great experience who have been involved in the political system for many years.  We need that type of experience at this critical time.  We have only one chance to get this right.  It will take a couple of years.  Once Article 50 is triggered, we will go down a road where nobody ever went before.  I am sure the architects who wrote Article 50 assumed it would never be used.  However, we are where we are.  I do not believe in lamenting and saying, \"Isn't this awful.  Isn't it bad?\"  My attitude about problems in life is that we should put down our heads, roll up our sleeves and get on with it.<\/p>  <p>  Along with Deputy Mattie McGrath and others today we were very glad to meet representatives from the IFA and others in Buswells Hotel.  They gave an excellent presentation and the heading on the screen was \"The most worrying times for farmers in the last 50 years.\"  That is certainly true because as every public representative in this House knows, it is extremely hard to make money out of farming at this time.  Dairy farmers, beef and lamb producers and tillage farmers are all having a very tough time.  This is a more difficult time for every sector of agriculture than ever previously experienced.<\/p><p>There are so many regulations to comply with such as the pollution regulations, standard sizes for yards and collection facilities.  While machinery and equipment has, rightly, to be up to certain standards, it places a tough burden on farming families.<\/p> <p> It is not all just about the farmers.  We also have to be concerned about tourism and other exports.  In my own small part as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, every week we meet with ambassadors from all over Europe.  Last week, we had the British ambassador and the week before we had the German ambassador.  I am playing my role in ensuring we are getting to know and forging links with people because we have to.  We have to make sure that we stick together and do our best to work our way out of the problems we have at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800029#DD00400","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488983100,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputies Michael Healy-Rae and Haughey, as well as other members of the European affairs committee, who have done much work on the ground.  While not a personal criticism of the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, that is work the Government should be doing.  The Taoiseach referred to the last Council meeting which 27 member states attended without the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, to exchange views on the future direction of Europe and preparations for the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome on 25 March.  Brexit was not on the agenda in Malta, however.  I do not know what the Taoiseach was doing in Malta if Brexit was not on the agenda.  It is on everyone&rsquo;s lips, man, woman and child where I come from.  There was a timely presentation this morning from the IFA at which it announced its action plan for Brexit.  It is a sad state of affairs if we are going to depend on NGOs to deal with Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  With 65% self-sufficiency, the UK is a net importer of beef.  Ireland is the main import supplier, accounting for almost 70% of UK beef imports.  The UK is the market for 50% of Irish beef exports, with a further 45% going to the EU market.  Overall, a reduction in access to and the value of the UK market would have a negative impact on the Irish beef sector and, potentially, on the overall EU beef market.  As a mature market, the capacity of the EU beef market to absorb increased imports is low.  Irish beef exports of 270,000 tonnes to the UK represent almost 10% of the intra-EU beef trade.  The displacement of these exports would, therefore, have a destabilising and devastating effect on the overall EU market.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, 34% of Ireland&rsquo;s dairy exports went to the UK.  This comprised 53% of cheese exports, 29% of butter exports and 12% of skimmed milk powder exports.  Exports of cheddar cheese were 78,000 tonnes, representing 82% of all cheddar imported by the UK in 2016.  Retention of tariff-free access to the UK market is critically important, particularly for Irish cheddar exports.  Overall, the loss of or disimproved access to the UK market could have a destabilising impact on the overall value of the Irish dairy sector.  I thank Ms Rowena Dwyer, the IFA&rsquo;s chief economist from Tipperary, for her excellent research and figures.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland exported 13,000 tonnes of sheepmeat to the UK in 2016.  In the UK market, almost 90% of UK lamb imports come from outside the EU, namely, New Zealand and Australia, while EU exports go predominantly to four EU member states with France accounting for 50% of these.  The key issue for the sheep sector will be the decision taken on the division of the large EU tariff-rate quota, TRQ, for New Zealand lamb.  Any displacement of New Zealand lamb imports, which currently go to the UK market, will have a negative impact on the overall value of the EU lamb market.<\/p>  <p>  It is the same with pigmeat and poultry.  There is significant bilateral trade between Ireland and the UK in pigmeat and poultry products, built up over many years.  The disruption to existing trade flows, through tariff barriers or other increases in costs, would reduce the overall value of these markets.  In addition, the continuation of cross-Border trade of pigs for processing is a critical issue, reflecting the overall processing capacity of the sector on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  On tillage, Ireland is a net importer of grains.  The geographical closeness to Northern Ireland results in some grain farmers exporting their product to Northern Ireland, rather than selling to more distant parts of the island.  The imposition of tariffs on UK imports would potentially result in a resourcing of imports from the EU with increased transport costs.  The already struggling mushroom industry has been decimated with the change in currency rates because of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot understand why the Brexit issue was not on the agenda in Malta.  However, the Government better get its finger out and start talking about it everywhere, anywhere and at any gathering of EU member states.<\/p>  <p>  I have tried to raise the issue of the persecution of Christians, minority Muslims and the Yazidis in the Middle East.  There is genocide against them but we cannot have a proper debate about it while Europe stands idly by.  I must take up Deputy Wallace on Hamas.  This is the same group that has been designated as a terrorist group by the US, Canada and Japan.  Its declared goal is the destruction of Israel.  We cannot mete it out on one hand and not take in the other.  We have to look at genocide overall wherever it comes from.  The slaughter and persecution of Christians is clearing Christian civilisation from the Middle East.  It will destabilise the whole world.  Under the different dictators there in the past, people of whatever religion had freedom to practice and protection.  Now, they are being slaughtered and persecuted wilfully while a blind eye is being turned to their plight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800030#EE00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1488983100,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I hate to ask the Deputy to conclude when he is in full flight, but his time has concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800030#EE00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1488983100,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Thank you for that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800030#EE00400","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1488983100,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I am glad to be able to make several comments in advance of the European Council meeting at this historic time when we are coming up to the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome and our nearest neighbour and closest colleague in the European Union is about to exit it.  It will be seen as a historic mistake because we live in a world where increased solidarity, not just in the Union but across the world with other countries, is what is required to be able to meet the great challenges of the 21st century, to live sustainably on this planet, to feed 9 billion people by the middle of the century and to live in peace, which we failed so clearly to do in the 20th century.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier, I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of the White Paper on the future of Europe which the European Commission had presented.  For what I understood from the Taoiseach, that will be an item for discussion at this upcoming Council meeting.  It is important we declare some of the positions we will take in that regard.  First, we should not be looking for a two-speed Europe.  That takes from the very core of the philosophy behind the Treaty of Rome and the sense that collaboration and international co-operation are what is required.  I fear if we do see a two-speed Europe, it will breach that fundamental approach.  It is better for us to get consensus and win common agreement.<\/p>  <p>  It does not mean Europe just has to be a monolithic organisation.  We have learned, as has the Commission and others, that we need to breathe within the European rules.  There needs to be a genuine commitment to subsidiarity, as well as allowing flexibility and innovation in a whole range of different strategies.  Not everything has to be regulated from the centre, controlled by increasing bodies of directives or by central European funding.<\/p>  <p>  There are a couple of areas in which we need to declare our position.  One is in security.  It is appropriate and right for us to go back to the very principles involved in our membership of the Union.  As I understand, in our application in the early to mid-1960s, there was a certain pressure at the time that Ireland would possibly join NATO or would be engaged in common military activity.  It is interesting, as I understand from reading the history of the time, that it was the German finance Ministry and the American State Department which in the end relented on that and accepted Ireland's original application on the basis of our tradition of neutrality.  It is right for us to stand with that tradition, which has benefitted Europe.<\/p><p>It has strengthened Europe to have a country like Ireland that is so actively engaged in UN peacekeeping missions and that has a different history or connection to other countries, particularly in the Middle East and elsewhere, because of our colonised past compared with France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Britain, Italy any of the other main European countries.  Europe is strengthened by having a country like Ireland with a different tradition.  We should stand up for that and say that while there is real pressure to increase spending on defence, it should be spent on peacekeeping and overseas development aid and not connecting that to trade but to the United Nations values we also espouse.  We should set the sustainable development goals - negotiated by an Irish civil servant and signed in New York by all members of the Union in September 2015 - as a manifesto for the European Union.  Those goals already provide a manifesto for the northern and southern hemispheres in the context of development.<\/p> <p> We should stand up for an open Europe in terms of the free movement of people.  I listened to what Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Paul Murphy said about not believing in the European Union because it does not show solidarity in that sense.  However, it is our best vehicle for solidarity.  If that is what we need in terms of international order - I believe it is - I do not see an alternative.  Neither do I see what is their alternative, other than trying to bring the European Union to that sort of position.  That is the strategic role we have to play in these talks about the future of Europe.   In the context of those discussions, the free movement of people - both within the Union and, in the context of refugees seeking asylum, from the outside - is critical because if we do not provide that, effectively, we are saying that the free movement of capital, not the free movement of people, gives undue power and influence to capital in the entire process of the way our economy develops.  That is not what we need now.  We need a balanced approach and it is only the European Union, in the scale it provides, that can give us that control on capital and that power against the power of corporations.  I do not understand what the Anti-Austerity Alliance's alternative is if it does not see the Union as a vehicle to impose that control on corporate capitalist interests.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we start to stand up for climate action and see the European Union as a vehicle in that regard.  In that respect, we are in a slightly shamed position at present.  Ireland is one of only two countries that will not meet their 2020 emissions reduction targets and one of only four that will not meet their renewable energy targets.  Ireland is increasingly seen in Europe - I have observed this up close in recent years - as akin to Poland in being a denier of effective action on climate, not only in the agricultural sector but also in areas of renewable energy and climate adaption plans.  We are not taking this issue seriously.  We are not leading on it in Europe.  The risk for us is that not only will we be shamed in that regard but we will also miss out on the economic opportunity that is developing for those countries that want to lead.  Europe should be what it says it wants to be, which is a leader on environmental action.  We should take up that mantle.  We should carry that as our vision of the future and as our brand within the European Union.  We are not doing that.  It is not Europe but Ireland that needs to change in that regard.<\/p> <p> In terms of economic integration, we also need to change.  We must be aware that Ireland is seen as a tax haven across the rest of Europe.  Regardless of whether we like that view or disagree with it, that is how Ireland is perceived.  If one were to take a blind survey of ten people on the corridors of power in Europe and ask them how they would view Ireland regarding the application of tax justice, they would say it is a tax haven and that it is undermining the ability of the European Union to have a social and just economy.  Ireland is seen as being centre stage when it comes to the social justice issue relating to the &euro;1 trillion in tax lost each year due to inappropriate tax avoidance by corporations.  We are not going to go to Europe and say we want common tax bands.  There must be some flexibility and subsidiarity but we must stop being seen as the ones who are leading the worst sort of practice, which is how we are perceived at present.  These are the broad principles in terms of how change should be applied.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach has a responsibility to report to and involve this House on how the Brexit negotiations will proceed.  It is interesting that, as we speak, the House of Lords is engaging in a debate on whether it will have a vote on the Brexit negotiations as they evolve.  It is important that this House should have a real role and responsibility in the context of whatever negotiating position the Government adopts in these historic negotiations.  It is not acceptable for us to sit back and say it is a European Council decision.  I presume that Christian democrats still probably comprise a majority of the membership of the European Council.  This deal will be done in the side rooms of Christian democrat meeting houses, but that is not appropriate.  The question we must ask is what is our role when it comes to the crunch in advising the Taoiseach in terms of whether he says \"Yes\" or \"No\" to any deal.  As I understand it, national governments still have the power to \"Yes\" or \"No\" to whatever is the final arrangements relating to any deal.  It is not acceptable for this to be left to a Taoiseach operating on his or her own and not consulting or involving this House.  In the coming months and as this process commences, I would like us to debate what exactly is the role and involvement of this House in terms of the negotiation strategy that will be undertaken.  To date, the only answer we have to that is that we cannot discuss it until the trigger is pulled.  The trigger is about to be pulled.  We need to be involved in a much more integrated way.<\/p> <p> Other Deputies stated that the Government is not active enough.  This Parliament is not active enough.  In the context of every matter I consider, be it EURATOM, energy policy, digital services and what is the effect of not listening to the European Court of Justice, the credible implications of these negotiations on every aspect of life is clear.  We should be involved in this issue.  It should not simply be hived off and dealt with at a European Council meeting, with the Taoiseach coming back and stating \"This is the deal, I have already accepted it and you have not had a say\".  That would not be good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800030#EE00500","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488983700,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I thank those who contributed this debate.  As the Taoiseach indicated, I will address in greater detail some of the economic issues for discussion at the European Council meeting.<\/p>  <p>  Leaders will conclude the first phase of European semester 2017 - the Union&rsquo;s annual cycle of economic policy co-ordination - and will provide guidance to member states for submission in April of their stability programme updates and national reform programmes.  The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, will join the meeting and there will also be a broader discussion on economic developments.<\/p>  <p>  There is welcome evidence that the EU is on a recovery trajectory, with all member state economies expected to grow this year.  The Commission&rsquo;s winter forecasts, published on 13 February, indicate gross domestic product, GDP, growth of 1.6% for the euro area in 2017, and 1.8% for the EU as a whole.  This is still a fragile recovery, with several uncertainties facing us, not least in the geopolitical context.  However, the more positive economic outlook continues to slowly feed through to Europe&rsquo;s labour markets.  The emphasis on investment in general is seen as helping to make the recovery sustainable.  As stated in the winter forecast, real GDP in the euro area has grown for 15 consecutive quarters, employment is growing at a robust pace, and unemployment continues to fall, although it remains above pre-crisis levels.  Measures on youth employment and schemes dedicated to young people appear to be bearing fruit; figures published by the Commission in October indicate that there are 1.4 million fewer young people unemployed in the EU than in 2013.  A key risk for Ireland is prolonged weakness in the euro area, so this more positive economic forecast is very welcome.  Ireland&rsquo;s recovery, while still incomplete, remains firmly on course.<\/p>  <p>  I expect that the European Council will give strong political reinforcement to the key pillars of European semester 2017 as set out in the Commission&rsquo;s annual growth survey: boosting investment; a renewed commitment to both national and EU-level structural reforms; and continued fiscal responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal on extending and expanding the European Fund for Strategic Investments, EFSI, is evidence of the political prioritisation of the investment agenda by the Commission and member states.  The EFSI has directly supported and underpinned a range of strategic priorities, including infrastructural investments.  While the impact in Ireland has been modest to date, the Government continues to evaluate where EFSI lending might complement other sources of funding for potential Irish programmes.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission has now presented a comprehensive assessment for each member state under this year&rsquo;s European semester.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the assessment is again broadly positive, reflecting the strength of the economic recovery under way and growing employment.  The report also points to the decline in public debt, diminishing financial sector challenges and the considerable strengthening of our external accounts among the important positive developments.<\/p>  <p> The country report assesses Ireland's economy in light of the Commission&rsquo;s annual growth survey published on 16 November 2016, which called on member states to redouble their efforts on the three elements of the virtuous triangle of economic policy - boosting investment, pursuing structural reforms and ensuring responsible fiscal policies.<\/p><p>Our country report acknowledges progress but highlights the need to continue to work to resolve legacy issues such as non-performing loans and to remain vigilant to potential external shocks.  It finds that progress is broadly on track in addressing the country-specific recommendations provided to Ireland last year.  Thanks to a streamlining of the semester process, we now have some time before draft proposals for the next round of country-specific recommendations are produced by the Commission.  This window allows for stronger national-level engagement with the Commission's assessment, which should in turn encourage greater national ownership of the semester process.  I know the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs attaches particular priority to its role in respect of the semester.<\/p> <p> In addition to the broader economic recovery and our country report, which are of particular relevance to Ireland, the European Council will address several other items under the heading of jobs, growth and competitiveness.  I wish to highlight two of these in particular, namely, trade and the Single Market.  Ensuring free and fair trade while showing commitment to a robust trade policy is essential for creating jobs and growth.  It is one of the foundations of European prosperity and Ireland will continue to be a strong supporter of free trade in the future.  Another foundation stone is the Single Market.  Removing barriers has led to economic growth and is clearly in Ireland's interests.  Despite all the commitments in this area, the Single Market, particularly the Single Market for services, is still incomplete.  We would like to push ahead with a forward-looking agenda, particularly in respect of the digital Single Market, DSM.  There have been positive steps on, for example, roaming charges and portability of digital subscriptions but there is still much more to do.  Ireland, as exemplified by the Taoiseach's initiative in December, will continue to push for an ambitious approach on the proposals under the DSM strategy.  As the Taoiseach has indicated, he will report to the House on these and other issues following the meeting of the European Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800031#FF00200","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions (Resumed) - Priority Questions","time":1488984300,"counter":335,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800032#GG00175"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Reviews","time":1488984300,"counter":336,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800032#GG00200"},{"type":"question","time":1488984300,"counter":337,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[12346\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800032#GG00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to review the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, specifically in respect of its impact on the hospital sector.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488984300,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Deputy Billy Kelleher has 30 seconds to introduce his question if he so wishes - or does he wish to catch his breath?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800032#GG00350","answer":true,"speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1488984300,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I am in training so my oxygen levels are not too bad.<\/p><p>Does the Minister have any plans regarding the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, specifically in respect of its impact on the hospital sector and the concerns about the treatment of private patients in public hospitals?

I acknowledge the Deputy has raised the issue with me previously in the Oireachtas Committee on Health and when we were considering the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act.  I acknowledge his interest in the issue and wish to put a little information on the record of the House on the policy rationale behind this when it was originally put in place.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, although a proportion of activity in public hospitals involves the provision of care to private patients, the core purpose of our public health system is obviously to provide services for public patients.  Government policy is to ensure that there is equitable access for public patients, that the proportion of private activity is appropriately controlled and that the costs of provision of services to private patients are recouped by public hospitals.  It is important to note that when patients are admitted to hospital, they can choose whether to be treated as private or public patients.<\/p>  <p>  The Health (Amendment) Act 2013 provided for the charging of all private inpatients.  The Act addressed a situation identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2008 report whereby when a private inpatient was accommodated in a public or non-designated bed, no private inpatient charge applied.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General noted that in 2008, 45% of all private inpatient throughput was not the subject of a maintenance charge because the patient was accommodated in a designated public bed.  A further 5% was not charged for because the patient was accommodated in a non-designated bed, with the result that only 50% of private inpatient throughput gave rise to any maintenance charge at all.  This was despite the fact that due to treatment costs, the type of room in which a patient is accommodated is by no means the major contributor to the overall costs of a hospital stay.<\/p>  <p>  The absence of a maintenance charge in such instances represented a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and to taxpayers - I think this was generally accepted by many parties at the time - and was an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, which cover most private patients.  The additional income generated as a result of the enactment of the 2013 legislation is a key element of the funding to the public hospital system and any curtailment of this funding stream would put pressure on the taxpayer to maintain services.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to review this, as the Deputy knows, and I will outline in my next response what I intend to do in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800032#GG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488984300,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that there will be a review, which we requested.  There are concerns about this.  It has been brought to my attention by some health care providers in the private sector that there is now competition in certain areas in trying to attract private patients and treating them on public beds.  The concept of the 20% designation in public hospitals with treatment of private patients was originally a historical hangover from the time when it was a sweetener given to retain consultants we were unable to pay to keep them in service.  However, subsequently, this has been breached continually, and it is not just me saying this.  The bottom line is that Mr. O'Brien, the director general of the HSE, said that the 2013 Act has made a farce of the application of the rules restricting the level of private practice senior doctors can carry out in public hospitals.  In an e-mail to the Minister's predecessor, the director general said large voluntary teaching hospitals were in some instances breaking the rules in how they went about recruiting consultants in the context of attracting and being able to guarantee that more than the 20% of private patients would be treated in public beds.  Overall, we could now have private patients receiving preferential treatment, and more of them receiving preferential treatment ahead of public patients, to bolster hospital budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800032#GG00600","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1488984300,"counter":342,"content":"<p>That is absolutely not the policy intention, and Deputy Kelleher's assertion in this regard is one of the reasons I have instructed my Department to carry out a review.  I have asked the Department of Health to conduct an analysis of trends in private activity in public hospitals since the Health (Amendment) Act commenced in 2013 and I intend then to review policy changes at that stage as well.  As the Deputy was already aware when he raised this important matter with me at the Oireachtas health committee, I have undertaken to share this analysis and policy review with him when it is completed.  My concern is not for the health insurance company but for the impact on premiums, which I know is the Deputy's concern as well.  However, health insurers have expressed some important and legitimate concerns about the use of the private insurance patient form at a hospital level, in particular the manner in which patients are being requested to waive their right to be treated as public patients.  It is accepted that there is a need for a consistent and clear approach at hospital level as to how the private insurance patient forum is presented to patients.  In this regard, the HSE and the insurance industry will now meet.  They have started an engagement, a series of meetings about this, to consider how the forum may need to be reviewed and in what circumstances it should be used.  If a vulnerable sick patient is on a hospital bed or waiting in an emergency department, merely waving a form at him or her is not appropriate; there needs to be a clear and consistent protocol in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800032#GG00700","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488984300,"counter":343,"content":"<p>One should never ask the fox to carry out an inspection of the fence around the hen house, but that is what the Minister is doing in respect of the Department of Health on this occasion.  It is a policy decision of the Department of Health to bring forward the 2013 Act, which allows for a designation of all beds in public hospitals for private patients.  There is no doubt, even in the context of budgets being forced on hospitals, that there are now stretched budgets, which have effectively been put in place to force hospitals to maximise the number of private patients going through their hospitals for billing purposes and to bolster budgets.  Stretched budgets are in their stated policy.  We have asked all the hospitals about this but they all deny that this is what a stretched budget is.  However, we know for a fact that the stretched budget primarily entails private patients being treated in public hospitals, and there is concern about this.  I do not have any truck with the private health care providers; my representation here is on behalf of public patients who are potentially waiting longer to access treatment because beds are full of private patients in public hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800032#GG00800","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1488984900,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I accept the Deputy's bona fides on this but he must also accept that the 2013 legislation came from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report of 2008, which pointed out that there was a significant lacuna in the law, which was making it effectively impossible for up to 50% of any potential charge to be collected by the public health service.  We would all share the view that the priority must be to invest in the public health service.  If there was a possibility that private health insurance companies were not picking up their portion of the tab, that needed to be addressed legislatively and that was the decision of these Houses at the time.<\/p>  <p>  The question that now arises is whether the policy is being correctly implemented, whether the way forms are administered in hospitals regarding waiving a patient&rsquo;s right to be treated as a public patient is consistent and co-ordinated across the hospital system.

He wanted to make sure that women with crisis pregnancies received accurate and truthful information.  We were all appalled by the reporting of Ellen Coyne at the time showing that was not the case and that there were rogue agencies in operation.  The regulation of a new profession under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, involves a consultation process and the making of a number of statutory instruments by the Minister for Health and by the relevant registration board.<\/p>  <p>  In September of last year, the Department engaged, at my instruction, in a formal consultation process in which interested persons and organisations were invited to formally submit their views on how the statutory regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists should proceed.  A total of 84 submissions was received by the closing date of 30 November 2016. <\/p>  <p>  I am undertaking an examination of these submissions which will inform the approach to be adopted in progressing the statutory regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors.  I envisage that the next steps in the statutory regulation of the profession or professions under the Act will commence in the coming months with the submission of draft designation regulations to the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 prescribes the conditions for making available information to pregnant women and the public about services lawfully available outside the State for the termination of pregnancies.  During the Second Stage debate on the Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill 2016, I undertook to have this Act reviewed by my Department to establish if its provisions need to be strengthened.  This review is ongoing.  For example, subject to the views of the Attorney General, it may be possible to amend this Act, and this is my gut feeling on the issue, to ensure that only registered professionals provide services under the Act.  This might be feasible, as expected, if it is decided to proceed with the statutory regulation of counsellors.

There are no such beds outside Dublin.  Numerous reports have highlighted the critical need to provide a dedicated specialist rehabilitation unit to serve the needs of people in the south of our country.

One of the many recommendations made in the report on the configuration of acute hospital services in Cork and Kerry, which was published by the HSE in 2011, was that a consultant in rehabilitation medicine, shared between the HSE south and the National Rehabilitation Hospital, should be appointed.

The inclusion of this action was informed by the meetings between the Minister for Health, the Department of Health and the HSE and the representatives of the An Saol project, for example.  The head of operations in the HSE disability service wrote recently to a representative of the project to confirm that approval has been given for the progression in 2017 of a pilot initiative that will focus on the provision of therapies for people with severe acquired brain injuries.  It is important to note that the HSE funds a large range of services across the country, including acute hospital services, the National Rehabilitation Hospital, a range of multidisciplinary services, a range of assisted living supports and rehabilitation training services.

The 2011 report clearly highlighted that Cork and Kerry need an acute rehabilitation medicine service that can provide a post-acute specialist rehabilitation service for acquired brain injury and neurological diagnosis to people between the ages of 18 and 65.

Headway Ireland provides a range of services to people with acquired injury between the ages of 16 and 65, including day services, psychology and social work services, community integration programmes, employment and family supports and rehabilitation training places.  It is important for further investment in rehabilitation services to be considered in the context of the overall acute hospital rehabilitation medicine infrastructure programme.  The needs of the hospital group will be prioritised within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  Such issues are important.

This position has been adopted by the House.<\/p>  <p>  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 regulates access to a termination of pregnancy if a pregnant woman&rsquo;s life, as distinct from her health, is at risk from a threat to her physical or mental health.<\/p>  <p>  The principal constitutional issue dealt with in the Act is the right to life of the unborn with due regard to the right to life of the mother as set out in Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  The effect of this article is to prohibit abortion in Ireland subject to exemption where the life of a pregnant woman is at risk.

The provision for 2017 represents a 3.5% increase on the final projected 2016 outturn and a 9.4% increase over the 2015 outturn position.  That the funding provided for health is the highest ever clearly demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to investing the gains from a recovering economy in a better health service.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding secured will continue to ease the pressure on the health service to provide the optimum level of safe services for patients within the budgetary limits.  There will always be a need for effective management of overall resources, particularly as health care demands continue to rise due to our growing and ageing population, the increasing incidence of chronic conditions and advances in medical technologies, drugs and treatments.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be better informed than I am but having checked with my officials, I am not quite sure to what she is referring with a 25% budget increase.  A 25% increase in the health budget would require additional funding of &euro;3.5 billion in a single year, as the Deputy correctly notes.  Such an increase in a single year would likely lead to a breach of EU fiscal rules and would also raise questions about the capacity of the health services to plan and recruit staff in the time available so as to manage this level of increased resources effectively.  We are now back in an era of reinvestment in health and the Deputy is correct that there were a number of extraordinarily difficult years for the health service.  The issue cannot just be about the level of investment and we must consider what we are doing.  It must be about moving services to primary care, doing more in the community, the new GP contract we are currently negotiating with GP organisations, and bed capacity.  The bed capacity review is under way and that will lead to a clear figure for the capital review.  Crucially, this is about recruitment and retention of staff, as we currently do not have enough nurses in the health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800035#KK01200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488986100,"counter":383,"content":"<p>The 25% figure came from a reply to a question put to the Department.  Budget cuts were achieved through a variety of means over the austerity years.  Staff numbers in the HSE were reduced from 111,000 to 99,000 from 2008 to 2015 and we are still reeling from that.  Having listened to public health nurses last week on potential industrial action, I know they are absolutely crippled with work and cannot keep going.  There were also cuts to pay.  In the same period, home help hours for the elderly, disabled and sick went from 12.2 million to 8.3 million.  Along with this, the cost of health care was shifted from the public purse to individuals, with increased charges introduced for accident and emergency visits and hospital stays and prescription charges introduced for medical card holders.  A higher threshold was introduced for drugs for those who did not hold that card.  All of this means that in 2013, citizens paid &euro;450 million more for health in 2008.

I am absolutely committed to reducing waiting times for patients, both for patients waiting for inpatient or day case procedures and for outpatient appointments.  During 2016, there has been evidence of a considerable increase in demand for health services as our population grows and ages.  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, the HSE is developing waiting list action plans in the area of inpatient, day case, scoliosis and outpatient services, which is the issue the Deputy has raised.  Draft waiting list action plans for outpatients, inpatient, day case and scoliosis are with my Department, and it is reviewing these plans.  Engagement is ongoing with the HSE and I expect to be able to publish them in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2016, the HSE launched the Strategy for the Design of Integrated Outpatient Services 2016-2020.  The strategy seeks to improve waiting times for outpatient services in the long term by restructuring referral pathways and utilising technology to improve service delivery.  The HSE has significantly progressed the development of a draft outpatient waiting list action plan.  In the plan, the HSE will identify proposals to reduce the number of patients waiting long periods of time for outpatient appointments across all hospitals, including St. Vincent's University Hospital.  A number of initiatives are in place in St. Vincent's hospital to address waiting times, including the introduction of virtual clinics and pooling of referrals, which means people are not referred to a specific consultant.  The target is that no patient will wait longer than 15 months by the end of October.  While it is still too long, it would constitute significant progress on current waiting times.  I expect to make known the details of the outpatient waiting list action plan in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800036#LL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1488986700,"counter":395,"content":"<p>It is important to put on the record of the D&aacute;il the waiting lists for outpatients in St. Vincent's hospital.

What is most significant about the figures is the increase in the amount of time and the number of people who have been waiting for 18 months or more.  In January 2016, 19 patients on the outpatient waiting list had been waiting 18 months or longer.  By January 2017, the figure had exploded to 491 people.

The \"did not attend\", DNA, rate is a serious issue in our health service and St. Vincent's hospital has established a task force to focus on reducing the DNA rate.  Last year, 450,000 people did not attend scheduled hospital appointments and this has a significant burden in terms of time and cost on the Irish health service.  It is anticipated that through the reduction in the number of DNAs and compliance with the one-strike national policy, the number of patients awaiting first appointment will be reduced.<\/p>  <p>  The hospital has introduced a number of virtual clinics which have been a great success and have allowed specialties to increase the number of new appointments per clinic.  This has assisted in reducing the new to review ratio within specialties.  St. Vincent's hospital is leading in this way.  The hospital has introduced urgent and routine new appointments in outpatient department clinic profiles, the pooling of referrals across a number of consultants, a project to review the discharge process and validation completed on a biannual basis to ensure the outpatient appointment list is valid.

My officials, in conjunction with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, are currently examining the report.  I understand that meetings of officials from both Departments are scheduled for today and tomorrow.  When these discussions are concluded and a proposed way forward is agreed between the respective Departments, I expect that the report will be submitted to both myself and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for our consideration.

It is not just the excellent historical tradition: I appreciate the ongoing tradition of providing services to people in our capital city and county.  At the same time, all of those involved in ambulance service provision must have regard to the findings of HIQA.  We all  must have regard to the findings of the regulator.  In its 2014 report, HIQA highlighted patient safety issues arising from two ambulance services operating in the same domain.  I fully accept, therefore, that in the interests of patient safety there is a need for a more co-ordinated and integrated approach to ambulance service delivery in Dublin.<\/p><p>Thus, there is a need for the Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service to work closely together to optimise and maximise all available emergency resources.

There was opposition to that plan from the city councillors and firefighters, and a consultative forum which involved council management and union representatives was established in March 2015.  That forum commissioned an expert panel to make recommendations on governance, funding, call taking and despatch.  It recommended not that the two call and despatch services amalgamate but rather that an efficient technological system be put in place.  However, council management did not accept that report and left the forum the following January.  According to the council's minutes of that meeting, the assistant manager said the forum had been set up to reach agreement on the proposal to centralise call taking, which was not the case.  To transfer the 100,000 calls handled annually by the fire brigade to another call centre would jeopardise public safety.

Therefore, in order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, we are developing through the HSE action plans for inpatient day cases and, specifically with regard to the Deputy's question, outpatient day services, as well as the issues in paediatric scoliosis.  My Department is currently reviewing these plans and I expect to be in a position to share them with Members of this House very shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in November 2016, the HSE launched the Strategy for the Design of Integrated Outpatient Services 2016-2020.

They need to co-operate.  They are ultimately going to be under the banner of the new national children's hospital.

The hospital has secured two consultants who will commence additional paediatric sessions from October of this year.  The hospital has also confirmed that it is currently trying to source locum consultants in conjunction with Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  If successful, these consultants will provide additional capacity until the permanent consultants come on board in October.<\/p>  <p>  The hospital is currently undertaking a cross-city ENT review with the children's hospital group to look at sustainable and permanent solutions to deal with the ENT situation, which is particularly acute.  A validation process is under way in Temple Street Children's University Hospital to identify patients who may be on a list but no longer require the treatment or have been treated somewhere else.  This should reduce numbers and enable them to focus on those needing care.  They are also due to commence an additional ENT clinic shortly, which will see approximately ten new patients per week.  They are looking at the possibility of running an additional clinic which would see approximately 12 to 15 new patients a week.  That will be a general paediatric clinic.

The child and adolescent mental health services are for those who are at most high risk and who have the most severe problems with psychosis, severe depression and eating disorders.  Due to the lack of supports at primary care level we are finding that young people are being referred when they should not be, so obviously more supports must be put in place at that level.  We have approved &euro;5 million for 114 assistant psychology posts which will work within the primary care centres.  Hopefully, that will take some younger people away from the CAMHS teams and their waiting lists, which will free them up for more severe cases.

I have raised this matter a number of times in parliamentary questions and have received a number of answers that go some way towards addressing the issue.  In the course of my contribution I wish to focus on transport, public transport and transport infrastructure in my area in the western part of Dublin.  It lies roughly between the N4 and the N7 and is affected by the M50.<\/p><p>In a previous reply to a parliamentary question the Minister stated:<\/p><blockquote>I recognise that there is considerable evidence emerging of increased travel demand across the Dublin region in general, with growing traffic levels on many of the region's roads and streets.  The increase in the number in employment has impacted on transport through the beginning of a recovery in public transport numbers, but also through increased car use and the re-emergence of peak period congestion. ...<br \/><br \/>Insofar as congestion issues in Dublin are concerned, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has overall responsibility for the implementation of their published Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).  My Department is working closely with the NTA with a view to intensifying efforts to combat congestion across Dublin\u00a0in the short to medium term through greater use of bus priority, demand management and other alleviating measures.<\/blockquote><p>I accept the Minister's response, but I am greatly concerned because I do not see its impact in my area.  The challenge for the Minister in his response is to outline whether the plan of the National Transport Authority needs to be reviewed.  What are the other alleviating measures to which the Minister referred?<\/p><p>I will outline some of the problems.  Two weeks ago I was driving home from Leinster House but at Bluebell I ended up sitting in a traffic jam at a certain time in the evening.  The journey took me almost one hour and 45 minutes.  The cause of the traffic jam from Bluebell, as I heard it reported on the radio, was a broken-down car on the N7 at Rathcoole.  It was reported that there were delays to the Long Mile Road, but the delays were not just to the Long Mile Road but back to Bluebell and Inchicore.  That is the capacity at which these roads are operating.  Try to get out of Palmerstown at the junction of the N4.  There is no flyover or intersection, so people queue for hours on end each day.  Consider the M50 between the N4 and N7 junctions.  In 2014, it was predicted that by 2023 there would be an annual average traffic flow there of 143,000 per day.  The figure was 140,000 in 2016.  By any stretch of the imagination, it is far ahead of what was expected.  However, our responses are not dealing with those issues.<\/p><p>In terms of public transport, there were 10 million extra passengers last year.  Where are the increased number of new buses for Dublin Bus?  Kishogue railway station in my constituency is lying idle.  It will be opened at some time in the future.  Where is the Luas to Lucan project that was planned?  Surely it is time to address that, given the volume of traffic movements on the M50.  Metro west, an orbital route to link Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown, whether it is a metro or bus service, is gone.  Try to get a bus out of Lucan in the morning.  If one has to get into town, people know that there is no point in queuing at certain bus stops because the bus will be full when it arrives.  They move to the next bus stop.<\/p><p>There is an immediate crisis in public transport in my part of the city.  I am glad the Minister is present today because the written replies I have received on this matter offer very little comfort that real and tangible solutions will be put in place in the short and medium term.  The Minister referred to alleviating measures.  What are they?  We need more than just a promise that the mid-term capital review will deliver something.  We need specifics and we need them urgently.  As I said, the traffic movements on the M50 between the N4 and N7 junctions are already at the levels predicted for 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800041#QQ00700","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1488989700,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this question.  I am sorry that he has not found the written responses adequate but I will try to elaborate on them.  Before I address the matter specifically, the Deputy should realise that the problem of traffic congestion in Dublin is extraordinarily difficult because of the volatility of what has been happening with traffic congestion, traffic numbers and traffic speeds in recent times.  The variation in traffic patterns, speeds and numbers is mainly a product of the economic changes which have occurred.  By any standards, they have been unpredictable.  The Deputy is seeking comfort regarding what is going to happen in the near to medium-term future.  I will try to give him some indication of that within the powers of prophecy that I have about what will happen to Dublin traffic in the years to come.<\/p>  <p>  The advent of Ireland's economic downturn in 2008 significantly affected transport patterns and levels of transport usage.  Largely reflecting the growth in unemployment, public transport usage and car usage in the Dublin region dropped significantly during the downturn and in subsequent years.  This also applied to the west Dublin region.<\/p><p>The period from 2008 to 2015 can be characterised as a period of reduced transport usage and suppressed transport growth.  Focusing solely on road-based transport, levels of congestion fell from 2008 and journey times reduced for many people.  It is fair to say that traffic congestion was not a major issue during this period.  However, I fully recognise that, as the Deputy has pointed out, a growing body of evidence is emerging of increased travel demand across the Dublin region in particular, with growing traffic levels on many of the region's roads and streets.  Indeed, 2014 saw the start of a reversal of the trend of reduced travel demand.  Public transport usage in 2014 increased for all modes, including bus, Luas and commuter rail services.<br\/><br\/>While the welcome increase in the numbers in employment affected transport through the beginning of a recovery in public transport numbers, it has also manifested itself through increased car use and the re-emergence of peak period congestion.  As a key indicator of recent trends, in 2014 users of the M50 motorway began to experience significant increases in journey times for the first time since the completion of the M50 upgrade.  In terms of traffic flows, average daily traffic at the tolling point on the motorway was almost 18% higher in 2016 than in 2014.  The effect of this growth can be seen on a daily basis, with slower speeds and longer journey times evident on the M50.  Similar patterns, though not as pronounced, are emerging elsewhere on the road network.  As Dublin city is the target destination of many of the journeys being undertaken in the region, there is a substantial degree of congestion evident at many locations on the road network approaching the city.<br\/><br\/>Insofar as congestion issues in Dublin are concerned, the National Transport Authority, NTA, has overall responsibility for the implementation of its transport strategy.  My Department is working closely with the NTA with a view to intensifying efforts to combat congestion in the short to medium term through greater use of bus priority, demand management and other alleviating measures.  The NTA&rsquo;s approach to managing congestion for the period 2015-18 focuses on public transport provision on key routes to the city centre, supported by adequate traffic management arrangements, measures to protect the efficiency of national roads in the region and measures to address local travel delay locations.<br\/><br\/> The bus network is the backbone of the public transport system in Dublin.  While a small number of corridors have enough patronage to justify development of light rail, metro or heavy rail lines, the bus system has to serve the majority of the Dublin area.  With this in mind, in its approach to tackling congestion in the Dublin region, subject to the availability of funding, the NTA will focus on transforming the bus system to deliver a step change in performance across the region and complementing that improved public transport system with a network of park and ride sites.<br\/><br\/>I will detail more specific measures in my supplementary reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800041#QQ00800","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488990300,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister but I am sorry that he did not begin reading from the middle of his script rather than from the beginning.

The total provision of additional buses this year for Dublin Bus, at a time of significant growth in demand, is 20.  That is a grossly inadequate response.  The bus network, as the Minister has said, is the backbone of the public transport infrastructure but the Government is not providing the required level of response.  As I raise this issue with the Minister, I am frustrated at the lack of urgency.  The frustration of the people who will sit in their cars and on buses this evening is not being reflected in the Government's responses.<\/p>  <p>  The entire road infrastructure in the Dublin region is at capacity.  Are there plans to deliver what was previously proposed in Lucan, namely a Luas line?  Are there plans to open a train station in Kishogue?  Are there plans to provide local bus services that would join major transport infrastructure hubs, for example, bus services from neighbourhood centres in places like Clondalkin and Lucan to the Luas station at Red Cow or the main Fonthill Road railway station?  Where are the specific plans that could have a more immediate impact?<\/p>  <p>  I could speak on this topic for ages but my time is running out.  The final point I will make is that I am concerned about long-term planning.  I am concerned because Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and South Dublin County Council, SDCC, have very different views on where things are going.  By 2023, TII expects the population of the SDCC area to be 268,000, with jobs in the region standing at 105,000, an increase of 7% and 12% respectively.  However, the council itself anticipates that the population will be 280,000 and the number of jobs in the area will be 115,000, representing growth rates of 11% and 23% respectively.

I acknowledge fully everything the Deputy has said and I acknowledge the need to address the issue.  We need a major step forward in our attitude to public transport and we need extra funding for the sorts of measures to which the Deputy referred.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the specifics, questions should be addressed to TII or the NTA, but if the Deputy has a problem getting an adequate response from either of those bodies regarding specific issues in his constituency, I will certainly be able to ask questions on his behalf.

The Deputy has raised what are operational matters for the aforementioned bodies; they are not matters for me.<\/p>  <p>  On a general policy level, I will address the matter of the M50.  Besides managing demand and optimising operational efficiencies, we are introducing measures to address the very serious and difficult problem of congestion.  The Deputy is absolutely right when he says that the numbers using the M50 have increased to approximately 140,000.  Those numbers were not predicted and they make it very difficult to manage.  However, we have introduced revised merge layouts, permanently signed diversion routes and enhanced vehicle recovery services.  The Deputy spoke about being stopped on the M50 for a prolonged period because of an accident on the N7.  The aforementioned enhanced vehicle recovery services have been introduced to counter situations such as the one the Deputy described.

I repeat what needs to happen: motor tax; white-label offerings and projects in telephony, energy, financial services and banking.  The Minister of State knows the menu.<br\/><br\/>The issue here today is not what needs to be done.  The issue is whether the Government will do it.  If it does not do it, we will not be talking about 80 post offices.  I hear from postmasters and postmistresses that persisting with the <i>status quo<\/i>will mean that very cleverly, the Government and An Post are forcing them out of business.  It is not viable anymore because the Government will not give them the alternative services to address dropping mail volumes and dropping revenue that is happening in every post office in the country.<br\/><br\/>Finally, let me say the Government is closing the post offices and it will not give us broadband either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800042#RR00900","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488990900,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this Topical Issue today.  The Rural Independent Group recently tabled a Private Members' motion.  We had consultation with the Departments of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Taoiseach.  The motion was agreed and we were delighted.  Everybody supported it here.  In Monday's edition of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>Charlie Weston reported that an unpublished report, which we have been awaiting, will recommend that 80 post offices should close.  If these indications from the unpublished report are accurate, our worst fears will have been realised.  It will result in increased economic hardship, increased social isolation and an escalation of the decline of rural communities.<\/p><p>I remind the Government that as recently as last November, it supported a D&aacute;il motion on the future of the post office network tabled by the Rural Independent Group.  We asked for clear and explicit commitments in terms of seeking out new and innovative approaches to sustaining the post offices in rural communities.  We all thought that acceptance of that D&aacute;il motion meant we were all right.  However, here we are.  The Government is doing nothing while Rome burns and is twiddling its thumbs.  The Government is either committed to rural post offices or it is not.  So far all the indications are that the Government will continue to speak out of both sides of its mouth on this issue.  We need absolute clarity.  We need an acknowledgement that rural areas cannot cope with the level of withdrawal of services going on at present, including post offices, credit unions and what is happening with our roads.  It could lock the people up altogether, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said.  It gave us no broadband either.<\/p><p>As a Deputy from a rural county, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, should understand.  I think it might have been a trick by the Taoiseach when announcing his last Cabinet he split ownership across three Departments and no one knows who is responsible.  None of them is responsible and none of them is looking after it.  The Government is closing them by stealth.  It will not allow them do motor tax or driver licences.  It will not allow them to be tourist offices.  It will not allow them do the parcel post.  It is strangling them with their hands behind their backs and eyes blindfolded.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State knows, the postmasters and postmistresses give sterling service.  There is a huge social aspect to their service and they are willing to do much more if the Government lets them.  Successive governments have closed them by stealth, but this Government has been the worst.  We are going to be stripped of more post offices resulting in less connectivity.  It was buses last week and also last week the credit union in Clonmel was bulldozed into taking over debts from Charleville credit union.  Now it is the post offices.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has no empathy with rural areas.  Is he trying to punish the electorate after it punished Government members for their reign of terror over five years in bailing out the banks?  Is it trying to take away everything from rural communities?  Given that he is a rural Deputy, the Minister of State should know what is going on.  He should hang his head in shame.  The post offices represent the last bastion.  The Government let the Garda stations go.  If it were approached imaginatively, the post offices could also be used in the evening time to allow the community garda be in there for an hour to meet people.  There are many imaginative ways to support the post offices instead of strangling them, stifling them, kicking them down the road and insulting the good postmasters and postmistresses.  There is huge waste in the GPO with many staff who have had no meaningful work for decades.  The Government should look at where the real problem is with waste and not with the individual post offices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800043#SS00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1488990900,"counter":465,"content":"<p>If 80 rural post offices are to close as reported, it would be a national scandal and it has to be resisted.  I would like to think that the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, who comes from a rural community in one of the most western parts of our country, would have a full understanding of the value of post offices and the life link it is for rural areas.  Over recent years we have seen the total erosion of small shops, the creameries are practically gone, Garda stations have closed down and a lot of pubs have closed down.  These are all areas of what I would call rural connection.  Those facilities, along with our small post offices, are of immense value particularly for those who live in isolated rural areas and those who are elderly.  They depend upon that for the social connection.<\/p>  <p>  Representatives of An Post management told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs that 55 out of 500 are unsustainable.  However, how is unsustainability defined?  Is it defined just in monetary terms or by the social value it gives to communities?  I argue that small post offices are invaluable to rural areas.  Elderly people can go to post offices and the post offices come to them through their postman and they keep that connection.  If the post offices are closed down it would be another death knell to rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be prepared to stand up and ensure we judge the value to the community, not as unsustainable but as sustainable.  Having such facilities in a community adds to the sustainability of the community.  The Government and previous Governments have had a very negative impact on rural areas.  I have considerable faith in the Minister of State, Deputy Ring; I say that as an Opposition spokesperson.  The fact that he lives in a rural area and is acquainted with what is happening there means that he should be able to take this on and defend the facilities for rural areas.  He should defend the small post offices so that they survive and that connection to rural communities is maintained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800043#SS00300","speaker":"1317"},{"type":"speech","time":1488990900,"counter":466,"content":"<p>If we had &euro;1 for all the various committees and studies on An Post that have been commissioned by the Government we would have a nice few bob in a savings account in An Post.  There has been a plethora of working groups reviewing the post office network.  One was under the auspices of the Minister of State, the post office hub working group to examine the Kerr report which, itself, was a separate report.  In addition, the Government set up a network renewal implementation group.  Meanwhile the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and his officials are examining the potential for motor tax etc. to be paid through post offices.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to explain to us how all these groups knit together to try to resolve what An Post claims is an impending crisis for the 1,100 remaining post offices.  Obviously, the announcement that 80 are to close is an indication of the failure of these groups to come up with ideas.  For example, we could give some sort of public service obligation payment to the post offices, which they do not receive.  We could stop underfunding them and stop removing services from them such as social welfare payments by insisting that certain Government payments must be made through bank drafts etc.  The State could form something similar to the Sparkasse or Kiwibank models that would help An Post perform multiple functions and therefore survive.<\/p>  <p>  It reminds me of the same rhetoric we have heard regarding Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>In that case, it is claimed that we cannot keep the service going, that it is costing the State too much, that it is valuable for rural Ireland but that it is too expensive and not competitive.  The operative phrase is &ldquo;not competitive&rdquo; because we are running down social services for the sake of neo-liberal ideas that profit must be made and one must be competitive.  It is not going to work without risking the fabric of rural life being torn apart, if that has not started already.  The threat to An Post and the threat to Bus &Eacute;ireann are one of the same threats to the fabric of rural society.  It is also winding it up to send a signal to the workers in both Bus &Eacute;ireann and An Post that they better not dare look for a pay increase the way the Luas or Dublin Bus drivers or other workers did, that there is a crisis and that they will not get any pay rise.  Will the Minister of State comment on all of these points, in particular how this will destroy the fabric of rural life?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800043#SS00400","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488991500,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I want to be very clear and place on the record of the House the fact that I have no statutory responsibility for An Post or post offices.

I recognise that post offices play a significantly valuable economic and social role in rural, as well as urban, areas.  At the same time, we must accept the reality that the postal sector is undergoing fundamental change both at home and internationally.  People are increasingly using e-mail and social media to communicate, rather than using traditional postal services.  Businesses, too, are increasingly providing services online.  As a result, core mail volumes have decreased year on year.  This is not just an Irish trend but a global one.<\/p>  <p>  The chief executive officer of An Post said today there has been a decline of nearly 50% in mail services globally.  An Post is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of the company, led by McKinsey consultants with a view to developing a long-term strategic approach to the business.  Much media coverage has been given this week to the post office network and references to a report completed by Mr. Bobby Kerr.  Mr. Kerr&rsquo;s report was carried out for An Post, not for the Government.  Mr. Kerr submitted his recommendations to An Post in December.  At this point, I call on An Post to publish Mr. Kerr&rsquo;s report, given that much of what it contains is already in the public domain.  An Post should also clarify how Mr. Kerr&rsquo;s report will feed into the wider decision-making process once the McKinsey process has concluded.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to put on the record that the post office network is not owned by the State.  An Post is a commercial State body.  As of the end of February, there were 1,121 post offices nationwide, 50 of which are operated directly by An Post, with the rest being run under contract to An Post by postmasters and postmistresses.  Decisions about the post office network and whether there are to be any closures are matters for the board and management of An Post.<\/p>  <p>  That said, the Government is committed to working with stakeholders to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the post office network in the changed environment in which it operates.  While I have no statutory responsibility for An Post, as I have said already, I have been working with the various stakeholders to ensure the commitments in A Programme for a Partnership Government for the post office network are delivered.  As a rural Deputy, I believe post offices should be encouraged to play an increased role in the provision of services in rural areas and generate new economic activity that can support the revitalisation of rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800044#TT01900","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1488991500,"counter":486,"content":"<p>That was the most extraordinary performance ever by a Minister of State.

All the roaring and shouting that is going on now about the current Government is not impressive.<\/p>  <p>  We would all agree that the third level sector is vital to our future and that third level colleges and universities are the platform on which we hope to produce graduates who will not only get good jobs and join different professions but who will start their own companies and provide for entrepreneurships.  <\/p>  <p>  I am very disappointed and angry at the way this Government has treated staffing issues in the third level sector since it came into office.  The economy is in recovery mode but we know that during the period of the crash, little or no recruitment was made in the universities or colleges or generally in the public sector but that period is behind us.  I am concerned about the terms and conditions under which younger and newer staff are currently being recruited.  <\/p>  <p>  We have had two reports by senior counsel, one by Peter Ward some time ago dealing with the issues and specifically focusing on issues around the entire education sector regarding staff getting quality contracts for the very important jobs they do.  The other report, the Cush report, which was delivered to this Government some time ago, basically examined the conditions of teaching staff in colleges and universities and how their contracts and terms and conditions would be improved.  Essentially, we find the quality of jobs has been both stripped out and stripped down in a number of the universities, including in the one closest to us in the D&aacute;il, Trinity College, over a period of time, whereby increasingly more staff are now on short-term contracts or contracts which are subject to renewal at frequent intervals.  The consequence of that for staff, who are vital for providing services to students, researchers and their institutions, is that their position of employment is extremely precarious, and if it were to continue that way, the staff will not be in a position to acquire a mortgage because they simply will not have contracts of a quality which would allow them to have financial security and commit to a long-term investment such as the purchase of a family home. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has very significant resources at its disposal.  What will it do to improve the terms and conditions of staff at third level and, in particular, to move away from short-term contracts and return to the principle of people getting permanent, contracted employment in which they can commit to the institution, give good service and also be able to enter into financial commitments?  What about this model of short-termism which is also being employed for ancillary staff such as people who work in the libraries and in administration?  It is a really insidious form of permanently reducing people's status and conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800045#UU01500","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1488992100,"counter":507,"content":"<p>The report of the chair of the expert group on fixed term and part-time issues in lecturing in Ireland was published in May 2016 and contains a number of recommendations which will assist in addressing concerns raised about the level of part-time and fixed-term employment in lecturing in the third level sector.

even for schools that do officially have an assigned NEPS psychologist, access to a psychological assessment for a developmental or behavioural issue is unacceptably long, creating adverse effects on children&rsquo;s education and reducing access to resource teaching hours and learning supports, and privileging households that have the resources to opt for private assessment;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

What is happening to our children today is outrageous and scandalous.  There are 95,000 children in schools without any access whatsoever to an educational psychologist.  Officially they are told they have no access to a psychologist.  There are many tens and possibly hundreds of thousands of others who have extremely limited access to a psychologist.  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is drastically understaffed and the needs of children in education are not being addressed.  This has been allowed to go on for too long.<\/p><p>The Government's four-year education plan has a modest ambition which has been reduced in the 2017 action plan, yet even with that modest plan nothing is happening.  We have been contacted by psychologists who would love to work in the service and simply do not know what is happening in the recruitment process.  The Minister for Education and Skills might perhaps clarify that.<\/p><p>There is a serious problem in respect of support for children with special needs.  The Minister and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, have attempted to address that with a new model to come forward next September.  Our party and others have engaged with the NCSE because we have many worries about the new system.  These worries have not been allayed by the publication of the circular yesterday.  In fact our worries about the new model of resource allocation are enhanced by its publication.  The first is that a procedure and formula will be worked out with NEPS for the calculation of the complex needs in place.  Nothing has been done yet and that needs to be addressed urgently because teachers do not know how the complex needs of the children in their schools will be addressed under this new model.<\/p><p>The second is that the appeals system is to be decided.  There is no appeal system for schools that do not have sufficient resources or individual children who will be left without resources.  No detail is given in the circular.  That reminds us of the procedure under delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS.  There is no right to a second chance.<\/p><p>The situation of special classes at primary and secondary levels is a scandal.  It is improving at primary level with an increase in the number of special classes.  At second level, however, a child falls over a cliff because the service is not in place.  That is wrong.  It must stop and some effort must be made to address the situation urgently.  Each child with special needs has a different need.  Some will have to go to special schools, some need special support in mainstream schools, while others will have to go to special classes, but each child, with or without special needs, has a constitutional right to primary education and a statutory right to second level education.  The Government must uphold these rights by providing the supports that are needed.<\/p><p>The Government has published legislation and there is not much urgency about it.  All sides of this House would be quite willing to push through the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill as quickly as possible, particularly in respect of the baptism barrier and special needs.  The Minister has proposed that schools would be forced to accept children with special needs because we know there are soft barriers in some areas to accepting children with special needs.  He has said the NCSE can designate a school for a child but he has not committed to giving the NCSE the power to demand that a school provide a special class.  I and most Members of this House believe the NCSE should have that power and there are those among the Minister's advisers who also believe that.  There are people within the Department of Education and Skills, however, who do not want that power to be bestowed on the NCSE.  We will not support the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 if that power is not in the legislation.  It is the right thing to do to ensure children's constitutional rights to a primary education and their rights to a free education at second level are given to them in a practical way.  We have to get serious about the right of children with special needs to an education, to be a part of our society, with the benefit of education that we all have, in accordance with their needs.  This must be in the legislation and I would say that would be the settled view of the House.  The baptism barrier can be dealt with through separate legislation and we will support that Bill too, an area where we hope for reform.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled an amendment to this motion and there is nothing in it that contradicts our motion.<\/p><p>It expands on our motion to some extent and refers to the appeals system, which is certainly within the scope of the motion, and mentions the need for more NEPS psychologists.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment argues that the 15% cut needs to be restored, which is something Fianna F&aacute;il wishes to be able to achieve in the context of upcoming budgets.  It is certainly something we will be pushing for.  While we can certainly discuss the amendment tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in, my strong view is that it does not contradict anything in our motion.  I think we are all on the same page with regard to what we want to do for children with special needs.  I think everybody in the House should be on the same page in this instance.  The Opposition's job is to put pressure on the Government to ensure this happens.<\/p> <p> There are practical things we can do.  I have been asked in media interviews about the cost of increasing the number of NEPS psychologists.  A good response to such questions is to accept that there might be financial implications and to ask what price should be put on our children's education.  From a fiscal point of view, a limited amount of money has already been provided under the education action plan, which means that the recruitment of extra NEPS psychologists would have no financial implications.  We have been told that a small number of psychologists will be recruited this year.  I am saying clearly that the Minister should get on with the job of making sure that recruitment happens and that psychologists are employed.  They need to be able to go about their work of assessing children with special needs and thereby giving them an opportunity to participate fully in the education system.  This is about the constitutional right of Irish citizens to an education.  If someone in officialdom is sitting back on the recruitment process, it is up to the Minister to speed matters up and get that person's act together because children will suffer in the meantime.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to introduce an amendment to the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 that has been sought by Fianna F&aacute;il and others, including professionals involved in this area, to direct schools to provide special classes where necessary.  I do not believe that power would ever be exercised by the national council, but it would be enough to ensure schools that are reluctant to provide special classes, particularly at secondary level, have something of an incentive in legislation to make such provision.  I accept that many schools provide such classes.<\/p> <p> I commend this motion to the House.  I urge Deputies to support it.  As my party leader and the Taoiseach agreed yesterday, there is a need to ensure that in 20 years' time we do not look back and wonder where we went wrong.  We must not be asking ourselves then why we did not serve the rights of our children properly 20 years earlier, as people said and identified at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800047#ZZ00400","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488993600,"counter":529,"content":"<p>This motion, which seeks to ensure no child will be deprived under the new system, places the wider issue of early intervention services and access to educational psychologists at the heart of the debate.  The Government is dealing with many crises in areas like health, housing and homelessness.  It is also facing industrial relations unrest.  I honestly believe the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is dealing with one of the biggest crises in the country.  It is going very quietly because these children have such a low voice in society and their parents are so exhausted from fighting so hard to get basic services that they cannot even get around to lobbying on behalf of their children.  I honestly think that when we look back 20 years from now, we will reflect on the fact that we deprived our children of access to educational psychologists and early intervention services, even though we knew that they needed such services and that such deprivation would have a long-term detrimental impact on their educational achievements and their future well-being, as a black mark on our State.<\/p>  <p>  It is not clear how schools that require additional resources will be given those resources under the new assessment.  We need to know exactly how the new system will operate so that we can identify any possible negative impacts on the children served by it.  We have learned that every child with a special need is unique, as are his or her educational needs.  The allocation of additional resources, such as teaching hours, to children with learning difficulties is often done on the basis of over-labelling of behavioural disorders.  This does not help anybody.  No child fits into a box set by a Department.<\/p>  <p>  We are all aware of the serious inequalities in the current allocation of resource teaching hours.  To be quite honest, this can be attributed to persistent failures on the part of the State.  If a child is to gain additional resource teaching hours, a psychologist must make an assessment that he or she has a learning difficulty.  Parents may seek such assessments privately or publicly.  If they do this publicly, they will have to wait at least a year if not longer.  Many parents who try to do this privately simply cannot afford the cost, which can be in excess of &euro;1,000.  It is generally well-off families that can afford to pay privately.  It must be heartbreaking for parents on low incomes who know their children are being deprived and who understand the long-term impact on their children of not getting early intervention assessments and services, but cannot do anything about it.<\/p>  <p>  I can only imagine what it is like to be a parent in such circumstances.  Like many Deputies, I have met parents in this situation who have sat in front of me in tears because they cannot afford to pay privately for the assessments their children need in order to access the services they require.  They are absolutely at their wit's end and absolutely exhausted.  We often do not hear their voices because they do not have any energy left to fight and they have given up.  We need to do all we can to ensure there is equality in our system and the necessary services are available for our children.  The Minister is in charge of those services and is vested with the relevant powers.  When we are looking back in 20 years' time, if we have to say our children did not get the services they need, the Minister, along with his predecessors and successors, will be asked to stand and answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800048#AAA00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1488993600,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, for bringing this motion before the House.

As a result of staffing issues, it is now normal for it to take over a year for students to be assessed for special educational needs, thereby delaying the putting in place of resource teaching and learning support structures.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the establishment of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes at post-primary level.  There are 548 ASD classes at primary level but just 237 such classes at post-primary level.  As a consequence, many pupils who have enjoyed the security of a specific ASD class in national school suddenly find themselves with nowhere to go in secondary school.  There is also an exceptional shortage of preschool ASD classes.  The lack of ASD classes in general is preventing many children from reaching their full potential.  I urge Deputies to support the motion before the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800048#AAA00300","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1488993600,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Thomas Byrne on introducing this motion on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I would like to focus on the entry point for children, for which the Department of Health and the HSE, rather than the Department of Education and Skills, is strictly responsible.  The lack of real integration between the health and education authorities in dealing with special needs is part of the problem we are discussing.  I would also like to focus on the assessment of need.  Under the Disability Act 2005, an assessment of need must commence within three months of an application and must be completed within six months of that application being made.  Those timelines are being consistently and flagrantly disregarded.  The fact of the matter is that they are not being met by the HSE and the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  There is nothing like an individual case to bring absolute clarity to an issue like this.  I would like to highlight such a case.  I could place the details of a different case on every single seat on the Government side of the Chamber.  A young girl in my constituency was put on the waiting list for an assessment of need in September 2016.  In November of that year, her parents became aware that the provisions of the Disability Act 2005 would not be met and the timeline would be breached.  They were advised to make a complaint to the HSE on the understanding that if the complaint was upheld, the child's application could be prioritised on the waiting list.  After they made the complaint in November 2016, they were advised that their daughter was No. 1,026 on the complaints waiting list.  I am not talking about the waiting list to have the actual assessment done, but about the waiting list to have the complaint regarding the assessment dealt with.  The parents were told at that time that the HSE complaints office was dealing with complaint No. 515 and that there was a five-month delay in responding to complaints.<\/p><p>On 1 March 2017, they requested an update on the complaint and were told the delay had increased from six to seven months from the date the complaint was received and the HSE was addressing complaint No. 569.  The young child was No. 1,026.  She is not a number but rather a young child waiting to be assessed in order to gain access to services so she can access an appropriate place in the education system.  There is one person in the HSE responsible for administering these complaints and it is not uncommon in our part of the country for children to wait for a year for an assessment of need having gone through the full complaints process.  We are told this is being addressed and the HSE is doing this, that and the other to deal with the matter but I am not seeing the evidence on the ground.  In my ten years as a Deputy, I have never had so many inquiries and complaints from families about delays in getting an assessment of need.<\/p> <p> At the end, if these people get an assessment, it is not as if there is a great array of services waiting for them, as, sadly, there is not.  If they get diagnosed through a service provider, no one-to-one occupational therapy, speech and language therapy or physiotherapy is provided that I can see.  At least it can allow these children to join a waiting list for an appropriate place in a special school or autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit that is part of a mainstream school.  That is what the public diagnosis, as such, can do, but they are being denied that opportunity.<\/p> <p> We have correctly seen outcry from the public and elected politicians in the past number of days arising form the revelations in Tuam.  No doubt there will be further revelations elsewhere in the country about mother and baby homes.  Let us consider what we are doing today, in 2017, when all the evidence tells us early intervention makes such a difference, leading to appropriate services being provided for children.  It is a life-changing experience and if those children get an appropriate place in school and access to the correct services, it changes their life for the better.  We are failing the children of Ireland with special needs and it is not good enough.  As a country we should be ashamed of ourselves.  This is our Tuam scandal of 2017 but we are in a position to do something about it.  Let us act on it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800048#AAA00400","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488994200,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&quot;recognises:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the strong commitment of this Government and the last Government to the issues of student mental health and wellbeing, and special educational needs;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the Government&rsquo;s commitment to special educational needs is evidenced in particular by the increase of the overall budget for special educational needs supports from &euro;1.28 billion in 2011 to more than &euro;1.5 billion now, with special educational needs accounting for approximately one fifth of the overall education budget, and corresponding improved outcomes for students;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the number of special classes has more than doubled, from 548 in 2011 to 1,153 across the country now, of which 889 are special Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) classes; that the number of special classes at post-primary level has doubled in the past three years and continues to rise rapidly;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the number of resource teachers has increased by more than 41%, from 5,265 in 2011 to over 7,500 now;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that, since 2011, the number of Special Needs Assistants has increased by more than 22%, from 10,575 to 13,115; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that, since the previous Fine Gael-led Government took office in 2011, and despite an adverse economic climate, sanctioned National Educational Psychology Service (NEPS) staffing numbers have been maintained at the same levels, and NEPS now provides a service to an additional 20,000 pupils compared to 2011;<br \/><br \/>and calls on the Government to:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; restate its strong commitment to both the areas of special educational needs and student mental health and wellbeing, and the range of ambitious measures underway in these areas through the Action Plan for Education;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; give a firm commitment that no school and no student with special educational needs will lose resources as a result of moving to the new model of allocation of resource teaching, and above all that all students will see better outcomes as a result of its implementation;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; carefully evaluate the case before considering any legislative change to compel schools to open ASD units or special classes against their will as there should be convincing evidence that the school system in an area is failing to make provision for ASD students before any such move should be considered and any possible unintended consequences should be carefully examined, including the question of whether parents and students would be satisfied to attend a school which had been compelled to provide these services against its will;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; restate the commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government to deliver an additional 65 NEPS psychologists over the lifetime of this Government; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; commits to the recruitment of a total of 21 educational psychologists by September 2017.&quot;<\/blockquote><p>I welcome this debate, which is important, as Deputies have indicated.  One of the goals I set in my Action Plan for Education is that within a decade we would have the best education and training service.  One of the areas in which we set out to be best is the way in which we deal with young people who come to education either with a special need or with a disadvantage.  Listening to the Deputies opposite, they gave a very inaccurate portrayal of what is happening.  Since 2011, there has been a 41% increase in the number of resource teachers, or teachers for children with special educational needs.  That equates to an additional 2,187 teachers for those children and we sought to vindicate their rights in a difficult time.  There are 2,517 additional special needs assistants, SNAs, supporting children with special needs in our schools.  Deputies mentioned ASD units and we have provided 601 additional units since 2011, an increase of 209%; in other words, we trebled the number of ASD units in the past five years for children with special needs.  I am not saying everything in the garden is perfect but pretending we have done nothing in the area, as the Deputies have done, is very inaccurate and does not really serve the purpose we are here to address.<\/p><p>The point has been made that there is a more acute problem at second level.  It is true to say second level ASD units have grown from a much lower base, although they have grown much faster.  The growth in ASD units at second level has been almost 350%, meaning the number is almost four and a half times what it was.  It equates to an additional 182 ASD units at second level.  Taking the number of ASD units as a proportion of the children at second level, it is true their proportion when compared with those at primary level is only at approximately 70%.  There are lower numbers in ASD units as a proportion of the second level school population but that reflects a growing transition where ASD units have entered into the system and are now moving to second level.  I recognise that not every child who has been in an ASD unit at primary level necessarily will go on to second level but there is a very real commitment in the area.  The additional 601 ASD units is a sign of real commitment.<\/p><p>We can also consider the building programme, which we have discussed during Question Time.  There was an example in Kildare and I am sure there could be one in Cork as well.  Not only do we have 59 ASD units in place in Kildare but there are three under construction and there are five in major building projects coming up the track.  There is a very real commitment to roll out support in ASD units, as well as having other dimensions of support for children with special needs.  As I stated, this is reflected very clearly in the numbers.  Between SNAs and resource teachers there are approximately 4,700 additional people supporting those children.  It is a real commitment and I certainly do not have to tell Deputy Michael McGrath that it was done in a difficult fiscal environment.  The commitment has been very real.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has told me that by and large it is satisfied with the availability of ASD units to meet needs but that is not to say there are not pockets with continuing problems, with Cork being one such area.  We recognise there are problems.  Deputy Mattie McGrath has drawn attention to problems in Clonmel and there are individual areas where I recognise there is a particular need.  As with Deputy Thomas Byrne and others, I believe every school should accommodate children with special needs, regardless of their needs.  It is already unlawful and as Deputies noted I am also seeking the power for the NCSE to direct a school to take a child.<\/p><p>I have an open mind on going beyond that.  He is correct in saying the approach of the Department has not been compulsion but rather, in the tradition of partnership with schools, it sought to develop ASD units through the NCSE by working with local schools and special educational needs organisers, SENOs.  It has not been about taking a legal power to date.  There are some genuine concerns that if we take a legal power and force schools to act, there is a question of how parents will feel about sending children to a particular school that in a sense has been compelled to take that child.  That is not to say I have a closed mind on the issue and I will work with others to see how we can address the issue.  We all have a shared belief that we need to ensure that where there is a need and where it is preferred that support for a child should be in a unit of this nature, we deliver it.  There have been cases where schools have resisted the roll-out of ASD units, which is unacceptable.  We must move away from that.<\/p><p>A number of Deputies raised concerns about the new model for allocation of resources.  There are approximately 2,200 additional resource teachers and we are putting another 900 in this year, bringing the total to over 3,000.  There are major merits in the new model and we have been very careful to ensure that it was first piloted in 47 areas.  Deputies Michael McGrath and Lisa Chambers raised the issue of us moving away from the requirement to have this expensive diagnostic test, which has been a barrier for children, particularly in disadvantaged schools.  This model will allocate to schools resources based on the profile of the school.  Deputy Thomas Byrne is right to seek the assurance that it will guarantee that no school will lose out or be left short of support for children with complex needs within a school.  That is guaranteed.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael McGrath rightly raised the issue of early intervention.  It also means that instead of a child in a school waiting to have an assessment done and for resources to come, the school will be in a position immediately to provide resources for the child.  Schools will be assigned resources to support children based on the profile of the school.  The change also means that the resource teaching will follow the need in the school.  Unlike the previous model, which spread a lot of the jam evenly across all schools, it will, over time, provide more resources to the schools with the greatest identified need.  This is based on the literacy standards and whether there are complex needs.<\/p> <p> This is a very positive dimension and it means that we are moving away from the counterproductive labelling of children.  Schools are best placed to determine how to cope with learning needs, whether in group settings or withdrawn settings.  Preferably, they would not be withdrawn settings.  This is the other dimension of the model.  It gives schools the capacity to manage resources as effectively as possible.  I had the privilege of visiting schools which have run the pilot, and it has been transformative.  Instead of children with special needs being withdrawn and handled differently, it has been an integrated model.  It has benefited not just the children with special educational needs but the whole community of children who see that their class invites in and supports children with special needs.<\/p> <p> The Deputy also raised concerns about the NEPS.  I understand those concerns.  This is one area which has not expanded in recent years.  This year, we are recruiting 21 additional psychologists, 11 of whom will fill posts that have already been sanctioned and ten of whom will take up new posts.  Under the programme for Government, we will seek an additional 55 posts.  It is not true, as some have said, that schools which do not have assigned psychologists have no access to psychological assessments.  Under a private psychologist scheme, we give them access to such assessments.  The service has been stretched and it is right that we expand it.  I want further expansion and I welcome the Deputies' support for it.<\/p> <p> I am intensively engaged in trying to support children more effectively.  We are rolling out a well-being programme at junior cycle.  We are investing &euro;3 million in professional upskilling support to teachers to roll it out.  Every teacher in the programme will have 22 hours of additional time to plan and deliver it.  As Deputy Thomas Byrne knows, we are restoring guidance counselling.  Those are very important supports to the psychological well-being, strength and resilience of children in our schools.  The programme we are rolling out is an important element of the entire picture of ensuring we make the learning environment for children who might struggle in school, for whatever reason, as good as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800049#BBB00200","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488994800,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle as ucht an deis chun labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach seo a bhaineann le oideachas speis&iacute;alta.  I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for bringing forward the motion.  While my party broadly supports the sentiment behind the motion, we have concerns with aspects of it.<\/p>  <p>  As the rapporteur of the committee on the issue, I am well aware of the concerns in respect of the staffing of NEPS.  As outlined in our amendment, 619 schools across the State do not have access to a NEPS psychologist for the purpose of carrying out an assessment.  That is a shocking statistic, and it is there in black and white.  We do not want a make-do system whereby a child might get through to a private service.  We want a proper service in place for our children through NEPS.  I am also aware of the constraints placed on schools seeking an assessment, given that only two assessments per 100 pupils are allowed, which is not enough.<\/p>  <p>  This flies in the face of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004, which gives a statutory right to children to receive assessments in a timely manner.  The system means that children from privileged backgrounds who can afford to pay privately can, to all intents and purposes, bypass the system and receive an assessment and diagnosis.  While I recognise that the sentiment behind the new resource allocation model is to ensure resources can be allocated without an assessment, there is a clear need to increase the capacity of the NEPS in keeping with the EPSEN Act and all it stands for.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of an accurate assessment is important.  From a teaching and planning point of view it is vital.  It provides schools, parents and even the children themselves with the information needed to adequately support them in fulfilling their right to a high-quality education.  In my experience as a learning support teacher and as an acting principal, an assessment and identification of a child's needs can often be a huge source of comfort and reassurance to the parents and the child.  It can explain the difficulties the child may be experiencing.  Surely their self-esteem is worth protecting.  It reassures the child that it is not his or her fault and I have seen many instances in which the self-esteem and confidence of children has improved significantly as a result of a diagnosis.  In that context, the development of the conversation regarding the so-called labelling of children has been very negative and unhelpful.  If a person has a medical condition, surely that individual wants to know about it so he or she can manage it.  This is no different.  It is a positive way forward for children and their families.<\/p>  <p>  If there are situations in which children are being misdiagnosed, they need to be addressed.  However, this has not been my experience.  As we know, due to the lack of capacity in the context of early intervention and school-age mental health and disability teams, obtaining an assessment and diagnosis of a child can be a very trying and frustrating process for parents.  It is not undertaken willy-nilly by parents or schools.  It is taken very seriously and is used as a last resort if a child is experiencing difficulties.  To suggest children are being diagnosed improperly and without good reason undermines the professionalism of the services.  There is always a good reason for it.  Most worryingly, that to which I refer sends out a message that, in having a special educational need, there is a negative connotation in having a so-called label associated with a child and that it is something of which to be ashamed.  That is wrong.  Like any condition, one needs to know what the condition is and be able to manage it.  I assume this is not the intention of commentators, yet it comes across that way.  I urge people to be careful in the language they use and the message it sends.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the provision in the motion that calls for powers to be given to the NCSE to provide for a special class or autism class where there is clear demand for one.  There is a huge shortage of autism classes throughout the State, particularly at second level, and this must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Although our party has already committed to an amendment of the upcoming Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 in this regard, I would welcome any moves to address the issue in the meantime.  I take the Minister's point that a clear need must be established for such a class and that it is better if schools are not compelled to provide such classes against their will.  However, the needs of the child must be paramount in this situation.  If we are striving towards an inclusive education system, it must be done.  We cannot kick the can down the road any longer when it is clear that there is a problem that must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  While I understand and welcome the sentiments behind the new resource allocation model in that it aims to provide increased flexibility to schools to allocate resources based on need and allow schools to provide for the special educational needs of pupils without an assessment or diagnosis, there are a number of concerns.  I have been flooded with concerns from principals and teachers about the new resource allocation model.  If we consider the upcoming admissions legislation, which seeks to eliminate the barriers to admissions for children with special educational needs, we must ask ourselves if there is not a contradiction between this aim and the operation of the new model.  I refer specifically to the fact that, under the new model, schools will have their allocations fixed for two years in advance of the enrolment process.  This raises a number of concerns.<\/p><p>The first of these concerns is that it will undermine the intention of the new admissions legislation in giving schools a very legitimate reason to deny admission to a child with special educational needs where the school does do not have the resources.  I have been informed of one such instance where a parent has been informed by a principal and a special educational needs organiser that the local school will not have the resources for two years in order to admit their child.  We speak of inclusive education but it is clear that this does not fit in with our vision for such education.  It certainly does not fit in with Sinn F&eacute;in's view for an inclusive education system.<\/p> <p> The second major concern with the new resource allocation model is that no clarity has been afforded to schools around situations where children with special educational needs enter a school subsequent to the allocation.  Inclusion Ireland, the National Council for Special Education and the inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills have all called for an appeals mechanism to be established in cases where schools have concerns about their profiles and their subsequent allocations.  To date, the full details of this appeals process has not been published and a letter issued to schools yesterday states that the details of the process will be published on 20 March.  There is much confusion and publication of the information must be fast-tracked.  I hope the appeals process will be a robust and speedy mechanism for schools to address the unanticipated changes in a school&rsquo;s profile under the new resource allocation model.  The lack of clarity at this stage is very worrying and frustrating for schools throughout the State.  The new resource allocation model envisages that additional needs identified after a school receives an initial allocation will be addressed through the inclusion support service.  This service has not been fully established, but I understand that work is ongoing to expedite matters.  There are many gaps in this resource allocation model with things so up in the air.  In the Department circulars issued this week and in the letter with details of the allocation that was sent to schools, there was no mention of this service or, indeed, the additional support that will be provided for schools in cases where additional needs have been identified.  This is very worrying and a source of frustration for schools.<\/p> <p> Given the fact that the model for identification of future complex needs has yet to be finalised, we are now in a situation where increased demand for supports and resources for children with special educational needs may not be adequately provided for under the new model.  This is compounded by the fact that the complex needs component of the allocation to a school is calculated on the basis of the current low incidence allocation and may not cover situations where there is increased enrolment of children with complex needs or cases where children receive a diagnosis after the allocation is provided to schools.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in believes there needs to be a clear and straightforward process available to schools in cases where additional needs are identified and the allocation is insufficient to address them.  Our amendment seeks to provide additional safeguards to schools.  Safeguards are needed because we cannot take chances on something; we must have a good model and a good operation in place.  We need to ensure that these needs can be addressed and I urge all parties to support our amendment.<\/p> <p> We have been in contact with stakeholders on this point and they agree that this needs to happen and indeed it is the recommendation of Inclusion Ireland, the NCSE and the Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate that there needs to be a mechanism to deal with unanticipated demand.  This would provide greater reassurance to schools and would be in keeping with the spirit of the new model whereby we are entrusting schools with the flexibility to determine the resources needed to adequately support the child.  It would also be in keeping with the spirit of the new admissions legislation, which seeks to remove the barriers to admission to school for children with special educational needs.  We know that such additional supports are absolutely crucial as pointed out by the Department of Education and Skills' Inspectorate report, which says that the impact of the new resource allocation model was primarily in schools that received additional supports.  This motion calls for additional provision to be made in cases where a child has a specific diagnosis when entering or transferring from school.  Sinn F&eacute;in feels, however, that this needs to be broader in order to address the issues outlined above.  The linking of additional supports to a diagnosis flies in the face of what the new resource allocation model is about and it sends a contradictory message to schools and parents.<\/p> <p> I appreciate the fact that there are positive aspects to the new resource allocation model but I sincerely hope that the issues to which I refer will be addressed before September.  Parents, schools and children are desperate for an effective and inclusive system that allows the supports and resources to be put in place to address the needs of children with special educational needs.  Appropriate investment in the NEPS and early intervention may be a more effective means of addressing many of the issues.  In one way it appears that we have come up with a very convoluted solution to the delay in assessing children.  In any event, I have difficulties with the wording of the motion before us.  I call on all parties to support our amendment to the motion, which provides additional safeguards for schools and, more importantly, for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800050#CCC00200","speaker":"1340","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488995400,"counter":537,"content":"<p>The austerity measures in recent years have hit the most vulnerable the hardest.  We have seen how this Government and the forerunner the Labour - Fine Gael government targeted some of the most vulnerable people in education.  Capitation grants were cut, class sizes remained high, career guidance positions were axed, teachers&rsquo; pay was cut and teachers were demoralised.  The teaching positions allocated to the Traveller community were cut.  Those students who have special needs were greatly impacted and the debate tonight is about those students.<\/p>  <p>  I will first turn to some of the issues that have arisen in Cork.  There is a particular concern among parents there regarding the lack of provision for children with autism.  I attended a public meeting in Cork on this issue a number of months ago at which parents, teachers and other elected representatives were present.  There is no adequate provision of autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, special classes - or anything near enough - in schools in Cork.  One teacher informed me that the special educational needs organiser in Cork contacted every secondary school in the city and found that apart from the four schools that already had ASD special classes, no school except one would set up an ASD special class despite the needs of the incoming student cohort.  In Cork city in the 2016-2017 academic year only one boy was offered a place in an ASD special class in a mainstream school.  That is just one place or the entire city of Cork.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider other figures.  According to figures I have been given by a teacher in Cork city, during the 2015-2016 academic year there were 1,164 students in special classes in at second level across the State.  There were 3,426 students in special classes at primary level.  The simple maths is that 3,426 places required cannot go into the 1,164 students at second level.  In Cork city and county last summer there were 396 students trying to get into 205 places at second level.  Again the maths is simple; there is simply not adequate provision.  While there will be some pupils who do not need a special class at second level or who may go to a special school, there will also be those who did not need a special class at primary level and who will need one at second level.  The experience is that when primary school concludes students with autism face a major disruption in their education.  There are many pupils with ASD who can thrive in mainstream classes.  There are others who cannot and who need the environment of a special class with a smaller group of students, experienced teachers and SNAs.  In such situations, these students can achieve in education when they would not if they were in the mainstream classroom.<\/p>  <p>  In reply to parliamentary questions, the Minister for Education and Skills and his predecessor have repeatedly stated that the setting up of special classes is &ldquo;subject to the willingness of schools to open classes.&rdquo;  The Government will say that the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 will make it illegal to refuse a person with autism from a school.  Under that Bill, the NCSE will have the ability to place children in schools where a school place is not available.  The key point is, however, that there is no provision in the Bill for the NCSE to direct that special classes be established.<\/p><p>Students needing special classes will be placed into a mainstream class, causing major disruption to that student&rsquo;s education unless such provision is put in place.  That is the crux of the matter.  That is what needs to be done.<\/p> <p> I want to make a couple of points about NEPS and the resource teaching situation.  It is scandalous that there are thousands of children in the education system without access to an educational psychologist through NEPS.  There are 619 primary and secondary schools without access to a NEPS psychologist for making assessments.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service has outlined that 131 DEIS schools have no access to a NEPS psychologist.  Like many aspects of our public services, private operators are used to fill in gaps in the underfunded and understaffed public service.  This is not something that is done by accident, it is done by design.  It is part of a general neoliberal model the Government has for our public services.<\/p> <p> The amendment to the Fianna F&aacute;il motion mentioned the crude limitation of two assessments per 100 pupils under the current system.  That shows the approach that Ministers have taken over the years.  Rather than catering for whatever are the needs of our young people, they penny-pinched and allocated access to assessments based on a crude budget, not on needs.  There was a 15% cut in the number of resource teacher hours and this cut has not been reversed.  There is to be a new allocation model that does not depend on formal diagnosis.  On the face of it, this is to be welcomed, given the problems in accessing formal diagnosis for many young people.  However, there are still serious doubts about the new resource allocation model being advanced.  I support the call for an absolute assurance that no student will have resource teaching hours reduced, even by a single hour.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I want to make several points of that the service the resources situation it is scandalous that thousands of students in education system without education access to an occupational's psychologist of the service there are 619 primary and secondary schools without access to a psychologist, assessments are class library and research services over that 131 schools no access to a psychologist like many aspects of our public services private operators beautiful in gaps under on that land on. Robinson was is not by accident the storm by design as part of the channel, the only role model the amendment to the Fina file motion mentioned the criminal limitation of two assessments per 100 pupils on the current system that shows the approach that ministers over the years have taken rather than catering for whatever other needs of our young people they penny pinched and allocated access to assessments based on a crude budget and not on these there was a 15% cut in the numbers of resource teacher hours and this course has not been reversed there is to be a new allocation model that does not and formal diagnosis on the face of it this is to be welcomed given the problems in accessing formal diagnosis for many young people however there are still serious doubts about the new resource allocation model being advanced I support the call for an absolute assurance that no student will have resource resource teaching arms reduced even by a single hour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800051#DDD00200","speaker":"1281","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488996000,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I wish to share time Deputy Pringle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800052#EEE00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1488996000,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

NEPS is seriously understaffed and a high number of DEIS schools do not have access to a NEPS psychologist for the purpose of carrying out an assessment.  That means a financial strain on NEPS to pay for private psychologists.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the new resource allocation model for allocating special education teaching resources, I note that, in theory, the new model is based on need and that it has been welcomed by the NCSE.  However, I believe that, as with all models, there is a need for vigilance in terms of monitoring and evaluation so it does what it is supposed to be doing.<\/p>  <p>  I spent 36 years in second level schools and I chaired the board of management of a primary school.  I want to highlight what is going on in our schools in spite of the lack of psychologists.  What I have seen over those years is a duty of care from all staff - from principals and teachers to the ancillary staff - and all of the ethos I have seen in schools I know has been an ethos of tolerance and respect, especially respect for difference.<\/p>  <p>  Many different issues arise for students in schools, namely, bereavement, addiction in their homes, their own addiction issues, bullying - for the bully and the bullied - lack of confidence, low self-esteem, poverty, housing, including those living in bed and breakfasts and hotels, relationship issues, self-harm, pregnancy, eating disorders and behaviour in classrooms and on school grounds.  These are just a few of the issues teachers deal with day.  My teaching days were in a time when, in north Dublin, we had access to one psychologist.  This means so much fell to the teachers, and they rose to it.  Many schools had excellent pastoral care systems, with year heads, form teachers, pastoral care teams, chaplains and school guidance counsellors.  It is important to recognise how much support and care there was over the years.  Obviously, it was not perfect but so much was done by the schools in drawing up programmes and addressing those issues for their students.<\/p>  <p>  Two particular programmes are On My Own Two Feet and Walk Tall.  I know On My Own Two Feet better because my school was a pilot school for that programme.  The modules were on self-esteem and identity, assertiveness, feelings, decision making and understanding influence.  There were five books with enough material for 40 classes in each.  It was adaptable according to the age profile and there was training for teachers, and there was a lot of support in the schools.  I want to put out there what the schools did and what they continue to do, regardless of the NEPS situation.<\/p>  <p>  The motion is comprehensive, given the work of Deputy Thomas Byrne, and the main issue is access to NEPS and related services.  It is positive that there will be less of a need going forward for students to have had a formal assessment to access supports.  However, that will put a huge onus on schools to decide which student gets the support and to what level.  That reinforces the need to bolster staff support levels through NEPS and related services to guide and help the resource schools in allocating teaching resources in line with the new model.  Many teachers also feel that they process by which to attract SNA support to a student with care needs is overly cumbersome.  Is there a possibility of looking at a model whereby a SENO or NEPS psychologist could monitor and observe such students as identified by schools and then decide what support may be necessary.  The current model for attracting SNAs is bureaucratic and costly.  We also want to acknowledge the excellent being done by the learning resource teachers in drawing up and directing individual lesson plans for those students who need them.<\/p>  <p>  We know the autism spectrum is very wide and there are some students at one end for whom an autism unit could be based in the school.  However, that has to be based on need and there have to be teachers who have been specially trained with the skills in order to teach those students.  There are other students with care needs and learning needs who can be accommodated within the school, and that has to be reflected in the admissions policies of all schools in order that they are welcoming of those with special needs.  It is crucial that we have early intervention and that we do all we can to ensure that early intervention is in place for those students of greatest need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800052#EEE00400","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1488996000,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issues addressed in the context of NEPS in Fianna F&aacute;il's Private Members' motion.  I not only want to focus on the issue of the chronically understaffed NEPS but also on the provision of special needs supports in our schools.  NEPS is also responsible for ensuring that the special educational needs of a child are met in tandem with the provision of special needs assistants for a school.  First, on the issue of staffing for NEPS, the programme for Government stated its intention to increase the number of NEPS psychologists in the country by 65.  However, the Government has already delayed on this commitment, as indicated in the Minister's 2017 Action Plan for Education, where the Minister commits to only beginning the hiring process for ten new staff to NEPS as opposed to 65 by the first quarter of this year.<\/p>  <p>  It was indicated to the D&aacute;il that a total of 34,500 primary pupils, or one in six primary schools, are still without direct access to a NEPS psychologist.  However, the total number of children possibly affected by the lack of access to NEPS could be many as 95,000 pupils and 397 schools.  This may be the case if we include children who are on long waiting lists to see a NEPS psychologist.  This inconsistency is undoubtedly leading to a growing inequality in access to education across the country.  While a child is waiting for a NEPS assessment, he or she is missing out on access to vital resource teaching hours and learning supports.  The current situation also privileges those who can afford to pay for private assessment, thereby exacerbating social inequality.<\/p>  <p>  The reformed system of resource allocation where access to resource teaching would no longer rely upon a formal diagnosis of learning difficulty, although welcome, has serious implications as it is unclear how this new system would be implemented.  The Minister recently announced a new assessment process for schools in regard to determining DEIS status.  Despite my numerous parliamentary questions to him on exactly how this new assessment framework operates, huge gaps are present in his explanation and it is still unclear how the Department determines a school's DEIS classification.  This leads me to believe that a large part of the process is left to the discretion of the Minister or his Department so there is flexibility in which schools are classified and which are declassified.<\/p>  <p>  I would be concerned that the very same process will ensue in the new model of allocation of resource teacher hours for schools.  The new model will allocate teachers to schools according to the profiled educational needs of each school, but how exactly will NEPS profile the education needs of each school in a way that is fair, transparent and truly reflective of need?<\/p>  <p>  I would also make the point that while we discuss the need to increase the number of NEPS psychologists available to schools, we need to talk about the allocation of special needs assistants for children with physical disabilities.  One consequence of increases in numbers within NEPS is an increase in the need for special needs assistants and in the number of children undergoing assessment.  The problem is the inequality inherent in the assessment process.  There have been cases where very young children with type 1 diabetes are told by NEPS they are not entitled to an SNA and must share an SNA with a child who has autism or who has entirely different needs and takes completely different classes within the school.  This is not a reflection of an equitable allocation of resources and it is certainly not reflective of need.<\/p><p> On the issue of equipment, some schools cannot get funding from the HSE to provide the necessary equipment for students who may not be able to attend school otherwise.  They may even have special needs assistants allocated to them but once they attend school, barriers are prevented due the lack of necessary equipment.  This could be anything from a hoist to special chairs or proper lighting for sensory issues.  Last year, a school in Dungloe, County Donegal, was left to fund-raise for vital equipment for students with severe disabilities.  Proper equipment and support staff are critical to students' progression in their educational development.  I echo calls across the House that the Government must begin to take seriously the right of the child to education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800052#EEE00500","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488996600,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I support the motion before the House.  It is long established that early intervention is crucial to give a child the best opportunities.  For early intervention, we first need an assessment of needs.  Otherwise, we are putting the cart before the horse.  Early assessment means that the children will be offered suitable resources and supports that will enable them to reach their full potential.  If a child is not assessed, supports are not put in place.  I was shocked to recently learn that there was only one educational psychologist employed by the HSE in south Cork who has to manage more than 200 referrals per year.  I have been told that the referrals are divided into two lists: priority and routine.  The priority list can take more than one year and the routine waiting list can take more than two years.  South Cork is severely understaffed and I believe that it is not in line with the child-to-psychologist ratio in other areas of the country such as County Donegal.<\/p>  <p>  The Government must act now on its commitment to increase the number of National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists.  Inadequate NEPS staffing is causing huge stress to parents, teachers and students and it cannot continue.  Early assessment intervention is key to preventing much bigger problems in children's lives.  Furthermore, it has been proven that early intervention saves the Government money in the long run.  The Government must make increasing the number of educational psychologists available a priority, particularly in south-west Cork, where, as I mentioned, only one educational psychologist is available to deal with more than 200 referrals per year.  It is wholly unacceptable that a child must in some cases wait more than two years for an assessment.  This issue needs to be addressed now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800053#FFF00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1488996600,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I too wish to support this motion and the call for more psychologists to assess the needs of children in order that their needs are properly addressed.  I call for more transparency when funding is being awarded under the DEIS programme.  I am aware of a situation in a very large school in Killarney, St. Oliver's, in which there are huge numbers of children who come from many different countries and where funding is required to give these children a fair and proper education.  Additional teachers with translation abilities are needed to give these children a proper start and a proper education.<\/p>  <p>  There is an urgent need for many more special needs teachers in the small national schools around the country.  As larger schools have special needs teachers, the child with special needs from a family of course tends to go to that school and the rest of the family follows.  That means they pass a small school nearer to them, which eventually closes because children tend to go to the school their special needs siblings attend.<\/p>  <p>  There is another issue in rural Ireland that needs to be addressed.  When rural schools were closed, a promise was given that the children would always be transported for free to the nearest central school in the parish.  That is not happening.  Since 2012, the last Government and this Government have furthered a policy by which the children will only get transport to the nearest school, which may be in a different parish.  That is not fair because families want to keep their parish identities and want their children to go to the local schools.  Where the parents went, they want to children to follow.  This must be addressed.  There are many such situations in Cordal, Scartaglin, Anascaul, Tralee and Dingle.  All of those places are affected.  In Knocknagashel, there are more families affected.  The Government did not honour the promise given that the children would be taken to the school in their own parish.<\/p>  <p>  There is no need in Kerry for the education Bill the Minister is bringing through.  There is no requirement for a child to be baptised to be allowed into any of the schools that I know in Kerry.  It is not a requirement that they have to produce a baptismal certificate.  All denominations and all children from whatever country they come from are allowed in to each of our national schools.  Our schools and parent-teacher committees need to be applauded for that because they do not segregate anyone.  They give all children a chance to be admitted to their schools.  I know one very small national school at the present time in which there are children from 13 different nationalities and there was never a requirement that they had to produce a baptismal certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800053#FFF00300","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1488996600,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Thomas Byrne on tabling this important motion.  The NEPS is drastically understaffed, with 95,543 primary and post-primary pupils across almost 400 schools without access to an assigned NEPS psychologist.  This is shocking.  There also is a serious shortage of special autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes, at post-primary level.  In Clonmel, Tipperary, there are two preschool units set up by a former principal of St. Mary's, Mr. Jimmy Ryan.  There are 12 students who will leave those units this September with no place to go.  The special educational needs organisers, SENOs, are doing great work, as are the parents of these children with special needs.  It is so difficult on them and so unfair.<\/p>  <p>  There is a public meeting taking place in my own school and village tonight at this precise time to inform the public.  It is ironic that we are speaking about it here.  However, that is eight, nine or ten miles out from Clonmel and people cannot be and should not be travelling.  Another is taking place in Burncourt on the other side of the Cahir electoral area.  We need them.  The town of Clonmel, with 22,000 people, has no national school that has an ASD unit.  There are problems with the unit and with boards of management.  They are not problems, but they all have to okay it and buy into it.  It has to be a whole school management scheme.  It needs a bit of enthusiasm.  There is a wonderful unit in Ardfinnan led by Ms Mairead Condon.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is going to have to sit down with the unions.  There must be a carrot and a stick.  The Minister said earlier that he cannot force them into it.  I do not want it to be forced as that would not be in the right spirit.  They have to want to do it and do it for the love of children with special needs.  We need to have special needs teachers.  We cannot force the teachers to go in.  We need to have more special needs assistants and more flexibility for them.  In setting up these two new units for September, we will be coming to the Department of Education and Skills with begging bowls in the next few weeks looking for funding to do the buildings.  I hope they will not be prefabricated.  We must get planning for a proper building.  I believe it is very important to have a proper type of building.  We need to have a reciprocation from the Minister's Department.  Where schools, boards of management, principals, parents' councils, parents and teachers want to do this, there must be an engaging Department of Education and Skills that will provide the supports and not hold them back.<\/p>  <p>  I have a son myself going to a special unit in the High School, Clonmel.  It is an exceptional unit set up under former principal, Mr. Shay Bannon.  There is an exceptional staff and team and it is a major success.  It could be used as a template for any part of the country.  People go in and out of it and into different classes.  It is needed.  The figures are compelling.  I know that we have come through a torrid recession but special needs children and their parents need all the support they can get.  They have enough to do to look after the children on a 24-7 basis.  They need to be able to have a school within a reasonable distance, and not have children travelling 21 km from Clonmel to someplace else out of town.  It is very important for such towns that there is some bit of stick, rather than carrot, to ensure there are schools for that kind of a population group.<\/p><p>Let us face it: they are all there.  All these problems of autism and other issues are being diagnosed.  There is early diagnosis, thankfully.  In many cases, parents have to pay vast moneys to get the vital early diagnosis.  We are playing catch-up totally in this regard.<\/p> <p> I wish to highlight the question of DEIS schools as well.

It failed to get DEIS status this year.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; a l&aacute;n obair le d&eacute;anamh ag an Aire.  The Minister has much work to do.

I regularly have people calling to my office to raise this issue.  I expect it is the same for other Deputies.  It happens because there is a problem with the psychological services or the absence of them.  The issue arises regularly.  Last week a particular case arose.  A child was facing exclusion from school activities due to the lack of supports.  Of course there is long-term damage for such children because self-esteem is not something we can measure.  Obviously, excluding the child is a major step for the teachers in the school to have to take.<\/p>  <p>  Parents constantly tell me that their children are not being called for assessments simply because no psychological staff are available.  It can be very much a post code lottery.  Not unlike Deputy Thomas Byrne, I happen to live in an area where there is a disproportionately large young population.  There are commitments in the programme for Government to increase NEPS staffing resources by 65 individual therapists.  Such an increase would represent a 25% increase overall.  However, there has been no increase in the number of assessments and no reduction in the waiting lists.  As of January 2017, a total of 321 schools have no access to NEPS psychologists due to staff vacancies.  Some 223 schools had no access to psychological services due to leave arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Many children are on the autism spectrum.  The service has been developed over years.  Often, services were developed because parents went to the courts and fought for appropriate education for their children.  I remember when some autism spectrum units were built specifically at primary level.  The one school decided to hold out and wait until it got the associated services.  Those involved knew that this was the best thing to do because if they did not get the services at the beginning, they would not be added afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  I do not understand it.  Children are identified at preschool level.  They eventually end up in a primary school but some schools want to be selective.  For some reason, it does not seem to follow that the need of the child is captured for second level.  Inevitably, the huge folder, familiar to any parent who has a child with special needs, gets pulled out again and the parents lobby once more for services for their children or for appropriate education for their children at secondary level.  I do not understand it.  If the information is available, why is it not captured or planned for?  Why are parents constantly put through the same fight all over again?  I have never met a parent of a child with special needs - regardless of the end of the spectrum at which he or she is placed - who does not end up being almost a professional lobbyist.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that there is an obvious gap in psychological services.  It is an obvious thing to say, but children only get one childhood.  If a child is deprived of necessary services and supports in childhood, essentially the consequences follow through in terms of outcomes in future.  This must be seen as an investment.  There is an educational window of opportunity.  If we do not pick it up at the early stage, we will not get the outcome to which the child is entitled in order for the child to be treated equally in this country.  The matter merits the attention it is getting tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800054#GGG00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1488997200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta labhairt anocht ar son an r&uacute;in seo mar go d&iacute;r&iacute;onn se ar chuid mhaith den mh&iacute;-chothroma&iacute;ocht at&aacute; sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais seo againne, m&iacute;-chothroma&iacute;ocht gur f&eacute;idir leis an Rialtas a leigheas go h&eacute;asca m&aacute; chinnt&iacute;onn s&eacute; infheist&iacute;ocht do na hearn&aacute;il &aacute;irithe seo.  I commend Deputy Thomas Byrne on bringing this motion before the House.  The Green Party will be supporting it.<\/p>  <p>  Psychological services in our schools have been at crisis level for many years.  Today, a total of 397 schools are without access to NEPS.  These schools are at an extraordinarily unfair disadvantage and face unacceptable delays when it comes to access to assessment for special educational needs or behavioural difficulties.  All schools need access to a full educational psychological service that facilitates early intervention work and appropriate screening programmes as well as vital assessment services and systems to ensure the necessary supports and resources are available to all children in need of same.<\/p>  <p>  The sad reality is that for many years parents from more affluent backgrounds have easily accessed the necessary educational psychological assessments for their children by paying for them privately.  These reports are then utilised to assert the rights of these children to extra resources.  However, children from more disadvantaged backgrounds have to take their place in an endless queue.  The resulting delay means needs are not identified, appropriate resources are not provided and children fall behind in an educational system that moves quickly.<\/p>  <p>  It is a vicious cycle.  The most disadvantaged become even more disadvantaged.  This is evidenced by the fact that at present 131 DEIS schools are without access to a NEPS psychologist.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's announcement of a new model of allocating teaching resources for special needs.  I look forward to the new model being rolled out in September and I look forward to seeing how exactly it will work on a practical level.  However, the key point is that the specific needs of all students are not only appropriately identified but adequately responded to with the necessary supports and resources as well.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of crucial services to students should not come down to luck of the draw in respect of where a school is based.  All schools and students should have access to all services that NEPS provides, especially in the event of a crisis or a tragedy.<\/p>  <p>  The chronic shortage of places for students with autism spectrum disorder is addressed in the motion.  Currently, schools can refuse to set up ASD units despite an obvious need for same identified in the locality.  Herein lies the ongoing appalling discrimination on grounds of special educational needs taking place in many schools.  However, it is not being addressed by the Government.  The school inspection system does not help.  Schools which have ASD units and many students with special educational needs are often questioned and criticised at the end of a school inspection in respect of why they do not attract more academic students.  At the same time, schools that do not have ASD units and have few children with special educational needs are never asked at the end of an inspection why they have so few children with special educational needs.<\/p>  <p>  One of the main reasons for the shortage of ASD units in schools is the ability of a school to groundlessly refuse to set up an ASD unit.  Representatives of these schools often suggest to parents who request such supports that they should try the school down the road or that the child would be better off in another school.  This practice must stop.  I will be submitting an amendment to the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill to give authority to the NCSE to compel schools to set up special classes where a need is identified.  the Department of Education and skills must ensure that these classes or units are then adequately resourced.<\/p>  <p>  John F. Kennedy once said that not everyone has equal abilities, but that everyone should have equal opportunity for education.  As legislators, we must ensure that equality of access and opportunity is always front and centre and at the heart of our educational system.  Unfortunately, this is not the case at present.  However, it is essential that it becomes the standard, the norm.  It should never be compromised.  Actually it must be a fundamental and overarching principle.  It must be a priority underpinning all levels of the Irish education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800054#GGG00400","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1488997800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>First, I thank my colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, for his work on ensuring fair treatment for all children is the primary focus of Fianna F&aacute;il's work in education.

For parents and teachers who wish to access additional teaching resources for these children, the students must first be assessed by a psychologist.

No Deputy in the House can dispute the fact that the parents of children with learning disabilities are completely disillusioned with the webs of red tape and the extraordinary waiting times being imposed on them.<\/p>  <p>  Far too many children are already being left behind and their families are the people who suffer.

Early education and human development through the adolescent years can be a challenging time for even the most gifted students.  For that reason we must do more to ensure urgent access to a child psychologist.  That is the key to ensuring that families are supported.  Currently, they feel the system is designed to work against them.<\/p>  <p>  To gain access to additional resource teaching, a child must be assessed for learning difficulty by a psychologist, which can be done publicly through the National Educational Psychological Service or through a private consultant.

A public assessment through the National Educational Psychological Service can take up to a year, and even longer, and I have a database of representations in my office which testifies to this timeframe.

There is concern that instead of a child-centred approach, the new system gives an allocation of resource teaching hours to schools based on their catchment demographic and socio-economic profile.  It should not be the case that a child with assessed needs is deprived of resource supports.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot ignore these inequalities any longer.  Parents should not be left waiting years for what is essentially the most important appointment in their child's early education, simply because they might not be as well off as others.  The Government is attempting to back-track on commitments to hire additional educational psychologists, and the education action plan has delayed the recruitment process.  The Government must commit to reversing such trends and to recruiting the required psychologists or the current inequalities in the system will increase to uncontrollable levels.  Every child in this country has the constitutional right to equal opportunity to flourish in education.  A society is judged by how it looks after its children, and especially children with special needs.  We should look after them at all costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800055#HHH00200","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1488997800,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Children with special educational needs should be able to access full education and the required supports.  Much has been said about the current system, the need for reform and the Minister's proposed new model.  I wish to focus on three key areas.<\/p>  <p>  The first is children who do not have access to psychologists.  There is an acknowledged absence of the service in 400 schools.  The Minister is proposing to recruit 21 new psychologists.  The target is 238, an increase from 162.  This target is inadequate and based on inaccurate information.  Take the example of the school in Dromleigh, which is like many other schools in rural mid-Cork.  There are seven psychologists within an hour's drive, but all of them are overwhelmed with work.  Only one responded to the school when requested and gave an appointment for nine months hence.  The child concerned is losing out on a full school year, with the child's education and development suffering.  Parents are pushed towards private diagnosis, which costs &euro;600 to &euro;1,200 if they can put the money together.  That is not accessible for many families; therefore, again, the child loses out.  Furthermore, it is a one-off report, with no follow-up through the child's years of education.<\/p>  <p>  The second key area is the total system failure for children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD.  It takes 18 months to two years to get a diagnosis.  Those with a diagnosis pre-2016 have limited services but in Cork those with a post-2016 diagnosis have none.  Parents are forced to actively drive a system that is not working for them.  One parent outlined how she has applied to schools where eight to ten places might become available, but there are over 60 children on a waiting list.  One sees the distress of parents who are driving the system, waiting for a response and then experiencing the disappointment and terror when they realise there is no place for their child in September.  A lack of demographic planning created this situation.  It is bad enough at primary school level but it gets worse at secondary level, where there are even fewer places.  If ASD students are lucky enough to get a place, they are also likely to be separated from their peers.<\/p>  <p>  The third point is that a lack of planning caused the problems with the current system.  Parents and schools, especially smaller rural schools, are concerned about the new model.  They are worried about losing services for their children and returning to the situation of 15 years ago or so when they had a shared remedial teacher who travelled from school to school through the week.  Under this new model can they depend on getting the hours that the current system delivers for them?<\/p>  <p>  There is a shortage of psychologists and a failure in ASD services.  Any new model must address these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800055#HHH00300","speaker":"1284"},{"type":"speech","time":1488997800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Government and in support of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, I am pleased to speak about our substantial investment in the area of special educational needs and our commitment to the National Educational Psychological Service.  Deputy Thomas Byrne will be aware that County Meath has received over &euro;300 million in funding in the past few years to develop its educational services.  That has been very well received.<\/p>  <p>  I will outline the reality of the situation in respect of these elements and discuss the real progress that has been, and is being, made in the education system, particularly in support of those with special educational needs.<\/p><p>We are emerging from a period of the most severe economic difficulty and stringency when hard decisions had to be taken with regard to all aspects of public expenditure.  It must be acknowledged that the Government - this also applies to the Fine Gael-led Government which preceded it - has performed admirably in its determination to protect investment in the education system, particularly for those students most in need of support.  I am pleased to support the Government's counter motion in this context, bringing as it does an air of reality to what is a positive and dynamic situation.<\/p> <p> The Action Plan for Education 2016 to 2019 articulates the ambition, values and goals that are at the basis of the high-level work programme of the Department of Education and Skills, its agencies and the education and training sector.  This blueprint demonstrates clearly the high priority being afforded to the areas of mental health and well-being and special educational needs, with a renewed focus on putting appropriate resources in place to address those most at risk of disadvantage.  The highlighting of mental health and well-being has particular resonance for me in my current role as Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for mental health.  The plan represents a more holistic and structured approach than ever before in the school system.  The approach in schools for the promotion of well-being and positive mental health focuses on the entire school community, including groups and individual young people with identified needs.  This spans the curriculum, whole school ethos, policy of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care, guidance counselling and the provision of professional development of teachers, which is critically important.  All school staff share the responsibility for general student well-being.  <\/p> <p> The services provided by the NEPS play a pivotal role in supporting well-being, special education and social inclusion initiatives in primary and post primary schools.  Several Deputies raised issues with regard to access to CAMHS, but the first step will always be to try to address the young person's needs at a primary level.  CAMHS offers services to those with more severe mental health issues like psychosis, severe depression and eating disorders.  Where possible, we must try to work with young people at that primary level.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Minister's assurance that recruitment is under way to fill 11 existing vacancies and to appoint another ten psychologists as part of the new DEIS plan which was announced in February.  This means that for the next school year the staffing complement in NEPS will be at its highest level ever.  I am particularly pleased that the important role of the NEPS has been recognised in the programme for Government with the commitment to increase the number of psychologists by 65 to an unprecedented number of 238 posts.  <\/p> <p> Another significant undertaking in the Action Plan for Education is the rolling out of a new model for the allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs.  The basic aim of the model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Officials from the Department of Education and Skills, with their colleagues in the NCSE, engaged in very extensive consultations with school management bodies and teacher representative bodies throughout the development of the new model.  Recently, circulars on the implementation of the new model and individual allocation letters have been issued to schools.  In addition, extensive guidance has been prepared which will support schools in the delivery of supports to children with special educational needs.  Representatives of the Department are now visiting towns throughout the country to speak to school principals and leaders so that any remaining concerns can be addressed.  I welcome the extensive engagement the Department has facilitated which will ensure that schools' concerns are addressed.  It is very important that people feel that they have been part of the process right to the end.<\/p> <p> The allocations given to schools are based on profiles of each school and are tailored to provide enough resources to ensure all children with special educational needs in a school, including those who are currently pupils and those who have yet to enrol, can access the supports they need.  In the future, children who need supports will not have to wait for a diagnosis, as was the position in the past.  The new model will give greater autonomy to schools to allocate or deploy resources to pupils in line with their needs, regardless of their diagnosis.  The provision of an additional 900 special education teaching posts for 2017 is extremely welcome.  This comes on top of an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools since 2011.  <\/p> <p> On introduction of the new model, over 1,000 schools will receive additional allocations but no school will lose supports.  In addition, no allocation made by the NCSE to schools to support pupils in the past will be removed from schools as long as those pupils remain in the school.  Under the new model, for students who start school from September 2017 with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school.  The introduction of this new model has followed extensive consultation, analysis and a pilot process.  It has been widely welcomed across the school sector, as well as by parents and disability representatives.<\/p> <p> Progress in developing special classes for children with autism has been significant in recent years.  There are 525 primary autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes at primary level and 237 post-primary ASD classes.  The number of special class placements available generally reflects the distribution of students with autism across school settings.  The development of special class provision in post-primary settings usually lags a number of years behind the growth of special class provision at primary level for obvious demographic reasons.  That said, in the past three years the number of special classes at post-primary level has doubled.<\/p> <p> The NCSE and the Department of Education and Skills are working with schools to open up classes to meet demand but it is accepted that some difficulties remain, particularly at post-primary level.  In many cases, a refusal to open special classes arises because a school has either no space, is currently full, is awaiting a new building or the renovation of existing buildings or rooms, or because it simply cannot access suitably-trained teachers.  Whether the difficulties are infrastructural or related to the availability of suitably trained teachers or SNAs, clearly it is preferable that the Department would work with the school to ensure that such difficulties are addressed.  Schools should not be expected to open classes in the absence of suitable accommodation or staff to manage these facilities.<\/p> <p> It is difficult to conclude that problems in this area should be remediated by introducing a statutory provision to compel schools to open special classes.  I do not think that is the way to go.  I cannot imagine that parents or students would be happy in such a scenario.  If I had children, I certainly would not consider enrolling them in a school where such a direction had been issued to a school without its agreement.  It would be far preferable for schools to voluntarily open classes on request and to ensure that all necessary measures are put in place so that infrastructural or staffing issues are fully and appropriately addressed in a timely manner.<\/p> <p> I strongly support my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Government's motion on this issue.  Since 2011 significant investment has been made in the area of special educational needs.  This year over &euro;1.6 billion is committed to this area, an increase of &euro;400 million on the 2011 figure, when the previous Government took office.  This represents close to 20% of the overall education and training budget.  The delivery of the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to appoint additional educational psychologists is already under way and the Minister has made a commitment to ensure that this happens as quickly as possible.  I am also working closely with the Minister and his officials to ensure we are as responsive as possible in addressing the needs of students experiencing mental health difficulties and in supporting the well-being of all, including teachers, parents and all in the community.  I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800055#HHH00400","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488998400,"counter":556,"content":"<p>There are two minutes left in the slot and with the Minister of State's permission, I will invite Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800056#JJJ00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1488998400,"counter":557,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800056#JJJ00300","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1488998400,"counter":558,"content":"<p>Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin is now speaking on behalf of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800056#JJJ00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1488998400,"counter":559,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

I am also speaking on behalf of the two schools in Rathangan which have no NEPS schemes whatsoever.  Staff in my office carried out a survey among all of the schools in Kildare on this issue because we recognised its importance.  We got a huge response to the survey from school principals who were very eager to have their views and experiences heard.  To be honest, not all of them were negative about the new scheme but they all spoke about the difficulties they experience in providing resources to children through the scheme.  They are very frustrated and angry about how difficult it is to get an assessment, as they see their students struggling every single day.  There is a glaring inequality in the system which allows parents with sufficient financial means to pay for a private assessment in order to get their children the resources that they need.  Such assessments can cost upwards of &euro;1,000.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not have time to talk about Caoilinn from Suncroft who cannot access a place or about David from Newbridge who is flourishing because he has one.

Yesterday I was contacted by a young teacher from Roscommon town who pointed to the considerable uncertainty about the new arrangements for the new NCSE model for meeting special educational needs in schools.  Parents have been left in the dark and do not know if their children will have learning support and resource teaching hours.  Teachers are unsure if they will have jobs next September.  School principals do not know what their staff allocation will be next year.<\/p> <p> As my colleagues pointed out, a number of people looking for assessments for their children have gone to private sources and some have paid between &euro;450 and &euro;1,000 for the service.  That, in itself, is totally wrong.  I understand from where the Government is coming.  I have no doubt about the sincerity of the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee.<\/p> <p> In County Roscommon a total of 132 children are waiting for an assessment by a child psychologist and some children have been waiting more than one year for the appointment.  The reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Thomas Byrne showed a huge increase since 2015 in the number of children on a waiting list to see a child psychologist in the county.  A total of 58 children were on the waiting list in 2015.  That figure rose to 126 in 2016 and this month a total of 132 children are on the waiting list, a staggering increase of 127% since 2015 in a county with a population of 64,000.  This is totally unacceptable and the situation seems to have deteriorated since last summer when a child psychologist in County Roscommon was on sick leave.  The post has been vacant since, resulting in 132 children from County Roscommon being on the waiting list and unable to access child psychological services.<\/p> <p> I am dealing with a boy from County Roscommon who was referred by his GP to the psychological services, but after several weeks his parents finally received a return call informing them that the psychologist looking after school-age children had been on sick leave since March 2016 and that a locum could not be found for the post.  Officials could not indicate when the service would become available again, but they indicated that no children had been assessed since March 2016 and that the waiting list would be significant.  I have more to say, but I have to share time.<\/p> <p> County Roscommon is a very special case.  Apart from those 132 children, 39 Syrian children are coming to Ballaghaderreen and the Government has informed us that it will have every service in place.  In a small county that will bring the number to almost 200 children who cannot get a service.  I plead with the Minister to approach the Minister for Health to sort out this issue as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800056#JJJ00600","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488999000,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Thomas Byrne for tabling this very important motion on NEPS psychologists.  As we have seen this evening, the assessment-of-need process is completely failing thousands of children who need the appropriate diagnosis and intervention and their educational needs are not being met as a result.  Both Ministers can quote figures for budgetary allocations, but the reality is that children are not getting what they require.  The Ministers have the executive function to change the current system, address the recruitment problems and manage the budgetary allocations properly and prudently in order that we give children the intervention they desperately require.  Quoting statistics means nothing to all of the children with no diagnosis and for whom there is no intervention.  They mean nothing to the parents and children who face a desperate situation every day.  I do not doubt the Ministers' sincerity, but it is important that they stop giving us the Civil Service speak, the statistics and the nonsense.  They need to cut to the chase and address what are serious matters.<\/p>  <p>  From international research, we know that early intervention is the only mechanism to give people a chance of achieving educational attainment.  This is only a diagnostic process in seeking occupational, speech and language therapy and dealing with all of the other issues we have with the HSE.  This is simply about ratifying people's current diagnosis in order that they can access the educational wraparound services and health intervention required.  That is not happening in the current system.<\/p>  <p>  It is all very well to laud the additional spending - nearly &euro;15 billion is being spent on health care services this year.  However, people are on waiting lists and dying because they do not have a diagnosis.  The same is happening in education.  It is possible to spend more, but what does that give parents when their child is not getting an opportunity?  We recently held a referendum to enshrine children's rights in the Constitution, which was a very positive development.  However, the Minister should not stand over a situation where thousands of children are not being given the chance to uphold their educational rights.  It is important to move away from bland statistics and look at the future educational attainment of children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800057#KKK00200","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speech","time":1488999000,"counter":563,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la go l&eacute;ir a thug taca&iacute;ocht don r&uacute;n seo.

This issue first came to my attention in a particularly sharp way when early in my D&aacute;il term the parent of a 15-year old child who could not obtain an educational assessment came to my office in Kells.  This is a child who is well through the education system and has needs that are developing and changing but who cannot gain access.  The parent was at her wits' end.  All of the parents we are meeting in our clinics - presumably they are also going to the clinics of Fine Gael Members - are at their wits' end.  Their children are suffering and if we do not speak out on this issue, try to make a difference and the Government does not deliver, we will be letting the children down and doing the State a disservice.  As I said, this is about upholding and delivering on the constitutional rights of children if we are to have a fair and equal society.<\/p>  <p>  Many other issues which have not been addressed in this debate will, of course, be brought forward in the future.  Extending the NEPS to cover preschool education would be a really positive development, something which many within the sector support.  The way we deal with home tutors at preschool level is scandalous.  I intend to address that issue further with the Minister and it is with the Department of Education and Skills.  It affects a child at the very start of his or her education.<\/p>  <p>  There is an issue with how we treat children who have left secondary school and for whom there is nothing available at third level.  Again, parents are at their wits' end because nothing is being provided and they have to do it for themselves.<\/p>  <p>  As colleagues said, it is all very well for Ministers to quote the spending figures.  As a party, we were rightly criticised for doing this ten years ago.  People did not want to hear it and that is a lesson we learned.  They want delivery on the ground.  They want action and support.  They want the Constitution to be put into practice in how we spend the people's money to deliver services.  That is our role.  We look at the Constitution and the laws and remember that we are a society of individual citizens, all of whom have a role to play and a contribution to make and all of whom have to be looked after.  We will not begrudge people who do well and get to the top of the ladder, but if somebody is struggling to get up the ladder, as a society, we should and certainly we in Fianna F&aacute;il will ensure we will give them every support.  We see it as our duty to do this and highlight injustices.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment process for the NEPS must be expedited.  The Minister must intervene, not in individual appointments but in the process.  He should tell the Public Appointments Service to get its act together and have people employed.  They are willing to work.  Panels have been constituted and suitable psychologists found, but they have not been employed and children continue to suffer.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need for more clarity on the circular, the appeals process, how we deal with complex needs in schools and what is to happen in second level ASD classes.

In A Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government set out its aim to increase access to safe and timely care as close to patients' homes as possible.  We outlined that progressing this objective will be a priority for the partnership Government.  In our programme, we committed to extend the entitlement to a medical card for all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  This initiative was subsequently announced as part of range of health measures included in budget 2017.  This Bill delivers on this important commitment in full, on time and without qualification.<\/p>  <p>  We also committed to reducing prescription charges for medical card holders.  The Bill, which will see the prescription charge reduced for medical card holders over 70 years of age and their dependants, delivers on this commitment for the group most affected by prescription charges.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation has two primary purposes.  First, it will ensure all children currently in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance payment will now receive a medical card.  Up to now, over 33,000 parents were in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance payment for their children but over 9,800 of these children did not qualify for a medical card.  This Bill will rectify this and now all 33,000 children who receive a domiciliary care payment will be entitled to a medical card.  The scheme will be operational from 1 June with the Health Service Executive, HSE, having a paper-based and online pre-registration system in place from 1 May.  This pre-registration will assist in allowing all those who wish to do so to use their new medical cards from 1 June.<\/p>  <p>  There will be several ways in the initial roll-out of the scheme for a child to receive the medical card.  First, for a child in receipt of domiciliary care allowance but who currently does not have a medical card, the parent or guardian will register for the scheme either online or through the paper-based form.  Second, for a child who is currently eligible for a medical card, discretionary or otherwise, and is confirmed to be in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance, the HSE will automatically issue them with a new medical card.  Finally, for a child who is currently eligible for a GP visit card, under discretion or otherwise, this card will automatically be upgraded to a full medical card.<\/p>  <p>  The second purpose of the legislation is to reduce the prescription charge for medical card holders aged 70 years, or older, and for their dependants to &euro;2 per prescription item with a monthly cap of &euro;20 for an individual or family.  This targeted measure, which will cost &euro;12 million in a full year, will benefit nearly 390,000 people.  It is expected to save this group of patients &euro;10 million in 2017.  Deputies will note this reduction has been implemented from 1 March.  I decided, following consultation with the Attorney General, to introduce the reduced charges on an administrative basis by the HSE, pending this legislation, in order that older citizens need not wait.  A circular was issued to pharmacies from the HSE setting out the reduced charges and process.  I take the opportunity to thank the HSE and pharmacies across the country for the swift implementation of this important measure.  In addition, I stress the importance of delivering this legislation in March to place the measure on a statutory basis.  I ask for the support of Deputies and Senators in enabling this benefit for older citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Shortly after I was appointed Minister for Health, I spoke with a campaigner for Our Children's Health outside Government Buildings on my way into the first Cabinet meeting.  Many of us, as public representatives, have been struck by the practical challenges that parents face in meeting the needs of a child with a disability.  As we discussed the issue that day, I came to understand that, for many of these parents, meeting their child's needs was the first time that they had sought assistance from the State.  Children in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance payment are children who the State has considered to have a severe disability under the age of 16 years which requires ongoing care and attention substantially over and above that required by a child of the same age.<\/p>  <p>  Caring for a child with a serious disability is a most difficult, stressful and worrying time.  Dealing with a diagnosis can at times require every ounce of strength from parents.  These parents face many struggles in dealing with a difficult diagnosis.  Accordingly, struggling to access services should not be a further burden that the State adds to them.  That is why we are committed to ensuring all children in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance payment will have access to a medical card.  It will be an automatic entitlement with no reviews or concerns about what further paperwork must be submitted.  This medical card will be an automatic entitlement and will provide security to 33,000 children, along with comfort to their families and carers.  Providing a medical card for these children will alleviate the stress and anxiety of parents in terms of dealing with medical costs associated with their child's disability.  Undoubtedly, it will also relieve some of the financial burden these families have experienced.  It will also ensure they can more easily access health services which their children require.<\/p>  <p>  By virtue of now having a medical card, these children will be eligible for the following services free of charge: inpatient and outpatient hospital, GP care, prescribed drugs and medicines, subject to a co-payment; dental, ophthalmic and aural services; and aids and appliances.  In addition, parents will now not be required to undergo the process of providing family financial information, expert or medical reports and additional supporting information when applying for a medical card.  This was a real burden on parents.  All Deputies know from their constituents the hassle and stress a parent, already busy caring for their child with a disability, encounters when they have to fill out more forms and a note from the HSE seeking a review when they child clearly has a disability and is in need of a medical card.  By providing these children with a medical card without the need for the detail required by the standard application process will ensure a quicker and easier process for parents.<\/p>  <p>  The reduction in the per item and monthly maximum prescription charges will also apply to children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  To ensure all families are treated equally, where there is more than one child in a family in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, and the payment is made to the same parent for each child, the legislation allows that family prescription cap of &euro;20 per month will apply.  The Government is committed to reducing the cost of medicines for patients.  Several actions are currently reducing medicine costs.  Pricing arrangements agreed with industry last year are providing ongoing and increasing savings, both for the taxpayer and for patients in pharmacies.  The list of medicines approved for substitution, allowing pharmacies to dispense the most cost-effective version of a drug to patients, continues to expand.  The introduction of biosimilars, the equivalent of generics for very expensive and complex biologic products, will free up significant resources to allow more people to be treated across the health system.<\/p>  <p>  The commitment to reduce the cost of medicines includes reducing prescription charges for medical card holders.  The prescription charge was introduced in the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2010, to address rising costs in the medical card scheme.  The charge is set by regulation.  The current charge of &euro;2.50 per item, with a monthly cap of &euro;25 per person or family in, was set in 2013.  It reduces the cost of the GMS, General Medical Services, scheme by approximately &euro;120 million a year.  Under the existing legislation, specific groups such as asylum seekers and children in care have been exempted from the prescription charge.  However, while the Act provides for exemptions, it does not allow the charge to be amended for a particular group.  Accordingly, this Bill will identify the over 70s and provide for a lower charge to over 70s and their dependants.<\/p>  <p>  The most effective use of the resources available for reducing the charge, at this stage, is to target a particular group of people who are under greater pressure because of their medical needs.  People aged 70 years and over have higher medication requirements than the general population.  Over 70s patients are just under 20% of the medical card population, but nearly half of the drugs dispensed under the scheme are for over 70s.  I am advised the average number of items dispensed per person over 70 years is seven, compared to two items per person under 70.  In addition, this group are generally on fixed incomes.  Given this, it is fair and just to direct the resources available to reducing the cost of medication for this group.<\/p><p> Budget 2017 announced a reduction in the prescription charges for this group.  The reduction will be from &euro;2.50 to &euro;2 for each prescription item, up to a maximum of &euro;20 per person or family per month, reduced from &euro;25.  I would like to further build on these reductions in prescription charges in future but this first step in reducing prescription charges rightly targets our older citizens, and their dependants, for the variety of reasons I outlined.<\/p> <p> The main provisions of the Health (Amendment) Bill 2017 are as follows.  Section 1 provides a definition for the purpose of reference to the Health Act 1970.  Section 2 provides a definition of who is eligible for full general practitioner and other health services, in this case, the children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  <\/p> <p> Section 3 amends section 59 of the Health Act 1970.  This section provides a definition of those over 70 years and their dependants and those in receipt of domiciliary care allowance access to drugs, medicines and surgical items.  It outlines the charging of fees in respect of prescribed items dispensed by community pharmacy contractors to persons with full eligibility.  <\/p> <p> Section 4 amends section 59 of the Act by inserting a new section, section 59A, into the Act, to allow for the variation of the prescription charge and monthly expenditure cap for over 70s medical card holders.  The current section allows for exemption of specified groups from the charge and for the variation of the charge overall but does not allow for variation of the charge for a specified group.  Section 59A(1) identifies medical card holders aged 70 and over, and their dependants, as the class of persons to whom the section applies.  Section 59A(2) sets the prescription charge for this class of persons at &euro;2 per item.  Section 59A(3) sets the maximum amount of prescription charges payable in a month by this class of persons at &euro;20.  Section 59A(4) provides that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, make regulations to vary the amounts in this section.  It also provides criteria to which the Minister should have regard to when making such regulations.  This will make it easier in the future if one wishes to make further changes regarding the level of charge.  <\/p> <p> Section 5 states the short title of the Act and includes a standard provision relating to commencement of the provisions of the Act. <\/p> <p> I am personally very pleased to bring forward this legislation.  It is our obligation, as the representatives of the citizens of Ireland, to provide ease of access for all to health care.  Providing ease of access to a medical card for this group of people, children with disabilities whose parents are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, is the right and appropriate thing to do.  People have been campaigning for this measure for a long period.  I acknowledge, as I did at the outset, the work of Our Children's Health and that of so many advocacy groups.  It is because of the work of those groups, their campaign, perseverance and important highlighting of this issue that I am on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann introducing this important legislation which I hope will be passed on Second Stage.  We should not underestimate the importance in terms of peace of mind that this Bill can provide to those families.  We do not need a situation where children who are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance are constantly having reviews of their medical card and medical circumstances by the HSE.  This will provide certainty of access to a medical card for as long as a child is in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  It is not only the nearly 10,000 children who will receive a medical card who do not currently have one as a result of this Bill, it is the entirety of the 33,000 who will have certainty that they will be review free once they have a medical card under this legislation while they are in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.<\/p> <p> The legislation will give children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance access to the services that they need, without unsustainable financial burdens on their families.  At the other end of the spectrum we are talking about medical cards for children with disabilities.  The other issue this Bill addresses is prescription charges for those aged over 70 years.  For both the young and the old, this legislation endeavours to make life that little bit easier for those two cohorts of people in society who deserve and require these supports.  <\/p> <p> For me, this is all about people.  It is about looking after the most vulnerable in society.  I am committed to doing everything we can to help those who most need it.  I acknowledge, as I am sure we will hear in this debate, the unanimous and cross-party support for this measure.  This is an issue that nearly every party in this House subscribed to during the general election.  It is one that we are delivering and that we will get over the line, and I hope we will do that as quickly as possible.  I thank everyone who has brought this measure to this point and who campaigned so hard for this.  This is not the answer to all the burdens that families encounter on a regular basis, but we hope it is one little step along the road to making life that little bit easier for a family caring for a child with a disability.  I hope the Bill will receive the support of all Members of this House because it provides support for that vulnerable group of children and also for older people in a very tangible fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800058#LLL00800","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489000200,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I wish to share my time with Deputies Jack Chambers and Eugene Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800059#MMM00200","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1489000200,"counter":575,"content":"<p>That is agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800059#MMM00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1489000200,"counter":576,"content":"<p>We will be supporting the Bill.  We thank the Minister for bringing it to the House in a reasonably timely fashion on foot of the commitments that were made in the programme for Government and the negotiations in that context.  This measure was contained in most parties' manifestos in the run up to last year's general election.  However, that is as far as I can go in welcoming it.<\/p>  <p>  This issue must be viewed against the background of what has been the policy on medical cards generally in recent years.  The Minister spoke about new politics but often this can mask the fact that people may still be entrenched in their views as to what is right and what is wrong with regard to ensuring people, particularly those who most need it, have accessibility to medical care.  Whatever way we decide to fund health services and whatever we decide on universality, we must ensure in the meantime in getting to that point that those who most need health care and the support of the State for access to health care get it first.  I have instanced the issues of people who are sick and children with serious illnesses and rolling provision out from that level.  The concept in this respect that has been pursued for the past few years has beggared belief.  While we still have limited resources, there has been an increase in the overall budget, but we are still rationing health care in the State every day of the week.  Somebody has to do without because somebody else gets what they need.  Until such time that we get to the stage where everybody can get what they need, we have to make decisions and choices on who gets health care and support from the State in accessing health care, who does and does not qualify for a medical card and who qualifies for general practitioner, GP, services.  In that context, when we reflect on an analyse the previous five years, it tells a fairly harrowing story.  I point to that because it is important if we are framing policy and trying to get to a stage where there is universality, that we do it in a humane way that is fair and primarily fair to and supportive of those who need it most.  <\/p>  <p>  People often talk about equality and fairness but there is a big difference between something being equal and it being fair.  We must be honest with ourselves about that and until such time as we get to a stage where everybody can be treated equally we must be fair.  We have not been fair to many thousands of people in recent years in terms of access to medical cards.  To take the example of the discretionary medical card, eventually a compassionate scheme was put in place but it was beaten out of the last Government.  It was incredible to think that week after week following harrowing story after harrowing story, there was an absolute denial that there had been a change in policy.  There had to have been a change in policy because the number of discretionary medical cards decreased to 49,000 and the number of them is now more than 100,000 and yet we were told for a long time that there was no change in policy.  Children with cancer were unable to access a medical card.  Women who were dying of cancer were told that they could not get a medical card.  People requiring end of life palliative care could not get a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  We raised these issues in the D&aacute;il time and again.  I am not reminding the Minister of this to get at him because he is only in office ten months and I will not hold him culpable, but when we are trying to get to a place of equality let us be fair in the meantime and being fair is ensuring that those who need support most get it first until such time as we have enough resources to give it to the others.  That is something I believe was missing in health policy development in recent years with regard to medical cards.  The discretionary element was, to say the least, distasteful in how a system, be it a Government or an administration, could preside over something that was heartless and without feeling.<\/p><p>We simply said \"No\" to people who were dying. Week in, week out, Deputies all across this House, including those on the Government side, raised the issue, yet the whole Administration, the whole system, said there had been no change.  Ministers told me there was not even such a thing as a discretionary medical card, that it did not exist, as quoted in the D&aacute;il by the Minister of State with responsibility for primary care.<\/p> <p> While we wait for the Committee on the Future of Healthcare to publish its report, while we wait perhaps for a health policy from the Government and while we wait for policies from the various Opposition parties, I ask the Minister to put at the heart of our policy the issue of fairness.  If universality is our aspiration or our goal, in the meantime, the pathway must be fair.  To decide to target one age cohort over another is equal but not necessarily fair.  I have had representations from children and families who are still under huge pressure.  They get the exact same as families who can well afford these costs.  We must think clearly about this.  It is welcome that the legislation to make the domiciliary care allowance available is to come before the House.  The targeting of this at children with disabilities is the right concept because it is fair.  However, is it fair to give it to everybody else and not to children with disabilities, or to give them the exact same as everybody else?  I do not think so.<\/p> <p> Regarding decisions to come from the Government, if there are to be any -  I do not mean that in a dismissive way - let us be honest that there are no policies from the Government on health.  There was a general election last year, there were manifestos and negotiations and there is a programme for Government.  However, there are some statements in the programme for Government but no clear, defined policy or vision on health.  We do not know whether the HSE is to be dismantled or retained.  We do not know whether we are moving to hospital trusts or hospital groups or whether they are all being scrapped.  We have no concept of a Government view on health, which is worrying in view of the fact that many people depend on a public health system underpinned by a policy that can in turn be supported by financial means and choices in respect of taxation and funding.  We have none of that.  Nothing has come from the Government in the past year.  Even before last year, policy was chaotic, from universal health insurance to no universal health insurance; from no prescription charges to prescription charges of &euro;2.50; and from marchers on the street saying we will never take medical cards off our over-70s to reducing the threshold from a very high point down to &euro;900 and &euro;500.  All these things did happen and they were all opposite to the stated view at the time and the commitments made.  At least in this area, the commitment made has thankfully been honoured.  This might restore some element of confidence in what one says and what one does, and the public might buy into the concept that we live up to our word in this House.<\/p> <p> Regarding the broader issue of prescription charges, there is no doubt that &euro;2.50, to some people, is not a lot, but to the people paying the &euro;2.50 who are on medical cards, it is a huge sum.  It adds up at the end of the month to &euro;25, which is a substantial amount of money being one tenth of the old age pension for a week.  This is the kind of money we are talking about.  We must therefore put things in context.  When people are drafting or drawing lines on how much we will charge individuals, they should at least take into account their ability to pay, a very simple, basic concept.  However, I am definite that whoever decided to change the charge from 50 cent to &euro;2.50 was not on an old-age pension or a medical card.  If he or she was, there is no way he or she would have asked a person on an old age pension to pay &euro;25 per month for prescription charges to avail of medication.  The concept is simply not that those who have the most pay the most in the context of fairness as opposed to equity.<\/p> <p> When this legislation passes, 33,000 people with disabilities will be on medical cards.  I know that the Minister will consistently say the Government is waiting for the report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare but I wish to raise two issues with him because I want to give my colleagues plenty of time to consider them.  The first concerns the long-term illness scheme.  We have been up and down on this issue but at some stage we will have to consider an imaginative way of addressing it.  I will make proposals as to how this might be done but, in the meantime, the discretionary element will have to be revisited in a more meaningful, compassionate way.  I accept there have been major improvements, for which I give the Minister credit, but there is an issue of long-term illness and people with very serious conditions being unable to access medical cards, even conditions which 30 years ago were unknown or at least in respect of which the research was not as readily available.<\/p> <p> Negotiations between the IMO and the Minister's Department are ongoing, wherever they are going.  I have heard that the National Association of General Practitioners was previously outside the window but is now even further from the window; it cannot even look in now.  The reason I raise this issue is that I am of the firm view - perhaps the Minister should go back and check this with his Department - that his Department officials have no interest in negotiating a major new contract, despite the pretence continuing there.  They are tinkering around the edges with the old contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800059#MMM00400","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489000800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800060#NNN00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1489000800,"counter":579,"content":"<p>If the Minister does not believe me, I am afraid they have pulled the wool over his eyes as well-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800060#NNN00300","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1489000800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800060#NNN00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1489000800,"counter":581,"content":"<p>-----because that is what they are at.

I will start on a positive note.  This is a very good measure, and it is good that all parties across the House are supporting it.  We all campaigned in the general election on a platform of supporting people with disabilities, but particularly giving people in receipt of domiciliary care allowance the full range of primary care services and interventions they require.  This Bill will deliver that for them.  I welcome the fact that they will no longer have a cost impediment to addressing their complex needs in the context of the primary care system.  The Minister stated in his speech that there will not be a charging mechanism in our hospital system for these people.  However, the core issue we have seen in recent weeks is that their complex needs are linked with the relevant interventions, and it is a matter of providing this in the context of our acute hospital system.<\/p>  <p>  As we know, the waiting times are beyond an obscenity.  Delivering on a primary care basis and handing these people cards is one thing, but our core priority should be to deliver on all the other levels within our hospital system.  The Minister has mentioned repeatedly in the press and elsewhere that he has the biggest health care budget ever seen in this country.  However, we need only consider the outcomes for people in terms of their wait times, the acute hospital system and how people with certain diagnostic issues are being left with long-term disabilities because our health system cannot deliver for them.  How much more allocation of money for the health system does Deputy Simon Harris need as Minister to deliver for those people for whom he seeks to deliver medical cards today?  As Deputy Billy Kelleher said, this should have been the first thing the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government delivered for people.  Handing a free GP card to everyone under the age of six was a popular, broad-ranging measure but it did not consider need or means.  When we are apportioning resources in the context of a very difficult health budget, we should prioritise those who have complex needs and those who cannot afford health care.<\/p><p>That is something the Government failed to do in its negotiations with the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, to deliver that previous measure.<\/p> <p> I also welcome the change to the prescription charges.  In 2011 the Government stated it would abolish prescription charges but they multiplied significantly.  It is ethically wrong that the State is profiteering on prescriptions which improve patients' long-term outcomes or keep them alive.  A lady in my constituency spent four weeks in Connolly Hospital because she could not afford the prescription charges.  She receives a non-contributory pension and could not manage her bills or buy her prescription and developed cardiac failure.  She recovered and was discharged but people like her present at emergency departments.<\/p> <p> We need a vision and pathway for the health service.  The Minister has repeatedly referred to the outsourcing of that to the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, which is playing an important role.  The Minister, however, needs to define what system he wants to create and how he sees it in the short to medium term.  We have the biggest health budget ever but the worst delivery.  This Bill contains a welcome measure for those in need.  It does not, however, give any indication of health policy or whether people who cannot pay can be guaranteed the orthopaedic or cardiac intervention or whatever they require without having to wait a significant length of time.<\/p> <p> Deputy Billy Kelleher said during Priority Questions that under the health care legislation people who pay for private health insurance, and have paid their taxes, must in effect pay twice in the public hospital system.  That is a form of double taxation.  It is wrong.  The State is incentivising hospital management to profit from people who pay their insurance.  That needs to change.  However, I welcome the overall thrust of what the Minister is doing tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800060#NNN00600","speaker":"1255","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489001400,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill and the fact that medical cards will be made available to the almost 10,000 children in receipt of the domiciliary allowance.

I hope that in the next week or two weeks the Minister will see that those who need Orkambi will get it.  Regrettably, diabetes in children is also a serious problem.  There are breakthroughs, however, such that parents or whoever cares for children will not have to carry out the prick test, often in the middle of the night, which is stressful and annoying.

We acknowledge that we introduced a charge of 50 cent.  When it went to &euro;2.50 it caused hardship, as I saw among older people in my family.

They cannot be here because they are caring for their children.  I also join the Minister in acknowledging the very good work done by Our Children's Health, which has fought tirelessly.  I am very proud to be one of its supporters.  It deserves credit for bringing this about because it was only through its hard work that the matter got the attention it deserves.<\/p><p>I welcome this legislation and hope we will be in a position to expedite its passage as well as ensuring the provisions of the Bill take effect as quickly as possible.  This is not the first time today that the Minister and I have had a conversation about how quickly things should happen.  This is one of those rare occasions when peace and unanimity will break out in this Chamber because we are all agreed that this measure is important, necessary and should be taken quickly.  <\/p><p>Last year the House passed a Sinn F&eacute;in motion calling for all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance to get an automatic entitlement to a medical card.  I am concerned, however, to read in the legislation and the accompanying press release that parents will not be able to use the new medical card until 1 June 2017, almost a year since that motion and further on from commitments made in manifestos.  It is important that as we discuss this Bill and the welcome provision regarding medical cards we remember that for thousands of families in the State there is no respite.  They have sick children who need care and access to services and they have to battle every single day for their children.  They have waited a long time for this legislation.  They welcomed the programme for Government commitments, the words of the Minister following the passage of the motion last year and the budget 2017 commitment but as they welcomed all of these milestones they still wait for their medical cards.  Last July the Minister said:<\/p><blockquote>I will act and we will act, as I hope will all Members, with a sense of urgency.  The money will be put in place in the budget in October and we will move forward with the legislation.  There are parents currently sitting in the public gallery.  These, and the parents of 11,000 other children, will receive an automatic entitlement to a medical card early in 2017.  That is acting immediately and urgently.<\/blockquote><p>Unfortunately, however, it is not early 2017 when they will get it.  The first of June is the middle of 2017.  What was the delay in drafting the Bill and introducing it to the House when the money was put in place in the budget?  Why is it June 2017?  <\/p><p>It is a blot on our society that for so long we have had a system that withheld medical cards from children with severe disabilities or life-threatening or sometimes terminal conditions.  It is a cruel society that perpetuates a system that tells the parents of a child with such a disability and illness that granting or continuation of a child's medical card depends on those parents jumping through a lot of bureaucratic hoops.  Access to quality health care should be a right and not a concession to be granted, withheld or withdrawn by any Government, Minister or civil servant.  The provision to grant children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance a full medical card is acknowledgement of this fact.  We need to end the two-tier health care system and move towards a system where every person, child, man or woman who needs health care can avail of it.  <\/p><p>I am not alone in having sat down with families to help them work their way through the myriad forms and proof needed to apply for a medical card.  Those people tell us, as legislators, to do whatever is necessary.  Those 9,800 families who will benefit from this legislation can tell us at first hand that the process is both cruel and degrading.<\/p><p>In addition, it happens at a time when parents are least able to handle dealing with bureaucracy.  When one's children are sick, one wants to be at home caring for them.  The last place one wants to be is standing in a queue to photocopy one's P60 for the third, fourth, fifth or sixth time.  Parents who have gone through this would advise us to forget about requiring people to get P45s, P60s, PAYE balancing statements, bank statements, evidence of mortgage payments and everything else that goes along with the current approach.  When a person's illness or disability has been confirmed and a medical need has been established, the State should do everything in its power to help and support him or her.  However, as the Minister knows, that has not been the case.  Many hurdles are put in the way of parents of children with disabilities at the precise time when they are least able to deal with any of those hurdles.<\/p> <p> When this House debated a Sinn F&eacute;in motion on this issue last year, I told the Minister about baby R&eacute;ilt&iacute;n, who was a very sick little girl.  I had spoken to baby R&eacute;ilt&iacute;n's mother, who was facing a bureaucratic nightmare involving mountains of paperwork.  I am a mother but I do not presume to have any monopoly on sympathy, experience or anything like that.  After my daughter was born and when she was still small, I would not have been fit to write my own name, never mind fill out all the paperwork baby R&eacute;ilt&iacute;n's mother had to go through.  Thankfully, she got her medical card very soon after her case was discussed here.  The current system is not right.  It is cruel.  We need to move towards a system that shows respect, decency and compassion to people who are sick and who need to use our health service.  We have to put an end to the disturbing and insensitive practice that requires people with life-limiting illnesses and permanent disabilities to respond to review after review, despite the ongoing progression of their illnesses and the reality that there will be no recovery for them.  Some people with terminal illnesses cannot get medical cards.  As the Minister knows, there is no such thing as recovering from a terminal illness.<\/p> <p> The Minister might argue that my criticism of the delay in this legislation and the wait for the day when it will come into operation and parents will be able to use these medical cards is an example of the Opposition playing politics on a positive news day, but far from it.  The importance of a medical card, in terms of the quality of life and quality of care given to children, cannot be fathomed by those of us who are fortunate to have good health and no caring responsibilities.  The delay in bringing this long-promised proposal to fruition is having a real impact on people's lives.  I remind the House that medical cards cover the cost of things like GP visits, medication and aids and appliances.  It can cause grave hardship for someone to be dealt the blow that he or she, or his or her child or loved one, needs a range of aids or medicines to deal with a diagnosis.  This is in addition to the difficulties associated with the illness or disability itself.  These circumstances can be absolutely catastrophic for the mental well-being of those involved.  It can be nearly impossible for someone who is unable to get a medical card because his or her household is on or just over the income threshold to get access to these services.  The drawn-out wait for these services piles more worry and pressure on families that are already heading towards breaking point.<\/p> <p> The medical card is a passport to gaining automatic access to a range of community-based and primary care services.  This is a particularly challenging position to be in if one has a complex condition requiring ongoing multidisciplinary support in the community.  As the Minister knows from his meetings with representatives of Our Children's Health, the medical card process is torture in slow motion for worn-out parents.  It involves constant form-filling and endless reviews, rejections and appeals.  Although this proposal will go live in June, the parents to whom I refer would like it to be a matter of urgency tonight.  Will there be any flexibility in the interim period to enable the 9,800 children involved to access the services, aids, appliances and supports that come with a medical card?  In light of the stated aim and purpose of the legislation before the House, I ask the Minister to give a commitment that he will ensure these children are able to get the medical services they need while their parents wait for the official date of 1 June 2017.<\/p> <p> What is the reason for the difference between the figure presented last year and the figure presented last week?  The Minister advised us last July that 11,000 children would be affected by this Bill, but he has said today that the correct figure is 9,800.  Where have the other 1,200 children and their families gone?  Is it the case that having fought tooth and nail in the interim period, they have received medical cards?  Has the wait been too long for some of these very sick children?  I would also like to ask about the operation of the scheme.  Will the Minister confirm that when parents register for the scheme online, by means of a paper-based form or otherwise, there will be no delay in issuing medical cards?  There should not be any slippage between saying it in here and making it a reality for parents as they watch the postbox.  Will the Minister ensure the necessary resources and personnel are in place to process these registrations as quickly as possible?  He must ensure no further unnecessary ordeal is visited on these families by further bureaucracy or delays in processing their medical cards.  Similarly, I urge the HSE and the Department of Health to ensure a high-profile public campaign is launched.<\/p> <p> This legislation is welcome.  We need to ensure the smooth passage of the Bill through the legislative process so that these measures can be put in place without further delay.  That will be the true measure of the success of this initiative.  The Minister will forgive me if I withhold my congratulations until the 9,800 children he mentioned receive their medical cards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800061#OOO00300","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489002000,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the Second Stage debate on the Health (Amendment) Bill 2017, which provides for two key advances in health care delivery, each of them potentially leading to greater or even more important developments in the provision of health care in this country.  First, the Bill provides for the automatic granting of a full medical card to every child in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  This will have a welcome impact on the lives of 9,800 children and their parents when it comes into effect on 1 June 2017.  The second measure will have a small but welcome impact on the monthly budgeting of households of citizens over the age of 70, and their dependants where applicable.  Both of these measures were promised in the programme for Government.  I welcome the presentation of this Bill and its implementation that will follow its successful passage through these Houses.  The granting of a full medical card to all children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance is an important step.  I hope it will lead to a universal health care system in this country that is free at the point of delivery and is paid for through direct and fair taxation.<\/p>  <p>  Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment that is made in respect of children up to 16 years of age who have severe disabilities that require continuous care and attention over and above what a child of comparable age would normally require.  Some 33,000 parents are currently receiving domiciliary care allowance each month.  More than 20,000 of their children already have medical cards.  This Bill will extend that entitlement to almost 10,000 children whose parents are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance but who have not qualified for medical cards to date.  All children whose parents are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance will now qualify for a full medical card, irrespective of family means.<\/p>  <p>  I have been advocating the extension of medical card entitlement to all such children for a long time.  This has been a core proposition in a series of Sinn F&eacute;in election manifestos and in our alternative budget proposals.  In December 2015, when I was still my party's health spokesperson, I introduced our new health policy document in which we urged that this critical advance be made and undertook to introduce it if we were in government.  When I did so, I was mindful of the needs of severely challenged children and their parents.  I was particularly mindful of the case made by the Our Children's Health campaign group, which was launched in May 2014 by families affected by illness and disability with first-hand experience of the struggle to secure and retain medical cards for their children.  Its primary aim is \"to ensure children with serious medical need are no longer subjected to the crude, unfair, lengthy and frustrating means test in order to be considered for a medical card\".<\/p><p>The campaign has condemned the onerous application process, the exclusive focus on financial hardship and the failure to take account of medical need and the impact of a serious medical condition on a child and its family.  Our Children's Health has argued:<\/p><blockquote>We cannot continue to have a situation whereby children with the most serious medical need coming from ordinary families with modest incomes and huge outgoings remain ineligible.  This is simply wrong and unjustifiable.<\/blockquote><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has long argued that the Department of Social Protection's domiciliary care allowance, operated until 2009 by the Health Service Executive, provides an example of an assessment model on which a new medical card eligibility test could be based in that it is independent of both financial means and diagnosis titles.  Eligibility would be based on reaching a threshold of care needs.<br\/><br\/>The horror stories of seriously ill children being refused medical cards and the lengths to which distressed parents have been forced to go to apply for medical cards have continued to this very day.  Today is but a start and stepping stone towards a universal health care system, as I stated.  The Government must introduce and implement a schedule for the extension of full medical cards to people with serious illness and disabilities without a means test, and not only focused on the primary measure in this legislation.  The Government is extending a full medical card to every child qualifying for the domiciliary care allowance and, despite the long years lost, I say &quot;well done&quot;.  I mean that sincerely.  I also say with great sincerity that the Government should now take the next steps.<br\/><br\/>We should legislate for a distinct new medical need ground for eligibility for the medical card with an associated application route, using the domiciliary care assessment framework as a model.  That is an assessment involving the establishment of a threshold of medical need and not tested against a household's financial means or diagnosis titles.  We should then invite applications to this distinct application process for a card that would be reviewed at intervals informed by the recommendation of the medical assessor.  This new route would be open to applicants of all ages but any child who has been granted the domiciliary care allowance would gain the card automatically, as we are providing for now.  Medical cards awarded on this new ground would not be impacted by changes to employment status or income.  This is essential as otherwise the medical card system will continue to trap people with disabilities in unemployment and poverty.  This would initially result in a further 14,500 cards meeting the health care needs of a further cohort of deserving people challenged by disability and serious medical needs on top of the 9,800 additional cards provided for in terms of the domiciliary care allowance.  Ultimately, all of this should lead to universal health care.<br\/><br\/>In the last couple of minutes remaining in my slot I will address the second matter the Bill provides for, the reduction in prescription charges for medical card holders over 70 years old.  I remember very well as a health spokesperson before my very able and esteemed colleague arrived.  She has been performing this role with great verve and capacity over the past 12 months.  I remember very well being on these benches when the Minister's predecessor, the deputy leader of Fine Gael, was an Opposition spokesperson on health, as I was myself.  Prescription charges were introduced at 50 cent and that was the position when the Minister's party went into Government in 2011.  Senator Reilly, then a Deputy, was an able spokesperson on health in opposition and I will not go further than that.  Like any of us here in those days, he articulated fierce opposition to prescription charges and not just for those aged over 70.  However, as the record shows, Fine Gael and Labour introduced a fivefold increase in this charge from 50 cent to &euro;2.50.  All these years later, the Government has decided to reduce the charge by 50 cent but only for those aged over 70.  What of everyone below 70 years of age, who must continue to pay &euro;2.50 per item up to a &euro;25 maximum per month?  Why not extend this reduction to all medical card holders and why not remove the charge entirely?  We should be done with it, as the former Minister and deputy party leader, Senator Reilly, so strenuously argued for here in this Chamber not all that many years ago.  I encourage the Minister to do it.<br\/><br\/>We will support the passage of this Bill in the hope that it will be followed by the further steps that can and should be taken, bringing us ultimately to the introduction of a national health care service across our land.  I use those words with purpose.  That is a worthy goal and a real and proud legacy for all of us to leave for future generations.  If the Minister says he will do it and he means it, we will work with him every step of the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800062#PPP00200","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489002600,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I will also support the Bill as it is the start of progress.  Reducing the prescription charge from &euro;2.50 to &euro;2 for those aged over 70 years and capping it at &euro;20 per month is a start, although a very small start.  When this prescription charge was introduced in 2010, it was 50 cent and it was meant to reduce unnecessary taking of drugs where people were getting drugs under a medical card and not using them.  The 50 cent charge was a disincentive to asking a pharmacist for drugs.  However, as time passed, the charge went from 50 cent to &euro;2.50.  If memory serves correctly, the Fine Gael Party campaign in the 2011 general election said the party would abolish the prescription charge but when the now Senator James Reilly came into ministerial office, he increased it incrementally, year on year, until it reached the level of &euro;2.50 per item.  That is a substantial burden on patients where it was not that people were getting unnecessary medication, but they stopped getting necessary medication.  That had untold consequences for the health service as people not taking their medication ended up in hospital.  Although it was set up as a deterrent, it ended up being a method of revenue collection, which amounted to a negative health policy.<\/p>  <p>  It is good that this is being reversed and, as the Minister notes, it will apply first to those who use medication most, those over 70 years old.  The &euro;2.50 charge is substantial for any patient on a medical card, which they have because they have been means tested.  This is not a wealthy cohort of society but these people are being charged &euro;2.50 for each item.  There are people under 70 years who are not getting their medication because of the charge for prescriptions.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referenced generic drugs and the savings they bring to the health service.  There is a caveat in that generic drugs may have equal bioavailability but they do not have equal constituents.  Many patients suffer side effects from generic drugs and 10% of hospital admissions are related to iatrogenic illness, meaning it is caused by side effects of drugs.<\/p><p>It has increased since generic drugs were introduced.  They are not equivalent and many people suffer side effects.  One patient of mine went through investigations for nine months before it was eventually discovered that the medication he had been prescribed, in a generic manner, on discharge from hospital was not the same medication as he received when he entered hospital.  He had a substantial illness because of it.  I could cite many other cases.<\/p> <p> I commend the Minister for introducing the domiciliary care allowance measure.  It is a very progressive provision.  However, as Deputy Billy Kelleher said, these are people who should have had a medical card long before now.  When I worked as a GP, it never ceased to amaze me when I wrote prescriptions for people with substantial disabilities and they told me they had no medical cards.  It was unbelievable.  Although it is late, it is very welcome.<\/p> <p> Disabilities put substantial pressure on patients, children and their families.  There is a substantial unmet need among people with disabilities.  This will address some of it.  There is financial stress involved in looking after a person with disabilities.  Access to aids and appliances was a huge barrier for people with disabilities.  Not only could they not get drugs, they could not get the aids and appliances they needed to help them cope with their disabilities.  Disability is a long term condition; it does not come and go.  Obliging patients to go under constant review to retain their medical cards up to now was unjust.<\/p> <p> The Minister's policy on medical cards must also be reviewed.  We have discussed it at length at the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare, where we are trying to devise a system which is fair, equitable and based on need rather than the ability to pay.  We must address all these issues regarding medical cards.  Discretionary medical cards are also a major issue as is the granting of medical cards to patients who have cancer.  One has to be terminally ill with cancer in order to get a medical card, and that is very unjust.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800063#QQQ00200","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489003200,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I too am pleased the Bill has been introduced.  My colleagues and I made this a very high priority, as did Fianna F&aacute;il in the discussions for Government.  It could not come too soon.  It is well overdue.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  During the previous D&aacute;il, the Technical Group, of which the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I were members, tabled a motion to improve auxiliary care services in 2012.  The motion called on the Government, among other things, to reform the domiciliary allowance system immediately by returning the administration of the system to the Department of Health where it belonged and insisting medical assessors were competent to assess the medical information submitted and were on the relevant specialist register, for example, paediatrics or child psychology.  It is very important.  There is nothing worse than parents of sick children who live with them 24\/7 and who want the best for them to have them assessed by people who do not understand the difficulties, issues and intricacies of their conditions.  Deputy Michael Harty would understand it far better than I.<\/p>  <p>  We asked that all decisions on domiciliary care allowance applications and existing claims be made by child protection or disability social workers.  We also asked that domiciliary care allowance applicants and recipients be given access to all documentation held regarding their claims upon request and within a reasonable timeframe.  There have been serious blockages, delays and stifling and frustrating of applicants.  It is part of what the HSE is good at.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will provide children with disabilities who are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance with automatic entitlement to a medical card.  It is a major step and was badly needed and I compliment the Government on it.  However, like other speakers said, we will be policing it day by day.  We cannot have any more delays.  It has to happen.  It is already years too late.  Under the former Minister for Health, now Senator James Reilly - \"Calamity James\" as I used to call him - HSE officials were writing to parents of sick children, even children with Down's syndrome, to ask whether they still had the condition.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, knows all about it.  How hurtful and unfortunate it was.  Are the people who sent these letters heartless, illiterate or what to send such heartless, uncaring letters?<\/p>  <p>  The Bill follows on from a commitment made in the budget in October 2016.  The Bill will benefit more than 9,000 children who are not eligible for a medical card.  My late brother was a paediatrician of renown in Tipperary.  Like Deputy Michael Harty, he was astounded to see people come into the surgery who did not have medical cards and who had to fight tooth and nail for them.  All the Deputies have constituents who are seriously ill with cancer and all kinds of illnesses who are begging, striving, scrounging, scraping, filling in forms and putting in this and that claim to get a medical card.  Once they have a serious illness, they should be entitled.  The frustration and stress is enough to make them sick, never mind affect them when they are under serious threat and trying to recover.<\/p>  <p>  The parent or guardian of a child in receipt of domiciliary care allowance but who does not have a medical card will register for the scheme online or through a paper form.  Many people in rural Ireland cannot go online.  They have no line to go on, because we have no broadband.  For a child who is currently eligible for a medical card, discretionary or otherwise, and is in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, the HSE will automatically issue him or her with a medical card.  I will believe it when I see it.  All those measures are very welcome, even if they are coming five years after the motion by the former Technical Group was proposed.  It is better late than never: do not look a gift horse in the mouth.  It has to happen and I am holding the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, responsible.  He recently came to Tipperary with a colleague of mine offering this, that and the other to very sick children.  I will hold him accountable for that too.  We need it to be delivered.  We need the Minister of State in the Cabinet with his Independent colleagues.  Along with the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, and the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, he was part of the Technical Group in 2012.  Put your money where your mouth is.  We expect delivery.  We cannot have these sick children or their parents waiting any longer.  The parents become ill themselves due to the trauma and stress.<\/p>  <p>  I supported the prescription charge of 50 cent for reasons to which Deputy Michael Harty and others alluded.  However, the HSE saw that it was working well and decided to multiply it.  All the HSE seems to do is bleed people for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800064#RRR00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1489003200,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I fully support the Bill, which will allow for some the provisions of budget 2017 to be introduced.  I fully support the provision of a medical card to all children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  Domiciliary care allowance is granted to children aged under 16 years with a severe disability who require ongoing care and attention substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  Children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance are some of the most vulnerable children in our society and it is only right that we provide them and their families with as much assistance as possible.<\/p>  <p>  More often than not, a child who qualifies for domiciliary care allowance also has complex medical needs and, therefore, parents are burdened with high medical bills.  The introduction of medical cards for all children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, regardless of means, will be a great relief to many parents and families.  In line with this, I urge the Government to introduce medical cards to all adults diagnosed with cancer.  I ask that the Minister make this his priority in the next budget.  In the past year, I have come across numerous constituents, many of them just over the income threshold, who have been diagnosed with cancer and who are struggling greatly to pay for their medical bills.  At a time when they are at their weakest and trying to fight this awful disease, they are burdened with trying to fill out paperwork and prove their eligibility for a medical card.  This causes extreme stress and undoubtedly interferes with their recovery.  We all have people calling into our constituency offices with serious cancer issues who have been refused a medical card.  It could not be more heartless in a desperate time for these people.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the reduction in prescription charges for medical card holders over 70 years of age.  It is great to see a reduction of 50 cent per item down to &euro;2 and the maximum monthly cost reduced by &euro;5 down to &euro;20 per person or family.  It is a positive step towards eliminating the charge in the future, for which I commend the Government.  The reduction shows the Government's support for one of the most vulnerable groups in our society and it will, no doubt, reduce elderly poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800064#RRR00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1489003200,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I too welcome the Bill to ensure children who are in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance receive a medical card automatically.<\/p><p>It is well known that parents with responsibility for a very sick child, who will be sick for many years, have enough to do and have other problems to get over every day, when they are landed with this noose around their necks.  Why has this measure taken so long since it was announced in the budget so many months ago? Those people have been looking forward to this since.  I hope there will not be much further delay and it can be progressed as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> The reduction in prescription charges is also very welcome.  As Deputy Michael Harty has said, many people had to forego some medication because they could not afford the charges.  When we talk about medical cards there are many issues that need to be resolved, but there is one issue in particular I have come across many times.  It is where many people do not apply for a medical card until they get sick or until the day they go into hospital.  Panic sets in because they know they do not have the funds to pay the hospital.  They fill out their card application form and send it away.  In due course, they get their card, but they may have already left the hospital two or three weeks prior to receiving the card.  They are billed by the hospital and they must pay that bill, even though they subsequently receive the medical card.<\/p> <p> I am asking for this matter to be reviewed.  If a person is entitled to the card then it should at least be in force from the day a person applies for it, or maybe even further back.  People do not expect to get sick and they do not take the precaution of looking for the medical card even though they are entitled to it.  As many people do not do this, I ask that the matter could be looked at to see if some fairness could apply to those people.  I have been involved in a number of cases where people had to pay the hospital and there was no way in the world could they get out of it.  They actually had to borrow money from the credit union to pay the bills.<\/p> <p> My next point is possibly unrelated to the topic we are speaking about.  I am aware that the Kerry Cork health link bus, which takes people to Cork University Hospital, is on the road every day.  The bus needs to be replaced.  The operator needs to buy another bus but must pay VAT on the new bus.  This is very unfair and I say to the Government it is collecting enough VAT from every other person in the State so please do not charge those people who provide a service that takes patients for cancer treatment to Cork, or to any other hospital.  People should not have to pay for VAT on a vehicle such as this.  I ask that this could be looked at to ensure the matter is addressed.  It is very unfair.  The Kerry Cork health link bus provides a great service for people who do not have a car or cannot drive a car themselves.  I ask that the matter be looked into and addressed appropriately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800064#RRR00400","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489003800,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I invite Deputy Bernard J.

I have been in constant contact with my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, since he first announced last year that he would be bringing this Bill before the House.  It will provide all children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance an automatic entitlement to a full medical card.  There will now be a clear entitlement for those children to a full medical card.  The Bill will also reduce prescription charges for medical card holders who are aged over 70 years and also for their dependants.<\/p>  <p>  On numerous occasions in the past I have said in this House and in the media that I firmly believe that any child in receipt of domiciliary care allowance must get a medical card automatically and without delay.  I am in constant contact with my constituents from all over County Louth and I assure Deputies that the introduction of this legislation will be a huge relief for them.  They will no longer have to go through the whole means tested route in order to get a medical card to which they should be entitled.  The whole application process of providing family financial information, expert and medical reports and additional supporting information was, and is, a terrible burden on parents when all they were seeking was a medical card for their child.  It beggars belief that up to now a child could receive domiciliary care allowance but in some cases was refused a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  I will now turn to the current application process for a medical card.  The system is too cumbersome and bureaucratic.  It is one of the issues that my constituency office in Dundalk spends most time dealing with.  The application process takes far too long.  I also have many difficulties with the procedure of assessing medical evidence.  I have lost count of the number of times an application has been refused yet is granted on appeal.  This extra time is another period of worry and stress for the applicant, when it is clear from the medical evidence provided that the person is entitled to a medical card.  I know that in the past the Minister has raised questions around the process and he has stated publicly that there are limitations to the system.  He has also stated that the Committee on the Future of Healthcare will examine the matter and will play a key role in any future changes to the system.  I hope the Minister will look at this aspect of the medical card process and that in the near future we will see a simpler and more transparent system of assessing medical card applications.<\/p>  <p>  I was amazed to find out that currently one in three children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance does not hold a medical card.  How could this have been allowed to happen for so long? It is not right that these children were not automatically given a medical card.  In my constituency work in Louth I, like many of my colleagues, see on a daily basis the challenges faced by parents in looking after a child with a severe disability.  I agree with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, when he said recently that in many cases parents who applied for domiciliary care allowance had never before requested help from the State for their child or children.  It is important that we recognise this fact and make people aware of the sacrifices these families make on a daily basis.  We must fully support parents of children with disabilities in order that they can access the services required to ensure their quality of life is improved.<\/p>  <p>  We must use an improving economy and the improving tax receipts to benefit all in society.  Some 12 months ago the electorate told Deputies that we must improve public services as a priority.  We must invest more in the health, education and social welfare systems.  I believe people would prefer to see increased spending on public services as opposed to tax cuts.  These extra resources must be spent on those who need it most.  I am particularly pleased this measure is finally getting approval from the House.  There is no doubt that those children and their families who are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance not only deserve a full medical card but should always have been automatically entitled to it.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted that the Minister has brought this Bill to the House but I hope this is only the start of new measures.  I would like to see a more simplified process introduced for medical card applications, particularly for those with strong medical evidence to back up their claim.<\/p>  <p>  I will outline the main features of the Bill for the benefit of those who have been following this topic.  The Health (Amendment) Bill 2017 will provide all 33,000 children who are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance full eligibility to a medical card.  Parents will be able to apply for medical cards on behalf of the child or children from 1 May 2017 and the medical card will be available to use from the 1 June 2017.  With regard to changes to prescription charges the Bill will reduce the cost of a prescription from &euro;2.50 to &euro;2 per item and will cap the monthly amount at &euro;20, which was previously &euro;25.  This reduction was introduced on 1 March and will benefit 390,000 people.<\/p>  <p>  I had the pleasure of welcoming the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, to the Louth County Hospital in August 2016.  The Minister was very impressed with the hospital, its staff and the services it provides to the community.  During that visit the Minister indicated that he intended making the minor injuries unit accessible to all children over the age of six years.  Currently the unit will only treat children aged 14 years and over.  Perhaps the Minister will confirm a timeframe for this change which would allow all children over the age of six years to be treated in the minor injuries unit at Louth County Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800065#SSS00400","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1489004400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Like other speakers, I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this important legislation.

At last and at least, in this particular situation, we now see some recognition of the things we would like to do when in opposition, and we have an opportunity to have some little influence of a positive nature on the well-being and livelihood of families who are dependent on what we do.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Harty and others made reference to the administration of the medical card system.  I accept it leaves a lot of room for improvement, although I am not criticising anybody, one way or the other, except to simply say this.  If a person is suffering from a serious illness, he or she has enough problems in his or her life without having to get proof in written or graphic form to say, \"Your end is nigh\", or words to that effect.  That should not be the case.  It should be a simple thing to be able to say, within reason, that this person deserves a medical card because of his or her situation and illness.  I know the HSE will say to us there is no automatic right to a medical card because of the seriousness of the illness.  However, there is always discretion and one can always use common sense to come to a conclusion that it is in the interests of those in receipt of medication or of surgery, instead of having to wait what could be a huge length of time to them.  We should always remember, when wearing the other person's shoes, that to those who are in pain or in doubt about their health, and those with a serious health problem, even a short time is much more magnified and serious, and has a much more debilitating effect on them.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that, in the context of the reforms that are taking place, which are of a positive nature, we can do something about this issue.  This is particularly the case in regard to the spot checks where the person's card is due for renewal and they get a form to tell them, \"It has come to our attention your circumstances have changed\", when no such change has taken place.  Every Member of this House knows this, and we have all dealt with such cases.  When it is pursued further, we find it is a spot check.  If there is a spot check for that purpose, the simple thing would be to do the spot check first without taking away the medical card and leaving the person waiting.  The obvious thing is to leave the person in possession of their card.  All we do is create unnecessary hardship for people in those circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  This is a positive move which I welcome.  The House will not be surprised when I reveal I intend to vote for the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister of State for the work done.  We hope this is the first of many items of recognition for the people who are deserving in our society, given we did not have a whole lot to give them in the past few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800066#TTT00500","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1489004400,"counter":603,"content":"<p>On a point of order, I point out that Deputy Bernard J.

Durkan, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Billy Kelleher and all the other Deputies for their contributions to the Second Stage debate on the Health (Amendment) Bill 2017.  The Government is committed to delivering on the aims to increase access to safe, timely care, as close to patients&rsquo; homes as possible, as set out in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  Let us remember it is a partnership Government.  The Independent Alliance is making a very positive contribution in regard to these issues, including this legislation, domiciliary care allowance and the prescription charges, on which we had a major input.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill has two parts, first, to extend automatic entitlement to a medical card to all children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance and, second, to reduce prescription charges for medical card holders over 70 years and their dependants.  This is a positive development.  It is a good news story and it is doing something for the members of society, particularly the weaker sections of society.  As Members know, children who are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance are children under the age of 16 years who are considered to have a severe disability and who require ongoing care and attention substantially over and above that required for a child of the same age.  Many families are in that position - I understand the figure is in the region of 9,800.  This new legislation will mean that all children in respect of whom a domiciliary care allowance payment is made will automatically qualify for a medical card and, therefore, no longer be subject to the medical card means test at any point in the future while in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  This is a positive and constructive development but it is also a major step in regard to the rights of all people with a disability.  That is part of my project in regard to services for people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  We recognise the added stress that parents are faced with when dealing with a difficult diagnosis.  For many of these parents, it is their first time seeking assistance from the State.  I hope, by providing an automatic medical card for these children, it will relieve some of the financial burden these families face and provide easier access to the health services their children need.  This is a positive development because we need to ensure the weaker sections of society are protected.  Like many of my colleagues who spoke in this debate, I believe that is a core ambition and should be a core value of anybody who is elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  While we are discussing domiciliary care allowance and other services for people with disabilities, I want to note that the social care disability services plan for 2017 represents a historic investment in disability services after many years of cuts to services.  For example, following my negotiations with the HSE for the disability sector, in budget 2017 we will be spending &euro;1.688 billion, an increase of 6%, on disability services.<\/p><p>What does this mean for the person on the ground?  It means 8,400 residential places, 182,000 respite overnights, 1.4 million personal assistant hours for 2,400 people, 24,800 day places, 41,000 day respite sessions and 2.75 million home support hours for 7,500 people.  <\/p> <p> Another issue that came up when I took office was that every single year we had a crisis in dealing with emergency cases.  I have managed to secure &euro;16.2 million to support 395 people.  The breakdown means that there has been the provision of 185 new emergency places, 210 new home supports and respite for emergency cases.  There is to be &euro;10 million for New Directions which includes school leavers and which will support 1,500 people.  <\/p> <p> The House is aware of the move from congregated settings.  There will be &euro;100 million for a capital programme over five years.  That means that this year 223 people will be moved to community living and that 50 additional homes will be purchased.  I mention those issues because they are very relevant.  <\/p> <p> Another issue that is very relevant with regard to the disability service plan is what came up earlier today about the Grace case - the issue of protecting vulnerable people.  Earlier in the debate I did not have the opportunity to highlight the services that had been put in place in the past few years.  We now have a national policy on safeguarding vulnerable persons at risk of abuse.  We have an excellent national safeguarding committee, with an independent chairperson, Ms Patricia Rickard Clarke.  We have also seen the national quality improvement programme, the national volunteer advocacy programme and the establishment of a family working group with Inclusion Ireland, an organisation that works with people with disabilities.  What is more important for families is the appointment of a confidential recipient, Ms Leigh Gath.  Through these measures, we are trying to ensure protection through the disability services.<\/p> <p> Another of the Government's commitment is to reduce the cost of medicines for Irish patients who have been hammered in recent years by high costs.  As stated, this includes a reduction of prescription charges for medical card holders.  Budget 2017 included a commitment to reduce prescription charges for medical card holders aged over 70 years and their dependants.  This issue is addressed in the second part of this legislation.  While the prescription charge was introduced in the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2010, the Act does not allow it to be amended for a particular group.  This Bill identifies the over 70s, for whom it provides for a lower charge and for their dependants.  After all, it is a small way of saying, \"Thank you,\" for the services and taxes they have paid during the years to the State, particularly during tough times.  I am happy to note that this measure has been implemented on an administrative basis since 1 March 2017 and will benefit approximately 390,000 people.  However, I stress once again the importance of delivering on this legislation to place the measure on a statutory basis.  I ask all Deputies to continue their support for this important legislation.  I look forward to further constructive examination of the Bill on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800066#TTT01100","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1489005000,"counter":610,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health (Amendment) Bill 2017: Referral to Select Committee","time":1489005000,"counter":611,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800067#UUU00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1489005000,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Health pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 149(1).<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800067#UUU00400","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1489005000,"counter":613,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Suspended Sentences of Imprisonment) Bill 2016 [Seanad]: Order for Report Stage","time":1489005000,"counter":614,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800067#UUU00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1489005000,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Report Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800067#UUU00700","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1489005000,"counter":616,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Suspended Sentences of Imprisonment) Bill 2016 [Seanad]: Report and Final Stages","time":1489005000,"counter":617,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800067#UUU00900"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1489005000,"counter":618,"content":"<p>Bill received for final consideration and passed.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Bill 2016: Order for Report Stage","time":1489005000,"counter":619,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800067#UUU01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1489005000,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Report Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800067#UUU01200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1489005000,"counter":621,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Bill 2016: Report and Final Stages","time":1489005000,"counter":622,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800067#UUU01400"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1489005000,"counter":623,"content":"<p>Bill received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1489005000,"counter":624,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill do now pass.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1489005000,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank the House for giving of its time to consider this relatively short but significant legislation.  As explained on Second Stage, its primary purpose is to give effect to provisions of Directive 2013\/40\/EU on attacks against information systems.  The Bill will also give effect to many of the key provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, the Budapest convention.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation reflects the EU directive in that it provides for criminal offences in relation to attacks against information systems and their data and establishes effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for such offences, the most serious of which could result in a term of imprisonment of up to ten years.  The offences provided for relate to information systems and data and do not cover content-related matters.  The Bill mainly creates new offences relating to the unauthorised accessing of information systems; unauthorised interference with information systems or data on such systems; unauthorised interception of transmissions of data to or from information systems; and the use of tools such as computer programmes, passwords or devices to facilitate the commission of these offences relating to information systems.  The primary offences are set out in sections 2 to 7, inclusive, of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The term \"information system\", as defined in the Bill, is deliberately broad, encompassing all devices involved in the processing and storage of data, not only those considered to be \"computer systems\" in the traditional sense.  This reflects the range of modern communications and data storage technology available such as tablets and smartphones.  Information systems also encompass the IT infrastructure or networks that support communication systems and individual devices, as well as data.  The term \"data\" is also circumscribed broadly in the Bill as meaning any representation of facts, information or concepts in a form capable of being processed and includes a programme capable of causing an information system to perform a function.<\/p>  <p>  Information systems are very much part of our daily lives in the modern world.  They are increasingly relied upon by governments, businesses and individual citizens alike.  This reliance on modern technology can also, unfortunately, mean vulnerability, as new technology creates opportunities for new forms of crimes, or at least an online version of crimes, perpetrated in cyberspace but with a very real impact on the ground.  It is vital, therefore, that we seek to protect modern information and communication systems and also maintain users' confidence in the safety and reliability of such systems.  This legislation ensures unlawful activity related to information systems will be criminalised and that strong penalties will be in place to both deter and punish offenders.<\/p>  <p>  I will mention at this stage that it may be necessary on Committee Stage in the Upper House to make a technical amendment to section 9 of the Bill which deals with liability offences by corporate bodies.  If that is required, the Bill will return briefly to Committee Stage in this House with a view to having the amendment approved.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for their generous support for the Bill.  It is short but nonetheless important legislation.  It is notably the first piece of legislation in this jurisdiction specifically dedicated to combating cybercrime and protecting information systems and their data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800067#UUU01700","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1489005000,"counter":626,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill 2017: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1489005000,"counter":627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800067#UUU01900"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1489005000,"counter":628,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1489005000,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I wish to speak very briefly about the Bill.  I do not have a lot to say that has not been said.  This is a Bill in which I have a particular interest having followed it in my previous ministry - the Department of Health.<\/p><p>When it was first proposed as an idea I was somewhat sceptical because I was concerned that it might encourage drug use, encourage more people to use heroin and other illegal drugs.  Having looked at the matter and studied it, this really falls into the category of harm reduction.  It is about reducing harm and ensuring that people who are going to inject anyway have a safe place to do so.  They can use needles that are safe, thus reducing the transmission of blood-borne infections such as HIV.<\/p> <p> In addition, if something goes wrong, medical help is nearby to ensure that the user does not overdose.  I understand from the contributions of the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, that no one has ever died in a supervised injecting facility, probably because these facilities are available.<\/p> <p> The project does something else that is important and valuable.  People who are hard to reach and who are not likely to engage with addiction services are at least registered.  In this way, they become exposed to and begin to interact with services that might be available.  This increases the chances that they might someday get into a rehabilitation or maintenance programme.<\/p> <p> For all these reasons this is timely legislation.  I welcome it and recognise the work of the officials in the Department of Health in bringing it forward.  The former Minister of State, Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, started the process and the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, has brought it to this Stage.  That is important and I express my support for it.

Mr. Tony Duffin and others have been before the Joint Committee on Health in recent years to explain the concept.<\/p>  <p>  Like many others, I did not have a great understanding of the concept or what it did in terms of harm reduction.  It ensures people have a safe place to inject or consume drugs that otherwise would be consumed in back-street alleys or on sidewalks or boardwalks in our capital city.  The concept is good in terms of the practical health implications for individuals.  They can be monitored in order that there is no potential to overdose.  Needles can be exchanged.  There is a concept of taking care of people in a vulnerable state, especially when they are addicted to substances.<\/p>  <p>  Equally, it gives an opportunity to ensure this is not seen in an open environment throughout our cities.

We need to ensure positive buy-in from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is an obligation on the force to enforce laws.  There is a grey area around this concept in terms of a person going to the premises knowing full well that he is carrying an illegal substance.  We have to impress upon An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that this is being done on a pilot basis.  There should be an embracing of the concept.  We have to ensure that there is an understanding of what we are trying to achieve, that is to say, people who are addicted to substances will be able to inject in a safe environment with clean needles.  They can be monitored and observed in the context of health in an immediate sense to prevent overdoses.  They can also be monitored for the longer term health implications that come about because of heavy drug usage, in particular with heroin and other opiates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800068#VVV00300","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1489005600,"counter":633,"content":"<p>Deputy Kelleher, sorry for interrupting you.

I believe the concept is fine.  I know it is a pilot project.  I know that it would be good for health reasons and so on to have clean needles and a safe area for this method of injection.<\/p>  <p>  However, we are talking about illicit and illegal substances and the carrying of them to and from the place.  So many pressures are on our authorities.  I have the greatest sympathy for people who are addicts and those who become addicts.  We do not put half enough menacing pressure on the suppliers and those peddling.  This is a problem in every town and village in Ireland.  Certain people are known to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I cannot understand why more pressure cannot be put on them.  It is ruining families and the lives of people.  It is damaging.<\/p>  <p>  It is not a question of NIMBY syndrome.  I realise it is a pilot project.  However, from the point of view of the concept of setting up these programmes I am unsure whether this is the right methodology.  Have we exhausted any other reasons and assessments?<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Billy Kelleher has suggested we are duty bound or that it is incumbent on us to embrace things like this.  I am unsure about that.  We almost seem to be on a wave of embracing things.  We were here this night last week and embraced things.  Many people here were not in favour of it and yet they were standing up clapping for it.  What is wrong with people?  This is the Chamber to which we are elected to pronounce our views.<\/p>  <p>  I am here almost ten years, thankfully.  That was the first time I was unable to say and do what I wanted to do on the night.  That is not good or healthy in a democracy.  We had it again this evening.  People could not get in or out.  If a person holds a certain view, that person is demonised as some kind of racist or bigot or whatever.  Thankfully, we live in a democracy.  I thank the garda&iacute; for their help in getting me in and out, as well for helping others later.  People were restricted from getting in or out.<\/p>  <p>  All kinds of charges are made if one does not go with the flow.  People are being encouraged to strike and leave their workplace and everything else.  It is reckless.  We are elected to the Chamber to make these decisions.<\/p>  <p>  I am not in favour of it.  I would like to see how it is going to work.  I would like to see it teased out better.  Are we going to have a situation whereby the State is paying moneys to cover for illicit substances and injecting facilities while, on the other hand, trying to prohibit people who have addictions and those who do not from using drugs?  What about those who are taking recreational drugs and then going on to harder drugs?  The jury is out as far as I am concerned and, therefore, I cannot say that I wish the Minister of State well on it; I do not.<\/p><p>I hope I will not be portrayed as backward, a caveman or any other type of man.  I am simply making known my view that I am not in favour of this.  The matter must be teased out and the community must be involved.

There is enough pressure on them at present.  There must be a serious assessment of the impact of any legislative initiatives undertaken in the House.  Is there a review clause in this legislation?  Perhaps there is a timeline for reviews of the functionality of this and to assess whether it is dysfunctional or not working.

How will the number of people to be treated in this unit be selected?  Will it be an awful crowd and could it get bigger?  Could we have more of these units around the country?  Where will they be located?  When somebody starts a business in a building in any part of Ireland, whatever planning permission there was for the use of the building beforehand they must apply for planning permission for change of use.  That gives the people in the community and the area a chance to voice their concerns one way or the other.  Will that be the case for these centres?  Otherwise it would be very unfair to people with young children in a community close to the centre.  They would be justified to be worried about people arriving to their area, be it on foot, by bicycle or by car, because they will end up wherever the facility will be.  The people in the area are entitled to have an opportunity to decide whether they are in favour of it.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, the idea sounds good but it could develop into a very sad reality for many people later.  Will it increase the number of users?  How much will they be allowed to inject?  Will people just come to these centres for the drug if they cannot get it elsewhere?

The intent of the Bill is not in any way to condone intravenous drug abuse or to encourage illegal activity.  Its intent is to reduce health risk for intravenous drug abusers.  Such drug abuse is very high risk behaviour and this is an attempt to reduce the risk.  It is not intended to encourage them to use intravenous drugs in any way.  This country already has a needle exchange programme and it is accepted that it has reduced the incidence of intravenous infections such as hepatitis C, HIV and septicaemia.  It certainly has reduced the number of deaths related to intravenous drug abuse.  If it is accepted that one would give somebody a clean needle to inject, it is a natural progression to move on to giving them a facility where they can inject safely and be supervised.  That is the intention of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Fatal overdose in intravenous users is very frequent.  When one combines intravenous drug abuse with methadone and benzodiazepine use, as well as other illegal drugs, one compounds the effects and one is more likely to have an overdose and a fatal outcome.  The provision of an injecting site is to prevent that, which is the primary objective of the Bill.  In addition, international experience shows that supervised injection sites reduce the incidence of public order offences and anti-social behaviour and do not increase drug related crime.  They do not increase the incidence of intravenous drug abuse.  The centre is targeted at a specific, highly vulnerable group that engages in high risk activity.  In that regard, it is a positive proposal.<\/p>  <p>  Injection centres are safe zones for drug abusers.  Unfortunately, there have been overdoses but there has not been a fatality in supervised sites for intravenous drug injecting.  That is to be welcomed.  They reduce the incidence of fatal overdose because people are supervised for a certain period of time after they have injected, which is the time when a fatal overdose is most likely to occur.  Medication can be administered to them, which I will mention later.  There is international experience with supervised injection sites.  There are more than 90 such sites throughout the world and they have been tried and tested.  This approach is not new, therefore, and it has been found to be safe and effective.<\/p>  <p>  We must remember that intravenous drug abusers are a very vulnerable group.  Many are homeless and have multiple health problems such as mental health issues, intravenous drug abuse issues and physical illness related to their intravenous drug abuse.  They are vulnerable and need to be supported.  We must not dehumanise drug users.  We must treat them humanely.  They are members of our society and if they are not given every support, they will die on our streets.  There have been 5,000 drug related deaths in the past ten years in Ireland, which is an unbelievable figure.  It is 500 per year.  Of them, 200 die on our streets from intravenous drug overdose, which is one on every second day.  The introduction of this injection site will address that and, hopefully, will save many lives.<\/p>  <p>  Supervised injecting sites will also offer supports to intravenous drug abusers.  It is not simply bringing them into a room where they can inject safely.  They will be offered medical, dental and psychological services.  There will be detoxification and rehabilitation programmes.  They will have social services and social support and they will be offered accommodation.  This group of people should be at top of the list for housing.  We must get these people off the streets and then wrap services around them.  There is no point in shoving them away or not giving them support.<\/p><p>If we do that, they are going to die on our streets.  This is about offering harm reduction and integrating with other services.  That is what the health service should be about - integrating and helping the most vulnerable.  <br\/><br\/>This is not only a Dublin issue.  It is an issue in every city and town in Ireland, in Galway, Limerick, Cork, Ennis and probably in Clonmel and Killarney too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800069#WWW00800","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489006800,"counter":652,"content":"<p>Yes, it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800070#XXX00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1489006800,"counter":653,"content":"<p>It is a nationwide issue., not just a Dublin problem.  The principle underlying this legislation is better outcomes for patients.  It is primarily about saving their lives.  Remember, we cannot rehabilitate someone who is dead.  We must give them every support that we can.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the policing aspect of this issue, it requires common sense policing.  It requires a sensitive approach from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this is challenging.  There must be an acceptance that intravenous drug users who are approaching these supervised centres are in need of a different type of policing.  There is a difference between an intravenous drug user in possession of drugs going into an injection centre and someone who is selling or supplying drugs in the vicinity.  Certainly, there is no intention that the injection facilities will be in any way related to the sale and supply of intravenous drugs.  Garda&iacute; need to play a very supportive role and should protect rather than victimise the intravenous drug users.  After all, drug users are the victims in this situation.  They are not the criminals or the people supplying the drugs.  They, unfortunately, have been abused by criminals who have gotten them hooked on these drugs.  They are victims more than anything else.  We must have a health-led approach to drug users, rather than criminalising them.  This is not a criminal justice matter, but a health matter.  It requires co-operation from the health services, the police and the local authorities.  <\/p>  <p>  I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the testimony of one of the witnesses who appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health when we discussed this issue, Professor Gerard Bury.  He is a Professor of General Practice in Dublin and is very involved in the provision of medical services for intravenous drug users in the city.  He offers his services voluntarily, as do many others, in looking after intravenous drug abusers.  He is deeply frustrated about the availability of Naloxone.  This is a drug that is used to reverse the side effects, particularly the respiratory failure side effects, of intravenous drug overdose.  It has saved many lives but Professor Bury is very frustrated at the lack of availability of this drug for GPs who want to provide a service to counteract the side effects of overdose.  He feels that the drug is a potential life saver and argues that if it is made more widely available, it will save lives on our streets.  He wants to drive that message home as strongly as possible and I am assisting him now in doing that.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State would consider making that drug more widely available in order to save lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800070#XXX00300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1489006800,"counter":654,"content":"<p>Deputy Kate O'Connell is next but I will be asking her to adjourn the debate at 10.15 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800070#XXX00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1489006800,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I hope I will not be still speaking at 10.15 p.m.<\/p>  <p>  Some of what I have written down mirrors what my good colleague, Deputy Michael Harty, said.  I am coming at this issue from the perspective of a health professional.  Fundamentally, a society is judged by how it treats its weakest and most vulnerable citizens.  My experience tells me that substance abusers are just that - vulnerable, weak people who live on the fringes of our society.  People do not choose that life.  They are usually victims of circumstances far beyond their control.  Who knows what might have happened to any of us if we were brought up in different circumstances or were exposed to different things at certain times in our lives.  Anyone who has dealt with people with an addiction knows that they are trapped in a cycle of getting a hit, withdrawing, panicking about where they are going to get their next hit and so on.  It is a vicious cycle in which they are trapped.  The least we can provide for vulnerable people on the fringes of our society is a clean room, with a clean needle and swab, where they can inject themselves.  <\/p>  <p>  Public health policy should have harm reduction at its core.  I know that it probably does not suit some people to hear this but we sell alcohol legally in this country.  How many alcoholics do we have?  We allow people to gamble legally.  How many families have been destroyed by gambling?  I was asked why we will not be giving addicts methadone in injection centres but they do not want methadone.  They want heroin.  They want to inject drugs.  If they wanted methadone they could get it from a community pharmacy or a methadone centre.  The core point here is that the legal classification of a drug does not make it any worse or better for a person.  That is just the way it is.  This is not about schedule 1 drugs or going against the law.  It is about trying to sort people out in their most difficult time.  <\/p>  <p>  Water is to the fore in my mind these days and this is a bit like shoddy workmanship that results in a leaking pipe.  One can say that it is terrible that the pipe is leaking but one still has to fix the pipe.  I do not want to get political but we cannot keep going down the usual route.  Until now, we have been going down the wrong road.  Previous policies have not addressed the issue and have not worked, which is clear from the startling number of intravenous drug users all over the country.  <\/p>  <p>  I concur with much of what Deputy Michael Harty said.  I will not mention specific towns but I have worked in about 60% of the country, geographically speaking, and can confirm that this is not just an urban issue.  Intravenous drug use is rampant in many of our rural and coastal towns and people are turning a blind eye to it in many instances.  Injection centres offer an opportunity to engage with substance abusers on a regular basis.  Often addicts do not engage with the regular services and injection centres are a way of tapping into a vulnerable group and trying to improve their lives through the provision of various services.  I hope it will prove possible to initiate them onto appropriate treatment pathways.  Often intravenous drug abusers have slipped through the cracks of social services.  They have removed themselves from their GP practice and from other services in their communities and injection centres are a way of engaging with isolated people.  The centres can also be beneficial in terms of being gossip hubs.  This can be useful if bad batches of drugs come onto the market.  The centres can be a very good way of identifying wrong concentrations or contaminated batches of illegal drugs and in that sense, they can be a good way of communicating.  <\/p>  <p>  Injection centres are not just for drug users but are also for the wider public and the villages and towns that have been ravaged by drug abuse.  In response to those Deputies who find this policy unpalatable and who are struggling to support this legislation, I ask them to consider how bad our society looks when we leave vulnerable people exposed on the streets, suffering in front of strangers who come to our shores to look at our beautiful country.  Injection centres mean less drug paraphernalia on the streets.  I am talking here about contaminated needles, swabs, bits of foil, blades and all sorts of things.  These are all left on the streets now but there is evidence to show that providing adequate injection centres will reduce this.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Harty has referred to the fact that supervised injection centres reduce the number of unnecessary hospital admissions.  People are shown how to inject correctly and they tend to end up with fewer blood-borne diseases, septicaemia and the other complications that arise from intravenous drug use.  We are not reinventing the wheel.  I have not been qualified for very long but needle exchanges were being piloted when I qualified some years ago and have been shown to improve peoples' lives.  My view on this has become more open over the years as I have become more informed and have seen that drug addiction can affect anyone.<\/p><p> I wish to address some of Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's comments.  Nobody gets up in the morning and decides to take up injecting heroin.  We need to try to improve people's lives to the extent that they do not see that as the option for them.  As a society, we can deal with what is in front of us now in the most humane and practical way we know, which I believe is this policy.  We also need to work to try to make people's lives better in order that is not the path that is the most opportune.  That is not somewhere where my children will end up or the children of anybody else here.  That is not the path that is laid out for people in life.<\/p> <p> We have done great work in Dublin's north inner city to try to improve people's lives there and stop this continuing into the future.  This is about reaching out to people who are more vulnerable than us.  I ask anyone who is opposed to the Bill to meet some of us who are involved in this.  This is about trying to do the best for society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800070#XXX00500","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489007400,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I do not think the Minister of State will have sufficient time to respond and it might be preferable to move the adjournment in order that she will have enough time in which to give her response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800071#YYY00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1489007400,"counter":658,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1489007400,"counter":659,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.10 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Thursday, 9 March 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
