It was a good decision.  It is a comprehensive and substantive report.  However, for whatever reason - rightly or wrongly - expectations were raised in advance of the publication of the report yesterday that a comprehensive response would be given to the issues raised in it.  Those representing survivors of the Magdalen laundries had the impression that such a comprehensive response would emanate from the Taoiseach and the Government.<\/p><p>  Having read the executive summary of the report and other aspects of it, it is clear that an unequivocal apology should be given to the women of the Magdalen laundries by the officers of the State.  An apology should be given by the Taoiseach on all our behalf in his capacity as Taoiseach and Head of Government.  Such an apology would say to the women involved that what was done to them was wrong.  It should be said that the apology is on behalf of the Government, the State and all the citizens - no ifs and no buts.<\/p><p>  One can qualify reports and a range of aspects involved in this or any issue but the fundamental point that comes out of the report is the denial of fundamental human rights.  I accept the arguments about it being a different era and historically looking back but, fundamentally, what emerges from the report is a denial of the right to freedom, the loss of freedom and the denial of contact with the outside world.  That was exacerbated whether by omission or commission on behalf of the State by its involvement, but also compounded by the absence, lack and undermining of educational, health and welfare rights, which clearly were significant factors as well in the life experience of the women involved.<\/p><p>  Given the publication of the report and what has emerged from it, the moment is now when such an apology should be issued on behalf of society.  As an immediate response, in addition to an apology, Justice for Magdalenes has suggested &ndash; it is a good proposal &ndash; that a dedicated unit should be established within the Department of Justice and Equality which would be an interdepartmental hub to co-ordinate remaining aspects of the State&rsquo;s response to the issue, including redress, which should also be provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600003#A00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1360146600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>The report which was commissioned by the Government, which former Senator McAleese chaired, was one that was determined in consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, before the United Nations committee made its recommendation.  This, however, is about women and young girls who entered Magdalen laundries through a variety of routes.  As the report points out, this is not a simple, single issue.  The Government is genuinely concerned at bringing about reconciliation and closure to the women involved.<\/p><p>  I spent a considerable period late last night reading sections of the 1,000 page report.  It makes for harrowing reading in many respects.  It is important to say that the truth has been exposed by the McAleese report.  In that regard, the first and major issue which was of concern to the girls and young women who were in the Magdalen laundries was the removal of the stigma attached to them.  For the first time their stories have been told, recorded and published, and their stories are believed.  I would not like us to engage in adversarial diplomacy in the House on an issue as sensitive and evocative of bad memories for so many.  That is why I suggested yesterday that we should reflect deeply on the findings of the report and the facts as outlined and that we would come back in two weeks to discuss the issue.  In the meantime, I would like to think that the Government itself would reflect on the findings of the report and that we would put in place a process to deal with the survivors of the Magdalen laundries.  I understand there may be between 800 and 1,000 women, each with their own particular circumstances, many of them having come through different routes to the Magdalen laundries, and in understanding the emotional state of mind of many of those young girls when they entered the Magdalen laundries that as a State and Government we would examine what is the most appropriate assistance that could be given to deal with the consequences of their experience.<\/p><p>This is not a matter for idle comment or a matter for flippant politics.  It is a matter of intense seriousness for those who were involved and for those of us who have responsibility now.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Martin's question, I repeat again my sense of deep sorrow for all of those women who went through that regime, but I think it is only appropriate that for the first time ever, having had access to material not seen by the public before, the truth of their stories having being exposed by the committee report and their stories having being believed, we as an Oireachtas and principally as a Government should see what is the best way of bringing about closure, reconciliation and assistance in respect of those survivors of Magdalen laundries.  I would hope that when we get to the debate on the report here in two weeks time, we can set out what it is that we think is most appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600003#A00300","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360146900,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I am not in any shape or form pursuing this in an adversarial way or in an idle way or in a speculative way but, in essence, the report, substantive and comprehensive as it is, does not take away any stigma in its entirety.  The only effective way for any stigma to be removed for the women involved is by the State formally apologising to the women concerned, which essentially involves saying what happened to them in society during that period was wrong - no ifs or buts.<\/p><p>  I was involved in relation to the industrial schools and I chaired an interdepartmental committee that led, in May 1999, to a State apology to the survivors of the industrial schools.  I regret and am sorry that we did not deal with the Magdalen laundries question in tandem with the industrial schools issue.  They were huge issues at the time involving enormous numbers.  The point I would make from my experience of having met the women involved in Goldenbridge at the time is that the most fundamental need they articulated to me, above and beyond redress, other responses or anything else: &quot;was just for somebody to say to us that what was done to you was wrong, it wasn't our fault and we are sorry for it&quot;.  The same applies now without question to the women of the Magdalen laundries.  The Government of the day has to stand up and say on behalf of all of us and on behalf of society that what was done to these women was wrong.<\/p><p>  When that original apology was made, there was no talk of redress at the time.  Other issues were dealt with - education, welfare, housing and so on - and legal obstacles were removed for people to pursue issues, which led to other things happening subsequently.  As I said, mechanisms can be put in place to deal with other issues that will undoubtedly flow from this report.<\/p><p>  Now that the report is published, the essential route to removing any sense of culpability that people may have, any sense of wonder or of questioning as to why they were placed in these laundries, something that comes out in the report: &quot;the sense of why were we put in here as young people, when will we ever be released&quot;, along with the loss of freedom and the denial of contact, all which has left a deep, profound, traumatic and negative impact on these women's lives, as the executive summary concludes, and the only way to bring closure in the first instance to those women is for the State to apologise unequivocally.  I put that to the Taoiseach in a respectful and non-adversarial way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600004#B00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1360146900,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I accept the Deputy's comment, his expression of sorrow of not having dealt with the Magdalen laundries situation when responsibility was his and his party's.  If I recall correctly, they refused to investigate it then, but that is a different issue.  This Government is dealing with it.  In the context of the McAleese report, which sets out the truth, it should also be recognised, in complimenting former Senator McAleese, that this report, for which people have waited very many years, cost &euro;11,000 approximately in comparison with other reports which have cost millions and that no member of the committee accepted any stipend for their work on this.<\/p><p>  This Government has to deal with what is in the McAleese report and we will deal with it, but because it is an issue that is complex, that there can be no discrimination in regard to those women who were in Magdalen laundries in the sense of the environment in which they had to live, despite the fact that they came from different routes to the laundries, it is only right and proper that we take the report, examine it individually and collectively as a Government and decide what is the best approach to dealing with the needs and the requirements of the survivors of the Magdalen laundries and to deal with those in the most appropriate and fitting manner that we can.  I would like us to apply ourselves to that in the intervening period before the House debates the report here in two weeks time.<\/p><p>  From the report and the briefing on it given to Cabinet by former Senator McAleese, it was very clear from the people who spoke to him and his committee that their overriding requirement was to have the stigma attached to the Magdalen laundries removed, but it is fair to say that their other overriding concern was a sense of fear that they had at not knowing when they might be able to leave the Magdalen laundries.  I want to say to the House that this is an issue that has affected the lives of women negatively, as is pointed out in the report, but it also has implications in regard to their families in many cases and to their circle of friends.  I would like genuinely to say that the process by which we bring closure and reconciliation here is one that deserves really genuine consideration by Government, and I intend to see that happens.  From that point of view, I would like the space to work with Government on putting in place a process and a structure by which the State can, in so far as it can, bring closure and reconciliation in regard to these women and help them in whatever way we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600004#B00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1360146900,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has wrongly asserted here this morning that the McAleese report is the first occasion on which we had documented evidence of the abuses in the Magdalen laundries.  He will be aware that the Ryan report detailed forced unpaid labour, denial of liberty to women and significant physical and emotional abuse.  In the same year that the Ryan report was published, the Taoiseach's colleague, Deputy Alan Shatter, now the Minister for Justice and Equality, was absolutely steadfast in his view, a correct view, that there was irrefutable evidence of State complicity in the Magdalen laundries.  The report released yesterday confirms yet again what many of us in this Chamber have known for a very long time, that the State was complicit in the detention of women, in the routes of entry to these laundries, in the State inspection of these laundries and in direct State funding.<\/p><p>  It was a very big disappointment that the Taoiseach failed yesterday to apologise on behalf of the State to those women for what they have endured.<\/p><p>I had hoped that overnight the Taoiseach would have had time to reflect.

I hope he has listened very carefully to their accounts, stories and experiences; how they tell that they were held against their will; how they suffered physical, verbal and emotional abuse; and how they were forced to work for nothing, which is slave labour.  I believe these women and I believe their account.  Does the Taoiseach believe them?  If he does, why then will he not offer a full and sincere apology on behalf of the State?  Why will he not offer an apology for the indignity that these women suffered in these laundries, an indignity in which we know, definitively, the State was complicit in.  Former Senator McAleese's report simply confirms that fact.  Many of these women are elderly and many of them do not enjoy good health.  They have waited and they have waited and yesterday was the day for the Taoiseach, on behalf of the State and its citizens, to say clearly to them: \"You were wronged.

I do believe that this is the truth about what happened to them, about their lives and their life experience.  I do believe that the Government has a duty to act on the findings of this report in bringing reconciliation and closure to a very sensitive and sad period in the lives of so many women who lived in this country.  The information contained in sections of this report was not available previously, including the financial accounts pertaining to the running of the laundries and the evidence given by the religious orders.  While elements of that were apparent and published in other reports, there is information here that was not seen before.  <\/p><p>  I accept, as the country knows, that these women have waited a very long time for this report to emerge.  I also believe that it is the duty and responsibility of a responsible government to examine the report, to reflect on it and to decide on the best thing to do.  I have given my word on this and I need the space of a short period to put in place a process by which we can deal with this.  Obviously, we will have an opportunity to discuss it further in two weeks time.  I realise that many of these women are now elderly and some are not in very strong and robust health.

I think it is extremely cruel to the Magdalen women who yesterday expected that their story would be fully validated and that the Taoiseach would move to remove that awful stigma with which they have lived - by putting up our hands, collectively, and by the State putting up its hands and saying: \"You were wronged.  We were negligent.\"<\/p><p>  I have to wonder as to the real motivation for the Taoiseach's failure to apologise, given that he believes the women's account and that he tells us that he understands their distress.  I hope his version of responsible government is not one that simply seeks to circle the wagons to protect the State from any financial liability that might arise and to simply cast the women's experiences to one side.  That would not be a very palatable version of responsible government not just for the women, but for citizens right across this country who are watching in horror as they hear of yet another story of brutalisation within institutions and of the State's relationship with those institutions and the State's stubbornness in refusing to face, head on, its responsibilities to the victims.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach needs to make the apology.

It is fair to say that Shane not only brought great joy in life to Fine Gael, he also brought it to this House.  It is a measure of the affection in which he was held that he is mourned so deeply and so widely.<\/p><p>  Shane McEntee did wonderful work for Ireland, for Government and indeed for the party that he loved.  From the time he was elected to the D&aacute;il in 2005, his belief was always in Ireland and its people first.  I remember on being appointed to office, when I had the privilege of nominating him as a Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, his sense of how things would at last change now that he had the opportunity to get things done.  He was impatient and anxious to get going and get doing.  The personnel in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are reeling not just from his absence but from his presence, his ideas, his energy and unstoppable enthusiasm for his work.<\/p><p>  Before his death, I was constantly hearing from people all over the country about their gr&aacute; for such a gr&aacute;mhar man, about his great work for forestry, dealing most recently with the ash dieback risk, and about his work with the greyhound industry, small farmers and householders and families affected by pyrite.  Since his death the same people have spoken of their shock and sense of loss.  He was their Minister of State for a relatively short time but they knew and trusted him and had come to respect and admire him greatly.  In many ways, he epitomised the word &quot;great&quot; in his physical presence, his energy, his resolve, his capacity, his enthusiasm, his zeal for his work and, above all, his great sincerity, his compassion and his gentleness, qualities that are perhaps devalued in today's world.<\/p><p>  Everyone who knew him would agree that Shane McEntee was a solid man, always ready with common sense, a kind word and sound advice.  He was, as we always expected him to be, always himself and always there.  In being himself, he spoke and acted from the most powerful place of all, his heart.  To speak from there not only reveals us but it exposes us.  Shane McEntee gave effortlessly and extravagantly in the love of his family, of his community and of his county.  He gave his life to people.  I remember sitting with him in houses in Ashbourne dealing with pyrite.  He did not just listen to people's stories, he lived them as they were told because he knew and they knew that what was at stake were not houses but homes and their futures - the everyday dream of places where couples could settle, raise children and pass on traditions to another generation.  His family, this House and this country are all the better for having known and understood the presence of Shane McEntee, the sheer force of the authenticity that we feel now acutely in his absence, which has created a void for so many.<\/p><p>  As a Minister and a politician, he believed in his country, in Ireland, and that our best days are still head.  We grieve his loss and know that it is nothing compared to the loss for Kathleen, Vincent, Sally, Helen and Aoife, to his mother Madge and his many brothers.  I was deeply privileged to work with Shane for a long time and at such a crucial time for our country.  I was always touched by his sincerity, his kindness to others and I speak for the House and the Oireachtas when I say we share many warm and happy memories of Shane McEntee, political and personal.  Every time he went to work, every time he helped a constituent, a farmer, someone in the food industry or someone he met on the road, he gave politics a good name, and for that we thank him.<\/p><p>  The Fine Gael family feels Shane's loss acutely and grievously and we honour and remember him.  In life often the greatest battles are the ones we fight with ourselves.  Shane fought and lost and won those battles through his 57 years.  It speaks eloquently of his shining qualities as a politician, as a Minister, as a Meath man and as a friend that this House is united in its still new grief at his tragic passing.  As a Minister, he had an ambitious and urgent agenda.  We will see to it that it is fulfilled.<\/p><p>  As Taoiseach and as leader of Fine Gael, I am proud to pay tribute to our friend and colleague, Shane McEntee.  I am honoured to have called him my friend over many years and I believe I speak for us all when I say the privilege was entirely ours.

I first got to know Shane as a formidable candidate in the Meath by-election, which first saw him elected to the D&aacute;il.  Over the years he served in this House, and during his time in government, I came to know him better, to respect him, to admire his work and commitment, and to like him.  He was a gentle man whose passion and commitment came through when he spoke in this Chamber and elsewhere about the causes that inspired him.  He was a fervent advocate for his community, for his constituency and, more broadly, for farmers and rural people generally.  Shane was a man deeply committed to serving those around him and to making a real difference to people's lives.<\/p><p>As a Minister, he impressed me in how he brought that same level of commitment and work ethic to his portfolio.  It was clear to all that this was a man committed to serving both his county and his country, and to the ideals of public service.<\/p><p> We all were deeply shocked when we heard of Shane's passing.  None of us can ever truly know what he suffered.  I pay tribute to the courage of his family who have spoken out so clearly about the circumstances surrounding his passing, the lessons that must be drawn and the practices that must be changed.<\/p><p> These are indeed troubled times.  As a country, we are going through a great crisis but, as people, we do have duties to each other.  We all have a duty of civility and a responsibility for personal respect.  The age of deference is past but not the need for decency.  If, as a people, we lose our sense of decency and of the basic respects that we owe to each other, then we have lost far more than we can ever count.  Those of us in public life, those engaged in the practice of politics and those who comment on it have a duty to think through the consequences of what we say and how we say it, and nobody can walk away from these consequences.  These are difficult times that require us all to put country before political advantage but to be human, times when we need those of the character and calibre of the late Shane McEntee.<\/p><p> I offer his family deepest condolences.  In these difficult days, I hope that they can draw some comfort from knowing that Shane was held in the highest of respect in this House and that he served his country with distinction.  He was a lovely man.  Cuimhneoimid air go deo.  Tr&eacute;an-fhear a bh&iacute; ann.  Fear a thug seirbh&iacute;s don t&iacute;r, do Chondae na M&iacute; agus d&aacute; chlann.

It was a truly shocking moment that caused all of us in this House to take stock, to stop and to pause.  That dark news gave the entire nation a reminder of the frailties of life and those of us who knew him were left with a deep abiding sadness at the loss of a true gentleman of Irish politics.  He had those qualities - a true gentleman whenever one met him.<\/p><p>  There are no words that we can offer to Shane's family to console them in their loss.  The irreplaceable space left at the heart of their home is a void that can never be filled.  We offer his wife Kathleen, his children Aoife, Vincent, Helen and Sally, his brothers and sisters and his mother, Madge, our support and heartfelt sorry.  Our thoughts and prayers are with them and will always be with them.  I pray and hope that the memory of a life well lived, of a loving and generous soul, will not only ease their grief but will sustain them in the days, months and years ahead.<\/p><p>  Since his election to the D&aacute;il eight years ago, Shane impressed me with his generosity, his quiet dignity and his sense of humour and commitment to his work.  His commitment to public service was a clear and defining feature of his life.  From his father he inherited a deep appreciation of the land and worked tirelessly with the IFA for the vitality of the family farm.  He brought those qualities to his role as Minister of State and those of us on this side of the House welcomed his openness, responsiveness and engagement and the energy he brought to his role.<\/p><p>  It is fair to say that all who enter public life do so with a deep sense of commitment to improve the well-being of their community, county and country, and it was clear that was at the heart of Shane's commitment to and participation in politics.  From the outset, he was deeply involved in many facets of his local community.  We are all here to try to make a difference.  Shane was here to make a difference to the quality of life of the people he represented, and he did that in so many ways.<\/p><p>  His lifelong enthusiasm for the Gaelic Athletic Association, perhaps, was the earliest manifestation of that deep sense of community commitment.  After his local playing career, his talent for coaching players shone through, both at local level and nationally for the royal county at minor level.  As a Cork man, suffice it for me to say that the name McEntee struck terror in our hearts on many an occasion on the playing fields of Croke Park but there was also a deep respect for the McEntee commitment and contribution to Gaelic games, to sport and to Irish life.  That deep underlying respect is still there.  He gave up his oars to help ensure that players reached their potential and that the vibrancy of a community club was kept alive.  His drive in the GAA is a testament to his generosity of spirit and it was that commitment to public service that he brought with him to the D&aacute;il and politics in general.<\/p><p>  He was Fine Gael from the backbone out.  His family links to the party stretch back to the foundations of the State and he was very proud of that.  He loved the Fine Gael Party and it is fair to say that Fine Gael loved Shane, as reflected in the Taoiseach's moving eulogy at the graveside some weeks ago.  It was through Fine Gael that he pledged himself to public service.  There is a deep sense of loss felt on all sides of the House, but particularly among all on the Fine Gael benches who worked with him for years as a Deputy and Minister and who were inspired by his commitment, loyalty and work.  I hope all will be heartened that his spirit will be kept alive by his colleagues who continue the work to which he gave himself.<\/p><p>  Political life can be a bear pit of rivalry, argument, debate and so forth and sometimes it can slide into rancour and pettiness, but fundamentally we are all bound together by a deeper commitment to improve the lot of citizens and society.  Working together collectively in this House, we seek to make the life of citizens that bit better than we found them on coming into the House.  That motivation is what inspired the late Shane McEntee to go into political life.  It is that spirit, which he personified, that must be cherished and remembered.  All Members of this House are bound together by that commitment.  We share in its costs and we can reflect upon its triumphs.<\/p><p>  It is his family we thank, in particular, for sharing Shane with us.  Politics places an enormous burden on families.  There is no question about that.  We thank the family for their contribution in that regard, for the huge endeavour and support that they gave Shane throughout his life, and particularly his political life.  As long as this work goes on, the patriotic spirit of the late Shane McEntee will endure and his commitment to public service will go on.  I trust that Shane's family, friends and many colleagues can draw strengthen from that reality.

I also express my sympathy to the Taoiseach and the Fine Gael Party.  Shane was deeply committed to Fine Gael and he worked tirelessly on behalf of the party.  His by-election victory in 2005 helped lift Fine Gael when its fortunes were low and all of that is to the good from his perspective.<\/p><p> He was first and foremost a proud Meath man and he made a very significant contribution to his local community, as a farmer, as a community activist, as an active GAA member and as an elected representative.  I first came across the McEntee name through the footballing exploits of Gerry, Shane's brother.  In his capacity as a surgeon, he also ministered and tended to a very good friend of mine over a long period.<\/p><p> I always found Shane to be very courteous, polite and generous - except on one occasion which I will deal with in a moment.  He was deeply committed to his politics, but was willing to listen to other opinions.  He had a deep commitment to rural Ireland.  I was surprised at the number of times he came to me quietly on the side to talk about forestry in the Cooley Mountains, about the ash tree disease or about his good relations with the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in the North, Michelle O'Neill MLA.  At one time he came to me after we had discussed collusion here and told me of an occasion when he was at his parents' farm and they had friends in from the North who had suffered from collusion - this family had been bereaved and he believed what was being said about collusion.  He was also very proud of his south Armagh family connections.<\/p><p> The one incident to which I referred was that I was heckled here one time, which happens quite frequently in this Chamber.  To my surprise I discovered afterwards that it was not just the usual suspects, but that Shane was one of the hecklers.  I was both disappointed and offended by this.  The next day as I was sitting here with Deputy Mary Lou McDonald beside me, he came across and stuck his hand out, shook hands and said, &quot;I was out of order yesterday.  I'm sorry.&quot;  That was a measure of the man.  He then went on to say, &quot;When you're giving my Taoiseach a hard time, I see red.&quot;  That was a sign of his great loyalty to the Taoiseach.<\/p><p> The big loss is to the family, including a bhean ch&eacute;ile and children.  All of our families suffer grievously in one way or another because of our involvement in politics.  However, I hope it is some consolation to Kathleen to know all the good work that her husband did and that he was liked by all sides in this D&aacute;il.  Many people are in a far better place today because of what he did and I thank her for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600008#F00300","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360149900,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I am very grateful for the opportunity to say a few words about Shane.  He might have been surprised to know that there were three women fighting at the Technical Group meeting yesterday over the right to have this slot.  However, seeing that it was Shane, it was a fight that I was absolutely committed to winning.  I know that Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan wanted to make points about Shane and his contribution to the debate on mental health when she initiated the discussion in Private Members' time almost a year ago.  I know that Deputy Catherine Murphy, who was elected on the same day as Shane in a by-election recalls the time when they were expectantly waiting outside the door to come into this Chamber and how her family and Shane's intermingled.  She recalled how emotional Shane was on that day - as we all know he was always someone who wore his heart on his sleeve, a straightforward man, a simple man.  Members of his family said to members of Deputy Catherine Murphy's family: \"Look, Shane is not much of a talker, but he is a doer.\"  What an important day it was for him and they obviously kept a connection going throughout the years, being from similar constituencies.<\/p><p>  I would never normally want to speak in a slot such as this because politics matters and it is hard to separate the political from the personal.  One could look at it and say that Shane and I were polar opposites in terms of tradition and ideas.  While that is true, I must say, hand on heart, there are few people about whom I would be more honoured to say words than Shane.  That is not in disrespect to anyone else, but recognition of the very different and special type of person he was.  For me the biggest compliment I could pay him was that he was not a politician.  First and foremost for me Shane was an incredibly decent human being and that matters and counts for a huge amount.<\/p><p>  The first time I met him was at the back gate of Agriculture House going across to our offices.  I did not know who he was.  As a vegetarian and an animal-rights campaigner, I had heard of him by reputation in terms of the stag hunt and all the rest of it.  One would not think of us as being pals, but after that first encounter I left with his phone number - I did not even have to ask for it - and a commitment that his door was always open and that we could work together on the pyrite issue because he knew the work I had been doing in my constituency.  An unlikely team was formed that day.<\/p><p>  I have said this here previously and I am glad that I did.  Nobody has done more for homeowners affected by pyrite than Shane McEntee.  He was the person who drove this issue.  In the years in opposition when it was not popular, he was a lone voice.  I told him that he was too complimentary to his Fine Gael colleagues because he fought that fight almost singlehandedly in opposition.  When Fine Gael got into power and he got his ministerial position, he absolutely used it to try to deliver gains for homeowners.  I have no doubt that this issue would not have been progressed in the way in which it was without the work that Shane did.  The residents who campaigned with us - and indeed myself - always viewed him as our man on the inside in terms of this issue.  He was a very practical person who sat down and hammered out deals with developers and quarry-owners - he did not want to enrich solicitors.  He worked quietly behind the scenes delivering results.<\/p><p>  He was a really peculiar politician.  Everybody knows most politicians talk themselves up and try to claim things they have not done.  Shane was the exact opposite - he quietly did things behind the scenes, delivered results, changed people's lives and never claimed any credit for it.  He was not a mad media follower or anything like that.  I would certainly agree with him on that one.  The Government must pick up on that legacy and deliver what Shane started in terms of the pyrite issue.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I had a meeting after Christmas with the residents who were involved in the pyrite action campaign.  There were a few tears, a few laughs and a big empty space where Shane normally sat at those meetings.  People talked about the constant phone calls, about him calling into their houses, putting on the kettle for a cup of tea and ringing them up to see if they were okay.  About 20 or 30 of us would get a separate phone call, giving us a bit of information and telling us that we were to keep it to ourselves.<\/p><p>  There are families up and down the commuter belt whose lives have been transformed by Shane's work in here.  I do not say that lightly by any stretch.  He was their advocate and their voice.  We have a responsibility to carry on that battle.  I remember the first meeting we had in the ALSAA where we brought together residents from the different counties affected by pyrite.  We were trying to hammer out a strategy on the issue.  In the middle of the meeting Shane got up and started talking about cows of his that had been poisoned.  All these urban couples from the commuter belt, who had probably never even been on a farm, were looking around unsure where the story was going.  The story involved how Shane tried to get justice over that issue and how he fought a long case to try to gather the evidence.  However, the evidence was destroyed and he had to abandon the court case.  The moral of the story he was telling the people was that the battle in which they were involved was a serious one and could be all-consuming for them.<\/p><p>They were engaged in a fight to save their homes but also needed to know when to let go, walk away and not allow it take over their lives.<\/p><p> I have thought a lot about that since Shane's death.  It is easy to be nice to be people when times are good and things are going well.  An honourable and decent person stands by one when the chips are down and it is not popular to do so.  A couple of such instances come to mind.  When I left the Socialist Party and was being vilified by our colleagues in the media I passed Shane in his car in the carpark in Agriculture House.  He beckoned to me and then jumped out of the car and gave me a big hug saying, &quot;Don't worry about it, they're talking about you today, it will be me tomorrow and somebody else the day after.  Don't worry about it.  Just get on with it&quot;.  When Deputy Wallace was in difficulty he called him aside and said, &quot;Listen, you've no friends in that House, this is a dog-eat-dog place where people generally only think about themselves&quot;.  While that is largely true it was definitely not true of Shane.  <\/p><p> I would have been glad to call Shane my friend.  On the last occasion Shane was in this House I engaged with him in a debate on Coillte.  I am glad I went easy on him.  He was brutal that day.  I could always go easy on Shane because he was too nice to get thick with.  I am glad I worked with him.  I am incredibly proud to have known him.  I am determined to carry on his legacy to fight for justice for pyrite homeowners because he deserves nothing less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600009#G00200","speaker":"1015","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360150500,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Six weeks have passed since Shane's death.  It is still difficult for many of us to grasp and accept what happened.  This is a difficult day in this House for Shane's many colleagues and friends from all parties.  It is a particularly difficult day for Shane's wife Kathleen and his children, Vincent, Helen, Sally and Aoife and other members of the McEntee family.  I have some experience of what it is like to look down on a Chamber and listen to the Taoiseach, party leaders and colleagues speak about a loved one.  It is not easy.<\/p><p>  This is another difficult step for a family struggling to deal with an immense loss.  I am sure they would rather not be in a political environment given all that has happened in that context.  However, they are here.  They are here because politics was fundamentally part of Shane's life and it is appropriate and necessary to pay tribute to him today in an honest manner, the way he would have spoken.  <\/p><p>  I got to know Shane long before we shared the running of the Department together.  He was a larger than life character.  One always felt better after meeting him than one felt before, particularly if struggling with an issue.  He tended to bring clarity to things quickly, knowing the difference between right and wrong and not really understanding or caring for the kind of PR management on which many of us focus too much.  He preferred instead to get to the root of a problem and spoke in a plain, decent and honest way about problems and how they should be solved, be it about pylons, pyrite, stag hunting, about which Shane was so passionate he could almost convince Deputy Clare Daly to support it, road safety, which he managed to link with stag hunting in a discussion with me on one occasion, greyhounds or horticulture in respect of which he had ministerial responsibility, the suckler cow welfare scheme about which we got some stick, solving the charlara problem in ash plantations across Ireland or internal battles within Fine Gael when as a party it was making difficult choices, at which meetings he was a passionate advocate for the Taoiseach.  Everybody respected Shane because of the way he spoke and how he spoke.  He spoke to colleagues like he would speak to his brother, which is not too common these days, particularly in this House or among the people who report what happens here.  This should cause us to reflect somewhat on how we behave and speak to each other, solve problems together, the often personalised nature of that engagement, how we engage with those who we need in the broader media to get our messages across and how they engage with us and the pressures this can put on individuals and families. <\/p><p>  Given his straightforward nature, Shane was hugely popular.  He was popular among his colleagues in Fine Gael and, as we have heard, in other parties.  He was not really a Party man.  Fine Gael was the vehicle through which he conducted politics and he was proud to be a member of that party but party allegiance was not what drove him, which I learned through my work as Minister with him.  Farmers loved Shane  because of his straightforward nature.  I noticed at meetings which we both attended, whether with the IFA, other farming organisations or the public, that the leadership engaged with me and the members engaged with him.  I was the person outlining the theory of policy, the CAP negotiations and the figures of budgets but the farmers went to Shane to find out in plain English how this would impact on their lives.  I suspect I will never be as close as he was to rural communities in terms of really understanding them but I learned a huge amount from him.<\/p><p>  As a Minister of State, Shane McEntee, did a huge amount.  He was underestimated by his colleagues and many people in this House but not in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The record will show that in the past two years there were no cuts to funding for forestry, an increase in expenditure for horticulture and no cuts in funding for the greyhound industry.  There were also no food safety scandals, which was one of his areas of responsibility, until after he passed away.  Were he here with me trying to solve the current challenges we face in the food industry his impatience and plain speak would be helpful through this difficult period.  He would also be caught up in it personally, as was the case in respect of everything he was involved with, which affected him and often weighed him down even though he never showed it.  <\/p><p>  Most mornings when I arrived at work I would meet Shane bounding down the corridor.  He was a big man in every sense.  He would always say, &quot;Everything all right Simon?&quot;  If ever I asked him to do anything, which I regularly did - I regularly tested his loyalty - the instant response was, &quot;No bother, I'll make that happen&quot;.  If I asked him at the last minute to give a speech or attend an appointment I could not make he changed his diary and made it happen.  He was extraordinarily loyal at a personal and political level to me.  He was an outstanding Minister of State in terms of his own portfolios and as a support to everyone in the Department.<\/p><p>  The following sums up Shane in the Department.  Last July, I was putting together a budget.<\/p><p>I had my usual team around me, including financial advisers, auditors and special advisers, trying to put together the theory of a budget we could sell to the farming and agricultural community while at the same time making the sums add up for the Ministers, Deputies Brendan Howlin and Michael Noonan.  I stopped Shane in the corridor and asked him to join us for a budget meeting as we were beginning to get on top of the detail.  He told me he trusted me on the detail and that when I had the budget together to go to him and he would farmer-proof it for me.  I did and he did and we made changes accordingly.<\/p><p> To his family I say not to feel any pressure about political decisions which need to be made in the coming months and focus instead on what is important for the family.  Everybody will understand this.  Take solace and support from the extraordinary outpouring of grief, support, sadness and genuine warmth in the House towards Shane as a person and as a politician who contributed a huge amount in a short time as Minister of State and an enormous amount as a local public representative and Deputy.  I hope we as a House collectively and those who cover the work we do will think about what happened and the circumstances which drove Shane to this tragedy for him and his family and that we will learn some lessons from him, his personality and his decency, which is something we have lost in public life in the past four to five years in particular as times have become more difficult and tougher.  Shane felt this and unfortunately it contributed to something which should never have happened in a moment of madness.  May he rest in peace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600010#H00200","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360151100,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I now call on Shane's constituency colleagues beginning with Deputy Regina Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600011#J00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1360151100,"counter":106,"content":"<p>We are here to pay tribute to our friend and colleague Shane and, importantly, to support his family.  I first met Shane in the run-up to the 2005 by-election.  As we all do during such times he was canvassing seeking support for the upcoming convention.  We all wanted somebody new and refreshing and on the night of the convention while all of the other candidates spoke very well Shane spoke of the Meath he loved, the party he loved and the job he really wanted to do.  With much respect to all of the other candidates there was no contest that night and Shane was the winner.  He went on to win the by-election.  We called him the glorious by-election winner in Meath for years afterwards not only because he won but because he galvanised Fine Gael and gave us strength and reinvigorated us as a party which allowed us to move on.<\/p><p>  Immediately he got stuck into his job.  He made a mark on his new constituency of Meath East and rallied all of our members.  He even convinced me to be the treasurer of the constituency.  He gave energy, commitment and inspiration to all of his team, and particularly to the thousands of people he represented.  At meetings he told every story in terms of football matches and he finished every meeting with a joke, most of which were rude.  His career progressed and on the day he was appointed Minister of State he was so excited.  We had a meeting to appoint somebody to replace me on the council and he could not wait to leave the meeting to go to his family so he could tell his Mam and Dad, who was in hospital, personally he had been appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  He could not have been more proud and I know his family could not have been more proud either.<\/p><p>  He loved his job.  He shared himself with absolutely everybody.  His confidence grew and his stories changed from football to mushrooms and strawberries, and his commitment to the land he loved so much shone through.  He worked with passion, integrity and endless energy.  One would be knackered on a Thursday night having worked in here and Shane would bounce into a meeting still full of beans.  Everybody who knew him will miss his care, commitment and big heart.  He was a vibrant individual with a rare friendliness and a charm of personality.  He was a genuinely warm and wonderful individual with a big heart.  Albert Einstein, who was apparently a very clever man, said the value of a man should be seen in what he gives and not what he is able to receive.  Shane gave and gave and gave and we, his friends, colleagues and fellow county men and women were the lucky beneficiaries.  Shane was a man of his people, his place and his party.  Rest easy Shane.

I first met Shane during the Meath by-election in 2005 when I was also a candidate.  That by-election saw him elected for the first time to the House.  While the campaign was tough and intense, as all elections are, throughout it Shane was a gentleman and was pleasant on the campaign trail.  In the following years I got to know Shane better.  I was elected to the Seanad in 2007 when he was elected to this House for the second time.  After my election Shane was very welcoming to me as a fellow Member of the Oireachtas from the royal county.  He ensured I was invited along to meet all the various delegations and representations and to meetings with regard to the county of Meath.<\/p><p>  On behalf of the Labour Party in Meath I can say that in all of our dealings with Shane we found him very easy to get on with.

One always came away from a conversation with Shane knowing he would try his very best to help one out in any way he could.  As political opponents we were only too well aware of the qualities Shane had.  It was second nature to Shane to be able to connect with people.  He could be speaking at a difficult public meeting or in the middle of a big argument on a radio show but he always managed to find the words to win the argument, often with a smile or an anecdote about a forthcoming football match or perhaps something to do with the farm on which he worked.  I remember ringing Shane one morning to discuss a relevant issue of the day and I could hear noise in the background.  I asked Shane what it was and he told me he was out in a field with some cows doing a bit of work.  That was Shane; he managed to combine so much in his life.<\/p><p>  Everybody is very well aware of the qualities he had and how he could connect with people and how one knew he was straight up every time one met him.  We would all agree the place was much better when Shane was around.  I know I speak for the people of Meath when I say Shane will be remembered as a fine man and a dedicated Deputy for the people.   I have spoken to many people in recent weeks and wherever one goes in the county one meets people who were touched in some way by Shane.  He gave his help and advice freely and people always knew Shane was there for them.  He was respected by all and loved by many.  We will all miss him in this House.  To his wife Kathleen and his family I say I am very truly sorry for their loss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600011#J00400","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1360151100,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I now call Deputy Damien English from the Meath West constituency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600011#J00500","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1360151100,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Shane truly was a unique person, colleague and friend.  He was a committed and passionate man whether for family, politics, football, community or, as Shane would say, parish.  He was a gentle giant with a huge presence in Meath and the country.  His passing is a huge loss to his family, our county and all of us here.  I did not know Shane before the 2005 by-election.  I knew of him, as everyone in Meath knew the McEntee family from football, sport and politics, and Shane's reputation had travelled even to my house when I was a young fellow well before 2005 when I got to know him.<\/p><p>  I remember canvassing throughout the county and it did not matter whether one was in Donore near Drogheda or in Ballinabrackey, Enfield or Navan, Shane was known.  Knocking on doors I assumed people would know Gerry, but no offence to Gerry it was always Shane they knew.  They knew of Gerry but they knew Shane personally.  Before he had even started his formal role in politics he was known.  Getting to know Shane during the by-election was an honour as was working with him and his family.<\/p><p>  Shane was a proud Meath man who entered politics for all the right reasons.<\/p><p>He genuinely wanted to improve things for the people of Meath and for his country.  Shane believed in public service and he was proud to serve.  Everyone who knew him and worked with him was extremely fond of him and they all knew how genuine and true he was.  <\/p><p> Throughout his career in politics, Shane threw his energy into fighting for his people.  He did not win every battle but he made sure, at the very least - be it in opposition or in government - to put up a good fight.  It was not unusual in our area to wake up to hear Shane on LMFM radio in the morning, starting a new campaign in which Fine Gael would be involved.  One might give out and say, &quot;Here we go again, another campaign&quot;, but one followed him into it.  That was Shane - everything became a campaign and everything was a battle.  Shane had the art of campaigning down to a tee.  He never took &quot;No&quot; for an answer.  In footballing terms, as Shane always put it, he never took his eye off the ball.  In my office, Shane's approach was called the &quot;Mac attack&quot;.  <\/p><p> As a colleague in Meath, I had the pleasure of working with him on some of these campaigns, including road safety, pylons, pyrite and our local hospital.  Shane always set the bar high for all of us involved in those campaigns, and rightly so.  Some of us might get obsessed with detail and the process of getting there, but that was not Shane's concern.  He just kept the end target in sight; we were going to win this campaign and that was it.  <\/p><p> Shane was a key campaigner for rural Ireland and its heritage.  He took on a leading role on many issues, including hunting, farming and the right to live and work on one's land.  On these issues, Shane was certainly not one to sit on the fence.  For Shane, it was never just about votes or politics, it was more real than that; people always came first.  If Shane thought a person or family was in need, he was the first to their door.  Their issue became his issue.  <\/p><p> Shane was a good friend to all of us here in Leinster House.  I will miss his visits to my office where he would pop in for five minutes and stay for an hour.  One would always hear Shane coming up the corridor because he would stop at everyone's door to say &quot;Hello&quot; and ask &quot;How's the family?&quot;  That was Shane.  He would ask &quot;How's the wee man?&quot; or &quot;How's the wee girl?&quot;.  Family meant the world to Shane.  I know that Kathleen and the children, as well as his brothers, sisters and friends, are here today.  Shane often spoke about them with a smile and a glint in his eye.  He was very proud of all of them.  They were a big presence in everything he did and everything he worked for.  My thoughts and prayers are with them.  I hope Shane is at peace now.  He really will be missed by all of us in this House.  May he rest in peace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600011#J00600","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360151700,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I am grateful to have this opportunity to speak about a great friend and a valued colleague, the late Shane McEntee.

The main issue for discussion is agreement on the Union's future budget, which is called the multiannual financial framework, MFF.  That work will start tomorrow and I expect discussions to continue late into the night.  As Members will recall, negotiations on the MFF have been under way since the European Commission put forward its proposals in June 2011.  They have been, and remain, both highly technically complex and highly political as by assigning resources, we are effectively prioritising our common actions, making hard choices and difficult decisions on the European Union's actions right up to 2020.<\/p><p>  The amounts of money involved may sound very large and the Commission originally proposed expenditure of approximately &euro;1,000 billion over seven years.  In reality, however, for a European Union of 560 million citizens, this represents just 1% of European Union gross national income, GNI.  If one puts it another way, it represents just 2% of total public expenditure in the European Union.  At a time when we look to the Union to assume many more tasks, this seems modest.  However, the negotiations this week will not merely focus on spending.<\/p><p>It concerns how the EU assembles the money that it needs, how we can improve the quality of the spending and how rebates may be handled for individual member states.  This must all be agreed by unanimity.  We are a Union of 27, soon to be 28 member states, with each member state having its own appreciation of the Union's wider interest, as well as of the national interest.  This week we will need to find the right balance between national interests and the approaches we support together as common policies in instruments such as the CAP.  We need to ensure that national interests do not outweigh broader EU interests.<\/p><p> That is the first hurdle and the treaty requires also that any agreement must have the consent of the European Parliament.  In today's more complex institutional environment in the European Union, this cannot be taken for granted and nor should it be.  We need to respect the interest of the European Parliament in this process, and I have made this clear both to President Van Rompuy and European Parliament President Schulz, as well as EU Commission President Barroso.  Ahead of the meeting of the European Council, I met with President Van Rompuy, who will steer our discussions, as well as Presidents Barroso and Schulz, in Brussels on Monday to consider the process that lies ahead.  It is clear that tough negotiations will be needed if agreement is to be found.<\/p><p> Some headway was made at the European Council in November but considerable differences remain.  From my contacts with colleagues, I believe there is a shared appreciation that we need to close the deal this week.  We need to show our citizens in the Union and the wider world that we are capable of taking decisions even on the most difficult of subjects.  In general, the signals from capitals have been encouraging.  It would appear that leaders will be heading to Brussels this week with a view to finding an acceptable compromise.  That would be good news for the European Union and for Ireland.<\/p><p> Our discussions will pick up from where we left matters in November, when President Van Rompuy tabled a proposal for a budget of approximately &euro;972 billion for the seven year period, representing a significant cut from the budget proposed by the Commission.  In setting out his assessment of how matters stand, President Van Rompuy has been clear that he believes further cuts will be necessary to bring everyone on board.  A main part of our discussion will, therefore, focus on how big these cuts should be and where they should be applied.  In addition, the European Council will also have to reach agreement on the revenue side, an area that we did not get into in detail in November, and this involves the very difficult and sensitive question of rebates.<\/p><p> I have set out the Government's approach to the negotiations on a number of previous occasions.  We want a properly funded and properly functioning EU.  The EU's budget must have the right mix of priorities, a fair allocation of resources and, most importantly in our current circumstances, a focus on jobs and growth.  The EU must, in short, have a budget that is fit for purpose.<\/p><p> Our overriding financial priority has been to protect the allocation for the Common Agricultural Policy and to maximise Irish access to it.  The CAP accounts for approximately 85% of our total EU receipts and it is central to our interaction with the EU.  The Union's budget needs a CAP allocation that will support a vigorous, consumer-focused agricultural production base in Europe.  The CAP is a vital tool for economic growth through its support for agriculture, the agri-food and related industries and the rural economy.  We have made this clear to our partners in Europe.<\/p><p> Our engagement with the MFF is of course not limited to the CAP.  We have argued strongly for an MFF with adequate resources for other growth-enhancing measures, including research, education, European connectivity and support for the small and medium enterprise sector.  We want the budget to support the Europe 2020 strategy for jobs and growth and be seen to support it.  It must have adequate funding for investment in economic growth and the creation of employment and it must have a particular focus on youth unemployment.  All member states, including those with more developed regions, must be able to access EU programmes and funds.  The Union's Cohesion policy must address the challenges that face us today, with the most serious of these being unemployment.  The Union must also have sufficient funds to act outside its borders, most importantly in the area of development and humanitarian aid.<\/p><p> The gaps between the positions taken by member states have narrowed but they remain.  They broadly reflect, in large part, the relative position of member states, whether they are net contributors or net recipients.  In seeking to broker a deal, President Van Rompuy - who has my full support - will be conscious that the outcome must be one of which each member state can take ownership.  This will not come about if the outcome is presented as one in which there are &quot;winners&quot; and &quot;losers&quot;.  We each have to be able to present what is agreed as a fair deal for all concerned.<\/p><p> As the member state currently holding the Presidency of the Council, Ireland will have a particular role to play if agreement is achieved this week.  Members are aware that it is only on conclusion of the European Council figure that the mandate is given to the Presidency to negotiate with the Parliament.  That will fall to Ireland on this occasion.  Tomorrow morning, ahead of the meeting, I will meet again with President Van Rompuy and President Barroso to discuss the work that lies ahead for these discussions and beyond.  Following an agreement it will be our responsibility to gain the formal consent of the Parliament.<\/p><p> As the House will recall from the visit of President Schulz to the D&aacute;il, the European Parliament is fully engaged with the process and is very clear on the outcomes it expects.  Ireland has repeatedly stressed the importance of any European Council deal on the MFF being one acceptable to the Parliament, which is a requirement of the Lisbon treaty from a number of years ago.  The Irish Presidency will also have responsibility for chairing discussions on many sectoral regulations underpinning the MFF, including reform of the CAP, and for negotiations and passage in discussions with the Council and the Parliament.  I expect the negotiations on Thursday to be long and difficult but I am confident a deal can be reached if there is goodwill on all sides to achieve a result.<\/p><p> On Friday, the European Council will discuss the other items on its agenda, which are trade and external relations.  The latter will include consideration of the Arab Spring and the evolving very difficult issue with Mali.  I very much welcome the discussion on trade and as Presidency we have indicated that an ambitious agenda on this front is an essential element of any drive for growth and job creation.  President Barroso will brief the meeting on trade-related issues, on which the Commission plays a strong leadership role.  This discussion will come at a time of unprecedented expansion of the EU's trade policy agenda.<\/p><p> Trade has never been more important for the EU economy and our discussions this week are most timely.  Approximately 30 million jobs in the EU depend on sales to the rest of the world, an increase of 10 million jobs since 1995; this is equivalent to the total workforce working for the manufacturing industry in the EU.  Over the next two years, 90% of world growth will be generated outside the EU.  It is estimated that an ambitious trade agenda could lead to an overall increase of 2% in growth and the creation of over 2 million new jobs across the EU in the medium term.  This would be most welcome, especially at a time when there are 26 million unemployed across the EU.  An active trade policy is therefore a key condition of success both to economic recovery and to job creation.  This fact is recognised by all leaders.<\/p><p> To benefit fully from the potential trade has to offer, the EU must also invest in increasing its internal competitiveness, making better use of untapped potential of the Single Market, opening up trade in services, strengthening the industrial basis in Europe and enhancing Europe's place in global supply chains.  These drivers of growth are mutually reinforcing.  I expect the European Council will prioritise those trade measures that will provide most benefit in terms of growth and jobs to the EU, and we must seize the opportunity of higher levels of growth abroad, both in emerging economies and in peer economies.  Immediate priority will be given to developing our bilateral trade agenda in the absence of momentum towards a more comprehensive multilateral approach.<\/p><p> With regard to emerging economies, we should continue to strive to bring these economies to our level of openness.  This will bring benefits to developed and developing countries alike.  In this respect, the EU is actively pursuing its trade relationship with Russia, China, India, MERCUSOR and ASEAN countries, as well as with emerging markets closer to home.  In the short term however, the biggest potential for growth lies in forwarding our new generation free trade agreements with peer economies.  Advancing the agreements will bring challenges for the EU and for our negotiating partners alike, such as Japan, Canada and the US, but it will ultimately bring longer term benefits for growth and jobs.<\/p><p>In this regard, the EU-US high level working group on jobs and growth has been actively engaged in finding ways to tap into the significant potential of this bilateral trade and investment relationship.  The working group will present its final report in the near future.  We have stated that if it makes a positive recommendation, as is widely anticipated, we will do all that we can to advance matters during our term in the Presidency.  If possible, we would like to see agreement by the Council on an EU negotiating mandate during the Irish Presidency.  I have raised this matter with President Barroso, President Van Rompuy, Mr. Martin Schulz, MEP, and President Obama when I spoke to him by telephone after his re-election.  <\/p><p> Foreign policy issues will be addressed by leaders during the working session on Friday morning.  We will review Europe's relations with its southern neighbours two years after the first democratic uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt in early 2011.  Such a review is appropriate given the momentous changes that have swept across the Arab world in the past 24 months.<\/p><p> The other foreign policy item on the agenda this week will be the crisis in Mali, a key foreign policy priority for the European Union which continues to be of serious concern.  It is welcome that leaders will address this pressing and critical issue.  President Hollande, who visited Mali last week, may brief partners on the latest developments on the ground in Mali where French forces are active.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, will elaborate further on both of these foreign policy issues in his contribution.  <\/p><p> I look forward to playing a full, active and constructive part in the discussions in a national capacity as leader of the Government and as Presidency in this week's deliberations on each of the items on the agenda.  As I stated, this meeting is important for Ireland and the European Union.  Concluding negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework will mark a significant achievement for the European Union and one which will contribute positively to our Presidency objectives of stability, growth and jobs.  I will report back to the House on my return from the Council. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600013#L02600","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360153500,"counter":142,"content":"<p>We will shortly mark two years since the Government took office.  This anniversary will see another outpouring of the self-congratulation which has become the hallmark of this Administration.  The clear and growing disillusionment of members of the public with the Government is directly linked to its non-stop claims of action and leadership which do not have the slightest connection to reality.  It is obvious to anyone who cares to examine the evidence that the Government does not have a strategy on Europe, other than a hope that something will turn up.  It has shown an inexplicable reluctance to set out Ireland's case with clarity and urgency, has not undertaken any credible diplomatic initiative and has refused to provide the public with even basic information.  It has put domestic party politics ahead of using the strongest arguments available to Ireland.  It has also made, in full, the first repayment of the promissory note, while claiming it did not do so and has used most of its energy trying to claim credit for deals won by others and automatically extended to other countries.<\/p><p>  As we rapidly approach the Government's self-declared deadline for the promissory notes, a pattern of dissembling complacency has been replaced by full-scale panic.  All of the evidence available is that the Government's approach is doing active damage to Ireland's interests.  Annoyance is growing at its inconsistent line, regular over-spinning of both minor and non-existent developments and use of contradictory arguments.  For example, the Taoiseach states Ireland is already back in the bond market, while the T&aacute;naiste states we are shut out of the market and facing a catastrophe unless the European Central Bank scraps most of the promissory note payments.  The latter tells Europe that the Government could fall apart without a deal while the former informs the House the Government is rock solid and will be in place for a full five years, irrespective of what happens.  Some Ministers have indicated that a deal will be used to stop the implementation of planned cuts, while others rushed out to claim all planned cuts and targets will remain fully in place.  On occasion, at the same time albeit on different media outlets, one Minister will say negotiations are hitting obstacles, while another will claim everything is going grand. <\/p><p>  The hard reality is that the Government has not supplied the D&aacute;il or Irish people with a single piece of proper or factual information about anything to do with the current negotiations.  Having spent a year and a half relegating the promissory notes to something to be handled by officials at a technical level, we have suddenly seen a burst of statements and activity.  In what one journalist described as unprecedented in her many years of covering Presidencies, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste have suddenly started discussing promissory notes at European Council events which have nothing to do with the issue.  She further stated that the reaction against the Government's behaviour has been very negative and it has not done anything to help Ireland's cause.  Why the T&aacute;naiste believed the EU-South America summit would take up Ireland's cause has yet to be explained. <\/p><p>  This new burst of activity is purely about a Government trying to be seen to be doing something rather than actually getting something done.  As both the European Council and Commission have stated repeatedly, while they wish Ireland well, they do not have anything to do with the final decision which is a matter for Ireland and the European Central Bank.  It would have been a significant help to Ireland if the Council or Commission had stated formally that they do not consider that helping Ireland is prohibited under the ECB's statutes or the European treaties.  Such a step would helped last year when the ECB President, Mario Draghi, was launching his radical moves to save the euro.  However, this major moment of opportunity was missed. <\/p><p>  Everything that is known about the negotiations has been supplied by journalists and ECB spokespersons.  Two weeks ago, the Government claimed everything was going fine, even though it was fully aware that things were far from being fine.  In the days subsequent to the Government's claim, a media report revealed that the ECB council has reacted negatively.  Although first denied by the Government, the report was later confirmed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, in one of his truth-telling episodes that do so much to annoy his senior colleagues. <\/p><p>  A growing number of newspaper and broadcast journalists have exposed major differences between the Government's public statements and what is actually taking place.  Each time the Government dismisses the work of these journalists, it subsequently emerges that the information they revealed was correct.  The first such case occurred following the Taoiseach's first summit meeting when he claimed he rejected a demand that other leaders have said was never made.  For almost a year, we were informed a breakthrough had been achieved because a joint technical paper was being drawn up, only to discover that no such technical paper existed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600015#N00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1360153500,"counter":143,"content":"<p>There are mountains of technical papers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600015#N00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1360153500,"counter":144,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach may recall that I looked for the paper for months but it never appeared.  We now learn it did not exist, although the Taoiseach got a good year out of it in the House.<\/p><p>  As was written yesterday, Government Ministers have cried wolf on Europe too many times and no one any longer believes their public statements.  As the Taoiseach is aware, he and his colleagues produced a budget and White Paper which laid out, on the basis of existing commitments, that Ireland would achieve full market re-entry, growth and debt sustainability.  Today, he informed the House that this was untrue and these objectives could not be achieved without a deal with the European Central Bank.  Less than two months after the budget, he tells us that the fundamental economic basis on which it was presented and pushed through the House was false.  He has a duty to inform the House and Irish people what is the bottom line for the current negotiations and what is required to avoid the catastrophe the T&aacute;naiste has predicted.<\/p><p>  I reiterate that every Member of the House wants the Government to get as much as possible out of the negotiations.  Outside a handful of Ministers, however, no one believes the negotiations have been handled competently or with the urgency they deserve.  Some are advocating policies which sound like those advocated by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, before the previous general election.  Their proposals are as credible as the T&aacute;naiste's were at that time.<\/p><p>  Members of the Opposition have limited opportunities to have even a peripheral impact on negotiations such as these.  As the Taoiseach is aware, however, I and my party have used the opportunities available to us to impress upon other countries and the European institutions that there is a broad national consensus in favour of the idea of lifting the impact of bank related debt on Irish people.  While the Taoiseach waited a year and a half to make the case that Ireland's debt was incurred substantially as a result of European Central Bank pressure, we have made this case repeatedly. <\/p><p>The Taoiseach is wrong to state that Ireland wants to swap an expensive overdraft for a cheap long-term loan.  What Ireland has in the notes is a low cost short-term loan.  As the Government finally seems to understand, the interest on the notes is nominally high, yet all but a small amount returns to the Exchequer.  The net interest position of the promissory notes is low.<\/p><p> We need a deal because we do not want to swap low cost short-term loans for much higher cost medium-term debt.  The best deal would involve a combination of an effective write-off and a long-term low interest series of bonds for the remainder.  At a minimum, we need a deal that places the debt on a much longer term and at the lowest possible rate.<\/p><p> The notes were to have been an exceptional measure, taken at a moment of extreme instability.  Ireland did not wish to incur the full debt.  The notes were created at a unique moment that does not set a precedent.  Underlying circumstances have changed fundamentally.  The basic framework for dealing with bank debt is different.<\/p><p> First, rescue funds have been put in place that will give a guarantee to the effect that governments will not be left alone when tackling bank debt crises.  Second, the ECB has introduced a wide range of new policies underpinning the liquidity and solvency of the banking system, which means that fears of contagion from individual failing banks have been removed.  Third, and vital for Ireland's banks, Europe has moved from obsessively seeking to avoid burning bank bondholders to seeking to require their burning before state investment is allowed.  In a succession of countries, the cost of saving banks has been cut by bailing in bondholders.  It is no longer possible for a country to find itself in Ireland's situation, in that we needed to tackle the collapsing banking system without access to new supports and was obliged to honour all of its debts.<\/p><p> Ireland's case for relief from the full impact of these debts is strong.  We were denied choices now opened to others.  We took action in solidarity with a wider European system that was terrified of contagion.  It would be economically and politically damaging to Ireland and Europe were the latter to fail to respond to these facts.<\/p><p> There are a number of technical barriers to Ireland achieving its ideal deal, that is, the writing off of a significant portion of debt.  However, only one significant decision is required to deliver us the minimum that we need.  As was again confirmed in this morning's newspapers, an ECB council that is increasingly irritated by the Government's grandstanding is holding the line that a write-off would effectively involve the monetary financing of a government, which is undeniably prohibited under the Union's laws.  This ban is deeply damaging and represents the difference between the eurozone and other more indebted currency areas that have stronger growth rates, lower borrowing costs and lower levels of unemployment.<\/p><p> However, this is not an insurmountable barrier to helping Ireland.  Giving Ireland the deal it needs would be a clear continuation of efforts to stabilise the financial system and protect the common currency.  All actions to achieve these objectives are fully within the competence of the ECB.  If the ECB's measures to reduce the cost of sovereign borrowing are legally acceptable, only by a bizarre twist of logic could restructuring our debts be illegal.  Helping Ireland does not threaten the ECB's inflation targets, create a damaging precedent or lead to a backlash from member states.<\/p><p> Instead of giving us more banal generalities about what the Taoiseach is doing while presiding over a chaotic and damaging series of outbursts from various Ministers, he must clearly outline what we want and what we will do if we do not get it.  Apparently, the T&aacute;naiste has told the rest of Europe and all of South America that we are facing a catastrophe and the dissolution of the Government.  The Taoiseach smiles at this comment.  During Leaders' Questions in the past two days, he avoided the issue, but this is what the T&aacute;naiste stated.  More importantly, this is what his people are telling the media.  Since last week, a clear difference in opinion has emerged in the Labour Party as regards its view of this issue.  One could argue that doing so puts party before every other interest, but the word &quot;catastrophic&quot; was used.  The dissolution of the Government in the event of a failure to get a deal has been crazily articulated by a T&aacute;naiste.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach has discussed the matter with him.  The Taoiseach should ask the T&aacute;naiste what he means and tell the House whether he really means it, whether it is spin or whether it is the truth.  Is this an issue over which the Labour Party is contemplating walking out of government?<\/p><p> It is not good enough for the T&aacute;naiste to make this comment or to claim that he made it to Chancellor Angela Merkel at an EU-South American summit and that he has authorised people to brief on his behalf about the dissolution of the Government being on the cards if a deal is not achieved.  The T&aacute;naiste also needs to spell out what he meant by &quot;catastrophic&quot;.  To be fair, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated yesterday that he was surprised by all of the panic and by people's wish to bring the issue to a head now.  He can only have been referring to the T&aacute;naiste, Labour spokespersons and people from the Labour Party who were briefing.  There is a significant chasm between the Minister's approach to this issue and the T&aacute;naiste's.  The latter is on the road to megaphone diplomacy and grandstanding, perhaps for party political interests.  We do not know.  The man charged with overseeing the negotiations, the Minister for Finance, is singing a different tune and, in his own inimitable style, rebuking the T&aacute;naiste and his colleagues for their behaviour and actions on this front.<\/p><p> As the Head of Government, the Taoiseach owes it to the D&aacute;il to clarify the situation instead of making large, &quot;rock solid&quot; statements.  Someone needs to spell out what the T&aacute;naiste means by his comments and the authorised briefings.<\/p><p> A panicked response to poor polls and backbench unrest is doing damage to Ireland's cause and must stop.  Regardless of what occurs by 31 March, the Taoiseach knows that he will claim it as a victory won through a brilliant strategy.  If there was less grandstanding and a bit more honesty between now and then, it would do Ireland's cause much more good.<\/p><p> It looks as though a budget will be agreed at this summit following the work of President Van Rompuy.  It is a bad budget deal for Europe because it stops the EU from playing a serious role in helping to restore growth and job creation, particularly in the hardest hit regions.  It is a budget framed with a narrow view of Europe, one that makes many demands of the Union but refuses to give it the resources to meet those demands.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach stated that the summit's focus will be on cuts.  President Van Rompuy has already cut back the budget from the Commission's target and, to bring everyone on board, claims that it must be cut again.  This is occurring in the middle of the worst recession that Europe has faced since the late 1920s.  There is a genuine case as well as capacity for a pan-European stimulus for the European economy.  As the Taoiseach stated, 90% of world growth in the next two years will happen outside of Europe.  There is no sense of urgency in the EU's external agenda.  The budget is a pitiful failure as a proper response to the crisis in which Europe and its citizens, particularly those who are unemployed, have found themselves.  I get no sense from the Taoiseach's speech or from Ireland's-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600015#N00400","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360154100,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I am loath to interrupt, but we will be tight for time at the end of this debate.

The budget will have direct repercussions on the size of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the scale of the cheques that farmers will receive and will undermine the good work done in the past five to six years in terms of agriculture and food development.<\/p><p>  Following Prime Minister Cameron's recent speech, the background to every summit will be the fact that a member state has, for the first time, started a discussion about leaving the Union.  Ireland does not want the UK to leave the Union, but we need to end our silence on the Tory agenda.  The speech was dressed up with positive words, but if one looks beyond them, one finds a bleak vision for the Union.  The list of powers that he cited for repatriation comes down to a demand that the EU cease to exist and become simply a free trade area.  However, even this would be almost impossible to achieve, as the regulations that give the Single Market its impact would be impossible under the Tory agenda.  If even a fraction of what is being demanded was conceded, the terms of Ireland's membership of the Union would be changed, requiring a referendum that would have no chance of passing.<\/p><p>  As European issues have mounted, the Government's refusal to set out its policy is stark.<\/p><p>What does Ireland want the Union to become?  How does it see it developing?  Agreeing to everything except changes that require a referendum is not a policy.

However, first I wish to deal with the ongoing negotiations on the promissory note.  Two weeks ago it was reported that the ECB refused to endorse an Irish proposal on the promissory note.  I understand from media reports that a new proposal will be brought by the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Honohan, to the ECB this week.  The critical issue in all of this is not whether a deal is done but precisely what kind of deal is agreed.  Sinn F&eacute;in's position is clear.  We want the Government to secure a deal and we wish it well in that regard, but it must be a deal that removes the toxic banking debt from the shoulders of Irish citizens.<\/p><p><br \/>  From the outset the Government has approached this issue in the wrong way.  Rather than stating, as the Taoiseach did in the D&aacute;il, that we would not have the word &quot;defaulter&quot; written on our foreheads, he should have said that it is not our debt.  He should have sought a write-down but he did not even ask for one and he has still not asked.  He should have told our European partners that this debt is not sustainable and the Irish people simply cannot pay it.  He still has the opportunity to do it.<\/p><p><br \/>  Sinn F&eacute;in does not accept that debt restructuring, as proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il, or paying the debt over a longer timeframe is a credible deal for taxpayers.  The notes should not be paid.  The people of the State, on a <i>per capita<\/i> basis, have already contributed more to the banking crisis and the stabilising of the entire European banking system than any other EU state.  It is time we got assistance from our EU partners.  The citizens of the State have just had their sixth austerity budget, bringing the total in taxes and cuts to &#8364;28 billion to date.  By December 2013 we are due to have made &#8364;31 billion in tax adjustments and cuts to our economy.  The sum of &#8364;31 billion is what the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il want us to pay into what remains of the bad banks, namely Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, now the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  Every billion paid to the IBRC is a cut to the health budget, an increase in PRSI, a new property tax, more overcrowding in classrooms, more workers out of jobs, more families struggling to make ends meet, more Garda stations being closed and more nurses emigrating.<\/p><p><br \/>  The third instalment of &#8364;3.1 billion worth of promissory notes is due to be paid to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation on 31 March.  Any deal on the bank debt must bring relief for citizens.  A deal must mean a reduction in the cuts and taxes to be faced in the next budget.  Could the Taoiseach tell us what impact he expects a debt deal to have on next year&#8217;s budgetary situation?  Will a deal on debt result in a windfall for the State and will the Taoiseach assure us that any benefit from it will be used to reduce the burden of austerity on citizens?  Could he also inform the House whether last year&#8217;s payment of the promissory note is part of the current negotiations?  Last year&#8217;s payment was covered by the issue of a bond to Bank Of Ireland which is due to be redeemed in May at a cost of &#8364;3.1 billion plus &#8364;90 million in interest to Bank of Ireland.  Where will the money come from?<\/p><p><br \/>  I wish to deal briefly with the negotiations on the EU budget.  The Government holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  In every negotiation the Government must argue for a budget that is fit-for-purpose and that brings an end to austerity.  The budget must also tackle the enormous issue of unemployment in the State and across the EU.  There is much talk and rhetoric from the EU about jobs stimulus and measures to drive the jobs and growth agenda.  At the same time many in the EU are looking to cut, or at the very least not to increase, the budget,  One cannot do both.  In the negotiations the Government must be on the side of investing in jobs and growth.  An Teachta Crowe will deal with this issue in more detail, in particular on the scandalous issue of youth unemployment.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Presidency should also be used to protect our vital national interests.  That includes securing a well-funded and fair Common Agricultural Policy which prioritises the needs of working farmers.  I also hope the Presidency can secure a PEACE IV programme in order that the good work of the PEACE programmes to date is not squandered.  Last week Mr. Martin McGuinness and Mr. Peter Robinson were in Brussels pressing the case for additional PEACE funding to continue.  Will the Government support those efforts?<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, I raise the issue of Ireland&#8217;s European Parliament representation.  The European Parliament is currently considering a proposal which would reduce the number of MEPs in the State from 12 to 11.  The proposal before the Parliament would leave most of the bigger states with their full complement of MEPs while medium to small-sized states, including this one, could lose seats.  Sinn F&eacute;in argued in successive referendum campaigns that there is a drift towards greater centralisation of decision-making at EU level and a reduction in the influence of smaller states such as this one.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ms Martina Anderson, MEP, has tabled an amendment to this proposal within the Parliament to attempt to preserve the State's current complement of seats.  The Government has been silent on the issue and seems almost unconcerned at the prospect of a further diminution of our say in Europe.  Will the Taoiseach inform us of the Government's position on the issue?  Does he support the reduction in seats or does he plan to lobby to maintain our current complement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600017#P01300","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1360154700,"counter":161,"content":"<p>It is essentially an issue for the European Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600017#P01400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1360154700,"counter":162,"content":"<p>An Teachta Adams referred to the ongoing EU budget negotiations.  I wish the Government well in the delicate negotiations.  I wish to refer specifically to youth unemployment and the proposed youth guarantee.  More than 5.5 million young people across the EU are not able to find work currently.  Across the European Union, 22% of people between the ages of 15 and 24 are jobless, a figure that swells to as much as 50% in Greece and Spain.  Long-term youth unemployment reveals an even starker reality: more than 30% of young people have been unemployed for more than 12 consecutive months.<\/p><p>  The CSO released figures last week which show that the number of young people on the live register in the State has risen from December to January by 1,420.  A staggering 68, 944 young people are now signing on.  The figure does not include the many thousands who have emigrated in recent months.  Many young people now see emigration as the only option open to them.  There is a responsibility on us all to respond, but even more so on the Government to ensure that deliberate and determined interventions are put in place to give young people choices and, more importantly, hope.<\/p><p>  I mentioned in the context of the European Investment Bank the importance of establishing a youth employment fund.  It appears that the position of the European Commission is that no extra money will be made available for youth unemployment or a youth guarantee.  In addition to talking about the issue, it is clear that there is a need for action.  More funding must be provided to tackle the issue.  The International Labour Organization called for the establishment of a &euro;21 billion action fund.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste to make clear the Government&rsquo;s support for such a measure in the negotiations.  The State must also provide funding to combat youth unemployment.<\/p><p>The National Youth Council called for an investment fund of &euro;300 million, an investment initiative to provide for young people who are long-term unemployed, particularly those coming from areas of high deprivation.<\/p><p> The youth jobs guarantee aims to ensue that member states guarantee every young person under the age of 25 a job, training or education placement within a set number of months of becoming unemployed.  Sinn F&eacute;in recently met representatives of the National Youth Council of Ireland.  While welcoming support for a youth jobs guarantee, it again raised a number of concerns about it.  The evaluation of the youth guarantee schemes implemented in Sweden and Finland indicate that they have reduced youth unemployment and inactivity.  However, they were found to be more effective for young people who were new to the labour market than to those who were long-term unemployed.  Yesterday one of the committees met Swedish representatives and we talked about the issue of youth unemployment.  We get a sense from many groups which come before committees that there is no sense of difficulties faced by many countries across Europe and there does not seem to be any urgency to address them.  I assume that reflects back on many of the countries involved in these negotiations.  There is a need to up the ante on this issue.  Will the issue of youth unemployment be discussed at the European Council?<\/p><p> A meeting of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council is to be held in Dublin this Thursday and Friday.  Is the Government aware of these concerns ahead of that meeting?  Will the Government include additional measures to support young people who are long-term unemployed to avoid the weaknesses identified in the schemes implemented in Sweden and Finland?  Additionally, young workers can often only access precarious, temporary jobs or traineeships which offer little prospect of career progression.  We know of the difficulty many young people who get temporary jobs face in terms of the rigmarole of trying to secure jobseeker's benefit or other benefits.  Changes in this area need to be made not only in this State but in other EU member states.<\/p><p> Will the Government ensure that any youth jobs guarantee will be resourced to ensure that there is sufficient high quality education, training and job experience places and the staff to provide intensive job counselling and guidance?  Will the Government lobby during EU budget negotiations to ensure it is resourced sufficiently and adequately to address the huge task involved?<\/p><p> In regard to EU Aid, Britain, Germany, Holland and Sweden are reportedly proposing a major cut in aid in the EU budget.  This is on top of President Van Rompuy's proposal in November of an 11% cut in EDF funding, compared with the figures put forward by the Commission.  Other budget lines face cuts of 7.5% on average.  European NGOs fear even steeper cuts and believe that the EU could end up spending less in 2020 than it did in 2007 on its partners in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.  Aid cuts would most likely ensure that European countries will fall short of achieving their internationally agreed targets for halving the number of people in absolute poverty under the millennium development goals for 2015.  Will the Government fight against the proposed disproportional cuts to the EU aid budget which will have a negative impact on some of the poorest people in the world?  Does the Government agree that to keep cutting the EU aid budget will hurt the EU's foreign affairs and trade interests in the long run?<\/p><p> The Taoiseach mentioned the situation in Mali.  We have seen EU member states intervene in Mali recently.  The European Union has also firmed up plans to set up a 450-strong military mission to train the Malian army.  Has the Minister, Deputy Shatter, brought a request to Cabinet on this matter and has a decision been made?  The T&aacute;naiste might inform us on that.  While there are plans to send African Union troops there as soon as possible and there has been little resistance so far, caution should be urged and there is need to highlight the potential problematic and disastrous affect intervention in the region may have in the long run.<\/p><p> Instability in the Sahel region can be directly linked to the intervention in Libya.  After the overthrow of Gadaffi, displaced tribes returned to their historic homelands and are demanding separatist rights for their states in that area.  That has not gone away with European intervention and it will not go away with African Union intervention.  I urge the EU to look beyond its immediate action of sending a military training force to Mali later this month, and wonder will the EU show the same interest and urgency for the future development of Sahel for the benefit of the ordinary people who live there.<\/p><p> While the EU and Economic Community of West African States are pushing ahead with their plans to send more troops to the region and to hold elections by 31 July, what plans are there to listen to what the people in northern Mali want?  What plans does the EU have to address the rampant corruption of the central government?  What plans are in place to stop another coup?  This does not appear to be what is being discussed.  There is only talk of radical Islamist forces and the threat to Europe.  Will the T&aacute;naiste raise the real needs of the ordinary people who live in Mali when discussing the issue with his colleagues?<\/p><p> There was no mention of the problem in Syria and there has been the recent intervention of Israeli forces in relation to that conflict.  The situation there seems to be getting worse rather than better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600017#P01500","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360155300,"counter":164,"content":"<p>The next time slot will be shared by Deputies Wallace, Boyd Barrett, Ross and Mattie McGrath.

He went on to say: \"We are in the bailout not because we burnt the bondholders but because we did not burn the bondholders ... and now the situation confronting us is that we are due to pay &euro;3 billion at the end of March, we are owing another &euro;3 billion on 1 June when the Bank of Ireland's bond for last year's payment is due, and we are due [to pay] a third &euro;3 billion in March 2014 - that is &euro;9 billion\" in just over a year as well as the money to follow.  He argued that \"it is very unlikely that the ECB would withdraw liquidity from the Irish system; it certainly would throw the whole system into chaos\".  He also said that \"the risk of targeted interest rate increases on the banks is possible but I think you have to weigh up that risk against a risk of\" paying out all this money.<\/p><p>  It reminds us of what happened after the First World War when the Germans were too heavily penalised and the reparations which initially amounted to the equivalent of 96,000 tonnes of gold were later reduced to just over 40,000 tonnes but it created such problems for German society and undermined the fabric of it so much that it facilitated the rise of Hitler.  I would like the T&aacute;naiste to bring the point to Europe that the fabric of our society is being undermined by the debts we are expected to pay and the level of unfairness involved.  It will cause further problems down the road for Irish society and it has done nothing to deal with the level of inequality that exists here which is also becoming a huge problem.  Most economists would agree that inequality is a huge risk to financial stability.  The Europeans should take this on board a bit more.<\/p><p>  The Europeans have set targets on the assumption that economies would recover despite the tightening of fiscal policy but in a balance sheet recession when the private sector is cutting spending to reduce its over-indebtedness, that assumption is wrong.  Put simply, we cannot all deleverage at once.  To save more, one spends less and if the eurozone, including this Government, does that, the economy has to shrink.<\/p><p>There are 6 million people unemployed in Spain and in the south of that country, 66% of those aged between 24 and 30 are unemployed.  There are huge problems coming down the tracks there.  It is clear that austerity has been self-defeating for Spain.<\/p><p> There must be a U-turn in EU thinking because the current thinking is undermining democracy.  Democracy is being frowned upon now and there is an idea out there that in this complex economic situation, the majority of people are not qualified to decide what is best.  The belief seems to be that people are unaware of the catastrophic consequences that might ensue if their demands were met but the truth of the matter is that the crisis offers proof that the experts themselves do not know what they are doing.  In western Europe we are witnessing a growing inability of the ruling elite - the treatment of Greece being a prime example - to solve the crisis and unfortunately the blind appear to be leading the blind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600018#Q00300","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360155900,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Debt and jobs are the Moses and prophets for this country and for Europe.  Everything else is secondary relative to those two issues.  Unlike Deputy Martin - who just took a political pot shot for the sake of it in terms of the T&aacute;naiste raising the issue of the promissory notes and debt in Latin America - I have no problem with the T&aacute;naiste raising the promissory notes in Latin America, at EU Council meetings and on any and every platform he can.  He absolutely should do so, both for the people of this country and for the people of Europe as a whole.  However, when he raises it, is it just theatrics or are we serious?  Is there serious intent behind it?  Is there a red line being put up where we say that we are not crossing this line if the EU does not give us a deal that makes a difference to the debt and to jobs?  The two are directly connected because every euro we have to pay out to bondholders and banks is a euro that we cannot invest in jobs.  The equation is simple and it is not just simple in this country but in Europe also.  If the priority is bailing out banks, then we do not have the money for jobs and investment collapses.  If we do not have investment, there will be no jobs.  On current projections, even in the best-case scenario - I have repeated this on numerous occasions and I hope at some point members of the media will focus on it - unemployment will only be down to 13.5% in 2015.  Is that the vista that we have to look forward to?  If that is our strategy and if that is our best outcome, it is nothing.  It offers no hope to the people who are desperate for jobs and for our economy as a whole because if we do not get people back to work, our economy is banjaxed and will continue to be banjaxed.<\/p><p>  What, apart from appeals, are we saying to the European authorities to back up those appeals?  Is there any red line?  Is the Government saying to the authorities that they must give us a serious and meaningful deal, not one that is just stringing it out but a deal that will make a serious difference to the budget arithmetic next year and our ability to have funds to invest in jobs and economic growth?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600019#R00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1360155900,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I am very disappointed in the Taoiseach's speech because it fails to address the one issue which is on everybody's lips and on everybody's mind, that is, the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes and the legacy debt.  I was even more disappointed when I read the following sentence: \"We need to ensure that national interests do not outweigh broader EU interests\".  If one is President of the European Union, there is very little point in not using that to one's advantage.  There seems to be a great temptation on the part of the Irish Government to use this as a photo opportunity and the evidence for that is in the media every day.  This is our great opportunity, at a time of crisis, not to talk about the MFF being top of the agenda, achieving this and that for Europe, as contained in the speech, but to wear the green jersey and to play for Ireland.  It is time, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, to say that at the top of the agenda will be the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes, to put that in the European pipe and let them smoke it.<\/p><p>  It is time that we used the position we are in to our advantage.  Imagine the French, with their great tradition of selfish, chauvinistic nationalism, being in the pickle we are in now and not using the Presidency of the European Union to their own advantage.  If it means being obstructive of EU business, let us be obstructive because we are in a crisis situation.  We need to go to the European Council meetings and insist that at the top of the agenda are the two matters that are vital to Ireland, which are squeezing the blood and oxygen out of the country.  They are the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes, on which we demand a write-off, and the EU legacy debt, where we are being betrayed by the day.  Long-fingering Ireland has gone on for long enough.  Here we are, in this key position, towing the French and German line, day after day.<\/p><p>  I make a plea to the T&aacute;naiste not to go to South America to issue threats of a general election.  He should issue such threats in Europe and should do so publicly, if that is what he believes.  That is the only language which will be understood in this critical situation in which we find ourselves.  I beg the T&aacute;naiste to take these current negotiations to every single forum and not to be on the back foot.

The T&aacute;naiste went Chile to utter his chilling words about what might happen at home.  We heard lots of chilling words from him when he was in Opposition.  Indeed, they were very chilling, some of them were very nasty and were downright insulting to the then Taoiseach, but that is for another day.  I wish to be conciliatory in what I say to the T&aacute;naiste.  I accept that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have a responsibility to Europe because Ireland has the Presidency, which I welcome, but we should use it to our advantage.  <\/p><p>  We must remember that they are all coming into our parlour.  We are not meeting them in Chile, Germany or France.  They will be in our parlour, in the nice comfortable surroundings of Dublin Castle, a venue that has panache and may give the impression of a wealthy country.  That is the time to raise it, nicely and calmly.  It is the place to draw attention to what the T&aacute;naiste said in Chile and to point out that he got a mandate from the electorate to raise the issues of the promissory note and bank debt.  This is crisis point and the time for talking is over.  The time for insults and for denigrating our situation in Ireland is gone.   I listened to an eminent German economist last night and could not believe how frank and honest he was.  I do not know his pedigree but I thought he was going to say something along the lines of &quot;let them eat cake&quot;.<\/p><p>He was asking, bluntly, what kind of people we are to pay this debt and how much more do we have to pay.  Are we to adore the lords from Europe?  It is time to put the foot down.  If the Taoiseach is not capable of doing it I beg the T&aacute;naiste to do it.  He showed that steeliness when he was in opposition.  His own colleagues are asking, and saying to me in private, where is the T&aacute;naiste we knew.  What happened to him?  My own former party had a similar experience with the former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen.  We could see steeliness and robustness and we were very disappointed with his performance in government.<\/p><p> The electorate is disheartened and disenchanted.  They want hope.  It may be, before it is too late, that the T&aacute;naiste can give them some ray of hope that he respects the mandate they gave him.  Will he honour that mandate and do what he promised, which is to speak up for Ireland and get some recognition of the people's misery and penury and the futility of going forward with further austerity?  Must they be made to take up the debts of gangsters, chancers and rogue bankers?  That is nothing short of what they were.  The T&aacute;naiste knows that.  He treated them with indignation when he was on this side of the House.  Why the change?  Are the civil servants completely and utterly in charge of the Government?  I am delighted the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has come to the House for the end of this debate.  Have civil servants taken the Government in, hook, line and sinker, and are they writing their speeches, training them how to talk and giving them the politicalspeak when they go out in public?  The Ministers must assert themselves, look into their hearts and speak for the people of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600019#R00400","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360156500,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Is that the same Deputy Mattie McGrath who voted for the bank guarantee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600020#S00200","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1360156500,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Yes.

As the Taoiseach said, this week's meeting of the European Council is an important one, for the European Union and for Ireland.<\/p><p>  Finding an agreement on the MFF will represent a welcome shot in the arm for the European Union and its member states.  On Monday, I chaired the General Affairs Council and we were briefed by President Van Rompuy on the MFF.  From what was said at that meeting, the task facing President Van Rompuy, who is charged with steering the discussions this week, will not be an easy one.  While good progress was made in November, it is clear that difficult issues remain to be resolved.  The President is faced with a position where some countries are seeking further cuts in order to secure agreement while arguments for increased spending in particular areas are being advanced by other member states.  Sometimes, indeed, the arguments for cuts and increased spending are being made by the same country.  It will require all member states approaching the table with minds open to compromise if agreement is to be found.<\/p><p>  Of course, agreement at the European Council is a first step to putting the framework in place.  The treaties require that the consent of the European Parliament must also be secured.  On Monday, therefore, I also met the MFF team from the European Parliament as preparation for the work we will have to do, as holders of the Presidency, after the agreement.  It was clear to me that their support cannot be taken for granted.  Particular issues have been highlighted as being of particular concern to the Parliament, including flexibility, its own resources and a mid-term review, and the Parliament will weigh any outcome carefully before reaching a decision.<\/p><p>  In opening the debate today, the Taoiseach highlighted the important discussion the European Council will have on trade.  I share the assessment that an ambitious trade agenda is an essential element of any plan for generating growth and creating jobs in Europe.  The achievement of an EU-US trade agreement is a great prize.  A high level working group has been engaged in finding ways to tap into this huge potential and we are awaiting its report.  It is widely expected that it will come out with a strong positive message recommending the opening of negotiations towards a free trade agreement.  We have said that if this is the case, we will make every effort towards agreement in the Council on a mandate during the term of our Presidency.  This is an area where Irish and European interests are absolutely aligned.<\/p><p>  This week's European Council will also provide an occasion to consider two important foreign policy issues, the Arab Spring and the situation in Mali.  The European Council will review Europe's relations with its southern neighbours two years after the first democratic uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt in early 2011.  Such a review is timely, given the momentous changes that have transformed the Arab world over the past 24 months.  The EU strongly supports the process of democratic transition that is underway.  We will continue to do so, while respecting clearly that it is ultimately for the countries concerned to best determine their own pace of political and economic reform.  The European Council is likely to invite High Representative Catherine Ashton and the Foreign Affairs Council to review the effectiveness of the EU's current policies and instruments in assisting the political and economic transition of the region and to report back by next June.<\/p><p>  On Syria, draft conclusions have been prepared calling for an immediate end to the violence and reiterating support for the efforts of the UN and Arab League joint special representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to achieve a political solution.  The European Council is also likely to reaffirm the EU's commitment to continue providing aid to address the appalling humanitarian situation in Syria and its neighbouring countries.  The total EU contribution in humanitarian aid since the start of 2012 now amounts to over &euro;830 million.  Last week, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, announced a further Irish contribution of &euro;4.7 million, bringing our total humanitarian assistance to Syria, over the past year, to &euro;7.1 million.<\/p><p>  I welcome the fact that the leaders will adopt conclusions on Mali, which is of pressing concern.  This week's European Council will review the latest developments on the ground and on the political track.  We welcome the adoption by the Mali Government of a roadmap towards political reform and elections, and this has been approved by the Mali Parliament.  We also welcome the accelerated deployment of the UN authorised African peacekeeping force, AFISMA.  While the situation remains volatile, the EU is playing a significant role in support of Mali and its neighbours through political and diplomatic engagement, the deployment of the European Union training mission, humanitarian assistance, and financial and logistical support for the Mali authorities and the regional military force.  We are, of course, concerned by reports of human rights violations and are continuing to monitor all developments closely.<\/p><p>  It is evident that this week's European Council meeting has an extremely full agenda ahead of it, with the aim of concluding the MFF negotiations as well as considering an important range of other issues which will impact on us economically or politically to one degree or another.<\/p><p>  The House can be assured that Irish interests will be advocated and defended at every opportunity in the formal agenda of the European Council.  With regard to the national interests which the Government is pursuing on behalf of the country I assure Members that we lose no opportunity to make our case forcefully and, I hope, effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600020#S00900","speaker":"951"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1360156500,"counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600020#S00950"},{"type":"speech","time":1360156500,"counter":180,"content":"<p>The Select sub-Committee on Environment, Community and Local Government has concluded its consideration of the Electoral (Amendment) (D&aacute;il Constituencies) Bill 2012 and has made no amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600020#S01000","speaker":"957"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1360156500,"counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600020#S01050"},{"type":"speech","time":1360156500,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Jonathan O'Brien - the relocation of Blackpool Post Office, Cork city;

Some tend not to believe this because, apparently, everything we say in this House is supposed to be untrue.  Sometimes, after appointments have been made on merit, I have opened the following day's newspaper to read an account of how somebody, of whose political engagements or involvements I had no knowledge, was either the relation of some Member of this House or had some time in the distant past apparently acted as an adviser to a Member of this House in some capacity on some particular issue.  I want to state clearly that when the judicial appointments board makes a recommendation regarding appointments my policy is to look through the appointments, consult the Attorney General and make recommendations to Cabinet based on persons' capacities.  The truth is on occasions it is difficult as to who should be chosen because often there are a number of persons eminently qualified for the job.<\/p><p>  I do not know whether the figure the Deputy gives is correct.  I remember reading in some newspaper it had decided, in the context of all the appointments this Government has made, that 30% of the individuals had some political affiliation or other.  I do not find that surprising because some lawyers tend to be political active.  If one could look at it the other way, if that figure is correct, presumably it was the 30% that would have got the headline, not the 70% of appointments that had no political affiliation.  Unfortunately, it is the way it is dealt with.<\/p><p>  I do not believe the current system is right.  I believe it is time for reform.  We must be careful how we do it.  We need to ensure that, ultimately, there is accountability to this House for appointments made in the shape of a Minister being accountable, as I am, on behalf of the Government.  We cannot have a system whereby, as has been suggested elsewhere, existing members of the Judiciary and representatives of the legal profession would themselves simply select the next lot of members of the Judiciary because there would be no political democratic accountability of any nature.  The difficulty with such lack of accountability - I am not suggesting any current judge would do this - is that particular group making appointments may make appointments of persons who they know better than others.<\/p><p>  We must be careful in how we proceed.  I am looking forward to getting the result of the departmental internal efficient deliberations and the suggestions that have come to me and I am giving thought to creating a consultative process around that before we move it forward.

We gave substantial consideration to those observations within my Department following which I conveyed relevant drafting instructions to the Attorney General in November 2012.  There was already a prepared Bill which needed improvement and the drafting instructions are to facilitate the completion of that work.  Unfortunately, there is some delay in that work because priority must be given to the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 where there is substantial work underway on Committee Stage amendments.  I hope we will be able to take, or at least start, Committee Stage before Easter.

While the issuing of such notice does not constitute commencement of legal proceedings, it normally leads to a prosecution if the charge is not paid.<\/p><p>  There can be circumstances, however, where the fixed charge notice may be cancelled, in accordance with Garda procedures drawn up in the light of legislative exemptions and prosecutorial guidelines.  Cancellation occurs where it is believed the evidence would not sustain a prosecution or a prosecution would not be appropriate, fair or proportionate.  The procedures provide authority to district officers, or inspectors acting as district officers, and an inspector in the fixed charge processing office to cancel fixed charge notices.<\/p><p>  Cancellation can occur in circumstances where, for example, exemptions apply to emergency vehicles or the wearing of seatbelts, or where there are evidential difficulties, such as where the registration number registered by a speed camera does not correspond to the vehicle in question, or where there are emergency medical circumstances such as, for example, a sick child being driven to hospital, an imminent birth, or a medical professional rushing to a sick or elderly patient.

However, it is important not to assume that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are dishonest, corrupt or unable to carry out their duties properly.  Unfortunately that seems to be an assumption he is making.  I will again reiterate what I said.  I take this matter seriously, as does the Garda Commissioner, and it is being fully investigated.  I will not prejudge that investigation.  The issue as to the rules applicable to cancelling fixed charges are as I stated and are not confined to the matter to which the Deputy refers.<\/p><p>  I believe it is appropriate, as I believe most members of the House do, that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can exercise discretion in the manner in which they deal with certain matters and apply a degree of common sense.  The important thing is that no special favour is done for any individual, that nothing wrong is done in return for receipt of any moneys and that no individuals are prosecuted in circumstances that are unfair where others have been exempt from prosecution.  It is important that the law is evenly and properly applied.<\/p><p>  It is also important to be able to address fixed-charge notices mistakenly issued because the registration does not comply with the vehicle an individual owns.  If, for example, a constituent of the Deputy's was taking his wife on the verge of giving birth to hospital and he was speeding, I believe the Deputy would be rightly outraged if such a person ended up with a fixed-charge notice in circumstances where there was no resulting accident and the wife was simply being taken to hospital.  The same would apply to a parent taking a seriously ill child to hospital.  Garda&iacute; exercise a degree of common-sense discretion.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked me about section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  As the Deputy rightly says, under that provision I may appoint a person to &quot;inquire into any aspect of the administration, practice or procedure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&quot; or the conduct of members if the matter is of concern to the public.  I do not intend to give consideration to so dealing with the matter in the absence of the full and final report of the Garda Commissioner into the allegations.  I again urge the Deputy not to prejudge the outcome of that investigation.  As I have done in the past, I again assure the House that I will inform it fully of the outcome of the investigation.  If there are issues of concern, they will be addressed.  If it arises out of the investigation that some further inquiry should be conducted, I assure the House that decision will be made.  However, I will not prejudge an investigation that is taking place in good faith by an assistant commissioner into a matter that the Garda Commissioner and I regard as serious.  I urge the Deputy to curb his enthusiasm for seeking to imply that honourable members of the Garda force are behaving in some inappropriate manner.  We will see what the outcome of the investigation is.  If something untoward arises from that, I assure the Deputy that appropriate steps will follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600023#V00700","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1360158300,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Question No. 4 in the name of Deputy Niall Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600023#V00800","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1360158300,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I have not insinuated that garda&iacute;-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600023#V00900","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1360158300,"counter":212,"content":"<p>We have gone way over time.

There are also approximately 2,000 civilian support staff and almost 1,000 Garda reserves in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy might be interested to know that a graduation ceremony for some additional reserves will take place shortly.<\/p><p>  Garda numbers have been reducing owing to the moratorium on recruitment put in place by the previous Government as part of its plan to reduce the strength of the force to 13,000.  My objective, despite the enormous financial pressures facing the Government is to ensure that Garda numbers will not fall below 13,000.  At yesterday's Cabinet meeting, I informed my Cabinet colleagues that I am reviewing the position regarding Garda numbers in light of an estimated reduction to just over 13,000 by the end of 2013 and in this context I will be bringing proposals to Cabinet in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  I will be making these proposals as part of a wider determination to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the greatest possible resources made available to it, and that it is supported in making the necessary reforms to ensure that those resources are used to the greatest effect.  In that context I have managed to secure a budget of &euro;1.4 billion for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2013, which includes a specific provision of &euro;5 million for new vehicles for the force.  This is in addition to the &euro;4 million for vehicles that was provided last year.<\/p><p>  I have also strongly supported the Garda Commissioner in the introduction of real reform, such as the piloting of new rosters, the closure of under-utilised stations and the consequent freeing up of garda&iacute; for operational duties, and the merger of Garda districts which will bring about much greater administrative efficiency.  These reforms are vital to ensure that the best use is made of Garda resources and that the most efficient and effective policing service is delivered to the public.  These reforms should be supported by all Members of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600023#V01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1360158900,"counter":220,"content":"<p>The Minister might address the following point in his supplementary reply.  It has been widely reported, predominantly in the national print media, that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na budget for this year is not sufficient to meet the cost of paying the entire force, and that in this regard, the introduction of a three-year career break mechanism is being considered, which may result in a reduction in the force to approximately 12,000.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to the resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I agree on the need to modernise and find efficiencies.  However, as agreed last week, Garda stations are being closed not for financial reasons but owing to the Minister's vision for policing, which differs from that of a broad coalition of people.  Last night, I attended a public meeting in County Mayo attended by more than 200 people who are concerned about crime, policing and the closure of Garda stations.  These people are worried at the direction in which the Minister is taking An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of the closure of rural Garda stations.  They do not want the Minister to break the link between communities and Garda stations.  That is the message I was asked last night by people from Kilmaine, County Mayo, to convey to the Minister today.  Perhaps the Minister will say if there is any truth or substance in, as widely reported in the media, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being offered career breaks of up to three years and an upfront payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600024#W00100","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1360158900,"counter":221,"content":"<p>As I said earlier, and previously in public, the Garda Commissioner and I are <i>ad idem<\/i> on the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not falling below 13,000.  That is my view, as expressed privately and publicly.  As I said earlier to the Deputy, I will be bringing a proposal in this regard before Cabinet in the coming weeks.<\/p><p><br \/>  On the closure of Garda stations, there has been much discussion and a little political points scoring on this issue in the House.  The Garda Commissioner conducted an examination of the Garda station network during 2012, following which he made an operational judgment that 100 stations are of no operational advantage and, if closed, would result in more members of the force being available for community policing and front-line services.  An estimate was also done of the benefits, one of which will be 61,000 additional patrolling hours during 2013.  That is the effect of the closure of the stations.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy and I had an interesting exchange on this matter last Thursday evening on &quot;Prime Time&quot;, at which time the focus was on rural stations.  This is not only about rural stations.  The largest station closing, in terms of Garda numbers, is in Stepaside in my constituency.  It is closing on the operational advice of the Garda Commissioner.  Dundrum Garda station is located approximately three miles from the Stepaside Garda station.  It made sense to have two stations when the road network and motor vehicles and communications system were different.  Some people want, for political reasons, to portray this as an attack on rural Ireland.  I would like to remind Deputies that the two largest stations due to close this year under this consolidation process are in Kill o' the Grange in Dun Laoghaire, which is in the T&aacute;naiste's constituency, and Stepaside in my constituency.  In the past, Ministers wishing to avoid controversy in their constituencies would not have allowed that to happen.  I believe we have an extremely good Garda Commissioner, on whose operational advice I rely.<\/p><p><br \/>  The largest stations, in the context of numbers, closed last year were in Dublin, including Whitehall Garda station, Harcourt Terrace Garda station, another in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Dalkey Garda station.  Stations that are open for no more than three to four hours per day, the vast majority of which are manned by one member of the force, are being closed because the Garda Commissioner has determined they are of no operational value.<\/p><p><br \/>  As regards the Deputy's comment that these stations act as a deterrent to crime, last week in Oldcastle a family was held hostage and a post office was robbed.  Three doors away from that post office there is a Garda station which opens for three to four hours per day.  It was no deterrent to that appalling event.  We need modernise policing methods which free up members of the force to engage in operational duties and community policing.  I assure the people in Mayo, to whom Deputy Collins referred, that these changes will result in more garda&iacute; being available for community policing, patrolling and crime prevention and detection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600024#W00400","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1360158900,"counter":222,"content":"<p>This is not only an attack on rural Ireland, it is an attack on urban and rural Ireland.

The Minister and I differ in terms of our vision for policing in this country.  The Minister, when discussing this issue, repeatedly refers to the Garda Commissioner, in respect of which I have also taken issue with him.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to what happened in Oldcastle.  A pensioner in Kerry was robbed on the same day a local Garda station there was closed.  One can be selective about the stories one tells.  The point made by the Minister in support of the closure of part-time rural Garda stations was raised at the meeting in Mayo last night.  People take issue with his statement that 61,000 hours will be freed up to allow garda&iacute; engage in additional policing.  Garda&iacute; in the communities are already carrying out this function.  There is nothing wrong with their being available in Garda stations to interact with the public.  There is nothing wrong with an elderly person knowing he or she can go to the local Garda station to make a complaint and so on.  The Minister fails to recognise this.  This is part of a wider plan to remove other services from communities, towns and villages and centralise them in larger cities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600024#W00700","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1360158900,"counter":223,"content":"<p>It is the difference between members of the force sitting in a station for three or four hours each morning or being out in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600024#W00800","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1360158900,"counter":224,"content":"<p>There are not sitting around; they are interacting with the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600024#W00900","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1360158900,"counter":225,"content":"<p>We are not taking community garda&iacute; out of communities.

These are operational decisions made by the Garda Commissioner who has the statutory right and expertise to make them.  I know some people are unhappy with change.  A retired assistant commissioner has stated that he does not know what smart policing is and does not understand why we are doing all of this.  I do not believe that in 2013 we need the station network we were handed in 1922 in colonial times.  We all have smart phones and so on nowadays.  Smart policing is about flexibility within the policing service to adapt policing to meet the exigencies that arise, to facilitate the putting in place of special operations and to ensure the availability of the transport and capacity to deal with mobile gangs throughout the country.  Having members of the force unnecessarily engaged in administrative duties is not smart.  I accept that members of the force do important duties such as signing passport forms and so on.  However, we do not need 700 stations, which is what the Deputy wants, so that passport forms can be signed.  We need trained members of the force engaged in the work for which they have been trained.  We need them engaged in crime prevention and detection.<\/p><p>At the end of this process we will still have proportionately far more stations in our station network than any of the networks existing in neighbouring police forces.

The report is extensive and detailed and, as has been stated in the House yesterday and today, runs to over 1,100 pages spanning the decades from 1922 onwards.<\/p><p>  I thank Dr. McAleese for chairing the committee.  In producing such a comprehensive report, it is fair to say that he brought integrity and independence to the work which was instrumental in having the full co-operation of all the agencies involved, the religious congregations, and the women affected.<\/p><p>  I thank the many women who were able to tell their stories of what being in a Magdalen laundry meant for them, and the effects this had on their lives.  I would also like to thank the religious congregations who gave their full co-operation and made their records available to the committee, and the many representative and advocacy groups who assisted the committee in every way possible.  Finally, I thank the members of the committee for their work.<\/p><p>  The report tells a complex story, spanning the decades from the establishment of the State onwards.  We now know that approximately 10,000 women entered Magdalen laundries since 1922, through a whole range of different routes.  These included State referrals as well as placements of women by many others, including significant numbers by their own families.  We now also know that just over 60% of these women spent one year or less in the laundries and 35% spend three months or less there.<\/p><p>  Much of the information in the report has never previously been made public.  Among other elements, it records the stories of women entering the laundries over the decades and documents some past practices which had been long since forgotten.  In this way, the report gives an extraordinary insight not only into the operation of the Magdalen laundries, but also into the social realities of past times.<\/p><p>  I hope that publication of the report will be of comfort to the women directly concerned.  I appreciate that many women have lived their lives under a cloud because of the stigma that has attached to their residence in the Magdalen laundries, irrespective of the circumstances which resulted in their admission and regardless of how much time they spent there.  This stigma was undeserved and its removal is long overdue.<\/p><p>  The committee's report clearly illustrates that the stigma derives from misconceptions relating to how women came to be in the laundries.  The report also details that the laundries were cold and harsh places.  I regret it was not until July 2011 that action was initiated on behalf of the State to undertake a comprehensive examination of the circumstances that applied in the laundries and the impact they had on many of the women who resided there.  I am sorry the State did not do more and the Government recognises that the women alive today who are still affected by their time in the laundries deserve the best supports that the State can provide.<\/p><p>  The report includes a significant amount of new information and it is important that time is given for it to be reflected on and for former residents of the laundries and others to give a considered response.  As the Deputy knows, it is intended there will be a debate in the D&aacute;il on the report in two weeks' time and, pending that debate, the report will be given full consideration by members of Cabinet who received it yesterday and who were briefed on its contents by Dr. McAleese.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600025#X00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1360159500,"counter":236,"content":"<p>It is interesting to note the first parliamentary question about the Magdalen laundries was asked in 1938.

The committee hopes the report \"will be a real step in bringing healing and peace of mind to all concerned, most especially the women whose lived experience of the Magdalen Laundries had a profound and enduring negative effect on their lives\".  On the radio this morning Felice Gaer from the UN Committee against Torture stated the State must ensure the women obtain redress and have an enforceable right to compensation.  The report is complex and the best tribute to it is to start acting on what has been found.  There is no doubt there was State complicity.

It would be helpful if individuals internationally, as well as everyone at home, read the report in full.  I could not be oblivious to the fact that much of the comment made yesterday, because everyone in this new media age is supposed to instantly have an opinion on everything, was comment made by people who could not possibly have read the report.  I know how many hours it took me to read it from start to finish.  I reiterate people should read the report.<\/p><p>  I am very proud of the fact that this Government, at the initiative of myself and my good colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, established this inquiry.  I had campaigned for a long time for the full story of the Magdalen laundries to be known.  Previous Governments had not been prepared to have an inquiry.  We owe a genuine debt of gratitude to Dr. Martin McAleese for the extraordinary work he did.  It was very important it was an independent chairman and that was no doubt about the independence of the report and its absolute integrity.  This was of crucial importance.<\/p><p>  It should be fairly acknowledged that publication of the report by Dr. McAleese yesterday was a major step forward because for the first time we have a comprehensive authoritative account.  Groups and individuals have campaigned, groups who resided in the laundries have been telling their stories and there have been various publications, but the report contains information which was not previously published.  We now know that 26% of the residents found themselves in the homes as a result of State involvement.  This means 74%, the majority of those who were resident, ended up being residents in the homes for other reasons.  Tragically, some were put there by their own families.  Others, because they were in difficult financial circumstances and destitute, sought to reside there themselves.  Others were referred by well-meaning people who had nothing to do with the State.  We also know the length of residence is not always as understood.  The aspect of the story which had been told was the story of the many women who had been living in the laundries for many years, and quite clearly a number had this terrible experience.  It was never really understood that 61% of the residents resided in the laundries for a year or less.<\/p><p>  In the context of State involvement on the criminal justice side, out of the 10,000 approximate residents that Dr. McAleese could identify, in excess of 600 came through the criminal justice system.  Some of these were individuals placed on remand by the courts and in this context the courts had the choice of whether they spent a few days or weeks in a prison or go to a Magdalen laundry.  The report shows a number of individuals were there for a matter of days or a short few weeks.  The people about whom we should be genuinely concerned, in the context of the Government and my Cabinet colleagues considering how we deal with this very important matter, are the individuals who spent extended periods of time in the laundries whose lives have been blighted by this experience who felt because they were resident in the laundries that in some way it was a stigma and something they could not share or tell anyone about.  These are people about whom we all have very real concerns.<\/p><p>  I know this is an issue about which Deputy O'Sullivan has had a genuine concern for some time, as I and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, had and as had many people on both sides of the House.  This is a first step in dealing with this issue.  The Government will give very careful consideration to how we proceed in a manner that is sensitive and of assistance to those who had the terrible experience of being resident in the environment so well described by Dr. McAleese.  I believe a very important contribution to the discussion will be made by Members of the House in the debate that will happen in two weeks' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600025#X01100","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1360159500,"counter":238,"content":"<p>It is very difficult to accept what the Minister said with regard to this being the first comprehensive report.

The report has established that 26% of the residents were referred by the State in various modes, whether it was through the criminal justice system, or individuals who were residents in industrial schools and who were released conditionally on the basis that they would go into the Magdalen laundries for some time.  Therefore, my concerns were proven to be correct.<\/p><p>  There were suggestions that individuals had not only been emotionally abused but had perhaps been physically or sexually abused.  Former Senator McAleese's report establishes that there was not physical or sexual abuse, but there certainly was emotional abuse.  The environment in which young women lived was not one within which any of us would wish to live.  I am not happy that that is the case but my view of that has been vindicated.  That is why, as a Minister, I was determined to establish an inquiry to get maximum information and in circumstances where the maximum records were available.  Former Senator McAleese achieved that.  He also achieved the co-operation of the religious congregations in getting crucial information.  When Deputies read the report, they will see information from the congregations matched against State records.  One can then identify the routes through which people found themselves in the laundries.<\/p><p>  This is not just a State issue, however, because 74% of the residents came there without the State being engaged or involved.  We must consider how we can proceed further.  There is a particular issue in the context of how the State deals with that matter.  It is different to the industrial schools.  Nearly everyone who found themselves in industrial schools were there by virtue of court proceedings, either care proceedings or criminal proceedings.  Here we have 74% of people who found themselves resident in laundries in circumstances where there was not a State involvement.  This is not about dancing on the head of a pin, it is about examining what needs to be done for those people today, what is fair and how one approaches it.  For example, I do not think there is a Deputy in this House who would take the view that someone whom the courts remanded to a Magdalen laundry and who might have lived in a laundry for two, three or four days should be paid compensation.  They would have been there briefly and may otherwise have been briefly in prison.  It is difficult to talk about these things in this way because it will be portrayed as being unsympathetic.<\/p><p>  The reason we set up this committee was because of an absolute commitment by this Government, including myself personally and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, that we would get the full story, following which we would have colleagues consider it and make serious decisions.  In fairness to members of the Cabinet, including the Taoiseach, they would not have seen this report until yesterday.  They first had a briefing from former Senator McAleese.  We live in a world where everyone expects instant answers to everything.  The alternative to publishing the report would have been for the Government to retain it for a number of weeks and then announce decisions on foot of it.  Instead we took the view that the women had been waiting for many years to have their story vindicated.  We also took the view that there should be transparency and that the moment former Senator McAleese completed it it should be published.  It was published so quickly that the final chapter came to me on Monday morning.  We were anxious to publish it for the women's sake, to give Members of the House a full insight into the background, and then move on to consider how we can deal in a humane, considered and careful way with the consequences of what people experienced.  That is the Government's intention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600026#Y00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Other Questions","time":1360160100,"counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600026#Y00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Penalty Points System","time":1360160100,"counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600026#Y00400"},{"type":"question","time":1360160100,"counter":243,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[6010\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600026#Y00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"noting (details supplied), further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 96,104, 68, &amp; 58, of 11 December 2012, that his replies are at variance with this information, if he will explain for each case noted, if the driver of the Vehicle contacted the Gardai requesting termination of the fixed charge penalty; the person who instructed the termination; the grounds for each termination and the rank of the Garda who terminated the penalty.","asker":"1032","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","time":1360160100,"counter":244,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[6017\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600026#Y00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he considered exercising his powers under the Garda Siochana Act 2005, as amended by the Criminal Justice 2007, to order an inquiry into the practice of terminating fixed charge notices by the Ombudsman under s.102 in which he is entitled to do so if he considers it in the public interest or to order a special inquiry by specially appointed persons under Section 42, where he is entitled to do so if he considers the matter to be one of public concern; the reason he chose to internally review this matter; if he will provide an update on the progress of the internal review by the Garda Commissioner; if he will commit to publishing the internal review in its entirety; if he will order an inquiry by the Ombudsman or a special inquiry by a specially appointed person into the practice of terminating fixed charge notices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","time":1360160100,"counter":245,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[6011\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600026#Y00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide details of the revenue foregone by termination of penalty points for all fixed charge penalties during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2011.","asker":"1032","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","time":1360160100,"counter":246,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[6014\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600026#Y00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will publish the internal Garda report he has commissioned in relation to allegations of widespread ticket fixing for some members of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","time":1360160100,"counter":247,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[5659\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600026#Y00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he has received the final report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the alleged quashing of certain penalty points; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1360160100,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 36, 58, 60 and 64 together.  These questions all relate to the issue we have previously discussed surrounding the allegations concerning the cancellation of fixed charge notices.  Fixed charge notices are provided for under the Road Traffic Act 2002 and are an alternative to prosecution.  They give a motorist the opportunity to acknowledge the offence, pay the fixed charge and, where the offence is a penalty point offence, incur the appropriate penalty points.  While the issuing of a fixed charge notice does not constitute commencement of legal proceedings, it normally leads to a prosecution if the fixed charge is not paid.<\/p><p>  There can be circumstances, however, where the fixed charge notice may be cancelled in accordance with Garda procedures drawn up in the light of legislative exemptions and prosecutorial guidelines.  Cancellation occurs where it is believed the evidence would not sustain a prosecution or a prosecution would not be appropriate, fair or proportionate.  The procedures provide authority to district officers, or inspectors acting as district officers, and an inspector in the fixed charge processing office to cancel fixed charge notices.<\/p><p>  Cancellation can occur in circumstances where, for example, exemptions apply in relation to emergency vehicles or the wearing of seat-belts, or where there are evidential difficulties, such as where the registration number registered by a speed camera does not correspond to the vehicle in question, or where there are emergency medical circumstances such as, for example, a sick child being driven to hospital, an imminent birth, or a medical professional rushing to a sick or elderly patient.  Access to cancel a fixed charge notice through PULSE is restricted to users with the rank of inspector or higher.<\/p><p>  Allegations concerning the cancellation of fixed charge notices are being examined by an assistant commissioner who is due to report his findings shortly.  I have received an interim report from the commissioner but I will not be making any further comment on any of the allegations until the final report is available.  It would be premature and wrong to assume that all of these cancellations of fixed charge notices were inappropriate, or that money has been lost to the Exchequer as a consequence.  Equally, it is premature for calls to be made for a statutory inquiry into these matters.<\/p><p>  As I said earlier, let us await the final report on this matter, which I expect shortly, and we will then be in a position to draw conclusions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600026#Y01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1360160100,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Four Deputies have tabled these questions so I will call them first, starting with Deputy Joan Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600026#Y01100","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1360160100,"counter":250,"content":"<p>The Minister did not really answer my question, which is very specific.

The Minister took it upon himself to send a letter from his Department to the whistleblowing garda&iacute; in the week before Christmas, isolating instances from their reported allegations which he dismissed out of hand.

It is at variance with the evidence and the facts of the matter, namely, garda&iacute; are terminating these penalty points without any reason, without any procedure and are acting as a law unto themselves.<\/p><p>  Members are not prejudging anything but are basing their opinions on the evidence.  If the Minister thinks that Members of this House or the wider public will put up with the outcome of a so-called internal inquiry, he is greatly mistaken because all the evidence tells us that the aforementioned inquiry already has been discredited, when the garda&iacute; who put their necks on the line to give the Minister this evidence have been approached over Christmas, denied the opportunity to do their jobs, prevented from accessing PULSE records without someone standing over their shoulders, being visited in their own homes by garda&iacute; and so on.  That is the type of system and people the Minister wants to investigate the matter.  It is a joke.  The issue will not go away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600027#Z02700","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1360160700,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and call on the Minister to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600027#Z02800","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1360160700,"counter":284,"content":"<p>The Deputy does not want this matter to be investigated.

Second Stage of the Valuation (Amendment) Bill took place in the Seanad on 11 October last year, with the common opinion of the Members of the Upper House being that there is an urgent need to speed up valuations and revaluations as a matter of priority.  There are a few initiatives that the Minister of State will doubtlessly outline as being within the Bill, with one being a pilot in a local authority in Galway to consider a self-assessment scheme.  That should be welcomed.  There is also a pilot scheme for considering different ways of facilitating an independent assessment system or an external service delivery scheme.  That would be welcome and I hope the Minister of State can expand on the concept.<\/p><p>  Having spoken to owners of businesses in my constituency, it seems there are a number of urgent issues, with survival being paramount in 2013.  The Minister of State would be well aware in his constituency that the common narrative among business people is if they will survive in 2013.  We must be conscious of that worry and look to deal with it.  With the valuation system, business owners are indicating it could take two to three years to get a valuation officer out to revalue a property, and there is a desire to speed up the process.  Some businesses may be paying very high rates and may have downscaled, with a decrease in revenue and profit margins.  We must be careful in assisting businesses when many are still struggling.  I spoke to a constituent at the weekend who is in business along with a couple of his sons.  He observed that the businesses which are doing well are working flat out but on the other side of things, the businesses trying to survive are slowly losing that battle.  We must use every available resource to make the process easier.<\/p><p>  We must look to speed up resource deployment with this Bill.  It has gone through Second Stage in the Seanad and the Minister might enlighten us today about the timeframe for getting through the legislative process.  There should be a sense of urgency.<\/p><p>  From speaking to open-minded people in business, there is a realisation that competition is good and business is dependent on other businesses doing well in an area.  Some but not all business people have mentioned a rates holiday for 12 months that could apply to new businesses.  The idea was raised in the recent past and we must use every possible incentive to attract people to setting up a business.  Not every business will survive, and the rate of survival is probably falling, but we should use whatever tools are available to consider the idea of a rates holiday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600028#AA01500","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1360161300,"counter":303,"content":"<p>The Deputy will have two minutes to respond to the Minister of State's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600028#AA01600","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1360161900,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McHugh for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister who is unavoidably absent.  I ask Deputies to excuse any errors I may make in reading out replies as I am using a pair of borrowed reading glasses, having lost my own glasses this afternoon.<\/p><p>  The programme of revaluing all commercial and industrial properties in the State for rateable valuation purposes is the responsibility of the Valuation Office, which is headed by the Commissioner of Valuation.  The commissioner is independent in the exercise of his statutory functions, which are principally derived from the Valuation Act 2001.<\/p><p>  The national revaluation programme was provided for in the 2001 Act and the expectation was that the complete revaluation of all commercial property in the State would take ten years to complete.  This assumption has proven over time to be overly optimistic.  To date, the revaluation programme has been completed in the South Dublin County Council area in 2007 and in Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown county councils in 2009 and 2010, respectively.  The revaluation of Dublin City Council area began in May 2011 and will be completed with the publication of a new valuation list in December 2013, which will become effective for rating purposes from January 2014.<\/p><p>  I assure the Deputy that the Government is aware of the importance of accelerating the national revaluation programme and this is a feature of its Action Plan for Jobs 2012 strategy.  Such a comprehensive revaluation of property has not been undertaken since the middle of the 19th century.<\/p><p>  The revaluation programme is required to take account of the differential movements in property values that have occurred over a prolonged period of time and therefore maintain uniformity in the valuation base.  Such uniformity is essential to achieve the policy objective of ratepayers paying commercial rates on an equitable basis.  This, in turn, supports a more competitive business environment and improved compliance.<\/p><p>  With the express objective of accelerating the revaluation programme, the Government published the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 on 3 August 2012 as part of its legislative programme.  The Bill proposes a number of specific measures in this regard.  It provides a statutory basis to enable the Valuation Office to establish pilot schemes for outsourcing some of the revaluation work and exploring the possibility of introducing an element of self-assessment by ratepayers to the valuation process.<\/p><p>  Additional provisions in the Bill seek to streamline the current valuation process and each of these will help to speed up progress.  The Bill proceeded through Second Stage in the Seanad in October 2012.  Officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and Valuation Office are engaged with a wide range of stakeholders and other interested parties on potential amendments that may be introduced on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  The Valuation Office is continuing to extend the revaluation programme.  The Commissioner of Valuation signed valuation orders for the three Waterford rating authority areas on 12 December 2011 and Limerick County Council and Limerick City Council on 29 March 2012.  The Waterford and Limerick revaluations will be completed in 2013 and 2014, respectively.  At that stage, approximately 33% of all rateable properties in the country, representing more than 50% of the national valuation base in monetary terms, will have been revalued.  The commissioner has also indicated his intention, subject to a statutory consultation process which is now under way, to sign valuation orders for Galway City Council and Carlow and Kilkenny rating authority areas during 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600029#BB00100","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1360161900,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, although I note it did not refer to his county, Louth, or my county, Donegal.  I hope he will use his powers of persuasion and position to try to ensure greater haste in bringing counties not yet included in the revaluation programme up to speed.  While I accept that 50% of the national valuation base has been revalued, businesses in my constituency are struggling and must be given hope that a valuation order will be signed for County Donegal as a matter of priority.<\/p><p>  The current valuation system is shrouded in secrecy.  Businesses in small towns do not share information and there are curious differences in the valuation methods employed.  Greater transparency is, therefore, required.  One way of facilitating more transparency is to encourage businesses in small towns to come together.  Buncrana and Letterkenny in my constituency have successful chambers of commerce, whereas smaller towns such as Ramelton, Milford and Carndonagh do not have a chamber of commerce.  We must encourage smaller towns to establish chambers of commerce which could then act as a lobby group on issues of importance such as the revaluation programme.  I call on businesses in smaller towns to come together and share information.  I am not naive and accept, therefore, that some businesses are worried that the revaluation process will result in an increase in their rates.<\/p><p>  Businesses in smaller towns and their environs must engage in more effective lobbying.  At a time when democracy is breaking down to some extent and the old party structures no longer work as effectively as in the past, we need more formal mechanisms and new conduits for allowing businesses to share and impart information.<\/p><p>  Businesses in the Border region, including counties Louth and Donegal, face specific competition issues, yet none of the Border counties is listed for revaluation.

The issue I raise is the decision of Mr. Justice Hogan in the High Court on 23 January last and its implications for those who are navigating the immigration, asylum and refugee process in this State.  The judgment affected the law on subsidiary protection.<\/p><p>  As the Minister of State is aware, an applicant seeking leave to remain in the State who has failed the asylum process, in other words, he or she has had an application rejected by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, is entitled to apply for subsidiary protection.  To qualify for subsidiary protection the applicant must show substantial grounds for believing that he or she would face a real risk of suffering serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin.  The High Court found, two weeks ago today, that the current model used in Ireland whereby we assess the asylum application first and subsidiary protection application thereafter, known as the bifurcated or split system, is not being operated properly.  In the case before the High Court, Mr. Justice Hogan criticised a decision to reject an application for subsidiary protection on the grounds of adverse credibility findings in the asylum application stage.  In other words, the grounds for failing the first hurdle were considered grounds for failing the second hurdle.  The State, through the office of the Minister, was found to have failed to afford the applicant an effective hearing, contrary to the principles of due process.<\/p><p>  Mr. Justice Hogan stated that an effective hearing for subsidiary protection must would involve the applicant being invited to comment on any adverse credibility findings made by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and being given a fresh opportunity to revisit all matters bearing on the claim for subsidiary protection.  It would also involve a completely fresh assessment of the applicant's credibility in circumstances where the mere fact was that the tribunal had ruled adversely to this.<\/p><p>  Like me, the Minister of State operates constituency clinics and will be visited weekly by people seeking to discuss the immigration and asylum process.  Many of them have been in the system for years.  In one case of which I have been made aware, a family received notice in the past week that decisions regarding subsidiary protection have been withdrawn without reasons being given.<\/p><p>Is this decision the reason for that withdrawal?<\/p><p> I wish to ask a number of questions.  What are the consequences for those who have been refused subsidiary protection?  The High Court has stated that the current procedure in certain circumstances is wrong and does not constitute a fair hearing.  Many people in the State who have failed in their subsidiary applications may have been judged incorrectly.  Are we going to audit those decisions to ensure they were reached correctly?  What will happen to people who are currently in the process?  Are we examining it to ensure that applications are being made to a proper system?<\/p><p> Mr. Justice Hogan acknowledged that his decision was likely to have significant, perhaps far-reaching consequences for the practical administration of the subsidiary protection scheme in terms of complications, delays and costs.  Does the Department have the capacity to deal with these demands?  Given the unseemly, unhealthy and despairing effects of the time spent in direct provision centres, of which there is much criticism, by those who have reached the subsidiary protection phase, does the Minister of State believe that the decision will further exacerbate this delay?  When will the legislation for a new combined application process be tabled before the House?  It has been drafted and is almost ready for publication.<\/p><p> I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, for taking this debate.  I appreciate that he is not in the Department in question and may not be able to provide me with the full answers that I require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600029#BB00700","speaker":"1045","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360162500,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Nolan for raising this matter.  I am not in the Department of Justice and Equality, but I am present in the House.  I apologise for the Minister, Deputy Shatter, being unable to take this debate.<\/p><p><br \/>  The judgment of Mr. Justice Hogan in the High Court, delivered on 23 January, deals with an applicant's right to be heard in the context of an application for subsidiary protection.  Mr. Justice Hogan's judgment, delivered after a preliminary ruling by the European Court of Justice, has interpreted this concept to mean that there may be instances where an applicant may require a hearing, particularly where he or she wishes to challenge negative credibility findings made by the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal that might be relied upon by the Department of Justice and Equality in arriving at a decision in the individual's case.<\/p><p><br \/>  As Deputy Nolan stated, the court's judgment has significant practical implications for the current subsidiary protection process.  The High Court has flagged the need for additional procedural steps to ensure that subsidiary protection applicants are guaranteed the right to an effective hearing.  The details in this regard, which are set out in the court's decision, are under examination in the Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General to determine how the current administrative procedures might be adapted to bring them into line with the court's judgment.  Given the number of subsidiary protection applications that are currently waiting to be processed, it is important that every effort is made to continue processing activity both from the State's perspective, owing to the substantial cost to the Exchequer of maintaining protection applicants, and the perspective of applicants themselves, many of whom have been waiting for some time for final answers to their requests for the State's protection or, failing that, for permission to remain.  As a result, Mr. Justice Hogan's judgment is being studied in great detail by officials in the Department.<\/p><p><br \/>  The current arrangements for dealing with subsidiary protection applications were always intended to be temporary pending the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010.  Work on the Bill is ongoing at the Department pursuant to current Government policy, which is committed under the Programme for National Recovery, to &quot;introduce comprehensive reforms of the immigration, residency and asylum systems, which will include a statutory appeals system and set out rights and obligations in a transparent way&quot;.  The Bill provides, <i>inter alia<\/i>, for the introduction of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other ground presented by applicants.  This change to the processing framework will remove the current multilayered and sequential processes associated with the existing system and address the issues arising from the High Court's decision.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister outlined to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality that several hundred amendments to the 2010 Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature.  The Minister also expressed the considered view that, instead of engaging in a cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments, it would be more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members, including that of a streamlined, single application procedure.  This proposition was broadly welcomed by the joint committee.<\/p><p><br \/>  Work on the Bill continues on this basis, including in co-operation with the offices of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney General while also taking account of relevant rulings by the courts.  It remains the Minister's objective under this new approach, mindful of needing to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU-IMF programme commitments, to be in a position to introduce a revised Bill for approval and publication by the Government later this year.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister has some concerns about the extent to which applicants seek to avail of the judicial review process to stall or prolong their stays in the State.  The construct of the current system provides ample opportunity in this regard, giving rise as it does to delays in finalising cases and to significant backlogs of cases.  In parallel with the work on the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, the Department is also developing proposals on judicial review with a view to addressing some of the difficulties in this area.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy may be aware of the large number of cases that often back up, sometimes on tenuous grounds, behind legal challenges.  Only last week, the Court of Justice of the European Union delivered its ruling in a case referred to it by the High Court in April 2011.  This referral gave rise to final decisions in approximately 900 asylum cases that were being delayed.  The Court of Justice's ruling supports the position taken by the State in the cases concerned.  While the court's ruling is welcome, the costs to the State arising from the inability to process the cases impacted by the referral are significant.  This reinforces the need to be able to adapt, as far as possible, our processing arrangements so that processing activity can continue and costs of this type can be minimised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600030#CC00300","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1360162500,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response, which was quite \"Department of Justice-y\" in many ways - I apologise for using that phrase - in that it referred to the need to progress, judicial reviews and so on.  Rarely do I get a response from the Department that refers to the impact on the lives of people in the system or acknowledges that, as a result of the delay in introducing legislation, the judicial review proceedings and the changes in the procedures for subsidiary protection applications, families and people - real human beings - are left waiting in accommodation for years on end with nothing to do, are constantly worried and are in the dark about their futures.

People were kept in places for long periods, often against their will, and received very small subsistence payments, if any.  The line is that it was a product of the time.  In this country today, thousands of people spend five, six or seven years in direct provision on a pittance and live in small rooms with their children, sometimes with as many as four people to a room, yet we are turning a blind eye.  The constant bureaucratic attitude to people's suffering is becoming tiresome.  We need to do something about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600030#CC00400","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speech","time":1360162500,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I will be happy to bring the Deputy's opinions to the attention of the Minister.

The Government was elected on a platform of introducing great reform to the way the Oireachtas would operate and also on a promise that it would engage with the D&aacute;il in a way that had not happened previously.  Unfortunately, the turnout in recent times of senior Ministers to respond to Topical Issue debates directly relevant to them is indicative that on too many occasions they are treating this Chamber as an irritation to them proceeding with what they want to do, regardless of what is said in this Chamber.<\/p><p>  I wish to raise the Government&rsquo;s proposal to introduce a capital means test for making decisions on maintenance grants for students attending third level colleges and the likely impact it will have on farming families as well as the self-employed.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, announced his intention in that regard in the 2012 budget.  In recent weeks there has been further media speculation as to exactly what he plans to put in place.  At the beginning of 2012 he set up a review group to assess how such a system could be introduced and he promised that a report would issue by September.  It is now February 2012 yet nothing firm has been announced on the issue except what we have read in the newspapers.  The Minister&rsquo;s approach to the issue displays a severe lack of knowledge and understanding of exactly what it means to be a farmer today or the challenges facing many in the self-employed and business community.<\/p><p>  The year 2011 was very successful for farm income in comparison to previous years.  The average farm income was &euro;24,000.  Much diversity is evident in farm income depending on the type of farming involved.  For example, in dairying, which tends to be practised on larger farms, the average income in 2011 was &euro;69,000.  However, on beef farms the average income was &euro;11,000 and it was &euro;17,000 on sheep farms.  That is taking into account all 100,000 farming households nationally.<\/p><p>  The Minister&rsquo;s proposal appears to be based on farm values of more than &euro;750,000.  If one takes an average acreage price of approximately &euro;10,000, that would equate to a 75 acre farm.  The Minister is talking about putting a notional value on the land which would then be added to the real income earned by a family in a given year.  As a result, in many cases students from farming backgrounds would find themselves unable to access a student maintenance grant and unable to finance themselves through college.<\/p><p>  If the Minister feels there is unfairness in the current student grant system he must examine how income is assessed and whether issues arise in that regard.  People from the self-employed and farming communities would not have a problem with the system giving a fair reflection of incomes.  Nobody could take issue with such an approach.  However, it would be unacceptable for the Minister to place a notional value on assets which are a tool to derive an income.  If the Minister proceeds with such a wrong-headed approach he will leave many families in a position where they cannot attend college.  That will not be tolerated.  The Minister must reverse from his current position.  I am interested to hear what the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, has to say on behalf of the Minister about his plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600031#DD00200","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1360163100,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I am very sorry that I am not the Minister for Education and Skills, but if I were, I would be very happy to be present.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, is unavoidably absent this afternoon.  I would not infer that his absence is not without good cause.  I am happy to respond to the issue raised on behalf of the Minister.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is referring to an announcement in budget 2012 that the means test for student grants will be broadened to take account of the value of certain capital assets as well as income.  It is important to understand that the intention behind this approach is to ensure that, at a time of reduced resources, the Government targets valuable schemes, such as the student grant scheme, at those who need them most.  The Deputy will know that a considerable body of reports over a number of years have strongly recommended the introduction of a capital test for student grants, particularly on the grounds of equity and fairness.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Minister for Education and Skills set up an interdepartmental working group to examine this issue and that he is due to bring proposals to Cabinet shortly.  As the matter is due before Cabinet in the coming weeks, I am not in a position to provide specific details at this time, but any decision taken will be a collective Government decision.  I can say emphatically, however, that broadening the means testing arrangements for student grants is not aimed at any particular section of the community - such as farmers - but rather at ensuring that all students are treated equally in the assessment of their or their family's means so that those in need of a grant can get one.  I can, therefore, give the Deputy the assurance that he is seeking, namely, that farming families will not be unfairly targeted in any new arrangements.  On the contrary, farmers, like all other citizens - be they unemployed, employed, self-employed or retired - whose income and assets fall below a certain level, will continue to be eligible for third level grants for their children.<\/p><p>  Last year, the Government spent approximately &euro;336 million supporting 76,600 students through the student grant scheme.  That represents 38% of the total number of full-time students in higher education institutions and on post-leaving certificate programmes.  That is a considerable amount of taxpayers' money, and no one would argue against the need to ensure that it is being spent carefully and targeted at those who need it most.<\/p><p>  It is also interesting to note that the student grant system, where no account is taken of the capital value of savings or assets, is in contrast to other major schemes of income maintenance operated by the Department of Social Protection or supports provided by the HSE for example.  The effect of this is that if a person has income below the current thresholds, which is &euro;39,875 in 2013 to 2014 for a full grant and maintenance, but has considerable savings in the bank or a wide property portfolio, his or her child can still qualify for a grant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600031#DD00300","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1360163100,"counter":318,"content":"<p>The key issue in the response is that from next year the assessment on whether a person is entitled to a maintenance grant will be done on the basis of his or her income and assets.  The next assertion is that the change will not affect the farming community in particular.  Unfortunately, the reality is that it will.  If assets and farm land are taken into account, farming households of modest incomes will find themselves unable to qualify for a student grant.  The Government is putting such families in a position where they must decide whether to sell some of their land in order to fund their children through college because a student maintenance grant will not be available to them in spite of having a low income.  The way we should approach the issue is simple; we must ensure there is a fair way of assessing everyone's income.  The system should be based on one's real income, not on an asset which is being used to generate income.<\/p><p>The Minister of State needs to revisit this issue and work with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to ensure there is an understanding of what happens on farms across the country on a daily basis and of the reality of the level of the average farm income, which applies to most farm incomes, and ensure that the farming community is treated as fairly as everyone else.  If we take the approach the Minister, Deputy Quinn, is planning, the farming community will be unfairly targeted because they will be assessed not only on their income, but also on a notional value of their land which they use to derive an income.  If the Minister wants to tax people's land, taxes are already in place in terms of inheritance tax and capital gains tax which come into play when land is sold.  However, while land is being held by the farming household it is being used to derive an income and it is that income that should be used to decide whether a family has the means to send their child to college independently or whether their child will need a student grant to ensure he or she has the same access to third level education as anybody from any other income background.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister to State to talk to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, about this.  I ask the Labour and the Fine Gael parties to rethink this approach because what they propose to do will unfairly target the farming community and many in the self-employed community and business community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600031#DD00400","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360163700,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy his comments will be brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Quinn.  I repeat what the Minister said in his statement, namely, that there is absolutely no question of any particular group such as farmers being targeted in terms of this issue.  Clearly, the objective of the Government is to make sure that those who need to get student grants get them.  Some 76,600 students in this country got grants last year, which cost &euro;336 million and represented 38% of the total number of full-time students.  There is a very good system in place whereby people on low incomes qualify.<\/p><p>  It remains the Minister's firm commitment that there should be no financial barrier to third level students who would not otherwise be able to afford to attend college or university.  It is not therefore the object of means testing proposals to exclude any particular sector of society.  The test will be applied fairly to all applications and in common with other State means tested schemes.  The two principal factors that facilitate spending, income and accumulated wealth or capital, would be taken into account for all applicants regardless of their employment status.  This means that farmers or any other category of person whose income and assets fall below a certain amount and cannot afford to send their children to third level would still continue to receive State support while those who can afford to pay would have to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600032#EE00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","time":1360163700,"counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600032#EE00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1360163700,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I would like to ask the Minister of State the current status in terms of opening a renal dialysis unit at Wexford General Hospital.  The physical infrastructure for housing the dialysis unit is up and ready.  It seems some legal hold up is stopping patients from being able to have their renal dialysis carried out in Wexford General Hospital.  At present, patients have to travel to Waterford which is over an hour's drive away.  It is not a difficulty for patients to travel to Waterford but renal dialysis patients have to go for dialysis at least three times per week and it can take up to six hours to have dialysis carried out.  It can be very stressful, especially for elderly patients, to have to arrange transport to travel to Waterford, have their dialysis carried out and then travel home.  The unit at Wexford General Hospital has been set up and very little is required to push it over the line in terms of its opening.  I ask the Minister of State to make every effort to ensure patients can have renal dialysis carried out at Wexford General Hospital as soon as possible.  It would be a more efficient use of the patient's time and would add to their quality of life.  As the Minister of State will understand, any patient who is receiving dialysis already has a decreased quality of life and there is no need for us to add to that when it is unnecessary at this time.<\/p><p>  I am delighted about what is happening at Wexford General Hospital.  In the 15 years I have been a GP in County Wexford I would have had to travel to Wexford General Hospital at least once a week.  My two young sons have been treated in the accident and emergency department there for injuries resulting from the activities young boys get up to and my little girl was born in the hospital.  One point I would make about the accident and emergency department and the maternity unit is that they are very claustrophobic.  If it was not for such goodwill and dedication to excellence by the staff of Wexford General Hospital, we would never have survived with the current set up in the maternity unit and in the accident and emergency department.  Now a brand new maternity unit and accident and emergency department are under construction and it fills my heart with joy to see the construction work under way when I go to the hospital.  Even though the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is my colleague in government, he is my political rival in the constituency.  He has always been a great friend to Wexford General Hospital and I am sure, like me, he is delighted to see the current construction work at Wexford General Hospital.  In all the years we have discussed the future of Wexford General Hospital, he has been a great supporter and has an excellent understanding of what actually happens in our health services.   These are positive developments in the health service but there is a possibility to add to the excellence of the services at Wexford General Hospital and I hope the Minister will be able to give me positive new about the provision of renal dialysis services at the hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600032#EE00400","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1360163700,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for bring this matter before the House and I assure him that his comments will be brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, who is unavoidably absent.  The Minister fully acknowledges the challenges that these patients are currently facing and the need for the provision of a dedicated haemodialysis service in Wexford for these patients.<\/p><p>  The Minister is aware that haemodialysis and home dialysis services in the south east are currently provided from the parent renal unit at Waterford Regional Hospital.  There are currently three consultant renal physicians working at this unit and a wide range of services are provided there.  The haemodialysis unit at Waterford Regional Hospital provides chronic haemodialysis therapies to just over 100 outpatients.  There is also a stand-alone satellite haemodialysis unit in Kilkenny which provides chronic haemodialysis therapies to just under 50 outpatients.  Waterford Regional Hospital also provides additional inpatient haemodialysis therapies to all end-stage renal disease patients in the south-east region who require dialysis when they are unwell and are admitted to hospital.  Acute haemodialysis therapies are also provided here for patients with acute kidney injury.  The peritoneal dialysis unit in Waterford Regional Hospital provides training, support and follow-up care to just under 20 patients who perform peritoneal dialysis in their own homes.  It is important to note that almost 20,000 dialysis treatments were provided during 2012 and over 13,000 of these were provided at Waterford Regional Hospital.<\/p><p>  The national renal office, together with the HSE and the parent renal unit in the south east, have considered how services should develop in the south east.  The vision for further development of renal services in the south east includes the development of a further satellite haemodialysis unit in Wexford.  This unit would be very beneficial to those patients living in the Wexford region.  It would be responsible for delivering routine care to stable chronic haemodialysis patients closer to their homes in Wexford and the HSE has identified this development in Wexford as a service priority.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, the HSE's service target date of end 2012 for initiating this project could not be achieved due to a legal challenge which may affect the process.  The HSE has obtained legal advice in relation to the initiation of a tender process for the satellite dialysis unit in Wexford and it concludes that this should not proceed until other legal matters are resolved.  The HSE must await the outcome of the legal challenge prior to deciding on next steps.  It intends to proceed with the tendering process for this satellite service as soon as possible after such matters have been resolved.<\/p><p>  I would like to pass on the Minister, Deputy Reilly's thanks to the Deputy for raising this matter. The Minister would like to assure the Deputy of both his and the HSE's commitment to this project.

It is vitally important that safeguards are put in place to ensure that national lottery funding will continue to support local projects in the future.<\/p><p><br \/>  One aspect of the Bill which is of concern to me is the possible relaxation of the rules governing online sales of national lottery tickets.  Obviously, given the nature of the technology-driven era in which we live, there is huge potential to increase sales by making Internet trade more accessible to the public.  I note that at present less than 3% of national lottery tickets are purchased online, which is a relatively small amount.  The danger of making online purchases more readily available is the potential that vulnerable persons will fall prey to the new system.  In an era where online gambling is rife, I would be concerned that our national lottery could be seen to encourage those with an addictive personality.  Obviously if people want to buy lottery tickets <i>en masse<\/i>, they can simply walk into a post office or a shop to do so.  The danger with online sales is the possibility of people building up card debt.  That is not what our national lottery is about and it is important that we tread carefully because once we open the door to online sales, it could be a very slippery slope.  We do not want the ethos of the lottery, which has proved so strong and which has been key to its success, to be tainted by a revenue generating exercise.  The Minister has advised that the sale of tickets online will be done in a way which will protect minors and vulnerable adults.  I would like confirmation that strong safeguards will be in place in this regard because, as we all know, the Internet is not easy to police.<\/p><p><br \/>  I would also ask the Minister to ensure due consideration is given to the existing network of lotto retail outlets and the fact that their lotto sales form an integral and extremely important part of their business.  In many cases, it is the add-on business that is generated from their lotto sales that makes them sustainable and ensures their survival, especially in rural towns and villages.  It is important, therefore, to take into account the impact the relaxation of the rules governing online purchases will have on these smaller shops, the rural economy generally and on the social interaction of simply buying a lottery ticket.  I ask the Minister to examine this issue.<\/p><p><br \/>  At the outset I said that our present economic circumstances required the Government to think outside the box with regard to the expiry of the current national lottery licence.  This is an opportunity to raise much-needed revenue which will help to fund important local and national projects.  At the present time of limited resources, additional revenue is obviously welcome.  It is vital, however, that the new arrangements are monitored closely by the new national lottery regulator, particularly with regard to online sales.  It would be my hope that the successful tender will recognise the ethos which has made the national lottery so strong in the past and will strive to continue in this tradition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600033#FF00400","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speech","time":1360164300,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Given the difficult financial straits in which this country has found itself recently, all avenues must be explored in terms of finding the finance necessary to get the country back on its feet.  As part of this, a number of initiatives were identified which could produce revenue, while ensuring that valuable assets were retained in State ownership.  The decision to hold a competition for the next national lottery 20-year licence was among the novel funding avenues identified and I must compliment the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, on bringing this idea to fruition in a speedy manner.<\/p><p>  The new licensing arrangement is timely as new legislation was needed in any event to take account of new regulatory functions.  I understand that following the hoped-for passing of this legislation, the licence competition will be launched very quickly with a view to having the new licensee in place next year.  However, while we need innovative solutions, given the difficult times we find ourselves in, it is imperative that we do not diminish the ability of future generations to benefit from assets already owned by the State.  The sale of the national lottery licence is an option which can have the twin effects of raising money while not selling off assets.<\/p><p>  While I have no issue with the selling of the national lottery licence, I do have concerns about the sale of another asset, namely, Coillte.  I hope the Minister takes on board concerns regarding the forestry industry, in particular, in considering the sale of that State asset.  We must do our best to protect that industry and the jobs within it.  It is important that we listen to all of the stakeholders in the debate on the sale of a State asset such as Coillte so that we do not end up regretting it in years to come.<\/p><p>  One concern I have regarding the Bill relates to securing the future of the many small retail stores that are the lifeblood of rural communities and which need to retain their margins on scratch cards and other lottery products.  At the moment, such small stores receive a margin of 6% on their sales but there is no provision in the Bill to secure that margin for the next 20 years.  Instead, the issue is to be addressed in the licence but ensuring that this margin is retained is crucial for the future viability of such small stores.<\/p><p>  Another element that must be safeguarded is the funding that goes to good causes.  In 2011, sales of national lottery tickets generated &euro;761.4 million in revenue, with over &euro;422 million of that going on prizes and over &euro;231 million going to good causes.  That is a very substantial figure which is a tremendous boost to voluntary groups all over the country.  I note that the protection of this funding is to be provided for in the licence as opposed to the legislation.  Groups such as RGDATA have called for the percentage of the takings to be distributed among good causes to be retained.  Reducing the amount of money going to good causes would make buying lottery products less attractive and would eventually result in a decline in sales, which would be counter productive.<\/p><p>  The issue of Ireland's love affair with gambling and the trouble that our gambling gene has caused to date, thanks to the reckless gambling indulged in by certain elements of the banking sector, has been widely discussed this week.  Addiction is ruining many lives and many families.  A family member's addiction to gambling can cause incomprehensible misery.  We must ensure the licence offered to any new licensee has strict regulations attached to ward against pushing gambling products in the direction of already vulnerable people.  For example, the availability of national lottery games in pubs or other places where people interact with alcohol should be prohibited.<\/p><p>  The economic necessity that prompted the sale of this licence is the need for a new state-of-the-art children's hospital for the nation.  The children of the nation deserve such a hospital, which should become available to the current generation of children rather than the next generation.  That is why it is important that money raised from the sale of this licence is used in the most effective manner to deliver this key piece of national health infrastructure in a timely manner.  This new hospital will be of great benefit to the sick children of the nation and their families and it is about time that all of the various paediatric services are brought together in one cohesive setting.  Of course, the building of the new hospital will also be of benefit in terms of the jobs that will accrue.  A report from the ICTU has suggested that up to 2,500 jobs could be created during the construction phase of the children's hospital.<\/p><p>  It is important to remember that this is not about the sale of the national lottery but the sale of the licence to operate the lottery for a defined period of 20 years.  It is a good mechanism for freeing up money for the State coffers at a crucial juncture in our history, and by ring-fencing the money for an important national project, we can all look forward to twin benefits from this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600033#FF00500","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1360164300,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Lottery Bill.

The idea of creating yet another regulator is somewhat problematic.  We have regulators for communications and energy as well as various other independent regulatory authorities, and I agree that they should be independent.  However, if we are going to create a regulator for the national lottery, could we not incorporate the entire gambling industry?  Could we not have a regulator for the various gambling companies, particularly in the context of fast-moving technologies that are affecting the lives of many people in this country?  There are many aspects of the gambling industry as a whole that are of concern, particularly in times like these when people are finding it very hard to make ends meet.<\/p><p>One of these concerns reflects on the national lottery where we know the odds and we have an idea what we are gambling with.  Bookies, similarly, give prices.  There are some areas of gambling that we do not scrutinise.  Radio and television programmes, for example, often ask up to 50,000 viewers to enter a competition by calling a premium rate telephone line for a prize that may be worth less than &euro;500 or &euro;1,000.  These competitions give one no idea how close one might be to winning a prize.  That should be looked at.  We need to see more transparency in these transactions.  I would like to see these competitions giving some information as to the chances players have when they make a premium rate telephone call and whether they have a 10% or a 0.1% chance of winning a prize.<\/p><p> I have reservations about the duration of the licence.  We must strike a balance between the duration of the licence and getting good value for money for the Exchequer.  Twenty years is a long time to hold a licence.  I hope the Minister and the Department are comfortable about granting a private company a 20 year licence and that there will be robust clauses in the agreement to prevent even minor abuse in the handling of the licence. <\/p><p> In tendering for the licence each company should state the level of its projected profits.  If a private company greatly exceeds those projected profits there should be a pro-rata clawback to the Exchequer which could benefit the national lottery charities.  I am also concerned that executives of the successful company might be paid exorbitant salaries.  We have seen this in deregulated companies, particularly in the United Kingdom.  Do we have any control over these salaries?  Will a balance be struck on the basis of getting a return for the Exchequer?  Considering that the current chief executive of the national lottery earns &euro;328,000, which is one and a half times the salary of the Taoiseach, I am concerned that we might lose control over the level of salaries to be paid to executives of the new company.<\/p><p> I am particularly worried about the effect the licence might have when the national lottery expands into the online area, as intended.  I would not like to see a national lottery portal or smart-phone app becoming a one-stop shop for online gambling companies, such as paddypower.com or betfair.com.  Many people gamble on the national lottery because it gives a good rate of return and because part of the profit goes to good causes within the State.  It would be easy for other companies to buy into a gateway and use the national lottery to expand its services and exploit people who may not wish to avail of their products.  If the national lottery is to go online it should be with a stand-alone portal that would help the company to generate income.<\/p><p> I welcome the fact that the funds generated by the sale will go towards the construction of the new national children's hospital and give a boost to the health services and to employment.<\/p><p> I welcome the Bill but it brings concerns with it.  I hope those concerns will be noted by the Minister and his Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600033#FF00800","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360164900,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I also welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The national lottery has been an enormous success for the country.  Anyone who is involved in community activity can see the benefits &euro;4 billion has brought to the country in the last couple of decades.  It is important that the Bill and any further changes to the national lottery should ensure that the benefit we have seen from the national lottery continues for many years.<\/p><p>  Many of the fears expressed when the national lottery was first proposed have not come to pass.  This is largely due to the good management of the national lottery to date.<\/p><p>  An open tender competition will be required for the new operators of the national lottery licence.  This is bound by EU directives and regulations.  Currently, the provision of postal services is one of the few areas that have been granted a derogation from the normal public procurement process.  For example, someone setting up a new post office, with the ability to gain revenue from the national lottery, is subject to a different set of rules than those that apply in virtually every other sector.  I believe new EU legislation will apply the same procurement rules to applications for a licence to run a post office.  Can the Minister of State assist me in securing some information on the current guidelines for the provision of post office licences and the audit trails that go with them?  That would be very helpful.<\/p><p>  I would support a more robust system of oversight.  We have considerable regulation in this country, and I do not say the national lottery requires more regulation, but giving a broader remit to a regulator who would cover other sectors, such as off-course betting and other forms of gambling, would make sense.<\/p><p>  Ireland is at a slight competitive disadvantage in the broad area of betting, particularly online betting, compared with countries such as Cyprus and Malta.  Legislation is promised in this area.  The betting industry has been successful for our country and as a small open economy we should ensure that other countries do not put legislation in place that would set our businesses at a disadvantage.  That is not to say we do not need to take extreme care that, as with other addictive products that can cause great harm, we do not put measures in place to increase the danger of gambling.<\/p><p>  I disagree with some of the previous speakers on the following point.  In the 21st century, people are entitled to purchase products online.  We must respect people's entitlement to be responsible for their own behaviour.  While I accept that an unfortunate number of post offices are closing, if mature people who can prove they are adults have the capacity and desire to purchase products on line, including the national lottery, they should be facilitated to do so.  Reasonable guidelines and protections should be put in place to prevent abuse and ensure that people are not setting themselves up for significant disadvantages and financial difficulty in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600034#GG00200","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1360164900,"counter":336,"content":"<p>This Bill provides for the privatisation of the national lottery.<\/p><p>To justify this on the basis of getting funding from the sale of the licence for the national lottery over a 20 or 25 year period by claiming the proceeds would go to finance a national children's hospital simply adds a touch of cynicism to the whole idea.  We have been given no clear figures for the cost of the national children's hospital and there are various estimates in the media ranging from &euro;400 million to &euro;600 million.  We have not been given any accurate figures for this nor do we have a clue if the Government goes ahead with this reactionary proposal what the licence would earn for the private capitalists who want to get their hands on it.<\/p><p> To privatise the licence for the national lottery to fund a children's hospital, or any other infrastructure, is to admit this is another tax on ordinary people under the guise of a lottery.  When he introduced the Bill last Thursday, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform referred to some of the states in Australia where the privatisation of the lottery licence was used to get upfront cash payments.  The Minister stated that a number of jurisdictions are examining how best their state or regional lotteries can be used to help alleviate fiscal pressures.  He said it would be remiss of Ireland not to take a similar approach in the case of our lottery at this time.<\/p><p> The national lottery has been transformed into another bailout tax that will fall upon the shoulders of ordinary working class and poor people.  The billions that should go into infrastructure such as the national children's hospital and other infrastructural projects that are desperately needed, such as the remediation of water infrastructure, and that should go into job creation are going instead to pay off banks and bondholders to make up their gambling losses from their reckless profiteering days during the Irish property bubble.  The Government then comes with the begging bowl to ordinary people in various guises, including the national lottery.<\/p><p> It is an extraordinary way to fund public projects, community organisations and social projects that are very necessary and perform a crucial role.  To institutionalise gambling to fund social or physical infrastructure is incredible.  It is also an extremely inefficient way to raise funds.  In 2011, to get &euro;231.9 million for so-called &quot;good causes&quot;, a term I detest and that is patronising and humiliating because these are causes that are in reality necessary social and cultural projects, &euro;761.4 million had to be raised in the national lottery.  There were costs of &euro;104.3 million, prizes of &euro;422.5 million, a modest fee for An Post for managing the national lottery and then, for the projects, there was a total of &euro;231.9 million.  What an extremely inefficient and ineffective way of attempting to raise funds.<\/p><p> It is true, and it is no exaggeration to say it, that national lotteries prey on poor people in particular, those on low incomes and social welfare.  To sell national lottery tickets, there is a cynical endless pushing through television and various other forms of advertising of the impossible dreams of luxury and wealth without end.  The odds of winning, of course, are virtually zero.  Nevertheless, in an Ireland that has been reduced to penury by the disastrous economic policies related to the current crisis in Irish capitalism and by this Government's disastrous austerity policies, increasing numbers of our people are reduced to poverty, low incomes and are struggling to survive.  To prey on them with these images of fabulous wealth is cynical and reprehensible.<\/p><p> A study by academics in University College Cork based on the Irish household budget survey of 2004-05 found the national lottery is socially regressive.  As the Library and Research Service points out in its summing up of the study, poorer households spend larger proportions of their income on the lottery and the evidence casts doubt on the idea that national lottery proceeds are used to favour lower socio-economic households.  On many occasions, national lottery funds have been used as slush funds by the politicians in power to ingratiate themselves with their local constituencies in the most cynical way.<\/p><p> In the current context, with the State bailout of speculators and bondholders to the tune of billions of euro, and using austerity policies to achieve that, Fine Gael and the Labour Party are desperately casting about to make up funding for necessary services such as social and cultural projects and the children's hospital.  These parties have turned their faces completely against taking any measures that would raise serious funding by tackling the super-wealthy in our society who could afford to pay far more towards our services and infrastructure.<\/p><p> The Department of Finance provided us with figures towards the end of last year in preparing for the budget that showed the highest paid 5% in the State earned &euro;20.12 billion and of that paid &euro;7.145 billion in taxes, an effective tax rate of 36%.  Raising that effective tax rate to between 37% and, for those over &euro;1 million in income, 60% would raise &euro;2.5 billion in a single year.  It would still leave that super-wealthy sector of society, a small minority, very wealthy.  Why will the Government not take that option instead of pathetically seeking to flog the licence for the national lottery to some gambling company to get relatively minuscule funding compared to what could be raised by that measure alone?<\/p><p> Similarly, we have produced figures that if the headline corporate tax rate, even remaining at 12.5%, was made the effective tax rate, it would bring many billions of euro extra in on an annual basis.  We got figures from the Minister for Finance which demonstrate the hard facts in this regard.  I have not even raised the issue of a wealth tax.  Therefore, we have a Government which has set its face against raising real amounts of funding to the tune of billions that could transform our infrastructure and our communities in terms of their cultural and social infrastructure.  It is a Government that will not challenge the minority of the super-wealthy and major income earners in order to achieve that but comes with this pathetic privatisation of the national lottery licence.<\/p><p> Privatisation of the licence for the national lottery will mean that the privateers who get it will immediately budget for a private profit.  They are not humanitarians.  This private profit is to be provided for, on the one hand, by increased sales which means encouraging greater numbers of people to gamble, which is quite reprehensible.  In any case, the continuing intensity of austerity means that ordinary people simply do not have major spare funds to increase the amount they spend on the national lottery.  On the other hand, they could cut costs which means wages and conditions of workers who administer the lottery will be squeezed.  It is undoubtedly the case that such course of action will be taken.<\/p><p> There is another cost with which the Minister did not deal.  An Post gets a management fee of &euro;2.7 million over and above the costs to administer the national lottery.  An Post has a universal social obligation to provide services to areas and communities, which services cost it money, for example, in the delivery of post, etc.  An Post does not get social funding from Government to meet this obligation but the Government proposes, possibly, to remove that &euro;2.7 million through handing the lottery over to private profiteers.  If that is the case, how will An Post make up for this funding to assist the provision of its obligation to people and communities, particularly in rural areas?  Instead, the equivalent of this fee will go probably to the private profits of major multinational lottery operators or gambling companies of various kinds.<\/p><p> There are other provisions in the Bill.  There is a regulator and a new stratum of bureaucracy on top of the lottery - a new quango by the Government that was supposed to hold a bonfire of the quangos.  What is that about?  It is not necessary.  There could be supervision from the public service without new costs and a new bureaucracy.  Unfortunately, the Labour Party is shamefully betraying any vestige of a commitment to public ownership in the privatisation of the lottery licence, as it is doing in the privatisation of the Coillte trees, and Fine Gael is also totally wedded to that policy.  If the lottery is a fact of life, the Government at least should keep it in the public sector, keep it with An Post, not extend gambling as a basis for providing necessary services, infrastructure and social, community and cultural infrastructure, and put real tax on the minority in society who can afford it.  That is the alternative to this despicable proposal.<\/p><p> D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, t&aacute;im glan in aghaidh an Bille um Chrannchur N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta 2012.

The national lottery was a tremendous introduction to the country.  It has benefited many different groups and will continue to do so despite some people's castigation as to the philosophy behind it.  It is an institution that is very close to the hearts of many people.  It is also close to the hearts of those people who play it and those groups that receive money from it.  We all know of community groups that have received funding for projects that have brought tremendous benefits to the members of those groups and also to members of the general community.  In recent years many groups in Louth and Meath, including the Meath Youth Federation, For&oacute;ige and St. Oliver's scout group in Drogheda, have received funding that has allowed them to provide better services for the young people who take part in their services.  It has meant that the groups can provide better facilities to young people in communities where they are badly needed.  As a result of this connection between the local groups and the local funding, we must be very sensitive about how we proceed with tendering for the new licence.<\/p><p>  I wish to focus on two important elements of the national lottery - the retail margins and community funding.  The Minister of State will be very aware that small traders are finding it very difficult in a tough environment at the moment.  We must do everything we can to make it as easy as possible for them to come out at the other side of the recession.  Under the current licence operated by An Post, retailers get approximately &euro;6 from every &euro;100 worth of lottery products sold.  No details have been provided on how this will operate under the new tender, but many small retail groups have noted that the retail sales margin has been left out of the Bill and they are concerned about what that might mean for them.  At this time of uncertainty we should give them some degree of certainty about their finances over the 20-year lifetime of this new tender.  It would not be unfair to have uncertainty for retail outlets, planning their finances and wondering how they will get through the upcoming period.  A commitment has been made to keep the margin at 6% and I hope the Government does its best to keep that commitment when the tender is released in coming months.<\/p><p>  At the moment 30% of the income raised by the national lottery goes to groups that need funding.  The Bill makes no provision for this to continue, which has raised concerns among many groups that the new operator might slash the funding made available to them, resulting in a reduction in the number of facilities that could be provided or a reduction in the number of groups that could be supported.  It is very important that this percentage will be covered in the tender documents.  Community groups need to be reassured that they will not lose out when we change the terms of this licence.  We all know the front-loaded payment will go towards the new children's hospital and everybody in this House welcomes that proposal.  However, we also need to ensure that community groups can continue to access funding over the 20 years of the licence.  Many people play the lotto because they know the money raised will go to good causes.  It is not all about becoming a millionaire or winning the lottery - people know that while they may not recoup their money in prizes, it is going to a good cause.  That is why so many people play it and enjoy playing it.  Any changes we make to it will stir up passions among people in this House and outside.  I wish the Minister the best of luck with the tender process.  We all agree it is in the best interests of the country to get the process right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600037#KK00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1360166700,"counter":341,"content":"<p>The National Lottery Act 1986 provides the legislative basis for the national lottery.  The current national lottery licence, which is held by An Post National Lottery Company, is due to expire in 2013.  The national lottery is not, in my view, being sold.  The licence to operate the national lottery is being sold, which will generate revenue for the State.  Obviously, there will be a competition for the award of the next licence and the successful bidder for the new licensee will be required to make an advance payment to the State.  The objective of the licence competition is to procure a substantial upfront payment for the State in return for granting an exclusive right to operate the national lottery for a 20-year period while the State will continue to retain significant annual revenues for good causes.<\/p><p>  As a result, the legislation governing the national lottery needs to be revised.  The Bill before the House is in many respects based on the 1986 Act, which is now being repealed, but also includes certain new provisions, including the establishment of a new independent national lottery regulator.  The new legislation intends to continue with the provision of a framework for the operation of a national lottery.  It is also intended to continue to safeguard the integrity and viability of the national lottery, for example, through the safeguarding of cash generated by lottery sales, the approval of lottery games by the regulator and the provision of step-in powers for the regulator.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a new national lottery regulator, who will be independent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government, which I welcome.  It is intended that the new regulator will be funded by an annual levy to be paid by the operator of the national lottery.<\/p><p>  The Bill provides that the national lottery will continue to be operated by a distinct company, whose sole purpose will be the holding of the national lottery.  The Minister will no longer have an involvement in the company - he will not hold shares in the company or appoint its directors.  I support this separation of political power from the national lottery and independence in this regard is essential.<\/p><p>  The Bill contains a number of provisions on the regulation of the national lottery, for example, provisions regarding the sale of tickets and the circumstances in which a licence may be amended or revoked.  The Bill provides that, in the event of the licence being revoked, the regulator will have step-in powers to take over the management of the national lottery.<\/p><p>  The Bill provides for the sale of national lottery tickets via interactive channels as well as through retail outlets.  In an international context, lotteries are doing more business through interactive channels.  The playing of lottery games on the Internet is seen as the most likely area of growth for lottery sales in the future.  This development needs to be observed carefully and steps will need to be taken to try to guard against gambling addictions being formed and also to guard against existing gambling addicts being enabled to continue to feed their habit, which is immensely self-destructive.  I recall the misery caused in this city by the scourge of one-armed bandits before councillors on Dublin Corporation rescinded the adoption of the Gaming and Lotteries Act in the Dublin city area in the late 1980s, which was welcomed at the time.<\/p><p>  Local shops face significant challenges in the current economic environment and as an essential part of our local communities they should be afforded all protections possible in terms of their revenues.  In that light, I would like to see the modest margin paid to retail agents of, I believe, 6%, protected in the new legislation, and I welcome that the Minister has said he will ensure that this is case in the licence itself where deciding the rates of the margin paid to agents are more appropriately contained.<\/p><p>  I understand that discussions have begun between management and unions on how arrangements for the new national lottery licence may affect the serving staff of the current operator.  The statutory rights of staff need to be taken into account and protected and their past service also needs to be recognised.<\/p><p>  With the continually improving sentiment towards Ireland in the financial markets, I hope that a substantial upfront payment can be achieved for the licence.  It is important that a good deal is achieved in this regard as the more income the State is able to generate the better for its people.<\/p><p>  I refer to the disbursement of national lottery grants for sports and community activities.  I believe that greater transparency is needed and the decision-making function should be transferred to local government.  The current position perpetuates the perception that party political considerations play a part in deciding who gets national lottery funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600037#KK00300","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1360166700,"counter":342,"content":"<p>It is hard to believe that the national lottery was established in 1987.  Through the years it has obviously raised substantial amounts of money for the four main sectors of youth, sports and recreational amenities; health and welfare; arts, culture and national heritage; and, in particular, the Irish language.  The Bill will repeal 1986 legislation and establish a new national lottery regulator.  The new National Lottery Bill will, please God, mean an upfront payment to the Government by the successful tenderer for the 20-year licence.  The upfront payment to the State in the longer term could be in the region of &euro;500 million.<\/p><p>The objective of the licence competition is to procure a substantial upfront payment for the State in return for the granting of exclusive rights to operate the lottery for a 20 year period while retaining significant revenues to be utilised for good causes.  <\/p><p> I commend the current lottery licence holder, An Post, which has held the licence since 2001, on the excellent job it has done, particularly for communities.  Every community in which there has been a substantial winner is aware of the excitement a win causes, including for the local agent who sells the winning ticket.  I congratulate An Post on its commitment.  <\/p><p> The Bill proposes a relaxation of the rules governing online sales in an attempt to increase the saleability of the licence, which will be auctioned.  Currently, less than 3% of ticket sales are via the Internet, which is in stark contrast to our European counterparts where up to 15% of business is generated online.  The Bill provides various player safeguards, including strict age verification systems and self-exclusion opportunities to comply with responsible gambling norms.  Key to this legislation is the decision to ring-fence just over 30% of lottery income for good causes.  The licence will be extended to 20 years.  This means the successful bidder will be able to provide continuity of service, value for money and stability to our much loved institution.  The Bill also provides for appropriate financial, probity, regulatory and other safeguards, which will ensure the operational flexibility required to facilitate the growth of the 20 year licence.<\/p><p> Currently, two thirds of Irish adults are regular lottery players.  Those who have had the unsuccessful flutter can rest easy in the knowledge that 30% of our gamble will continue to go directly to good causes.  To date, the national lottery has provided more than &euro;4 billion in funding to youth, sports and amenity projects throughout Ireland.  Among the most recent beneficiaries of national lottery funding were our Olympian boxing champion, Katie Taylor, fellow Olympic medalists, Paddy Barnes and John Joe Nevin, and sailing sensation, Annalise Murphy.  National lottery funds are also used to support a massive range of projects and charities, including Down Syndrome Ireland, the Paralympics team, Gl&oacute;r Theatre, Ennis, The Myasthenia Gravis Association, the Alzheimer's Association of Ireland and Barnardos, to name but a few.  Since the establishment of the national lottery, almost &euro;4 billion has been raised for good causes.  Of the money raised by the national lottery during 2012, some &euro;718 million was returned to communities, which represents 93% of sales.  Following the sale of the licence, the lottery will continue to make a positive difference, with &euro;200 million of the amount paid for the licence to be put towards the construction of the new national children's hospital.  <\/p><p> The national lottery has been so successful people have become complacent about it.  More than &euro;225 million per year is generated for good causes.  When people were asked in a recent national lottery survey how much they thought it generated, the response was &euro;70 million.  As such, it is far more successful than people know.  There is no community in Ireland that has not benefited from national lottery funding.  Prior to Christmas last, my constituency was successful in obtaining a sporting grant from the national lottery of &euro;1.3 million, which was very much welcomed and will make a significant difference to the community.<\/p><p> The national lottery is a firm institution and is responsible for the creation of 447 millionaires.  It has generated more than &euro;6.3 billion in prizes and channelled more than &euro;4 billion into good causes.  The funding has been a catalyst for community development, with groups who raise a significant portion of the funding they require receiving a national lottery grant.  Communities benefit from the work of individuals on the ground.  Along with core funding, this stimulates development of our communities and towns throughout Ireland.  This can only be good and to our benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600037#KK00400","speaker":"1075","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360167300,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Like others, I have fond memories of the introduction of the national lottery in 1986.  The Government has decided that award of the new licence will be by way of competition.  The successful bidder will in purchasing this licence make a major contribution, by way of an upfront payment, towards construction of the new national children's hospital.<\/p><p>  I was one of the first agents of the national lottery when it was introduced in 1986.  The increased footfall it brought to my newsagents and other newsagents helped us survive.  Many sports and voluntary and charitable organisations have received funding from the national lottery down through the years.  I was in Australia prior to 1986 and saw at first hand how popular playing the lottery was there.  I suppose I had a bit of an edge because I understood from a business point of view that without the lotto my business would not survive.  <\/p><p>  I was secretary of Boyle Celtic soccer club at the time the national lottery was established.  I understand that the application made by that club to the national lottery for funding was the second on file.  On the first day of sales, there was great demand by men and women for tickets.  I was concerned about the impact of this on the country, with everybody losing control of their spending.  I recall saying that night that if spending was not curbed we would have a serious gambling problem in the country as a result.  I am glad people recognised they had as much chance of winning with a &euro;1 ticket as a &euro;20 ticket.  In my experience, there has not been much over-spend on the lotto during the past ten or 20 years.  <\/p><p>  As stated by Deputy Kenny, while the problem of gambling on slot machines has been regulated by the local authorities, online gambling is now creating problems.  However, I acknowledge it is important people can purchase the lotto via the Internet, the margin on which will be only 6%.  Many of the larger shops such as Tesco and so on are now lottery agents.  It is important the new licence holder is aware of the importance to small shops, in terms of survival, of being a lottery agent.  Also, small shops are often more accessible than the larger outlets. <\/p><p>  It was a joy for my colleague and I when we met the Minister in 1987 to be told that Boyle Celtic club was to receive funding of &pound;20,000.  We went home that night and celebrated.  Everybody was delighted.  The club was built and the pitch has been in use now for the past 28 years.  The standard of the pitch is incredible.  The cost of the project at that time was &pound;67,000, &pound;20,000 of which was funded by the national lottery and the remainder of which was raised locally.  It was money well spent.   <\/p><p>  An Post has been very professional in its operation of the national lottery.  While there has been much pressure on it down through the years at political level in regard to the location of lottery machines, I believe its decisions in this regard were fair.  However, I would say that.  I wish the Minister every success.  I hope we get a windfall for the country.  It is hoped the new licence holder will ensure there is no over-gambling by people.  We are moving with the times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600038#LL00200","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1360167900,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  Like others, I have seen the tremendous success national lottery funding has been in this country on a number of fronts.  It has provided a level of gambling, gaming and entertainment in a very controlled and regulated way for those who play it.  Irish society has a penchant for gaming and gambling whether at the dogs, horses or bingo.  Some would suggest, perhaps rightly, that it is State-sponsored gambling and another tax on the poor.  When such a system is put in place, one must be exceptionally careful to recognise that within its ambit one has something which, if it goes out of control, can have dramatic and disastrous consequences for those who participate and play.<\/p><p>  It has been so successful in Ireland since its inception in 1986 because of how the current licence holder has succeeded in managing the growth of the product and the introduction of new products in a careful way which looks to the potential dangers and ramifications of being overly avaricious in terms of trying to target new players or trying to target the average revenue per user.  It has been a tremendous success because the State and An Post have been able to demonstrate to the players and citizens at large where their tax euro goes.  Our communities are very well aware of the very positive benefits associated with the spoils of the national lottery.<\/p><p>  Others have spoken about projects developed in their constituencies and it is the same in mine, in areas with which I am mightily familiar.  I am minded of the support a former Minister with responsibility for health gave to a cystic fibrosis unit attached to the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick, involving a voluntary organisation developing facilities for cystic fibrosis sufferers.  It received approximately &euro;300,000 over two years which allowed it to garner other funds from philanthropic organisations.  Now it is working towards a state-of-the-art facility.  This has significant benefits which might not have been provided or might not be on the development list now were it not for these funds being available.  It will have a meaningful impact on the lives of many young people.  It is easy for some who might say this should be provided by the State, but the State can only levy taxes to a certain extent, and it is necessary to allow this discretionary spend and having another stream of revenue which again can be distributed from State coffers.<\/p><p>  The national lottery has worked well in terms of the support it has given to sporting organisations locally and nationally and has allowed for very significant investment at grass roots level.  We are well aware of the much improved facilities which virtually every club in Ireland has with regard to playing surfaces, changing areas, gyms and facilities not only for those who play but all those who participate by coming to observe.<\/p><p>  From the outset the package has been developed well and it has developed in a very controlled way.  The national lottery through An Post has advertised that one could be that millionaire, driving that Ferrari or lying on that beach.  At times I was concerned about the notion of the dream being very much part of this advertising.  I have a problem with this because it pulls the strings of a certain vulnerable cohort in the community but sometimes it was so overstated it was almost laughable and therefore not as infectious as some advertising campaigns might be, such as those by drinks companies in the past or by cigarette companies which had a very specific methodology for hooking new participants for their products.<\/p><p>  I am against the Bill because I am concerned that too much responsibility will be handed over to the new licence holder.  The State is seeking an upfront payment which will be a significant boost to the State and will allow it to do certain noble things.  My concern is that the new operator will try to increase the overall take from the national lottery spend, which can be done in two ways: either through giving less back to good causes or increasing sales which Deputy Regina Doherty indicated could be done through an extension into online gaming.  It is my recollection there is no prohibition on online gaming.  The former director of the national lottery, Ray Bates, was a former Department of Finance official.  I thought he understood lotteries and the importance of where a national lottery could go wrong and the negative impact it could have on society.  He crafted and developed the organisation in a way that ensured it did not boil over and become overly avaricious.<\/p><p>  I am concerned if the national lottery goes outside State control and we end up with an international player driving to get a return on the investment made upfront.  We may see new games, including online games which by themselves require one to spend more in a less controlled environment.  I am also conscious that other countries have a game known as keno which involves multiple draws every ten or 15 minutes and is usually located in pubs or clubs.  Such games would move the national lottery into hard gambling.  We must accept it is gambling, but I would argue it is soft gambling, no more than horses, dogs and bingo.  This is where the line would be breached between entertainment and soft gambling and we would end up with an absolute tax on the poor, with games developed and created to target this audience which will spend more than it should because the return seems possible.  Recurring draws every ten or 15 minutes are quite addictive.  There are people who spend too much on the national lottery but they will spend it today and then must wait until Wednesday or Saturday.  This is controllable, but a multiplicity of games which turn over every few minutes has the real potential to move people into an area associated with slot machines and casino-led gaming.  We must be exceptionally careful.  This is my biggest concern with regard to the legislation.<\/p><p>  I note the real success achieved by the national lottery and I ask the Minister of State to take on board the views and concerns I have raised.  These views have also been expressed by others associated with addiction to gambling organisations.  They are concerned about anything which might tip the balance.  The national lottery is well maintained and well structured and it has been very well managed.  I appreciate the Minister of State can stand up and say there will be a regulator.<\/p><p>  I am conscious we cannot hardwire into the legislation that the licence will be given to An Post and I am not here to make the case for An Post.  I accept under various competition directives from Europe it is not possible for the State to issue a licence to a sub-division of the State and this puts the Government in a very difficult position.  If it could hand it over to An Post there would be at least a level of control at arms length.  I do not advocate this as it would be nonsensical.  For this reason I am deeply concerned that outside players are being brought in.<\/p><p>  I have some knowledge of the lottery industry as well as having a general interest in the area.  I am not casting aspersions on lottery service providers or lotteries in other countries, but there are different cultures which treat this differently.  I have seen the low end of lottery participation and I do not see much difference between this sector of the market and slot machines in a casino.  I have grave concerns about this.  We need to be very careful about whether the legislation will be prescriptive about the extent to which control of the games will be a factor or feature of it, or whether State supervision or acceptance will be required before these games are introduced.<\/p><p>I want to acknowledge the role the lottery has played since its inception in funding various groups and organisations in the State.  An awful lot of development at county level would not have taken place had it not been for lottery grants.  There was much economic activity around those lottery grants, as well as socio-economic improvements for sports, health projects and others.<\/p><p> In the context of this legislation, I also acknowledge that the new national children's hospital might be partially funded through the national lottery.  My subsequent comments are in no way meant to take from the positive work achieved over the years by the lottery in its current format.  However, I do have a number of concerns surrounding the Bill's proposals.  First, I think the legislation does not contain sufficient detail to govern the offering of this licence in the market.  Lessons will have to be taken from the many mistakes that were made in selling off either enterprises or State assets without the best interests of the taxpayer in mind.<\/p><p> One has only to look at the current reports on toll roads, for example, to understand that the State will have to continue funding those very profitable companies simply because they have not reached the numbers.  The detail of the contract concerning this licence is very important.  In many cases, however, the State does not look at the detail sufficiently and, as a result, the State is short-changed so the taxpayer had to stump up considerable sums to support the transaction that has taken place.<\/p><p> The legislation needs to be more robust and detailed in terms of the transaction involved.  There is an opportunity for the Minister to use the appropriate Oireachtas committee to set out the detail of the transaction and the licence, thus giving greater clarity concerning the agents' 6% and their profitability.  The uncertainty needs to be removed.<\/p><p> We also need to examine the regulatory framework being put in place.  Various regulators have already been put in place and are being paid in the region of &euro;180,000 a year.  In some cases, there is a second or third person on exactly the same level of salary.  Within the same organisations, a significant number of employees are earning over &euro;100,000 per annum.  The body of staff grows over the years because bureaucracy simply encourages the regulator's staff to grow and prosper at the expense of the State.<\/p><p> One would have to question the type of regulation we have seen.  In most cases when an application is made for an increase in ESB, gas or Eircom charges, they look at the cost of the regulator's administration.  They also look at the other cost items concerning the company.  They almost always grant the increase, so one must ask if the structure itself, in terms of its cost in salaries and bureaucracy, actually serves the citizen it is supposed to protect.  It does not seem to do so.  It actually serves the corporate entity that it is supposed to regulate.  That is what I have seen from the three or four regulators who are currently there.<\/p><p> In opposition, the Government said it would remove a lot of quangos, yet it is now doing exactly the opposite.  I would like to see the Government sticking to its guns and having a different corporate structure in place to oversee the lottery, with far less cost and far more accountability to the State.  In this instance, one could reduce the 6% on agents' tickets.  The sum of &euro;6 in &euro;100 is nothing.  What will happen to the agency structure when this licence is given out and it becomes a new entity?  What about all the other agents?  What is the criterion for establishing an agency?  What criteria will be used by the new entity to give out agencies across the country?  What will their performance expectations be?  They are serving local communities and it is important to a local business.  The Minister of State needs to reflect on that because at the moment I am hearing numerous complaints about the lottery being taken from individual businesses and thus affecting their viability.  This is in spite of the fact that the turnover figures would stand up.<\/p><p> RGDATA - of which I was once a member - and the Convenience Stores and Newsagents' Association have made submissions on the agents' figure as to whether there is a commitment to hold it at 6% or to increase it.  There is much more to it than the 6% figure.  There are also performance issues and the appointment of agents, particularly new ones.<\/p><p> I also have issues over the new licence.  The Bill states that any terms that are considered necessary or expedient will be included, and that there will be a code of practice contained within the licence.  What does that mean?  Surely as legislators we should know what that means.  We should know the background to the licence and the detail concerning the appointment of agents.  In addition, we should know what is being committed to in terms of agents' fees and profitability, but we do not.  Yet we are expected to pass the legislation without knowing that.  We should also know the detail of the regulator's office and what the potential is for staff numbers.  What will they be related to and are they being taken from the Civil Service or being recruited externally?  What will be their terms and conditions?<\/p><p> What will be the audit arrangement concerning the Comptroller and Auditor General?  I note the legislation proposes an arrangement whereby the Comptroller and Auditor General would examine the accounts.  What is the extent of that audit, however, and what is the extent of the role of the Committee of Public Accounts?  The Bill mentions another committee regarding oversight but not the Committee of Public Accounts.  I would like to see that stitched into this legislation.<\/p><p> Another issue is the period of the licence.  The proposal is for a period of 20 or 25 years, but are we going down the same road we went with the road tolls?  Will we find after five years that we have sold the taxpayer short, and that we could have got much more for the licence?  What are the performance criteria relative to this licence that the Minister will insist upon when the new licence holder is the operator?  We need to know that.  Twenty years is far too long.  What if we have a bad operator?  We know what that means - it will just go into litigation with all sorts of crossfire between Departments, the Oireachtas and the operator.  Unsatisfactory arrangements can lead to protracted legal arguments, so one may be stuck with the operator for 20 years.  Surely there should be five-year reviews with an analysis of all this after that period.  The legislation needs to be far more detailed on that matter, so that there is no wriggle room for any licence-holder or sharp operator the State may find itself with.  I am not saying it will, but it could.<\/p><p> Every single eventuality should be covered in the legislation.  The Bill is short on detail and requires much more analysis on whether we really want to create another regulator absorbing so much cost to the State.  Where does the citizen fit into this and how can taxpayers' money be protected?<\/p><p>The committee system in the House should be used to a greater extent to expose the detail which is not included in this Bill but which should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600039#MM00100","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360169100,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Next, we have Deputies Pat Breen, Tom Hayes and Peter Fitzpatrick who intend to share 20 minutes.

The games have remained popular over the years and have brought a substantial amount of income to a number of projects nationwide.  The wealth that has been created has financed many worthwhile projects.  In the 25 years since the establishment of the national lottery in 1986, approximately &#8364;12 billion has been generated in sales and &#8364;4 billion has been donated to good causes.  The funding is spent on many worthwhile projects, such as services for people with disabilities, which is extremely important, services for the elderly, sport in particular, music and the overall advancement of Irish culture.  Many communities in my own constituency of Clare have benefited from lottery funding.  For instance, the Gl&oacute;r Theatre, Ennis, is a perfect example of the contribution the national lottery has made in support of the arts.  This premier venue has seen the performance of many musicals and other art forms, but without the funding it would have been difficult to open the doors of this fantastic facility which is located in the centre of Ennis.<\/p><p><br \/>  Involvement in sporting and leisure activities also is extremely important, particularly for people's physical and mental health.  In this context, funding through the sports capital programme has transformed the facilities that various sporting organisations in County Clare have provided over the years.  On the reintroduction of the scheme last year by the current Government after a lapse of four years, it elicited huge interest from many clubs and I believe that for every euro available, there was a demand for &#8364;7.50.  Ultimately, 23 projects out of 70 were funded to the tune of nearly &#8364;740,000.  It was great to see so many clubs being successful, among them being my own local GAA club of Ballynacally.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, lottery funding is essential for many organisations that provide health related services in our communities.  For instance, the Brothers of Charity services operating in Ennis were allocated &#8364;100,000 for the remodelling and renovation of existing workshops on the Kilrush Road.  Another recipient was The Clare Crusaders Children's Charity, which is a voluntary organisation that provides a great service in Barefield, County Clare, for approximately 190 children with special needs.  Similarly, assistance was provided for a minibus for the Friends of Ennistymon Hospital, while Carrigoran House, Newmarket, received funding towards the development of a satellite catering service for its new day care service, which was opened recently.  Consequently, this funding is extremely important and has benefited various other projects, including the AstroTurf pitch for the community of Tulla, child care facilities and environmental projects.<\/p><p><br \/>  This is the reason I welcome the stipulation in the legislation that a fixed percentage of the annual lottery turnover must continue to go to some good causes.  The percentage has been set at 30.5%, which is the same level of funds disbursed to good causes in 2011.  I believe this to be significant as it demonstrates the Government is committed to ensuring that the voluntary and community sectors, such as those I already have mentioned, will continue to receive support under the new national lottery system.  It also is important to point out that by selling this licence, the State is not giving up all the future funding in exchange for a one-time upfront payment.  The opposite is the case because it will ensure the <i>status quo<\/i> and the level of support for good causes is maintained.  The lottery is extremely important and one half of the adult population claims to have played it regularly at one point.  Many people are not aware of how vital and beneficial it is for the aforementioned organisations that these proceeds go into such centres and organisations in particular, as well as to other spheres of culture in Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  The main benefits to be derived from undertaking an open sale competition to appoint a new operator are twofold.  First, by having an open sale competition for a new operator, one ensures the State will get the best possible deal.  In this context, it appears that a number of companies, both in Ireland and overseas, are interested in acquiring the national lottery licence.  This is what the State needs, namely, the best possible deal to secure the money for projects.  The obligation on the successful operator to make an upfront payment will ensure the funding required for the development of the national children's hospital will be secured.  The development of the national children's hospital is an extremely important project not just for Dublin, but for the entire country.  Everyone present in this Chamber recognises the need for such a hospital and to have a modern facility.  All such facilities are extremely expensive and the sale of the licence will help to ease the burden on taxpayers when it comes to funding this project, which is one of the largest projects in the current capital plan.  Various reports put the projected revenue to be gained from the sale of a licence to be in the region of &#8364;500 million, which is a significant amount of money and which certainly would play an important role in financing the national children's hospital.<\/p><p><br \/>  As I stated earlier, playing the lottery's games has proved to be very popular.  New games are continually being introduced and they have proved to be very popular.  However, one aspect of this Bill about which I have concerns for a number of reasons is that unlike the National Lottery Act 1986, it places no restrictions on online playing.  At present, the purchasing of cards online amounts to approximately 3% of volume compared with approximately 15% in other European countries.  Everyone is aware of the addictions that can develop from online purchasing.  This much is evident in respect of online betting, where young people use their apps and mobile telephones to bet.  Were online purchases to increase, the same could happen.  In addition, it is important for rural Ireland in particular to have the tickets for sale in shops because if one increases the online purchasing of lottery tickets, it certainly will be at the expense of the local shop and all Members are aware of the pressure on such shops and post offices at present.  If someone goes in to buy a lottery ticket, they also will buy something in the shop itself.  Consequently, I am somewhat concerned about this and would like to see more restrictions on such sales.  I certainly do not seek to have greater numbers of people getting hooked on the online purchasing of such tickets in the way people have become hooked on online betting.  It has been proved there is room for the market to grow.  It has been stated that half the adult population has played a lottery game at some point.  It is important to try to grow this market in a manner that does not place significant burdens on people.  As previous speakers have noted, one can see the glamour of all the advertisements to the effect that one can win a fortune and be a millionaire for the rest of one's life.  However, very few people achieve such a level of winnings.  Nevertheless, online purchasing is convenient for people and I worry about that.<\/p><p><br \/>  Another important element of this legislation is that any new operator will be answerable to a Government regulator.  This will allow the Government to continue to have some control over the lottery and to have the ability to take back full control should it perceive any negligent action on the operator's part.  Such a safety net is important because it would allow for the continued integrity of the lottery and would ensure the lottery will continue to be run in a beneficial manner for all the people of Ireland.  Consequently, the proposed regulator will have a very important role to play.  The lottery has become a great source of entertainment and funding for the people of Ireland.  This Bill is a necessary step in ensuring we continue to build on its success by capitalising on the opportunities in the growth area in lottery ticketing and ensuring local communities and voluntary sectors continue to receive funding as they have in the past under the watchful eye of the regulator.  Moreover, the taxpayer will continue to get good value for money and at the same time, funding will be secured for a number of important projects, particularly the national children's hospital, concerning the site of which there was so much controversy over the years.  I welcome the legislation and commend the Minister on bringing it before the House.<\/p><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on this very important Bill, the National Lottery Bill 2012.  The national lottery has been a feature of our lives since 1986, when the then Minister of State, Donal Creed, introduced it.  There were many questions at the time, particularly from the Opposition, about whether it was a good idea and if it would see more people gambling.  The results speak for themselves, and the Irish people are very pleased with them.  Listening to the contributions this afternoon, one could say that public representatives, particularly Members in the D&aacute;il, are pleased with what has happened ever since.<\/p><p> The national lottery has funded many good causes right around the country, including those in the sporting, cultural and social spheres.  Organisations have received funding which would otherwise have been unable to complete projects.  In the youth and sport area, there are monuments in every parish in the country from Donegal to Kerry and from Wexford to Monaghan.  It has helped to keep young people, in particular, out of trouble.  Sport and recreation is good for our health.  We have spoken about people being overweight and obese people needing help.  There is much money being spent by the Department of Health in trying to cure people of diseases that could have been prevented if they had kept fit or in a trim manner.  The former Minister of State, Donal Creed, had much foresight in introducing the legislation to establish the national lottery.<\/p><p> It is important that we try to improve and revitalise the national lottery for the next generation.  There are large amounts of money involved, so it is vital that we ensure the highest standards of integrity in operating the national lottery.  This Bill provides for competition to acquire the exclusive rights to operate the national lottery for a 20 year period.  It is important that the period is that length, as there is no point in putting it to tender for a shorter period.  The company which will operate the project will need at least that much time to focus, and it is important that the process can be moulded over that time.  This exclusive right is a valuable property and it is entirely appropriate that it should be awarded on foot of a well-run competition.  It is important that the people involved can put their best foot forward, and often in the past people did not get the opportunity to tender.  This Bill will allow people to run the project efficiently and do a good job.<\/p><p> In the interests of the taxpayers and the population in general, we must get the best price for the awarding of this exclusive right, with the highest possible proportion of money paid upfront.  Our country is in dire need of finance, and the Government has decided that this will provide funding for the new national children's hospital.  That is to be commended.  The decision to get an external party to run the national lottery, with part of the money received to go to the new children's hospital, is a good one.<\/p><p> I have much to say but I must mention the projects in my constituency of Tipperary South, including those in Emly in west Tipperary, Tipperary town, Lattin, Bansha, Golden, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir.  Across Tipperary South there are projects funded by the national lottery, and I thank everybody involved in them.  The current Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has done a great job, and I also thank previous Ministers who gave out funding and helped Deputies around the country in contributing to constituencies.  The projects are worthwhile and I hope the process will continue.  I ask the Government to cross all the t's and dot the i's.  There has been much valuable work and it has made a great contribution to Irish society.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure no mistakes are made and when the regulator is put in place, it should be a simple authority.  Local shops should be kept involved and no matter who wins the licence, people must be able to purchase a lotto ticket in every local village.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600041#OO00300","speaker":"974","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360169700,"counter":351,"content":"<p>The national lottery was set up by the National Lottery Act 1986 and has been run under licence by An Post since.

It will provide for a new national lottery regulator, which shall be funded by the national lottery operator and independent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It will continue to protect the integrity of the national lottery through the continual safeguarding of cash generated by national lottery sales and set out certain principles regarding the regulation of the national lottery.  For example, there are the circumstances in which a licence can be amended or revoked.  The Bill will continue to provide a legislative framework for the operation of the national lottery.<\/p><p>  To date there has been little amendment to the original legislation governing the national lottery.  In 2011, there was a transfer of responsibility from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Under section 8 of the 1986 Act, the national lottery fund was established and was used to receive the proceeds of the lottery from An Post National Lottery Company and the payback, cost and prize money for the company.  There was also a facility to transfer surplus money to the central funds after leaving an appropriate amount for possible liabilities for good causes and investing for the benefit of the fund any money not currently required.<\/p><p>  To the end of 2011, the 25 years of the national lottery generated more than &euro;12 billion in funds for good causes.  Money for good causes is distributed between Departments through the process of Estimates of expenditure, and the Department decides where the funding goes.  Included in the Bill are the categories of good causes, including sport and recreation; national culture and heritage, including Irish languages; art under the Arts Act 2003; and health of the community, as well as youth and welfare amenities.  The Government may also determine other categories.<\/p><p>  Sections 26 to 28 in Part 4 provides for the licensing of the national lottery, and one licence can exist at any one time.  The terms of section 26 are general, and the competition can be conducted in any manner, as long as the Minister's direction is abided by and the eventual winner is considered suitable by the regulator.  Under section 28, the details of the licence and the code of practice contained within the licence are to be published by the regulator.  This publication is not to include commercially sensitive information.<\/p><p>  Currently, the national lottery is run by a subsidiary of An Post, the An Post National Lottery Company.  Under section 29, operation of the national lottery will be carried out by a subsidiary company formed by the licence holder.  The memorandum and articles of association of the new company must be approved by the regulator.  The minimum amount of funding going to prizes will be raised from 40% to 50% and the terms determining who can buy or own a national lottery ticket will remain unchanged.  People prohibited from doing so include persons under 18 and staff of the operator; any person in a company that prints lottery tickets; and any person in a company the supplies computers, electronic devices, computer programmes or related products that are used by the operator.  National lottery tickets cannot be sold for less than normal or for free.<\/p><p>Others who may not purchase a lottery ticket include persons employed in a company that prints lottery tickets and any person in a company that supplies computers, electronic devices, computer programmes or related products used by the operator of the national lottery.<\/p><p> Part 3, comprising sections 7 to 25, inclusive, provides for a new independent office of regulator of the national lottery.  The term of the regulator is up to seven years.  Under section 9, the function of the regulator are as follows: to license the holding of the national lottery; to ensure the lottery is run with all due propriety; to ensure the interests of participants in the national lottery are protected; to ensure the revenues allocated to good causes are as great as possible; and to monitor and enforce compliance by the operator.<\/p><p> The debate on the reform of the national lottery has focused on the possibility that a new licenceholder will emerge, an upfront fee will be charged, the licence will be longer and the licenceholder will achieve greater profits.  These matters are not considered by the Bill, however.  The main changes implemented under the legislation will be to provide for an independent regulator, chosen by the Minister, to oversee the operation of the licence and the competition for the new licence.<\/p><p> The Bill will provide greater transparency as regards the licence and establish an enhanced system of compliance and enforcement.  It will be the terms of the new licence, however, that will have a greater impact on changes from the current licence system and national lottery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600042#PP00300","speaker":"1068","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360170300,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Since 1986, An Post has held the licence for running the national lottery.  The company has been successful and competent in its management of the lotto and has at all times complied with regulations and conditions attached to the licence.  The current management fee to An Post of &euro;2.7 million is most reasonable and provides vital income to a semi-State body that is striving to maintain and enhance its services.  Many post offices, especially those located in rural areas, are under review.  The loss to an An Post of essential revenue from the national lottery management fee will have a domino effect on the viability of all postal services.  In recent years, the first target of An Post management in any restructuring arrangement has been rural post offices.  The closure of rural post offices is compounding the already dire circumstances in many areas which have experienced or are about to experience the closure of Garda stations and where pubs and shops are under threat, creameries have been centralised and small local schools are under pressure.  Moreover, in many parishes GAA teams have been forced to amalgamate with neighbouring parishes to field under age and, in some cases, senior teams.  This is a regular occurrence in rural areas, especially in County Kerry, and these factors are leading many communities to lose their identity and sense of community.<\/p><p>  The proposal before us is akin to selling the family silver.  Since its inauguration in 1986, the national lottery has been one of the most successful initiatives in generating much-needed funds that have transformed and revitalised organisations and voluntary groups throughout the country.  It has provided facilities and services in sport, health, culture, etc., which provide immeasurable benefits to citizens.<\/p><p>  It appears there is widespread worldwide interest in securing the national lottery licence, with international companies from Australia, Canada, Britain, Italy and elsewhere on the Continent willing to bid for it.  It is imperative that An Post is given every opportunity and afforded a level playing pitch to allow it to compete actively for the new licence in any auction or bidding exercise.  The national lottery and its staff have provided an excellent and efficient service since the 1980s and there is no guarantee a new operator would live up to the standards it has set.<\/p><p>  Ireland's record in privatising State companies is dismal and we have clearly failed to learn the lessons of the Eircom disaster.  The failed privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann, a company that was building an international quality standard in communications infrastructure and networks, is the main reason we have not provided an adequate standard of broadband in many areas.  This failure is a major deficiency in our efforts to revitalise the ailing economy.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, expressed a similar view when speaking of the privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>  The proposal to raise the minimum amount of funds allocated to prizes from 40% to 50% is unnecessary as the existing prize money offers an adequate incentive for members of the public to participate in the national lottery.  An additional 10% of national lottery revenue should instead be added to the fund for good causes.  Since 2001, more than &euro;2.5 billion has been expended under the good causes provision.  It is estimated that the new national children's hospital will cost &euro;250 million.  The funding required for the children's hospital could be allocated over a three year period under the current national lottery mechanism, thus resolving in a satisfactory manner the priority of providing the new facility while avoiding interference with the current lottery structure.<\/p><p>  Increasing the number of outlets operating as lottery sales agents would provide a further boost to sales and enhance the viability of many of the small businesses that made unsuccessful applications to become lottery agents.  The Internet accounts for only 3% of national lottery sales.  While I accept the view expressed by previous speakers that promoting online lottery sales has a downside, we should nevertheless target the international market for online sales.  The United Kingdom is on our doorstep and offers the potential to achieve a dramatic increase in sales.  Many people with Irish connections reside in Britain and it constitutes a very large market.  Marketing the national lottery internationally could increase the proportion of online lottery sales from the current level of 3% to between 15% and 20%.  The additional revenue generated by these two initiatives could be ring-fenced for a three year period and used to fund the national children's hospital project.<\/p><p>  The proposition set out in the Bill will be a mistake in the long term for a variety of reasons, not least because An Post's national lottery company will be wound up if it is unsuccessful in bidding for the national lottery licence.  Such a scenario would be shameful.  Those employed in the national lottery have given great service for 20 years and now face grave uncertainty.  This, too, is a major factor which must be taken into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600043#QQ00200","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1360170300,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1360170300,"counter":355,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600043#QQ00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1360170300,"counter":356,"content":"<p>The Select Sub-Committee on Health has concluded its consideration of the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill 2013 and has made no amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600043#QQ00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Lottery Bill 2012: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1360170300,"counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600043#QQ00600"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1360170300,"counter":358,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1360170300,"counter":359,"content":"<p>The Bill provides for the national lottery licence to be sold to secure an upfront payment to help fund other much needed areas in the economy.  The current licence operated by An Post expires at the end of June 2013, with the licence competition expected to open in the spring of this year.<\/p><p> The total revenue generated by the sale of a 20 year licence could be anywhere in the region of &euro;400 million to &euro;600 million.  The awarding of a new licence will generate funds to benefit the community and allow for construction of the new children's hospital to begin.  Without such revenue, it would be difficult to meet the financing requirement for this important and long overdue project with Exchequer funding alone.  The sooner this project gets started, the better for all of the country's children.  Hopefully, it will also create thousands of new construction jobs.<\/p><p> Nearly &euro;4 billion has been raised through the national lottery for good causes since it was founded in 1986, with &euro;1 billion of that generated in the past five years alone.  In 2011, almost &euro;232 million was raised for good causes, with nearly one third of every &euro;1 spent with the national lottery donated to good causes around the country.  This money has been distributed by the Government and many thousands of people and organisations have benefited as a result.  Under the terms of a new operating licence, it is vital that the national lottery continue to thrive and to allocate money to those who need it the most.<\/p><p> Although the percentage of funds to be discharged to good causes is not referred to specifically in the Bill, section 41 requires that money be paid to good causes in the same categories as has been the case to date.  The lottery should continue to support good causes and allocate substantial sums of money in line with current levels.  Some 30.5% goes towards projects in the categories of youth, sport, recreation and amenities, health and welfare, and arts, culture and heritage.  It also goes towards the promotion and survival of the Irish language, a matter that is close to my heart.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, who was present earlier, is working hard to ensure the survival of the Irish language and that this money is used correctly.<\/p><p> The lottery is increasingly popular.  I am sure that all Deputies play, particularly when the prize money is at a high level.  Despite our recent economic difficulties, considerable sums are being allocated to good causes.  In 2011, sales amounted to more than &euro;761.4 million.  While this represents a decrease of 1.4% compared with 2010, it shows that sales remain robust in these difficult times.<\/p><p> The Minister has been working with Davy Corporate Finance to finalise the exact nature of the competitive process for the licence and the sale's associated timelines.  Officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have been holding meetings with domestic and international parties that are interested in bidding for the licence.  One reason for the high level of interest is the lottery's success since its inception.<\/p><p> I understand there are concerns about the sale of the national lottery licence, but it is vital that we generate revenue now.  Now is when the money is most necessary, particularly if it is to be allocated to needy causes, including the construction of the national children's hospital.  The delays in getting the children's hospital project off the ground are regrettable.  Once the money becomes available, it is important that construction work get under way as soon as possible.  When the Minister wraps up, will he provide further detail of the other projects to which money will be allocated?<\/p><p> It is important to remember that the asset of the national lottery itself is not being sold, only the licence to operate that asset.  This should reassure those members of the public who have major concerns about its sale.  With this in mind, I welcome the establishment of an independent regulator to ensure the interests of participants in the national lottery are protected.  The regulator will also have the important task of ensuring allocations to good causes are maintained as far as possible so that they can continue doing their great work.  Calls have been made for greater transparency and accountability regarding which projects receive allocations.  The appointment of a new regulator should help to allay any concern in this respect among members of the public.<\/p><p> It is hoped that the selection of a bidder will be finalised later this year and that the 20 year licence will commence next year.  An Post has operated the licence since the lottery was established and has done an impeccable job.  When the chairman of the National Lottery Company, Mr. Donal Connell, appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, he highlighted An Post's interest in bidding for the new licence, given that company's brilliant track record.  It is important that whoever wins the licence, if it is not An Post, should continue that company's legacy and maintain the success of the national lottery.<\/p><p> The lottery in the UK has been run successfully by Camelot, a private company owned by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for almost two decades, with the licence coming up for tender at regular intervals.  Camelot is licensed to operate the lottery for a third term until 2023 and the company's chief executive, Ms Dianne Thompson, has stated that she manages a high-profile national institution for the public good, with 28% of total sales donated to good causes.  This example proves that a private company can work in the interests of the Irish people while operating the national lottery and continue in the same vein as An Post.<\/p><p> The Artane Boys Band of my constituency is famous for its many appearances at Croke Park, particularly for All-Ireland finals.  As a former member and loyal supporter of the band, I know it has been supported considerably by the national lottery.  Without that help, it would not survive.  I congratulate the national lottery in this regard.  Many Deputies would have similar stories from their constituencies of projects that owe their success to the good causes fund.  Long may this continue.<\/p><p> I welcome the Bill.  I am sure that whoever is selected will be the best operator, will have the best interests of the Irish people at heart and will ensure that funding continues for good projects through the country, as they would not survive without that money.  I assure the public that the new regulator will ensure greater transparency and accountability regarding the funds used in this way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600043#QQ00800","speaker":"1019","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360170900,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I will speak in favour of the legislation and welcome its introduction.  Before I refer to it, though, I will discuss the origins of the national lottery.  Its establishment was not without political opposition in the 1980s.  I acknowledge the role played by a Deputy of many years who was also a Minister of State, Donal Creed.  He brought to the then Cabinet a memo on the establishment of a national lottery.  He was a Minister of State at the Department of Education with special responsibility for sport.<\/p><p>I remember because a photograph of him is still in place where I used to go to school to commemorate the opening of an extension by him at the time.  It was a move that was opposed by many at the time, but as every speaker to the legislation has pointed out, the national lottery itself has been a tremendous success, in particular in terms of the funds raised.  It is not just a question of funds that have been raised and distributed to sporting organisations, which are important and have been most welcome, but also funds distributed to groups such as those to which Deputy Terence Flanagan referred, in addition to health care providers, which have provided much needed facilities in my own part of the world such as respite for families of children with autism, for example.  The latter group is based in Waterford and covers Waterford and south Kilkenny.  The effects of the national lottery have been most positive in that regard.<\/p><p> The purpose of the legislation we are discussing this evening is to allow for a new licence for the lottery to be published, allowing for new terms and for a new competition to take place.  The Government&rsquo;s freedom as to who administers the lottery is affected in the sense that it must be a full public process and cannot be limited to the State or an agency of the State, as was the case heretofore in terms of the operation of the lottery.<\/p><p> Opposition Members have said that is bad.  I disagree.  It is a positive development that an open competition will be held for interested parties to tender for the future provision of the national lottery.  I was also struck by the number of Members of the Opposition who spoke in support of the lottery and its good causes and effects, but decried the fact that it promotes gambling.  They cannot have their cake and eat it.  It is either one thing or the other.  One can look to examples around the world of services provided as a result of moneys gained from national lotteries.  The experience worldwide has mostly been positive.  That is not to underestimate the difficulties posed by gambling and the addiction to it for individuals and families in this country and elsewhere.  By any measure the national lottery has been successful in the objectives set out in its initiation in the National Lottery Act 1986.<\/p><p> The Bill aims to provide a legislative framework for the operation of the lottery, protecting and safeguarding the integrity of the lottery and the establishment of a regulator to ensure that whoever wins the competition adheres to the principles which were enunciated in the original legislation in 1986, that the lottery would be run for the benefit of the people and causes in communities right across the country.  That is something I fully support and welcome.<\/p><p> I also support the point made by Deputy Terence Flanagan about the terms of the new competition.  The current national lottery scheme stemmed from a competition dating to the turn of the millennium.  We have had previous competitions.  In the future the competition will be more broadly based and will give the opportunity to the Exchequer to get an upfront payment of a substantial amount for, as Deputy Terence Flanagan outlined, the provision of the national children&rsquo;s hospital, which could only be considered as positive and has been sought by many Members of this House previously.  I would welcome such use of lottery funding.<\/p><p>I will conclude by outlining the often maligned position politicians have and point out that it was a politician, namely, Mr. Donal Creed, who is still hale and hearty, whose brainchild was the development of the national lottery.  Thanks are due to him that the initiative has proven such a success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600044#RR00200","speaker":"966","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360171500,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the good work the national lottery has done in the past.  A total of &euro;12 billion has been invested in various areas over a 25-year period.  Many areas have benefited, such as Carrigart, Clonmany, Carrickmacross and Castlecoote.  Money was distributed to many areas that otherwise would not have got such benefits.<\/p><p>  According to the Minister, there is a need to tender for the outsourcing of the licence but it is important to ensure that we enshrine in the legislation that good causes will benefit.  Some might argue that the model that was previously in operation was used by politicians to buy votes but the contrary was the case.  It was an exercise in local democracy in action where local politicians were in touch with their constituency base and realised that there were small parishes and areas that would not otherwise have funding to build a new sports centre, an extension onto a sports club or to provide a community centre or service.  Politicians are the ones who ensured that the &euro;12 billion was spread out as evenly as possible in their constituencies and fought tooth and nail to ensure that would happen.<\/p><p>  We should not avoid the rationale behind the positive functioning of the lottery system.  One could ask why such a mechanism was required.  One could point to the centralising of Exchequer funding and the priority given to larger projects for worthy needs such as hospitals, the provision of bigger roads, sewerage schemes and water schemes.  The bulk of funding goes to core areas where population centres are concentrated.  There is a constant fight in rural areas for funding that would not otherwise be available to them.  It is important in the context of a debate on the lottery to examine the reason rural, isolated areas are always fighting for the crumbs of its share of the pie.<\/p><p>  I could always argue the toss in my county which historically and traditionally had less investment than other parts of the country in terms of national distribution.  One only has to look at the motorway systems between Dublin and Galway, Dublin and Limerick, Dublin and Belfast and Dublin and Cork.  Each of those cities also has a rail service.  There is a national psyche in terms of peripheral areas losing out to core areas.  I use the example of my county, but when one brings it to a micro-level, in every county, including populated parts of Deputy Terence Flanagan&rsquo;s constituency, areas are losing out on investment.  Unfortunately, that is the world in which we are living.  We must continue to ask why.  We must examine the current banking system.  I wish to allude to a report compiled by Dr. James Deeny a number of years ago when he worked as a locum doctor in the Fanad Peninsula.<\/p><p> He argued that, in that geographical area, there was upwards of &pound;1 million on deposit at that time in the 1970s.  He asked how that money on deposit was working for the area and he argued that the banking system operating at the time was using that capital as collateral - as liquidity - to attract further investment into the bigger areas.  We should use the opportunity of this debate to discuss the way our government system and banking system are working for the rural areas, as there is a constant drag on capital out of areas, and how we can make our money on deposit in rural areas work for the people and the communities.<\/p><p> I have reservations about the awarding of this licence to an external source but I ask the Minister to examine all the suggestions from both sides of the House in terms of enshrining the good cause element in it.  That is a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600045#SS00200","speaker":"997","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360172100,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to this debate.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, who unfortunately cannot be in the House, is conscious of the high regard in which the national lottery is held by the public.  Many of the issues raised by Deputies reflect their wish to ensure that Ireland will continue to have a national lottery which is based on integrity and propriety and which takes account of its responsibility to operate in accordance with the public interest.<\/p><p><br \/>  Deputy Fleming has urged the Minister to ring fence the proceeds from the award of the next licence to ensure the money is safeguarded for the building of the proposed national children's hospital.  He has also suggested that perhaps the payment for the licence could be received in instalments over a number of years.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, is concerned to ensure that funding for the national children's hospital will be available at the appropriate time.  He would like to reassure the House that it is the intention of the Government to allocate part of the proceeds received from the award of the licence for this purpose when such funding is required.  However, a provision in the Bill such as that would not be appropriate.  The Bill is concerned with the ongoing operation of the national lottery and how it is regulated.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The aim in regard to the award of the next licence is to ensure that the State receives a large upfront payment while also ensuring a satisfactory ongoing stream of revenues for good causes.  The amount raised for good causes currently is referred to as the surplus which is the amount left over after prizes, operating costs, retailer commission and capital investment have been deducted from sales.  Consequently, the good causes contribution both in cash terms and as a percentage of sales varies from year to year.  In 2011, for example, it amounted to &#8364;232 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  Many of the Deputies noted the importance and scale of this funding, highlighting the local community projects that continue to benefit from this revenue stream, such as Deputy O'Mahony's example of the project that assists sufferers of cystic fibrosis in Mayo or the meals on wheels service in Castleblaney, to which Deputy Heather Humphreys referred.  This type of support is needed now more than ever.  The Minister assures the House that a strong and robust revenue stream for good causes will be a major component of the terms of the next licence. The precise arrangement on good cause contributions will, as it is at present, be a matter for the licence and not the legislation.  In the context of ongoing work on the draft licence, and the competition for that licence, the Department and its advisers are looking at configurations that can deliver the best deal for the State.  The Minister can assure the House that central to these considerations are how we can generate a strong annual revenue stream for good causes knowing the numerous community groups and worthwhile projects that are dependent on it.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the course of a Seanad debate on the national lottery in May 2012, the Minister undertook to include a provision in the Bill to safeguard retailers' rates of commission.  However, he has now decided that the guarantee of retailers' commission of 6% on sales of products other than lotto 5-4-3-2-1, which is 5%, will be included in the next licence.  This is consistent with the existing position - the commission payable to retailers is specified in the current licence and not in the 1986 Act.  There is no backing down from his commitment; he is<b><\/b>merely being consistent with current practice by placing it in the licence.  Deputy Fleming rightly pointed out that margins are tightening throughout the retail trade so protecting margins for the period of the licence is very significant, but the Minister is more than happy to do that as the retailer network is at the heart of the national lottery.<\/p><p><br \/>  Deputy Fleming asked what is included under the heading of &quot;interactive channels&quot;.  This heading includes Internet enabled devices such as computers, tablets and mobile telephones which allow access to the Internet.  The Minister wishes to reassure Deputies that the rules governing online games will ensure to the greatest extent possible that persons under 18 years of age will be prevented from playing such games.<\/p><p><br \/>  Many Deputies, while welcoming the Bill, expressed a slight note of caution in respect of the potential for problem gambling.  It is imperative that a national lottery is fully aware of the risk of problem gambling and that its approach to the suite of products which it offers should reflects this.  The Minister will ensure that both the licence under which the next licence holder will operate and the office of the regulator that will enforce the licence will have as a priority an exemplary approach to this issue.  The Minister is particularly heartened to note that the lottery industry globally takes this matter very seriously and a number of proactive procedures are in place to address this problem and are being enhanced by reference to latest research in this area.  A national lottery is in place to benefit the community and not in any way to harm it.  The Minister wants to see people continuing to play the lottery where they can afford to do so.  A large proportion of the population playing a little is the preferred model and one on which the Minister intends to base the licence.  It will be a condition of the licence to comply with strict codes and procedures regarding the area of problem gambling.  The Minister will seek to include in the licence particular practices in place for the online environment.  It is worth noting that online play does allow for a greater level of monitoring and a capacity to intervene to prevent problem patterns of play developing.<\/p><p><br \/>  Some Deputies, including Deputy McLellan, have questioned the need for the establishment of an independent national lottery regulator.  It is a reasonable question and I am happy to set out on behalf of the Minister why in this instance it was deemed the right approach.  For the purposes of the competition for the next lottery licence, it is felt that a better outcome for the State can be arrived at if the office of the regulator is an independent body outside of Government.  Second, it is proposed that this regulatory office will be fully funded by the operator so there will be no cost to the Exchequer.  Third, it is the intention to explore the scope for this regulatory body to be linked with new proposals coming from the Department of Justice and Equality concerning the regulation of gambling.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister wishes to point out that in the context of an operator who is willing to provide an upfront payment to the State in return for a 20 year licence, it is vital that there is an independent regulator who will ensure that the lottery is operated in accordance with the Act and with the licence.  We believe that the regulatory office can be a modest set-up with a relatively small number of people involved so the cost involved, even though funded by the operator, would not be excessive.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister wishes to point out that we are required under European law to hold a competition for the award of the next licence to operate the national lottery.  Even if no provision were being made for an upfront payment, a competition would need to take place for the next licence.<\/p><p><br \/>  Some Deputies made reference to the current licence-holder, An Post National Lottery Company.  The Minister agrees that it has done an excellent job.  However, the option of simply retaining the current licence-holder, as implied by Deputies Boyd-Barrett and Higgins, without a competitive process would be a completely backward step.<\/p><p><br \/>  Some reservations were expressed in the debate about the terms of the competition particularly regarding the involvement of an upfront payment but the majority understand the Government's position.  This House will know there are no easy ways to raise funds to provide the level of public services that are required.  In the current fiscal environment it would be remiss of the Government not to take advantage of the expiry of the current lottery licence in order to yield the best return for the State and its people.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is using the opportunity presented by the competition for a new licence to generate an upfront payment, part of which will be used to finance the new national children's hospital.  In addition, we want a licence arrangement that sees good causes growing strongly knowing the real benefits on the ground that this delivers.  Other ideas or concepts around how we can generate the revenues for the hospital through specific lottery draws or earmarking some of the annual contributions will ultimately reduce funds for the projects and community groups that need them.<\/p><p> It has been acknowledged in this debate that we are being innovative in how we approached this licence and we have to be.  I wish to clarify that what we will be tendering is a licence for a fixed period.  The licence will return to the State in 20 years and it will be the job of the Government of that time to make a decision on how the subsequent licence shall be framed.  I say this because it is different to an asset sale.  The State has sought to protect, in this Bill, the future benefit of the national lottery licence and its long-term value will be linked to how well it is operated over that period.<\/p><p> The Minister is confident that the Bill before the House will enable us to secure the future success of the national lottery, obtain a significant upfront payment for the State and strongly increase revenue for good causes.  The Minister looks forward to discussing the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600046#TT00200","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360172700,"counter":367,"content":"<p>On a point of order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am very sorry to interrupt.

One of the key issues with which we must deal is the need to improve water services throughout the country.  At the moment, water services are the responsibility of 34 different local authorities, including county and city councils.  What we are doing, with the setting up of Irish Water, is placing, over a period of time, all responsibility and accountability for water services under a single body, namely, Uisce Eireann.  <\/p><p>  This Bill is the first legislative milestone in the Government's strategy for the reform of water services provision in Ireland.  As I said, it provides for the establishment of Irish Water, or Uisce &Eacute;ireann, as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is under the Companies Acts.  The programme for Government provides for progressive and considered structural reforms of the water services sector in Ireland.  There are three inter-related components to the Government's proposed reforms and to date, key decisions taken by Government include the establishment of Irish Water as an independent, State-owned company within the Bord Gais group, based on a public utility model; the introduction of a sustainable funding model to support much needed investment in the sector, which will include the introduction of water charges for domestic users; and the establishment of an independent economic regulator for water services, a function being assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation.<\/p><p>  Our water resources are a very significant national asset and there have been significant improvements in the quality and the capacity of our water and waste-water infrastructure over the last decade.  This has been achieved on foot of substantial Exchequer investment through successive water services investment programmes.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in its Assessment of Ireland's Environment, published last year noted that our water quality is good relative to other EU countries.  A decade earlier, the agency's Environment in Focus 2002 report noted that the quality of our rivers at that time was &quot;unacceptably poor&quot; while our ground water had &quot;unacceptably high levels of contamination&quot;.  Maintaining the improvements in quality and standards will be a considerable challenge in the coming years against the backdrop of severe restrictions on the public finances which have seriously impacted on Government's ability to maintain the previous levels of capital investment.<\/p><p>  Our valuable water resources also serve to support the success of many water-dependent sectors of the economy, most notably the pharmaceutical, information and communication technology, ICT, and food and drink sectors.  I cannot stress that point enough.  We are very lucky to be water-rich in comparison to other countries.  However, some parts of our country do not have as much water as they will need into the future.  If one takes the greater Dublin area, for example, it is anticipated that by 2020 supply and demand will equal each other and, therefore, as the economy of the area expands, there will be a water deficit, with the possibility of water shortages.  It is very important that we deal with that issue now.  The proposal that Dublin City Council and Bord na Mona have been working on up to now will mean the creation of a new reservoir in a place called Garryhinch, which will have sufficient back-up water resources to supply the greater Dublin area for a significant period of time.  The reservoir will also serve as a wonderful amenity for the Garryhinch area, which could do with a boost to employment.  I was in a water park in the United Kingdom recently which attracts more than 1 million visitors per year.  It is a fantastic resource in the Anglian water area which provides massive employment, particularly in tourism and recreation.  The new reservoir will address the water needs of the greater Dublin area as well has having a significant impact on tourism in the Laoighis-Offaly constituency.<\/p><p>  The key objective of the Government's water reform programme is to put in place structures and funding arrangements that will ensure we have a world-class water and wastewater infrastructure that meets all environmental and public health standards and is well positioned to attract new foreign direct investment and to support job creation in indigenous companies.  As I understand it, eight European countries are experiencing water shortages at the moment.  When I visited Rutland Park in the United Kingdom in September last year, the water authority in that area was also experiencing a significant water shortage.  Ireland has many positives, if we build to our strengths and improve our infrastructure.  The establishment of Irish Water will also ensure a co-ordinated approach can be taken to matching regional investment priorities with strategic national objectives.  <\/p><p>  The EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland includes commitments to introduce domestic water charges and to establishing a national water utility.  While it is committed to introducing water charges, the Government considers that volumetric-based charging is the fairest approach.  The annual cost of water service provision in Ireland is &euro;1.2 billion.  Ireland is the only country in the OECD which does not charge for domestic water and the OECD, in its review of our environment performance in 2010, argued that the absence of volumetric charging gives domestic users no incentive to save water and perpetuates a low awareness of the real cost of water services.  <\/p><p>Where there is metering of domestic water, there will be savings of the order of at least 10% or 12%.  There are many advocates of water conservation, and none better than the national group water schemes.  One scheme in the Cavan-Monaghan area, involving several farmers so that there was a commercial as well as domestic aspect to water consumption, reduced its overall water demand by more than 80%, which is an unbelievable figure.  Significant conservation takes place when we are charged for water.  That is in the long-term interest of everyone.  <\/p><p> There is considerable public dissatisfaction with the levels of unaccounted for water, including leakage from water distribution mains.  Investment in recent years has been prioritised on mains rehabilitation and leakage reduction.  The metering programme will assist greatly in improving the management of water supply networks and will assist in targeting investment.  Experience internationally and here in Ireland with the non-domestic sector and on private group water schemes indicates that metering will promote water efficiency and conservation by users. <\/p><p> The national figure for water unaccounted for is over 40%, which is unacceptably high.  In Fingal, in the Dublin area, the percentage figure is down to the low 20s, which is excellent compared to some counties.  There is a league table showing some counties with as much as 60% of water unaccounted for.  To say that 60% of water which is treated, stored, pumped and put into a pipe, goes nowhere is unacceptable, given the cost of supply and the issues involved.    <\/p><p> The Government wants to ensure that the interests of consumers will be protected when domestic water charges commence and the Commission for Energy Regulation will have the necessary powers to regulate the water sector and to determine the appropriate level of water charges.  The Bill provides the commission with the power to advise the Government on the development of this policy.  The intention is that the new policy will be given legislative effect later this year when the commission will be given full regulatory powers, including the authority to set water tariffs.  The commission's approach to regulation of water services will be transparent and it will undertake extensive consultations in advance of the water tariffs being set.  The public can be assured that the water charges will be fair and that the Government will ensure that appropriate measures and supports will be in place to assist vulnerable groups when water charges are introduced.<\/p><p> I would also like to address the impact of the reforms on the local authority sector and in particular on local authority employees.  Given the scale and complexity of the change involved in this reform process, engagement with staff and unions is critically important and a specific structure, the Irish Water consultative group, has been put in place to facilitate this.  There will be a fair and objective consultative group, independently chaired by Mr. Kevin Foley, to deal with all of those issues, as and when they arise.  We want a smooth transition from the present disparate 34 sectors to a one-stop shop.<\/p><p> Good progress is being made on clarifying issues for staff.  During the period to the end of 2017, other than situations where existing staff are recruited to new positions in Irish Water, existing staff will remain employees of local authorities working either under service level agreements or on a secondment basis to Irish Water.  Where employees are working under a service level agreement they will carry out their existing role and this arrangement will continue until at least 2017 unless otherwise agreed at the Irish Water consultative group.<\/p><p> Some existing water functions are likely to transfer to Irish Water on establishment or on a phased basis in the period 2014 to 2017.  These largely relate to management roles and roles associated with the delivery of the capital programme.  It is envisaged that the staff currently carrying out these functions would move to Irish Water on secondment in the period to 2017 and would, therefore, remain as employees of the relevant local authority.  During this period, some staff could transfer to Irish Water by agreement.  The framework for such secondments or transfers would be considered at the Irish Water consultative group.<\/p><p> Before I set out the provisions of the Bill I would like to address some of the matters which are not specifically provided for in this Bill but which will, subject to Government approval, be comprehensively addressed in more detailed legislation which is under active development and will be brought forward in a separate Bill in the second half of this year.<\/p><p> As I said earlier, the Commission for Energy Regulation will be given full regulatory powers later this year.  These powers will include the power to examine all costs incurred by Irish Water in the delivery of water services and to determine what levels of tariffs are appropriate for Irish Water to use to charge for the services.  The regulator will also be responsible for setting standards of performance for Irish Water and will ensure that appropriate customer protection measures are in place.  As I said earlier, the regulator will undertake extensive consultations in advance of the setting of water tariffs and these consultations will commence following the enactment of this legislation. Among the range of issues the regulator will be consulting on are the development of a regulatory framework, the design of water tariffs and the development of customer protection measures.<\/p><p> This next Bill will also confer powers on Irish Water for the provision of water services which are currently the responsibility of the county and city councils.  This would include the power to provide water and wastewater services directly, responsibility for strategic planning and delivering investment programmes and powers of examination and survey.  It will also provide for the transfer of local authority water assets and associated liabilities to Irish Water.  The establishment of an asset base will be an important step in ensuring that Irish Water will, in the future, be able to access financial markets to secure funds for capital investment.<\/p><p> The accountability of the company to the Oireachtas will also be addressed in more detail as well as its interaction with the local government and the functions that local government discharges in relation to planning, economic development and emergency management.  This issue, the political accountability of the new company at national and local level, arose during the debates on the Bill in the Seanad.  I can assure the House, as I did the Seanad, that the Government will ensure that the company will be accountable and transparent.<\/p><p> I will now outline the purpose and operation of each section of the Bill.  Sections 1 and 2 set out the Title and commencement provisions and definitions of terms used in the Bill.  Section 3 is a standard provision enabling the expenses incurred by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for the administration of this legislation to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 4 provides that Bord G&aacute;is shall establish a subsidiary company, Irish Water or Uisce &Eacute;ireann, under the Companies Acts, following consultation with the relevant Ministers.<\/p><p> Section 5 outlines that the subsidiary will be known as Uisce &Eacute;ireann in Irish and Irish Water in English.  The shares in the company are to be distributed between Bord G&aacute;is, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance.  Bord G&aacute;is will be allocated the only voting share which it will not be allowed to alter without the consent of the two Ministers.  The two Ministers will share the remaining shares between them.  This share structure will ensure that Irish Water remains in full public State ownership.  I will reiterate that.  The above structure will ensure that Irish Water remains in full public State ownership.  An important point for many people I have spoken to in the political and local government areas and on the streets of our towns and cities is that Irish Water will remain in public ownership and will not be privatised.  That is a critical issue.<\/p><p> Section 6 sets out conditions in relation to the memorandum and articles of association of the company and provides that they must be approved by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, with the consent of the relevant Ministers.  Any amendment to the memorandum or articles of association can only be made with ministerial approval.<\/p><p> Section 7 is a standard provision and sets out the circumstances in which a director of Irish Water will no longer be qualified and must cease to be a director.  Section 8 outlines the standard prohibitions on directors or members of staff of Irish Water holding political office, either at national or European level.<\/p><p> Sections 9 and 10 are also standard provisions setting out the requirements for the disclosure of interests by directors or staff of Irish Water of any material interest, in the case of directors in any arrangement or agreement for consideration of Irish Water, and in the case of staff in their capacity as employees.<\/p><p> Section 11 prohibits the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information by a director, member of staff, consultant or adviser to Irish Water, unless authorised to do so.  This prohibition will not apply to the disclosure of confidential information to Bord G&aacute;is however.  Confidential information for the purposes of this section includes information expressed by Irish Water to be confidential either as regards particular information or a particular class of information or description and proposals of a commercial nature or any tenders submitted to Irish Water<\/p><p> Section 12 provides that Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water may borrow money, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The aggregate borrowings of Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water for the purpose of this legislation must not exceed &euro;500 million.  The section specifies that the borrowing limit is additional to the limits for Bord G&aacute;is set out in section 23 of the Gas Act 1976.  Money borrowed in currencies other than the euro will be deemed equivalent subject to the rate of exchange at the time of the borrowing.  Money borrowed by Bord G&aacute;is under this section may be subsequently lent to Irish Water.<\/p><p> Section 13 provides that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government may, for the purposes of this legislation, make grants out of money provided by the Oireachtas to Irish Water, Bord G&aacute;is or the Commission for Energy Regulation.<\/p><p> Section 14 provides that subsections (1) and (2) of section 21 of the Gas Act shall apply to Bord G&aacute;is, such that the approval of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be required for capital expenditure by Irish Water above a level to be specified.<\/p><p> Section 15 relates to the accounts of Irish Water.  It contains standard provisions on the maintenance by and audit of the accounts of Irish Water and the submission of audited accounts and any other accounts to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The accounts must be then laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The section also sets out the arrangements for the appointment by Irish Water of an auditor to audit the accounts and for the Ministerial approval of the fees of the auditor.<\/p><p> Section 16 provides that by 30 June each year, Irish Water will prepare and submit to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources a report on the performance of its activities in the area of water services in the preceding year.  The report must be then laid before each House of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> Sections 17 to 21 of the Bill deal with the water metering programme and confers powers on Bord G&aacute;is and the new company as metering authorities.  I referred earlier to the Government's position regarding the fairness of volumetric-based charging.  In addition to this, the domestic water metering programme will have significant economic and employment benefits.  The programme, which is the largest and most ambitious programme of its kind of which we are aware, will commence later this year.  It will be preceded by the surveying of domestic water connections at the external boundary of households connected to public water supplies; this work will be undertaken by the local authorities.  This surveying work will commence across all local authorities shortly.  On the meter installation works, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Bord G&aacute;is have already commenced the procurement procedures for the sub-contractors, regional management contractors and equipment for the metering programme which will be rolled out over a three year period.<\/p><p> Section 17 provides that a reference to a metering authority in sections 17 to 21 means Bord G&aacute;is or Irish Water.<\/p><p> Section 18 provides that the functions of a water services authority in relation to the installation of water meters for dwellings may be carried out by a metering authority in addition to a water services authority.  It also provides that other functions of a water services authority may be also carried out by Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water to the extent that their performance is necessary for the installation of water meters for dwellings.  These would include, for example, the power to lay pipes and the power to interrupt water supplies at sections 41 and 51 of the 2007 Act respectively,<\/p><p> Section 19 provides that the provisions in section 41 of the Water Services Act 2007 relating to the installation of pipes shall apply to a metering authority, subject to the removal of a requirement to obtain the consent of a road authority, which applies when the water services authority is not the road authority.  The 34 water services authorities are the 34 city and county councils, which are also the road authorities.  The installation of pipes by Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water will be exempt from planning permission.  This is necessary to avoid causing delays to the metering programme and, having regard to the level of excavation work required to install a meter, is unnecessary.  The Department and Bord G&aacute;is will agree a protocol with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and with the local authorities which will specify the standards for the installation works nationwide.  This protocol will ensure that the highest standards will be applied and will address issues such as traffic management, the quality required for footpath and road reinstatement and health and safety requirements.  Many people have said to me that it is essential that footpaths and roads are reinstated as they were before.  There is far too long a history of some companies going in and digging up footpaths and leaving behind an appalling mess but no one can find out who is responsible and no one is held accountable.<\/p><p> Section 20 specifies that the water meters will remain in the ownership of Irish Water and Irish Water may not dispose of any property vested in it without ministerial consent.<\/p><p> Section 21 provides that the provisions of section 29 of the Water Services Act of 2007 shall apply to Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water in the same way as it applies to a water services authority.  This provides for the immunity of these bodies and their employees from prosecutions arising from carrying out their functions.<\/p><p> Section 22 is a standard provision and provides that Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water will have all of the powers that are necessary or expedient for the performance of its functions.<\/p><p> To create an accurate database of the names and addresses of domestic customers, Irish Water will be given the power to request information from other public and commercial bodies which hold similar information.  Section 23, therefore, provides that Irish Water and Bord G&aacute;is may request a relevant person to provide them with such information that they may require to perform their functions or that they could be expected to require if additional functions, similar to those currently vested in a water services authority, were conferred on them.  A relevant person may be a local authority, the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Property Services Regulatory Authority, the holder for the time being of a licence granted under section 14 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the Local Government Management Agency, the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Social Protection and any other person prescribed by order made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government after consulting with the Data Protection Commissioner.  A relevant person must comply with a request under this section.  This section amends sections 6 and 7 of the Water Services Act 2007 such that Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water have the same powers to obtain information as a water services authority, as well as the same entitlement to obtain information on ownership as a water services authority.  This provision will not exempt Irish Water from the requirements of data protection legislation.  Irish Water will agree a protocol with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to address the exchange and treatment of any personal information.  There have been discussions with that office during the drafting of the legislation and the section includes a provision that before any proposal to extend the list of relevant persons, the Data Protection Commissioner must be consulted.<\/p><p> Section 24 provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation may do all things necessary or expedient for the purpose of preparing for the performance of water regulatory functions under any future enactment.  The functions include functions relating to setting charges for water services, the specification of minimum standards of service for the provision of water services and the protection of the interests of a person in receipt of water services.  This section also states that the commission may advise the Government on the development of policy regarding the regulation of the provision of water services.  Under this section the commission may consult with Bord G&aacute;is, Irish Water, the water services authorities or any person prescribed by order by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Following the enactment of this Bill, the commission will commence its work and will undertake public consultations as soon as possible this year on a range of issues, including the development of tariff structures, and will prepare guidelines on consumer protection measures.<\/p><p> Sections 25 and 26 remove the existing prohibition on charging households for water services as set out in section 105 of the Water Services Act 2007 and in section 4 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act 1983, as amended by section 12 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997.  I want to stress that section 105 of the 2007 Act has not been commenced and it will not be commenced prior to the introduction of charges, which will not be before 1 January 2014.  This amendment is being made only to enable Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water to undertake functions relating to domestic water charges, such as the development of a customer database, the establishment of a billing system and the commencement of consultations with the public and other stakeholders.<\/p><p> Section 25 transfers the functions of a water services authority relating to charging dwellings for water services from the water services authorities to Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water while section 26 provides for the removal of the statutory prohibition by amending the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Acts.<\/p><p>Section 27 provides for the amendment of section 15 of the Gas Act 1976 so that Bord G&aacute;is shall keep accounts of moneys received or expended by it in the performance of its functions in relation to this legislation.<\/p><p> Section 28 provides that Bord G&aacute;is must submit a report on its activities in the area of water services to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The report shall be submitted no later than 30 June each year and arrangements will be made as soon as possible after the receipt of the report for copies of the report to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> Section 29 relates to directions issued by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Directions may be issued, subject to the approval of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, to Bord G&aacute;is or Uisce &Eacute;ireann on the performance of their functions and they must comply with a direction issued to them.  It would not be the intention that ministerial directions would be issued to the companies, or, indeed, that such directions would be necessary.  However, as this Bill is effectively interim legislation pending the more comprehensive Bill later this year, this section is considered prudent to ensure that Government policy is being implemented appropriately by the companies.<\/p><p> As I stated at the beginning, this Bill is the first legislative milestone in the Government's strategy for the reform of water services provision in Ireland.  It is the first step in what is undoubtedly one of the most fundamental reforms of public services provision in Ireland.  I look forward to engaging with you on the provisions of the Bill.<\/p><p> I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600047#UU00900","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360174500,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I will be sharing my time with Deputy Barry Cowen.

The Government has failed to learn from the household charge fiasco and is determined to ignore genuine concerns about its plan for water charges.  These include the lack of detail in how much metering will cost the consumer, uncertainty for current employees, a rushed decision-making process by-passing the Oireachtas, confusion in the Cabinet over the costs involved, and no guarantee on conservation or water infrastructure.  Metering will not be finished until 2016, contrary to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan's original time line of 2014.  The Government is rushing ahead with the creation of Irish Water and rolling out water meters without clearly considering the costs involved to consumers.  Apparently, apartments, in particular, will be excluded from metering but no details about how these will be charged has been yet forthcoming.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government has decided on this issue amidst internal Cabinet confusion over the costs, the lack of details on how much consumers will pay, no public tendering for the new body, the by-passing of the Oireachtas committee and holding a severely limited public consultation.  For the Labour Party, it is yet another direct U-turn on its pre-election promises to the people.  The Cabinet generated immense uncertainty over how much people would have to pay for the cost of water metering with contradictory statements coming out from various Cabinet Ministers.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, has announced that householders will receive their first bills for water by the end of 2014.  The estimated annual costs could reach &#8364;400 per household.  He originally stated that the Government would implement water charging by 2014.  However, reports in September 2012 indicate that metering would not be completed as late as 2016.  Then Irish Water Board chief executive, Mr. John Mullins, stated that it will take two and a half to three years to fully install water meters in all qualifying properties.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan's initial statements were clearly lacking any factual basis, casting his whole policy in doubt.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Cabinet announced the creation of Irish Water which will be an independent State-owned subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is.  It will bill all households for their use of public water supplies.  The services were not put out to tender and the decision-making process to award the contract remains shrouded in mystery.  Irish Water and the regulator, the Commission for Energy Regulation, will determine the cost of the service, the free allowance and the framework for levying the charges.  However, there is no detail on the level of free allowance and the total costs involved to the consumer.<\/p><p><br \/>  Irish Water will operate in conjunction with the current 34 local authorities, which operate the water infrastructure, up until 2017.  However, the nature of the relationship between the bodies has not been clarified to date.  Ultimately, local authorities will be stripped of this function.  Despite the fact that the White Paper on local government reform has not been produced, the Government is whittling away their powers in an <i>ad hoc<\/i> incoherent fashion.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government has lauded the creation of Irish Water and rolling out of metering as a job stimulus package, yet it is pressing ahead with investments in the area without clarify the cost.  It is also putting the cart before the horse as it has not passed the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 which would secure sub-contractors rights to ensure they will fully benefit from the stimulus.<\/p><p><br \/>  I will address a number of metering issues.  Water meters will be established in some 1.05 million households across the State.  These meters will be built outside the curtilage of the property.  Reports indicate that establishing water meters across the country will cost &#8364;300 million, although the cost may reach &#8364;500 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  The 2011 census figures show the potential problems with the Government's plans.  Some 503,140 units or 36% of those households eligible to pay water charges are potentially unsuitable for metering by the Government's own standards as they either are too old or are apartments, creating a two-tier system of charges.

Any pressure on the Government and the agencies to move on this &euro;3 billion is welcome, but I am not optimistic about what kind of deal we will get.  Last month Government Deputies had to grin and bear it as they voted through one of the most regressive budgets in recent years.  More than &euro;3 billion in cuts were voted through.  Child benefit was affected and there was tax on all income through PRSI as well as cuts in allowances for carers and so on.  It was a very regressive budget that can only dampen the domestic economy.<\/p><p>  By the end of the year we will have suffered &euro;31 billion in cuts and tax hikes over the past five years.  We are now being asked to throw away &euro;3 billion more.  There are no grounds for paying the &euro;3 billion promissory note this year.  It cannot be justified especially while working people and children suffer.  While I am not optimistic, I hope at least this debate will shed more light on where we stand with the ECB and the debt on the promissory note in particular.  I hope there is some news on that, but it seems we are not allowed to raise questions about how it is being negotiated and if we do we are labelled as being negative and somehow against it, but nothing could be further from the truth.  The Minister knows that, but is simply using it as a means of deflecting questions from us.<\/p><p>  Last year we had a stunt of pushing the promissory note off until this year.  We had a big announcement, much back slapping and then it turned out that we would pay the full amount anyway.  The public have grown tired of that type of spin and want to see progress.  We have had two years and very little to show for it.  The refusal to engage with the D&aacute;il on this issue shows contempt for those of us on this side of the House.  We continue to pay diligently the costs of this failure of capitalism even if the payments are pushed down the road.  We will pay up for whatever time period without a whimper - that is what we are supposed to do.<\/p><p>  People who believed the Labour Party would challenge Frankfurt have been let down in a very obvious way.  However, there is still time for those on the Government benches to stand up and put the people first.  Our position on this has been very clear.  We have been completely consistent in our policy.  We do not believe Ireland should pay the promissory note.  We have been completely consistent in our policy on this.   It is not the people's debt and should not be turned into a sovereign debt and socialised.  It should not be paid by us.  We as a people have shouldered more than any other people in Europe the cost of the banking collapses.  It is time that some solidarity was shown.  It is time the welfare of our people was put before protecting a flawed system.<\/p><p>  This should not mean cobbling together a deal that would not satisfy anyone.  Simply extending an unfair debt over a longer period does not make the debt any fairer.  This evening's leaked news that IBRC may be liquidated with the assets going to NAMA, the debts sent to a bridging bank or the Central Bank - which will mean Joe and Mary Taxpayer picking it up - and creating a bond to push it down the road by between 25 and 40 years would simply be extending it.  That is like my mortgage being changed from ten years to 30 years - I will still pay.  The other problem is that it is further confirmation that it is still a sovereign debt.  Will we wind up paying more in the longer term when the interest is added to the capital?  Pushing it down the road or sideways means we - or our children - still have to face it.  The big scandal of all of this is that we are lumbering our children with the huge burdens of the excesses and craziness of the previous Government which had no regulation of the banks or financial institutions.  It seemed as if Anglo Irish Bank wrote the financial policy of the previous Government - shame on the then Government for that.<\/p><p>  We need to take a stand on this and ensure we get it right.  Time is running out.  People have an expectation that should be met.  The debts should be reduced.  People have a greater level of knowledge now than ever before of the importance of these promissory notes and what they mean in terms of cuts to public services, lack of money for investment and extra taxes.  There is no mood in the public for a half-baked deal.  Any progress to improve the debt sustainability and more importantly to lift some of the burden of austerity from low and middle-income earners, who have borne the bulk of it, must be genuine and must be real.<\/p><p>  After two years the best proposal put forward by the Government presented by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, was roundly rejected by the ECB.  The Minister has said the negotiations are where he would expect them to be.  This evening they could have moved on and we need to know what that is about.  If all we are going to get is a prolonging of the agony and more interest and it is still ending up on the backs of the public as a sovereign debt, the Government's ambitions are even more minimal than I thought.<\/p><p>  We fully support the motion.  The promissory note and the &euro;30 billion bill that comes with it is the Fianna F&aacute;il legacy to the Irish people and yet it is being kept alive to date by Fine Gael and Labour.  When people voted out Fianna F&aacute;il, the Anglo Irish Bank mess was a big issue that we all heard on the doorsteps.  There was an expectation that there would be change and progress, but to date we have not seen any change.  What we have seen is Frankfurt's way and Fianna F&aacute;il's way, but we have not seen Labour's way yet.  We would welcome anything that genuinely reduces the debt burden and makes it more sustainable and lifts the burden off working people.<\/p><p>  Last week the troika indicated any deal extending the maturities would be considered as a windfall for Ireland and that we would be expected to use this to pay off the wider debts.  In other words any so-called deal does not necessarily mean one cent less in cuts or new taxes.  This is the yardstick by which our party will measure any deal the Government might announce.  We want to be able to count how much is available to invest in new jobs through a stimulus.  We want to be able to judge how many of our sons and daughters we will be able to welcome back from Australia and Canada to work here.  Those are the calculations.  Simply playing a game with this debt and moving it around and pushing it off into some other institution or turning it into a bond and crystallising it as a sovereign debt even further will not satisfy people.  We, and our children, will still have to face it down the line in ten, 20 or 30 years' time.<\/p><p>  I appeal to the Government to deal with this in an honest way and take this burden, which is not ours, off us.  We are really concerned about it.  We, on this side of the House, are accused of everything, but we really are concerned about this.  Like Deputies on the Government benches we are meeting ordinary people who are absolutely tormented with their debts and tormented with financial hardship for the past four or five years because of the mess created by previous governments.  We need to change this.  We need to put down a marker on this and we need real and sustainable changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600051#YY01600","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1360175100,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Mathews, who is sharing time with Deputies Twomey, Kevin Humphreys, Donohoe, O'Donnell, Mitchell O'Connor, English, Spring, O'Reilly and Fitzpatrick.

It was a picture of Professor Patrick Honohan, President Barroso and Joaquin Almunia, the wise men who said that the Irish people needed to make up their minds quickly and called on the Irish Government to move fast to have the NAMA legislation enacted.  That was done around 7 November.<\/p><p><br \/>  The next landmark day was in March 2010, following the first PCAR, when we were told Allied Irish Banks needed &#8364;7.9 billion and Bank of Ireland needed &#8364;3.5 billion.  It was admitted on 30 September 2010 that losses in Anglo Irish Bank amounted to &#8364;22 billion and that the total loss of the banking system was &#8364;50 billion.  The 30th of September is significant because it was on that day the surreptitious payment of &#8364;7.9 billion by the then Anglo Irish Bank was made to senior unsecured bondholders, the guarantee on those bonds ran out and my telephone calls in this regard to the Central Bank, Financial Regulator and Anglo Irish Bank went unanswered.<\/p><p><br \/>  The European Central Bank can move fast when the interests of the euro system and others is at stake but moves slowly when it comes to addressing the promissory note, which was a wrong move for the Irish people.  The promissory note was created for the first time ever in the euro-system to validate and regulate the advances of a greater amount of exceptional liquidity assistance.  The rumours tonight are that the ELA will move back to the Central Bank of Ireland and that a long term bond will be created.  However, there will be no debt write-down.  The ELA created in IBRC was to allow for the redemption in full, without any losses, of senior unsecured bondholders.  The system was maintained by the establishment right up to 29 November 2010 when the troika came to Ireland concerned only with the &#8364;135 billion to &#8364;140 billion of exposure of the ECB to the Irish banks.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is wrong that there will be no write-down of the ELA, which is secured by the promissory note.  It is absurd that I do not have the time to explain this properly, as I have done on several other occasions.  People have chosen not to inform themselves on this issue.  It is wrong that the ECB can move as fast or as slowly as it likes to protect the system.  The people of Ireland have been at the receiving end of this.  I heard it mentioned last night that although we have no moral obligation to pay this debate, we have a legal obligation to do so.  We do not have a legal obligation to pay it and I will explain why.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600052#ZZ00100","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1360175700,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1360175700,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Guarantees require <i>uberrima fides,<\/i> which is a policy of insurance and indemnity.

As we await confirmation of the facts in this regard, I take this opportunity speak about an element of our national debt which I believe has not been part of the public debate but should be considered in any deal with the ECB and EU, resulting in fair treatment for Ireland.<\/p><p>  In 2010-11, the European Central Bank purchased almost &euro;20 billion of Irish sovereign bonds on the secondary market through the security market programme.  At that time, these bonds were trading at well below par.  When Ireland redeems and pays out on these bonds the ECB will make a substantial profit.  This profit will be shared proportionally among the eurozone nations and Central Banks, according to the ECB capital base, GDP and population.  We should seek the return of this profit, which I estimate will be between &euro;3 billion and &euro;5 billion.  If the profits amount to &euro;3 billion, Germany will get the greatest share of 19% or &euro;600 million, France will get 14% or &euro;420 million and Ireland will get just over 1% or &euro;30 million.  Greece has been given a deal worth more than &euro;7 billion.  We should seek a similar deal.  There is no reason we should not be treated the same as Greece on this aspect of its debt deal.  This is not about asking for a write-down or interest holiday, it is about being given some of the profits on Irish debts, of which each European country will receive a share unless we are treated the same as Greece.<\/p><p>  On the motion before the House, it is important to note that the proposers completely ignore the consequences with Ireland will be faced should it go down the path advocated by them.  Interest rates could be increased and the European Central Bank could refuse to lend to Irish banks or to accept Irish assets by altering the risk control framework.  This Government does not have the luxury afforded to the Technical Group of grandstanding on issues like this.  If Ireland were to default they would be complaining about the consequences of doing so.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600052#ZZ03000","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1360175700,"counter":439,"content":"<p>The timing of the Opposition on this matter could not have been worse.

I wish this commitment had not been given, but the risk of us unilaterally breaking it is too high when we need to borrow so much to fund what we cherish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600053#AAA03200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1360176300,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Listening to many Opposition Deputies speaking on the promissory note, calling on the Government to throw its toys out of the pram, throw its weight around, make noise and be a general nuisance reminds me of immaturity and having no common sense, life experience or understanding of how to negotiate.

I wish that none of the debt had anything to do with us.  Intelligent Members of the Opposition, which most of them are, will recognise that when the previous Government gave the guarantee, it made it our sovereign debt.  As much as we may dislike it, it became Irish debt.  I hate it as much as those who voted for me and whom I represent in here, but I also deal in practicalities.  The problem is that at the moment it is this country's debt, so what will we do about it?  We could renege and not pay it, but that would not do good for our reputation abroad.  The Government has tried to repair that reputation over the past two years and it is slowly getting there.  The proof is that we can see investment coming into the country.  We are winning jobs and money back into the country.  I accept it is happening at a slow pace and we would all like it to be quicker but it is getting there.  It is going in the right direction compared with what it was.  That is happening because people like to invest in a stable, sound country.<\/p><p>  We are now regarded as stable and sound.  If we really want to make the country unstable again we will see what happens to investments.  As historical research proves, if one reneges on debt, there is no doubt that it will take about four years before one can win back investment and people's confidence.  The public cannot wait another four years to win back investment and jobs.  We need them now.<\/p><p>  The Government is trying to make debt more sustainable in the short term.  Hopefully tonight we might hear more news about the negotiations over the next couple of weeks.  The aim of these talks is to make the promissory note more sustainable.  We would love to wish it away but that will not happen overnight.  We first have to make it sustainable, thus managing the interest a little bit better and easing the cashflow.  That is the start.  In the years ahead we will continue negotiations about what happens to the &euro;30 billion plus that is still there.  We will work on that but it could take at least two or three years to get the initial deal on this.  Hopefully we will hear something in this regard.  We must get the interest rate down and extend the repayments as long as possible.  Inflation and growth will deal with a lot of that but we can continue dealing afterwards.  Firstly, however, we must make the debt sustainable so that we can manage it.  We cannot afford to continue paying out &euro;3 billion plus every March plus &euro;1.8 billion in interest.  That is what the Government is trying to avoid and I believe it will be successful.<\/p><p>  One must accept that these deals are never done in a week, a month or a year.  It takes time.

While Deputy English is correct in saying that there is public concern and anger, this motion is a cynical exploitation of that and it is misleading people.<\/p><p>  The governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, has confirmed to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that the negotiations are ongoing to achieve a solution to this problem at a very high level.  That has also been confirmed by senior Cabinet Ministers.  Professor Honohan told the committee that by reneging on the debt, as some people opposite would suggest, we would put welfare payments to vulnerable people at risk.  In addition, we would be putting people's savings at risk.<\/p><p>  International confidence in this country has been restored, which was an important backdrop to the negotiations.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance have done a huge job internationally.  Good work has been done at all levels, including diplomatically.  The recent support for Ireland's case by President Van Rompuy of the European Council is a testament to that.  Many other significant people in Europe have also supported our case.  We have already achieved &euro;10 billion in savings on interest as well as restoring confidence and attracting inward investment.

That means the State did not pay the &euro;3.1 billion in cash in March 2012.  The bond was a complicated arrangement financed with the Bank of Ireland.  While this arrangement reduced the level of the emergency liquidity assistance provided by the Central Bank to the IBRC, the Government will still have to repay the bond.  This Government is confident of a deal before 31 March 2013 and is engaged in continuing talks with all relevant parties in Europe.<\/p><p>  The Government is examining all options, including the source of funding, the duration of the notes and the interest rate applicable.

I thank and commend Deputy Ross and my independent colleagues on introducing such an important motion at a critical time for the Irish people.  All Members must accept this promissory note issue is of great importance for the Irish people and the country's future.  I must also note I am getting sick and tired of listening to Government backbenchers regularly putting it up to the Opposition to come up with ideas and solutions.  Opposition Members have been doing so for the past year and a half but the Government party Members have not been listening.  First, a decent deal on this particular debt to the European Union is required.  At present, it is choking Ireland's potential for economic growth and is not sustainable.  Next, the domestic economy must be kick-started by supporting actively the small business sector and creating employment.  This can be done by reducing VAT, developing a seed capital scheme to be made available to certain individuals who are starting up new businesses, implementing a three-year tax relief for start-up companies and halving the rate of PRSI on jobs that pay up to &euro;356 per week.  In addition, those who have savings, particularly those who are over 65, should be encouraged to spend an additional &euro;20 per week in their local small businesses and shops.  These constitute some sensible proposals to try to get us out of this mess and Government Deputies should not say Members on the Opposition benches lack ideas.<\/p><p>  Over the past hour or two, rumours have been flying around this House about a potential deal.  There are rumours that the IBRC will be liquidated and, in respect of the promissory notes of &euro;3.1 billion, a number of 25 year bonds and some 40 year bonds with the average length being 27 years.  In addition, the payments might be stretched over a longer time.  My question to the Government is whether the stock of debt will be reduced.  This is a key point, as last June's summit decision will not be implemented unless this happens.  Moreover, will the next budget be less severe on the people the Government already has shafted?<\/p><p>  Failure will force Ireland into a second bailout.  The worsening position in Italy and Spain over recent weeks has actually strengthened Ireland's negotiating position.  We are now in a much stronger position than we ourselves think.  Last night, a well-known German economist spoke on RTE and got a great reception by putting forward the policies of the Independent Deputies.  Moreover, it was widely accepted to be a balanced view.  I also consider it to be a bit rich of Deputies Spring and Twomey to have a go at the Independent Members in this Chamber.  The Independent Members are putting forward sensible policies.  They are putting forward the views of the people, are making the point that the promissory note issue is outlandish and are telling people to consider reasonable solutions.<\/p><p>  I note that in the last budget, children, families, the disabled, senior citizens, PAYE workers and small businesses were hammered.  I urge Members to consider seriously this motion.  It will strengthen the Government's hand - it already has done so - and I commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600055#CCC00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1360177500,"counter":494,"content":"<p>During Leaders' Questions on Tuesday last, I suggested to the Taoiseach that the Government was engaged in an elaborate charade designed to draw the media and the public into a heightened sense of anticipation and anxiety on whether the Government was going to get a deal on the promissory note.  The carry-on that has been going on in this House tonight makes this absolutely clear.  Questions on whether the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, will come into the Chamber to make a statement or whether there will be a big announcement or a deal are almost up there with the T&aacute;naiste in Chile talking about governments collapsing.  They make clear this is precisely what is going on, namely, an elaborate charade or the politics of illusion.  It is an attempt to sell a puff of smoke as some sort of great victory which the Government will announce and will claim to be a great stride forward for the country.  However, as the Government has stated very clearly for the past year and a half when pressed on the issue, the deal it seeks involves paying every cent of the gambling debts of Anglo Irish Bank.  This is the reality and this is the deal the Government intends to announce.  One should be clear about what that means.  However it might be structured, each cent and euro that we pay back on the gambling debts of Anglo Irish Bank is a cent or euro that is not going into public services, infrastructure or job creation.  The Government simply cannot wriggle its way out of that fact.<\/p><p>  My point is we should not do that.  We should not pay back gambling debts that are not ours, our children's or our grandchildren's, as they will be if the Government does the deal it proposes  Instead, this money should go into jobs and public services and into alleviating the misery that is being inflicted on ordinary citizens in this country.  The Government claims that were we to do this, there would be catastrophe because of the reaction of the markets.  Even Patrick Honohan, when speaking at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last week, admitted the claim that money would not come out of the ATMs was nonsense.  He made that point, not the members.  This is a scare tactic on the part of the Government.  The reality is that if we did not pay the &euro;9.1 billion in interest next year - not just the &euro;3.1 billion for the promissory note - we would be left with a manageable deficit of &euro;6 billion.  We could manage that by imposing taxes on wealth, on the corporations and on higher income earners and by using that money to generate growth and employment, which is the only way we can recover.  One cannot recover by saddling this country with billions of euro in debts for 40 years.  It is not a victory; it is a puff of smoke and I hope the public see through it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600055#CCC00400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1360177500,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate this evening on the Private Members' motion tabled by the Technical Group on the promissory notes.  It is interesting that Members are debating this issue tonight while rumours are flying everywhere on Twitter, on news headlines and so on about the deal that supposedly is being done in respect of the promissory notes.  Members are being told by the media that the Minister will make a statement in the D&aacute;il and is scheduled to come in at 9 p.m.  While this has been seen on Twitter and everywhere else, the Members of the D&aacute;il know nothing about it.  They are in this Chamber debating in a vacuum because they do not know the detail of what is being discussed.  They do not know the detail of the basis for any deal on which the Government might be negotiating because the Executive does not believe in briefing the D&aacute;il on the work it does.  Consequently, Members cannot know what a likely deal might look like, except by looking at Twitter and the rumours that are flying around.<\/p><p>  However, Members do know the Taoiseach is adamant that Ireland has not and will not ask for a write-down of any debt.  They learned over the weekend that the European Central Bank had rejected the proposal from Governor Honohan because it would be in breach of Article 123 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  It is very interesting to hear the bank make this point because it proves the treaties and rules of the European Union are, once again, a moveable feast.  When it suits those concerned, they can use those rules to reject a deal but if they wish to do a deal, they will bend the rules to make sure a deal happens.  By any estimation, the granting in the first instance of emergency liquidity assistance was a breach of the treaties, as was the purchasing of distressed Government bonds, as the ECB has done in recent years to the tune of more than &euro;240 billion.  Similarly, the provision of loans to European banks in order that they could purchase Government bonds also is in breach of Article 123 of the aforementioned treaty.  However, last weekend the ECB chose to ignore these issues and to claim it could not do a deal on the promissory note for Ireland because it was a breach of the treaties.  I very much doubt whether the Government negotiators have pointed this out to the ECB.  When Europe wants to do something, the treaties are not a barrier to making it happen and this is something we all should have learned by now.  The Government should have learned this and should put it up to them in the negotiations on the promissory note.<\/p><p>  Media reports indicate the board of the IBRC already has been stood down and the receivers are in place but the nature of the deal still is not known.  The rumours suggest the deal will be on long-term bonds, on which we probably will pay more over the years and will make our grandchildren liable for the debt with a balloon payment at the end.<\/p><p>There is no legal basis for the debt and we are not legally obliged to pay it but we will be making it into senior Government debt, bringing all the legality that this entails.  If legislation comes forward over the next couple of days, the Labour Party will vote on the replacement of the promissory note; the party may not have voted for the bank guarantee but it will vote to ensure that our grandchildren will carry the debts of this illegal promissory note.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600055#CCC00500","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360178100,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600056#DDD00200","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1360178100,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600056#DDD00300","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1360178100,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I thank the Technical Group for allowing me to use some of its time.

The public does not want trust to be placed in such a narrow confine but they wanted this D&aacute;il to be different.  We are not seeing any difference and there is absolute outrage at the idea that this promissory note, which was expected to be a temporary measure, will be turned into a bond and formalised.  People are not only offended that they will have to pay it but they are doubly offended that their children and grandchildren will have to pay it.<\/p><p>  One can consider the negotiating strategy of other countries which worked because, in many cases, they forced institutions to take notice and pay attention.  They have nothing like what we have in the most costly banking crisis since the Great Depression.  Taking into account the full cost of the banking crisis, the figure is &euro;42 billion to date spent just on our banks.  Working done by the Nevin Economic Research Institute and Michael Taft indicates that the average amount falling on the citizens in Europe will be &euro;191, with the average burden placed on the citizens placed on the citizens of this country at almost &euro;9,000.  It is unsustainable.<\/p><p>  This is not our debt and we should not be paying it.  I can live with it if it is called default but let us not treat the people of this country as imbeciles.

I now know exactly how she felt.  Sadly, however, this story will not end as well as the story of Jack and the beanstalk because when we plant our beans, they will not produce a beanstalk with riches at the top.  Instead, the Government will guarantee emigration for my children and my neighbour's children, just as members of my family and my neighbour's family had to emigrate in the past.<\/p><p>  The Government has told Opposition Deputies we would make poor negotiators.  How can it claim the deal emerging in media reports this evening amounts to good negotiation?  Deputies should imagine being woken by a knock on the door tomorrow morning to be told their house had been remortgaged without their permission and they would have to repay the sum involved.  Imagine if the messenger then said he would return later, possibly with better news, leaving them to wait and wonder what would happen.  Eventually the messenger returns with the better news that, having mortgaged the house behind their backs, he has now secured a better deal on the mortgage that was never sought in the first place but that it will cost more in the long run.<\/p><p>  I and many others agree with the comments by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, that the debt arising from the promissory notes is unsustainable.  If that is the case, how will the proposed deal make the debt sustainable?  In recent weeks, I asked the Library and Research Service to produce figures based on a scenario in which we secured a deal such as that which has been mooted.  It modelled the figures and worked out that a deal spread over the term that has been indicated and repaid at the current rate of interest of 3.78% would save approximately &euro;870 million in the first year, &euro;760 million in the second year and &euro;660 million in the third year.  If the debt is unsustainable, how would this level of savings make it sustainable?  It does not do so.  The Government told us the debt would be unsustainable if we did not secure the right deal.  The proposal we have heard about is not the right deal.<\/p><p>  I will not use the word &quot;default&quot; in connection with the promissory notes because one cannot default on a loan one did not take out in the first place.  We must repudiate this debt because it is not ours.  We are told, however, that to do so would mean teachers, doctors and so forth would not be paid.  The figures show clearly that if we refused to pay the promissory notes, we would be left with a primary deficit of &euro;3.6 billion this year from a total spend of &euro;57.3 billion.  I am sure we could find a way to make a saving of &euro;3.6 billion.  We could, for example, refuse to pay the Roscommon county manager the same salary as President Barack Obama receives, or stop paying hospital consultants the same salary as Brian O'Driscoll.  Perhaps we could be given control over local authorities to allow me to fillet my local authority and save the country a fortune.  There are ways of achieving this saving and while they would mean the big guys would no longer be paid their current salaries, we would be able to balance the books.<\/p><p>  We are told such moves would be illegal.  Since I was elected to the D&aacute;il, Deputy Peter Mathews has proved he knows more than the vast majority of Deputies, with the possible exceptions of Deputies Stephen Donnelly and Shane Ross.  When he states it would not be illegal to take such measures, I believe him because he tells the truth.  If we defaulted on or repudiated this debt, we would be better off in the long run.<\/p><p>  Whom has the Government asked to do the job on its behalf?  From what I heard earlier, it will ask KMPG to do it.  This brilliant company has a brilliant past as it was the auditor of a bank that cost the country &euro;6 billion.  Well done, lads.  Maybe they should bring back Jack and the beanstalk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600057#EEE00100","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1360178700,"counter":515,"content":"<p>On the night of the bank crisis in 2008, one of the greatest scandals and con jobs ever, even in international terms, was perpetrated on the Irish nation.  The previous Administration was sold a pig in a poke, to put it in mild terms, and fed false information regarding the solvency of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  This was done in the hours leading up to midnight and it was revealed at five minutes past midnight that this information was a complete fabrication.  As a result, a crippling burden has been imposed on this generation and future generations.<\/p><p>  D-day or 31 March is fast approaching.  As recently as 19 December 2012, the International Monetary Fund warned that Ireland's economy could stagnate, leaving the country in a distressed state for years.  It insisted that the European Union help reduce the burden of the bank debt and urged agreement to restructure the &euro;31 billion Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes well before March when the &euro;3.1 billion repayment falls due.  The IMF sent a strong signal to the European Central Bank that it must act decisively on this issue and stressed that Ireland also needs a deal on the additional &euro;31 billion it pumped into the zombie pillar banks before the bailout.  One option suggested by the fund was the implementation of the European Stability Mechanism.  <\/p><p>  The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, made some strong statements recently in which she accepted that the IMF's economic model was wrong.  The implication of her admission is that the fiscal compact to which we signed up will eventually destroy Europe's economy.  The IMF realises that the Merkel-Sarkozy axis focused on achieving debt reduction through austerity and increased competitiveness and considered these measures the most effective means of controlling the crisis.  This view was strongly supported by Ireland.  In October 2012, however, the IMF concluded that the economics underpinning its assumptions may have been wrong and conceded not only that austerity does not work but that it is counterproductive. <\/p><p>  I and many others believe we should, at a minimum, obtain an agreement extending the timeframe for repaying the promissory notes to at least 30 years and reducing the annual repayment to a nominal amount.  Such an agreement would not be new in Europe, as Germany only recently finalised its reparations to the Allies agreed after the First World War.  This bond, which extended for more than 90 years, established an international precedent.  If we were to adopt a similar mechanism for repaying the promissory notes, it would have the least possible impact on Irish citizens and enable us to regain our sovereignty and return to the international financial markets.<\/p><p>  The &euro;30.6 billion promissory note will, with interest, eventually cost &euro;47.4 billion.  We need to secure a notional interest rate of 0.2% at most.

We are agreed that every effort must be made to reduce the cost to the Exchequer of the promissory notes.  We are also agreed, to various degrees, that the State should continue its interaction with our European partners as to how this can be achieved.<\/p><p>  As many Deputies will have noted from this evening's media commentary, the ECB is considering a proposal from the Government as part of our ongoing discussions in seeking to reach an agreed position on resolving the promissory note issue satisfactorily.  The leaking of some elements of the ongoing discussion is unfortunate.  The Minister for Finance has taken action to secure the stability of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, in the face of these leaks.  He has appointed persons to assume the powers of the board for the interim.<\/p><p>  The ongoing discussions with the ECB illustrate that the Government has taken the initiative in dealing with our problems, has taken difficult decisions and will take other decisions that are necessary to get the country back on track as quickly as possible.  We must ensure, and our European partners must have regard to the need to ensure, that Ireland's capacity to repay its debts is maintained and enhanced.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Finance accepts that the necessary adjustments in State expenditure have impacted and will impact on people's level of services and living standards.  He also accepts that the impact of the adjustments must be fair and proportionate.  He accepts that it is galling to have needed to pump State resources into supporting the financial sector.  We must return to the financial markets for funding.  We are continuing to work to re\u00adestablish our financial credibility.<\/p><p>  We need to return to growth and prosperity for the good of our people.  The Government is committed to delivering a return to a successful and vibrant economy.  We are targeting to exit the programme of assistance from the troika by the end of this year.<\/p><p>  Turning to the motion before the House, it is clear that all parties to the current arrangements have something to gain from the current discussions and from an agreed approach to the resolution of the issue.  It is in this context that the Government has been working extremely hard to secure a deal.  I reiterate that we are optimistic that an arrangement, agreeable to all parties, can be found in the format of the current discussions.  The key objective of any new arrangement will be to make the banking-related debt more sustainable.  This is central to the Irish position in all negotiations with our European partners.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that any potential agreed arrangement on the promissory notes reached will benefit this country, improve our debt sustainability position and represent a major step in facilitating an early and sustained return to the financial markets.<\/p><p>  In the current environment, it is not realistic to consider default as an option or to assume that the Central Bank or the ECB would continue to fund the bank in the circumstances described above.  The essence of the Government's amendment to the motion before the House is that an approach centred on agreement is a more effective approach to the gunboat diplomacy proposed in the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600058#FFF00400","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1360179300,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Proposed by Labour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600058#FFF00500","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1360179300,"counter":521,"content":"<p>The Government's engagement with our European partners and its approach to the discussions has always been constructive and consensual.

Under the motion, we in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann call on the Executive to ensure that any restructuring of the promissory note is done on the basis of a fair sharing of the burden.  If it is not possible for Ireland to share the burden of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, then and only then should we assert that we will not continue with the payments.  This is the motion that we have proposed to our colleagues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>  Why are we making this call?  In total, the Government has pledged &euro;35 billion to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, &euro;31 billion of which is in the form of the promissory note, the topic for this evening.  It was pledged to ensure that those banks could pay everyone they owed when they collapsed.  Who did we guarantee?  In September 2008, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide had combined total liabilities of &euro;110 billion.  That is what we guaranteed.  Three quarters of this amount was in deposits and the remainder, &euro;28 billion, was in bonds.<\/p><p>  Had the market and the rule of law been allowed to take effect, the bank would have been closed down and the creditors would have been paid out of the remaining diminished assets.  It is certain that the holders of the bonds worth &euro;28 billion would have taken heavy losses.  It is entirely possible that some of the depositors would have taken losses, too.<\/p><p>At that point, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the Irish people could have decided what level of guarantee we would provide to those depositors.  I expect we would have focused on Irish depositors.  However, that is not what happened.  The Irish people are on the hook for &euro;35 billion to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  The Irish people bailed out everybody.  One could ask why the Government did that.  It was not to protect depositors.  That could have been done for a fraction of the price.  It was not to protect the other Irish banks; there was no risk of contagion because they were all guaranteed anyway.  It certainly was not because Anglo Irish Bank or Irish Nationwide were of any relevance to the economy other than that they were trying to destroy it.  Why did the Government do it?  It did it because of a diktat from Europe that said no European bank could fail, no eurozone bank could fail and no senior bondholders could incur any debt.  That is why the Irish people handed &euro;35 billion to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide - to protect the European and eurozone banking system.<\/p><p> In issuing the promissory notes, the Government loaded every citizen with more debt than any other European citizen has had to take on - in fact, several times more debt.  The motion says that we require a negotiated agreement that results in fair burden sharing.  That seems pretty reasonable.  At the time the State and the people took the hit for Europe.  We stabilised the eurozone system.  It was of no benefit to us to do so as our banks were already guaranteed.  We took the hit for Europe and now we are saying that because of that, we need a negotiated agreement that spreads the burden in a fair and reasonable manner.  That is the motion before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann this evening.<\/p><p> The Government&rsquo;s motion also seems reasonable.  It says we are in the middle of negotiations and we are going to do our best so leave us alone.  That is good, except for one point: the Government&rsquo;s stated position is that it has not sought, is not seeking and will not seek a write-down of the total quantum of debt.  It will seek to extend the terms and reduce the borrowing costs through interest rates but as a point of principle it will not seek a write-down.  On his way out of the Chamber last night, Deputy McNamara said a guarantee is a guarantee.  The Taoiseach has said we will not have &quot;Defaulter&quot; written across our foreheads.  The Government will not even seek a write-down.  It is not that it cannot get it.  It has stated that it will not seek one.<\/p><p> We do not know what deal will be announced in the House at 10.30 p.m. this evening.  We do know that one option the Government was pursuing was a 40-year bond.  I understand that it could alleviate short-term financing pressures and stop us potentially putting &euro;3.1 billion into two dead banks this year which could be used for investment or closing the deficit.  I accept that, but there would be no burden-sharing.  The people who benefited from that act of lunacy - namely, the rest of Europe - would not be sharing the burden.  In fact, the total payments to this country would increase.  We would be getting a 40-year interest-only mortgage.  That is not an acceptable solution for the Irish people.  It is not European solidarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600058#FFF07100","speaker":"1107","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360179900,"counter":588,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600059#GGG00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1360179900,"counter":589,"content":"<p>If the Government accepts such a deal, it is putting its hands up and surrendering.

When the figures are adjusted to account for our small size, they show that we have paid 18 times more than German citizens.

As many Deputies will have noted from this evening&rsquo;s media commentary, the ECB is considering a proposal from the Government as part of these ongoing discussions.  In the discussions with the ECB it was envisaged that the first step would be the liquidation of IBRC and the sale of its remaining assets to NAMA or other market purchasers.<\/p><p>  As soon as the information relating to the proposal to liquidate IBRC was made public earlier today, there was an immediate risk to the bank.  Given this position I, as Minister for Finance, took immediate action to secure the stability of the bank and its assets, valued at almost &euro;14 billion, on behalf of the State.  To this end, I vested the powers of the board temporarily in an employee of KPMG and a KPMG team is now in control of the bank on my behalf.  The Government met earlier this evening and approved this proposed legislation for presentation to the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  Once the legislation is passed, joint special liquidators will be appointed to IBRC with immediate effect to wind up its business and operations.  It is intended that the net debt owed by IBRC to the Central Bank and its associated floating charge security will be purchased by NAMA, using NAMA bonds, in a way that ensures there is no capital loss for the Central Bank.<\/p><p> The ministerial guarantee underpinning the net debt owed to the Central Bank will also be transferred to NAMA.  Eligible depositors, bondholders and counterparties will be repaid under the deposit guarantee scheme and the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  There is also a derivatives guarantee in place.  As is common in liquidations, all employment contracts in IBRC are immediately terminated, but the special liquidators have indicated that the majority of staff are likely to be re-hired to assist in the liquidation on such terms and for such duration as the special liquidators may designate.<\/p><p> As indicated, the IBRC debt to the Central Bank, which is intended to be purchased by NAMA, is secured by a floating charge over the assets of IBRC and a ministerial guarantee.  Following an independent valuation process, the special liquidators will sell the assets of IBRC, which are subject to the floating charge, to third parties at or above their independent valuation and failing that, the special liquidators will sell the assets to NAMA at their valuation price.  The proceeds of these sales will be used to repay creditors in accordance with normal Companies Acts priorities so that preferred creditors, including employees, would be paid first and then the IBRC debt to NAMA would be paid under the floating charge.  To the extent that there are proceeds available after repayment in full of the NAMA debt, these proceeds will be applied to remaining unsecured creditors who have not been paid under the guarantee schemes which, for clarity, do not include the deposit guarantee scheme.  These remaining unsecured creditors will include the Minister to the extent that he has paid out under guarantee schemes.  Similarly, if the proceeds are not sufficient to pay IBRC&rsquo;s debt to NAMA, the shortfall to NAMA will be met by the existing ministerial guarantee.  The remaining subsidiaries will be wound up or sold by the special liquidators to optimise value and once all of its obligations are resolved, IBRC will cease to exist.<\/p><p> I will now go through the sections of the proposed Bill.  Section 3 sets out the purposes of the Act.  Section 4 provides that the Minister will make a special liquidation order in respect of IBRC.  Section 5 provides, among other things, for the publication of the special liquidation order.  Section 6 provides, among other matters, for an immediate stay on all proceedings against IBRC; that no further actions or proceedings can be issued against IBRC without the consent of the High Court; that no action or proceedings for the winding up of IBRC, or the appointment of a liquidator or an examiner can be taken, issued, continued or commenced; for the removal of any liquidator or examiner appointed prior to the order; and that the order constitutes notice of termination of employment for each employee with immediate effect.<\/p><p> Section 7 provides for the appointment of the special liquidators.  Section 8 limits the power to grant injunctive relief in certain proceedings.  Section 9 provides that the Minister will issue instructions and may issue directions to the special liquidators, and requires the special liquidators to comply with such instructions and directions.  Sections 10 and 11 deal with the application of certain sections of the Companies Acts and Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 in the context of the winding up.  Section 12 provides for the sale or transfer of assets and liabilities in IBRC.  Section 13 provides that the Minister may give directions in writing to NAMA in relation to the acquisition by NAMA of the debt of IBRC to the Central Bank; and in relation to the purchase of assets of IBRC from the special liquidators.  Section 14 provides that the Minister shall direct the special liquidators in respect of the independent valuation of the assets of IBRC prior to sale.  Section 17 provides that the Minister may issue securities. <\/p><p> The decision to liquidate IBRC is unique to IBRC and does not affect other banks.  In the case of IBRC, the vast majority of IBRC&rsquo;s deposit accounts moved to AIB and Permanent TSB last year, and they are unaffected by today&rsquo;s announcement.  Deposit accounts that were retained in IBRC are generally associated with a wider ongoing relationship with the bank.  It is important to state that all eligible deposits up to &euro;100,000 for an individual and &euro;200,000 for two individuals holding a joint account in IBRC are protected by the deposit guarantee scheme in operation in the State.  Eligible deposits beyond this limit are guaranteed under the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.<\/p><p>It is critically important that deposit account holders, mortgage account holders and those indebted to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, understand that their situation following the liquidation should generally remain unchanged.  If deposit account holders have any concerns, they should make contact with the operators of the relevant schemes.  Contact numbers are available on the Department of Finance website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600068#RRR00600","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360184700,"counter":805,"content":"<p>Who will answer the telephones?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600070#TTT00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1360184700,"counter":806,"content":"<p>I wish to emphasise that the reason these steps are being taken is entirely distinct from the performance or direction of the board or management of the IBRC.

I wish to acknowledge, with much appreciation, the significant efforts the directors and staff of the IBRC have made to the stabilisation of and maintenance of value in the IBRC.  I regret the abruptness of how this decision is communicated to the management and staff but due to the scale, sensitivity and complexity of the economic issues involved, it was necessary in the public interest to keep the matter confidential until now.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, as is common in liquidations, all employee contracts will be terminated on the winding-up of the IBRC.  However, it has been indicated to me that the majority of staff will, if they wish, be re-hired for the purposes of an orderly liquidation on such terms and for such duration as may be determined by the special liquidators.  Employees will rank, in the normal way, as preferential creditors ahead of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and unsecured creditors in respect of certain amounts owing on a winding-up, including accrued wages, salaries, holiday pay, sick pay, statutory redundancy, pensions contributions and claims for damages arising from accidents.  I understand this announcement will come as quite a shock to employees of IBRC and to some of those who do business with the bank and the special liquidators will be instructed to handle that as well as possible in the circumstances.<\/p><p>  I would have preferred to be introducing this Bill in tandem with a finalised agreement with the European Central Bank.

At the outset, I wish to register a protest and to state Fianna F&aacute;il's objection in the strongest possible terms to the manner in which this matter has been handled.  Leaks came out during the day that moves were afoot at the European Central Bank, ECB, with regard to the overall deal on the promissory note and parts of those leaks referred to the winding-up of the IBRC.  It is clear from the Minister's statement that the Government has had this issue on the agenda for some time as part of its negotiations with the ECB.  That matter presumably was not meant to come into the public domain today and the Minister has now told Members that unless they adopt this Bill immediately, it poses an immediate risk to the bank.  The Minister has informed Members of the need to take immediate action to secure the stability of the bank and the value of its assets, which are valued at &euro;12 billion, on behalf of the State.  I would have liked the Minister to have gone into much greater detail as to what are those risks because I am sure everyone in this House will agree this is no way to conduct our business.  It is clear the Minister plans to appoint a special liquidator early tomorrow morning in an effort to fireproof the bank from claims by others who may wish to prevent the appointment of a liquidator to protect their own commercial vested interests.  I assume this is the essence of the argument with which the Minister has come forward tonight.  However, I would have expected the Minister to have justified this in far more detail in respect of what precisely are the risks because it is now in the public realm - and has been for most of the day - that the Government intends to liquidate the IBRC.  I have not received an adequate explanation from the Minister as to the reason this cannot be done in the normal course of business in this House.  Clearly, the Minister's attention was to announce the winding-up of the IBRC as part of the overall package the Government hoped to agree with the ECB but for one reason or another, he has been forced to bring forward all of that.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, leaks have been a common feature of developments in recent weeks.<\/p><p>We may never know who leaked this information today.  Whoever leaked it first was quickly pursued and succeeded by many others who gave far greater details of what may emerge tomorrow in respect of the overall deal.  I sincerely hope nothing that has been said in recent days or weeks by senior Government people, nothing that has been leaked, has in any way jeopardised the best interests of this State.  When I speak on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, that is my sole motivation in responding to this legislation.<\/p><p> This legislation has to be seen in context, namely, a proposal the Minister has put through Governor Honohan to the governing council of the ECB and which, it is hoped, will be adopted tomorrow.  We do not know what is in that proposal, with the exception of leaks that have been reported in the media, and we cannot be sure of their veracity.<\/p><p> We should be honest with people and acknowledge that this is not a liquidation of IBRC in the true sense of the word because many people all over the country would rejoice in the notion of IBRC being obliterated and taken off the banking landscape with immediate effect.  Of course, that is not the true effect of what the Minister is proposing.  This is a technical liquidation of IBRC which will involve, for example, all the assets of IBRC being transferred to NAMA, and they will be worked out in the fullness of time in the normal course of business.  A normal liquidation, as the Minister well knows - we have seen far too many of them in the last number of years - involves a liquidator being appointed, all the assets being realised immediately involving the fire sale all assets and whatever is left the creditors get in order of the hierarchy set out in the companies Acts.  That is not what is being proposed.  IBRC will live on in a different form by virtue of the assets being transferred to NAMA.<\/p><p> I want the Minister to give a number of reassurances to the House.  He has not given them adequately on Second Stage.  This Bill presents fundamental questions that need to be answered adequately before the House decides on the legislation.  It is potentially a legal minefield.  IBRC is involved in a plethora of cases, as the Minister knows, involving, for example, bondholders whom the bank has sought to burn, and there is a case outside this jurisdiction in respect of that matter.  Many other individuals, companies and groups have a gripe with IBRC.  We all know that the best legal brains in this country and further afield are going to be pouring over every single word, dot and comma in this legislation to see if it can in any way confer an advantage on their clients.  I assume that, as with any other legislation, this Bill has been constitutionally proofed.  There are provisions in it about which I have serious concerns, including in the Title to a Bill which refers to permanent or temporary interference with rights including property rights of persons.<\/p><p> The Minister is asking us to take a leap of faith that all of these issues have been adequately examined, analysed and that sufficient safeguards have been put in place to protect the national interest, which is our concern in debating this Bill.<\/p><p> Given the Government has signalled that it intends to wind up IBRC, the Minister is presenting us with an argument that not doing so immediately would expose the bank to very serious risk.  That may or may not be the case.  I want the Minister to go into further detail in relation to that.  I also want the Minister to explain what the benefits are of winding up IBRC immediately, lodging the promissory note presumably with the Central Bank and transferring the assets to NAMA.  It is only a few months since the Minister gave a reply in this House stating that in his view &quot;NAMA and IBRC are not in direct competition.  Due to funding and operation considerations, it is not considered appropriate to merge the two agencies at this time.&quot;  That was last September.  Six months on, clearly circumstances have changed.<\/p><p>The Minister must explain precisely what are the implications of the change in Government policy whereby it is proposed to immediately liquidate IBRC and transfer its assets to another State agency, the National Asset Management Agency.  He must spell out the implications for taxpayers, ignoring the overall deal about which, as I stated, we are completely in the dark.  <\/p><p> The remaining creditors of IBRC, the bondholders, are now small in number and the value of their bonds has greatly diminished because they have been substantially repaid.  Will the Minister spell out what are the implications for the remaining unguaranteed bondholders in IBRC?  Does the Bill involve burden sharing with the remaining creditors?  This is an important question to which people deserve to have an answer.  <\/p><p> The current chief executive officer of IBRC, Mike Aynsley, and its chairperson, Alan Dukes, have appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Service on a number of occasions.  They estimate that the likely cost of winding up IBRC would be in the region of &euro;25 billion.  Will the Minister explain what are the consequences of what he is proposing in respect of the final bill to the taxpayer of bailing out IBRC in the context of this legislation?  The House deserves to have important and essential information on that matter. <\/p><p> There is precious little sympathy for staff who work in banks, which is very unfair because the majority of them had nothing to do with the crisis that emerged in the banking system as a result of the reckless management of the banks by a relatively small number of people at senior levels across the banking sector.  I am concerned about the provisions of the Bill in respect of the staff of IBRC because the legal effect of the appointment of a special liquidator is that their employment will be terminated immediately as a direct consequence.  The Minister addressed this issue when he indicated that the majority of staff will be rehired, presumably by the National Asset Management Agency, for the purposes of the orderly liquidation on such terms as the special liquidator designates.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600070#TTT00400","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360185600,"counter":810,"content":"<p>That will be done by the liquidator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600072#VVV00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1360185600,"counter":811,"content":"<p>The Minister should provide clarity on this issue as he has not provided any guarantee.  People working in IBRC know their employment with the bank is not permanent.  Although the bank was in wind-down mode in any case, its staff certainly did not expect to learn tonight that their employment will be formally terminated as of the passage of this legislation.  They deserve a better explanation and more reassurance than the Minister has given in respect of that issue.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has gone through the Bill in as much detail as possible in the short time available to us.  We received a call after 10 p.m. inviting us to attend a technical briefing on the legislation.  The context of the Bill was not explained in respect of the promissory note negotiations which are under way and the Minister expects to conclude tomorrow.  Having discussed the Bill in as much detail as possible in the time available to us, I am prepared, on behalf of my party, to take in good faith the Minister's reassurance that not passing it tonight would expose IBRC and, by extension, the State to substantial risk.  While I am prepared to accept that in good faith and do not have an objection in principle to IBRC being wound up with immediate effect, I want the Minister to reassure me, my colleagues and every Member of the House that the national interest has been fully protected in respect of the decisions we are making tonight.  I am not giving the Minister <i>carte blanche<\/i> in respect of any deal he may or may not announce in the House tomorrow.  While I sincerely hope he announces a deal on the promissory note, my party's support for any such deal cannot be taken for granted.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Last June, the Eurogroup reached an agreement that there should be a complete separation of banking debt from the sovereign.  Implementing that agreement should be the objective of the State in all our negotiations with the European Central Bank and of all those who have an interest in this matter. <\/p><p>How would it be fair if the total stock of bank-related debt owed by this country was not reduced by 1 cent whereas countries that experienced banking difficulties in future may have all of their capital losses fully replenished by the European Stability Mechanism, ESM?  This is what the Eurogroup has decided.  Once the new banking union is established, the ESM will have the power to recapitalise banks directly.  Why is Ireland not being treated in the same manner?  We were the first country to experience this crisis.  As the Taoiseach acknowledged, European policy was imposed on this country.<\/p><p> Based on today's leaks, I hope that we will have a long debate on whatever deal may emerge.  We want a number of questions answered, for example, whether the total stock of debt changes in any way.<\/p><p> Apparently, the Minister is proposing to convert the promissory note into a permanent form of debt, the strongest possible form, namely, a Government bond, which can never again be restructured.  This is Ireland's opportunity to get the best deal that we possibly can, a deal that will result in future budgets being made easier.  This is the prize at stake.  Many times in the House, I have wished the Minister well in the negotiations.  My party meant that sincerely.<\/p><p> I am deeply disappointed by the manner in which this legislation has been introduced tonight.  We have no objection to winding up the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, in principle.  We want the Minister to reassure us on the issues that I have raised.  They are reasonable questions and we deserve and require those reassurances on behalf of the people whom we represent.<\/p><p> Tomorrow is another day.  Tomorrow is the day when I hope that the Minister will enter the House with a deal on promissory notes.  More than anything, I hope that it will be the right deal.  I hope that it is a deal that will set us on a new course.  I hope that it is a deal that will help to take the burden of bailing out the banks from the shoulders of the Irish people.  I hope that it is a deal that people will feel in their pockets.  I hope that it is a deal from which the domestic economy will benefit.  I hope that it is a deal that will result in this Government being able to inject far more money into job creation initiatives to erode the unacceptably high level of unemployment being experienced in this country.<\/p><p> I wish that we had more time for this debate.  We will engage throughout the time that is left.  I look forward to doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600072#VVV00300","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360185900,"counter":813,"content":"<p>At about this time last year, we were all asked to come to the Chamber for an important announcement.  We were told that the State had cobbled together an agreement that meant that we would not pay the promissory note last year.  We were asked to applaud the Government and to take it at face value that a great deal had been achieved on behalf of the Irish taxpayer.<\/p><p>  However, as the mist faded and the cobwebs were dusted away and after delving into what occurred at the time, what became clear was that the State repaid the emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, to Anglo Irish Bank or the IBRC.  The Central Bank got its money and the European Central Bank, ECB, was satisfied that a certain amount of ELA had been taken out of the system.  The difference was that it was done through a convoluted approach.  In simple terms, the Minister asked Bank of Ireland for a loan of &euro;3.1 billion, paid Anglo Irish Bank that money and Anglo Irish Bank then paid it to the Central Bank, which disappeared the money.<\/p><p>  At this late hour, we are again being asked to take at face value the Government's claim that a deal is in the interests of the State and are being told that not having the time to deal with and read through the legislation does not matter.  The briefing that finance spokespersons and other Deputies received was not concluded because we were called back to the Chamber.  Certain questions could not be answered at the meeting.  We were asked not to ask certain other questions.  It is a matter of taking the Government at face value.<\/p><p>  Through all of the leaks and spin of recent weeks, particularly in the last number of days and hours, something has become clear - this Government intends to pay every single last cent of the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note, totalling somewhere in the region of &euro;28 billion.<\/p><p>This year is part one of a plan and a couple of other parts are to follow later if the Minister gets the call from Frankfurt to say that it is happy with the proposal.  The spin that will be put on what the Minister has laid before the House is that we are winding up the toxic bank that was Anglo Irish Bank.  Nobody in this Chamber would be happier than me and my party colleagues to see Anglo Irish Bank disappear.  The Minister is winding up the bank but he is not winding up the debt.  That is where he critically fails in his endeavours in terms of the legislation.<\/p><p> This so-called debate is an affront to democracy and to people the length and breadth of the State who have suffered austerity under the Government and the previous Government of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  It is not appropriate that we would be asked to deal with such important legislation that deals with a bank that has assets and liabilities in excess of &euro;40 billion; that gives the Minister wide-ranging powers to direct the liquidators to liquidate the bank in a certain way and that gives him powers to direct NAMA to purchase the assets of IBRC.<\/p><p> In his speech the Minister outlined that the ministerial guarantee to which he referred is not the same as the promissory note.  I ask him to elaborate on the point.  I understand the ministerial guarantee refers to the comfort letters, if one could call them that &ndash; the comfort e-mails - that were sent to the Central Bank at the time the exceptional liquidity assistance, ELA, was issued.  The Minister has said that if the assets which NAMA will be directed to purchase from IBRC do not realise the values then he will also convert the comfort letters into reality.  In other words, the Minister will pay out the shortfall.  Not only are we on the hook for the promissory note, but those dodgy e-mails that were issued between the Central Bank and the late Minister for Finance will now take full force if the State does not realise its assets and a liability arises.<\/p><p> The situation of the workers has been raised previously.  I have been one of the loudest in challenging the fact that IBRC continues to employ staff such as the chief risk officer at a salary of &euro;500,000.  I hope nobody in the House, at least on this side, would shed tears to see certain people being able to take less money in IBRC.  Approximately 850 employees in the State work for IBRC and approximately 150 others work in various jurisdictions.  The vast majority of them are not on anywhere near the salaries of the chief risk officer, yet 850 Irish employees were informed today through Bloomberg in 2013 - when we celebrate the centenary of the great Lock-out - that their jobs were gone.  How could we stand over that?<\/p><p> I do not know how many times we have asked for information on what is happening with the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note.  We were told that it was kept confidential because that is the way negotiations have to be kept.  The Minister did not even inform his Cabinet colleagues as to what was going on with the deal.  It was kept so tight that I am not sure the Economic Management Council - the four wise men - were even aware of the details, but lo and behold, it all blew up in the Minister&rsquo;s face.  A leak from the European Central Bank appeared on Bloomberg and at 12 midnight we were rushed into the House to pass legislation supposedly to protect the interests of the State.  The Minister has done such a great job of keeping it so tight that we have been forced to introduce emergency legislation at midnight.<\/p><p> Openness and transparency would dictate that we should all be more informed; not only Deputies who have a mandate to be present and to represent the public, but people at home, whom the Minister is asking to carry the burden of the promissory note.  The information the Minister imparted to us in his opening remarks is absolutely disgraceful.  He has given no idea why the Bill is required at this point, why we need to introduce such legislation in the early hours of the morning, why he wants to ensure that none of us can properly parse the legislation before we are asked to sign it into law or why there is no opportunity for us to table amendments to the legislation.<\/p><p>We need to learn the lessons of the past.  This is the type of politics that Fianna F&aacute;il practised for far too long.  It is the type of politics that led us to constructing the Fianna F&aacute;il promissory note.  It was the late night meetings, and the approach was to forget about the legislation, take me at face value, I am doing this to protect the interests of the State and if we do not pull on the green jersey we are the bad boys here-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600073#WWW00200","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360186500,"counter":816,"content":"<p>That is a phrase the Deputy used the night he voted for the guarantee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600075#YYY00200","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1360186500,"counter":817,"content":"<p>-----because we are working against the interests of the State.

It is symbolic, however, of the anarchy by which the financial markets operate and symbolic of the dictatorship of those financial markets, in front of which Governments all over Europe, most notably the Irish Government, prostrate themselves to do their bidding while bleeding working class people to bail out their system.  My first thoughts are with the 800 workers, most of whom are ordinary working people, in this bank who are to be summarily and brutally sacked from their jobs tomorrow morning if the legislation goes through, and who are dependent on NAMA as to whether they will be rehired.  The transfer of undertakings does not apply so they can find themselves severely disadvantaged.  They are being treated as pawns in this fiasco of high finance.<\/p><p>  This does not in any way cancel the disastrous private debts undertaken by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, following their predecessors in Fianna F&aacute;il, and placed on the shoulders of the Irish people as a result of the disaster that was Anglo Irish Bank and its speculation.

The European financial market system is a broken system, utterly dysfunctional and parasitic on society.  Governments, including this Government, at the behest of these markets, are breaking society through savage austerity and crushing with economic misery tens of millions of people.  This Bill is part of the whole rotten infrastructure and architecture of that market system and it should be roundly rejected.  It is past time the working people of Europe, the poor and the pensioners, rose up to bring down this system to have a financial system that is democratically owned and controlled in the interests of the majority instead of holding literally trillions of uninvested profits for big business while 25 million Europeans languish in unemployment.

In particular, we committed to replacing short-term emergency Central Bank lending secured against the promissory notes used by the previous Government to bail out the worst Irish banks with longer-term, more affordable financing that reduces the burden on Irish taxpayers and reinforces growing confidence among potential investors in Ireland's economic recovery.<\/p><p>  The promissory notes represent, in this Government's view, a highly onerous and unfair legacy of the banking crisis.  Under this promissory note arrangement put in place by the previous Government, Irish taxpayers are due to pay &euro;3.1 billion next March and every March until 2023, and declining payments until 2031, to cover the massive private losses of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.<\/p><p>Including interest costs, the lifetime cost of the promissory note would have been almost &euro;48 billion.  It is an enormous burden for taxpayers to bear just as we attempt to restore our public finances and investor confidence.  As I have said many times previously, the Government is committed to replacing the promissory notes with a new cheaper, longer-term instrument that will ease the burden on the Irish taxpayer just as we are attempting to restore growth jobs and market financing to our economy.<\/p><p> A key element of the restructuring of the promissory notes is the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, the wind-down vehicle for the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  As the Minister for Finance has confirmed, this Bill to liquidate the IBRC was approved by Government meeting earlier this evening as a first step in a final comprehensive restructuring of the heavy obligations placed upon the taxpayer from the bailout of these financial institutions.  The liquidation is necessary to secure the billions of euro worth of IBRC assets that are ultimately owned by the taxpayer as part of that restructuring process.<\/p><p> The disappearance of the former Anglo Irish Bank and former Irish Nationwide Building Society from our financial, political and social landscape is long overdue.  Both institutions became synonymous at home and abroad with the reckless mismanagement of our banking system and wider economy under the watch of previous Government.  They became emblems of a culture of cronyism that undermined the confidence in both our economy and our political system.  They became a stain on our international reputation and dent to our national pride.<\/p><p> Investigations by Mr. Peter Nyberg into the causes of our banking crisis revealed that both institutions has abandoned traditional checks and balances and risk management procedures in the pursuit of ever-bigger short-term profits.  Both institutions are also key to understanding the wider crisis because they were both seen as highly profitable institutions to which other Irish banks should aspire.  As other banks tried to match the profitability of Anglo Irish Bank in particular, their behaviour gradually became similar.  Accordingly, when the crisis broke, large losses were realised not only in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, but also in other banks.<\/p><p> Both Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society also became synonymous with the disastrous response to the banking crisis by the previous Government and European authorities that brought our entire State close to bankruptcy.  Instead of a fair sharing of the losses with the banks' creditors, the decision was taken to force the massive losses onto the shoulders of Irish taxpayers.  This policy of socialising the costs of private failure was instigated by the previous Government and then, in effect, became a condition of the 2010 bailout programme required by Brussels and Frankfurt, where there was fear that a bank failure in Ireland would unleash panic in the financial markets across the eurozone.  In any event, bond market financing for eurozone banks largely shut down anyway as the vicious circle between weak banks and weak sovereigns became entrenched.  The belated recognition by European institutions that this policy was an expensive failure came too late for this country and for our people.<\/p><p> The bailout of private bank creditors cost Irish taxpayers, in total, an astonishing &euro;64 billion, which is more than 40% of GDP or &euro;35,000 for every household in the country - over ten times the cost of bank rescues in any other eurozone country.  At &euro;35 billion, the cost to date of the bailout of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society remains, even to this day, shocking.  This is the equivalent of almost &euro;20,000 for every household in the country.<\/p><p>It is a burden that has weighed heavily on struggling families across the country.  While not all of our public finance problems relate to the banking crisis, there is no doubt the hardship suffered by the Irish people has been worsened by the cost of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Were it not for the bail-out of banks, Irish public debt levels would be now below those of Germany.  This debt weighs heavily on the country as it seeks to re-enter the markets at sustainable interest rates.  <\/p><p> Last June, the European Council resolved to break the vicious circle between the sovereign and banking debt crises in the eurozone and specifically committed to examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme.  Eurozone leaders, including Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande, have publicly recognised the unique circumstances behind Ireland's sovereign debt crisis.  For the credibility of the entire eurozone, we now need to see concrete steps to give effect to that commitment.  The ECB is the first of the European institutions to have an opportunity to show its commitment to getting Ireland back to full financial market access this year.<\/p><p> Restructuring these promissory notes will lead to a significant reduction in Ireland's market funding requirements until its financial stability is fully restored, boosting investor confidence and economic recovery.  It will also reinforce public and market confidence in the Government's commitment to the path of fiscal consolidation and structural reform.  While few in this country will grieve the loss of these financial institutions, many will feel for the hundreds of ordinary staff, and their families, affected by this decision, about which the Minister for Finance has already spoken.  I expect that many of these staff will be re-employed as part of the managed liquidation of the bank over the coming months.  Others may be employed by the National Asset Management Agency as part of the redistribution of some of the assets of the IBRC.<\/p><p>Today's agreement is a significant milestone.  It closes a sad and tragic chapter in our economic and political history.  We are now a poorer but, perhaps, wiser people from the lessons we have learned.  Let there be no doubt, this is not a silver bullet to end all our economic problems.  The damage done by these financial institutions will take many years to rectify.  After the catastrophic economic management of the past decade, so epitomised by Anglo Irish Bank, there is a long and hard road to travel in our country's journey back to prosperity and full employment.  Today's decision to liquidate the IBRC is another step in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600079#CCCC00800","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360188900,"counter":895,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to speak in support of the Bill before the House tonight.<\/p><p>  This Bill, when enacted, will finally bring an end to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.

I accept the point made by Deputy Donnelly that each of us, as an individual, has that responsibility.  Even when the circumstances are so exceptional as they are this evening and while the Government has the majority to push through the legislation, there remains a duty on every Member to consider the issue and to push aside political considerations.  One could easily go against this legislation from the Opposition perspective in the knowledge that the Government clearly has the numbers to pass the measure.  However, in my view that would not be the honourable approach to take.<\/p><p>  One must examine the legislation, the rationale and the Minister's statement on the risks to which the State is exposed and then act accordingly.  Some Members of the Government, albeit not all, are clearly in the middle of executing a public relations strategy to try to regain lost support.  However, that is no basis for anyone to decide on how to vote on this legislation.  Equally, the Opposition has a responsibility to accept there are situations in which emergency legislation is required and grandstanding on both sides helps no one.  As I stated earlier today, everyone supports a deal to lighten the impact of banking debt on Ireland.  Deputy Michael McGrath has outlined the details and issues that should be addressed in respect of a comprehensive deal on Ireland's bank debt, particularly the fundamental issue of the separation of sovereign debt from banking debt but other issues as well.  Members have been told this is part of a solution but have been provided no detail in this regard.  They learned last year in particular that any claim by the Government to have secured dramatic progress must be examined in detail before it can be believed.<\/p><p>  According to reports, the Governor of the Central Bank is continuing his negotiations with colleagues on the ECB Council.  Members may know more at 1 p.m. tomorrow afternoon.  His technical and negotiating skills are considerable and he has worked tirelessly even in the face of the headwinds caused by Ministers' grandstanding in the media.  I continue to wish Governor Honohan well in his work on Ireland's behalf.  The Government has placed enormous faith in Governor Honohan and I remind the Taoiseach it was Governor Honohan who stated, not just in the context of the Nyberg report but in another report, that without a bank guarantee, the impact would have been catastrophic.

The leak of information which caused this emergency session should be investigated.  It means we are proceeding with one part of a deal before the whole deal is agreed.  It is hoped that this will not cause further problems on top of the reported annoyance at political posturing by Ministers.  In the limited time we have had available to be briefed or to seek advice, it appears that this legislation is a legitimate part in a process of lessening the impact of banking debt on the public finances.  However, there are number of important questions we would like the Government to answer.<\/p><p><br \/>  We have been told that this is not last-minute legislation and it has been worked on for some time.  Therefore, the Government should be in a position to answer questions in some detail and extend the Minister's reply beyond the ridiculous five minutes allocated.  We have indicated that Fianna F&aacute;il's intention is to support this legislation and we accept the Minister's statement this evening, given the risk to the &#8364;14 billion in assets.  As Deputy Michael McGrath noted, in principle and apart from an prospective deal, we have no objection to the winding up of the IBRC and its absorption into NAMA.  Nevertheless, I welcome the conversion to NAMA by the Taoiseach and others as I remind them that when the body was established, he used some very colourful language to describe it.  He indicated it was a &#8364;90 billion &quot;double or quits&quot; gamble with taxpayers' money.  The Fine Gael Party leader at the time confirmed that his party would vote against NAMA, which he called &quot;a sweetheart deal&quot; for the banks.  Admittedly, the Taoiseach has come a long way since making those statements as Leader of the Opposition but his comments may be somewhat similar to what he would now accuse members of other elements of the Opposition now.<\/p><p><br \/>  The IBRC was always intended to be a temporary entity and its creation prevented the need to immediately resolve all issues with Anglo Irish Bank.  Crucially, it prevented an immediate and unknown crisis of much greater magnitude.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, described the bank as &quot;systemic&quot;.  It has the form of a bank but in substance it has gone about the business of trying to recoup as much money as possible.  Its liquidation in this manner should not have a significant impact but it will facilitate technical changes to the Central Bank's balance sheet required to refinance the promissory notes.<\/p><p><br \/>  The IBRC currently has well over 850 employees focused on recouping debts.  They are managing court cases against a wide range of people, including those who are brazenly trying to avoid full responsibility for their own debts.  We would like the Government to explain what will happen to IBRC's employees.  The Minister indicated that <i>de facto <\/i> they will lose their jobs tomorrow morning, and this was repeated by the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste.  I respectfully suggest to the Taoiseach and Ministers that much more needs to be done to support the workers concerned with regard to employment contracts and issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600085#JJJJ02200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1360190400,"counter":959,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p><p>It is noticeable from all the commentary tonight that no guarantees are being given to the workers in terms of their position and there is no engagement with them.

In the contributions from the Government side, we heard a great deal of flowery rhetoric about this Bill being historic and all the rest of it but for the 850 workers concerned, it has serious and profound consequences.  Their rights and entitlements need to be spelled out.  As we speak, negotiations are taking place on the Croke Park agreement.  The employees of IBRC have rights and entitlements and have been effectively working for the State in recent years.

Let us remind ourselves that the Government's proposal is a U-turn on the claims following the European Council meeting in June that there would be a deal on legacy debt by October.  That month has come and gone, as has 2012, yet there is still no deal on legacy debt.  Neither is there a separation, an idea to which the Government was converted after rubbishing Sinn F&eacute;in's championing of the need to separate banking debt from sovereign debt.  On the contrary and even on a cursory reading, the Bill will turn bad banking debt into sovereign debt.  The Bill reads: \"And whereas the winding up of the IBRC is necessary to resolve the debt of the IBRC to the Central Bank of Ireland\".  No one should be surprised.  This Government promised that it would not give another red cent to bad banks.<\/p><p>Then, in one of its first acts as a Government, it paid &euro;3.1 billion to Anglo Irish Bank.  Despite our best wishes and us willing the Government to do well, this is no game-changer or seismic shift.  The critical issue was never whether there would be a deal; it was what type of deal would be done.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long advocated a deal that would remove the toxic banking debt from the shoulders of Irish citizens.  That is not what is being proposed.  This is not a write-down.  The Government never asked for a write-down.  It never negotiated for one and it did not seek one.  The overall stock of the debt remains the same.  With interest, it might be larger.  The Government might be winding up Anglo Irish Bank as an institution but not its debt.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not accept that restructuring or paying the debt over a longer timeframe is a credible deal for the taxpayer.  The fact is, as the Minister said in opposition, the promissory note should not be paid.  It should not be paid for the simple reason we cannot afford to pay it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600087#LLLL02400","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360192200,"counter":999,"content":"<p>We are not paying it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600088#MMMM00200","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1360192200,"counter":1000,"content":"<p>It is not our debt.

Did they ever hear of a liquidation that was announced on one day and not implemented for several days or weeks?  Are all liquidations not announced when the liquidator has moved in?  Is it not simple to understand why that is?  If that is not done, creditors will line up to strip the company of everything they can lay hands on and debtors will refuse to pay a penny because they know the company is going into liquidation.<\/p><p>  The assets of IBRC, which are the assets of the people of Ireland, are worth between &euro;12 billion and &euro;14 billion.

Of course, we were not in a position to deny it because, as many Deputies have said, it is obvious that the legislation was not drafted this afternoon but has been prepared for some time.  We had to move.<\/p><p>  Under the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act, at 4 o'clock this afternoon we put in a representative of KPMG to take over all the powers of the board of the IBRC and secure the assets, which are in Dublin, London and New York.

This would be a serious issue if it was not part of our law already.  Under section 17, powers are transferred from the Minister for Finance of the day to the NTMA but that has always been the position and the NTMA under its basic legislation is empowered to issue securities.  Specifically, I refer Deputies to the Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009, section 34: &quot;For purposes of this Act and to enable the Minister to provide funds for Anglo Irish Bank's continued operation, the Minister may whenever and so often as he thinks fit create and issue securities.&quot;  It is already part of Irish law, both under the base legislation of the NTMA and specifically in the Anglo Irish Bank legislation.  There is nothing in section 17 that is not already in our law.  It will not be exercised by the Minister for Finance - this Minister for Finance would not know how to issue a security.  The NTMA does this in consultation with the Minister for Finance or on the instruction of the Minister.  The NTMA during the year got us back into the markets and is issuing Government paper.  We do not have a debate every time the NTMA issues Government paper.  It must have the flexibility to time markets on that basis.<\/p><p><br \/>  People asked why we had to act and I think we have dealt with that.  No one would stand over a situation where it was clear statements were being made in Reuters and Bloomberg and we were not in a position to contradict them.  No one would let that situation develop so the assets of the bank would be impaired in the way I describe.  If that happened, the Opposition would be rightfully very critical of any Government that would allow that.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is power under the Bill for the Minister to issue directions to the liquidator.  If this legislation is passed tonight and signed by the President, the same person from KPMG who has already secured the property this afternoon will be the special liquidator.

As well as that, in running down certain portfolios, NAMA will be recruiting from the staff who have been dealing with the deleveraging of portfolios in the bank.  I cannot offer any more comfort than that.  I would expect the majority of staff to be re-employed for significant periods and that will give them an opportunity to decide their futures.  These are very skilled people and the financial services industry is one of the industries in the State that has been going well, with strong inward investment.

That is what is happening with the Bill.  The substantial deal is being done now in order to promise the European Central Bank that we will repay every cent.

That is not the primary issue, which is the promissory note process.  That is where the commitment was made by the previous Government.

There is no contention between the European Central Bank and the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland or the Irish Government on the approach of liquidating IBRC, having one bad bank, the National Asset Management Agency, and having an orderly transfer by way of sale to NAMA for NAMA bonds of the assets, after which the wind-down will proceed.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael McGrath stated this is not typical of a normal liquidation and that is, of course, correct but no one is suggesting the liquidator should go in and try to dispose of the all the assets in a fire sale.  We are trying to protect the Irish taxpayer and recover some of the ground lost and are doing so in a number of ways.  Part of this involves ensuring an orderly wind-down of the IBRC assets, which will be in a special purpose vehicle operated by NAMA when the transfers take place.  We want to realise the maximum benefit and obtain the best price possible for the Irish taxpayer because if we do not do so, there will be a shortfall.  As the assets are systematically wound down, part of the debt is cleared to the ECB and the more we get for them, the better we will do.  If it transpires that some of the information given by representatives of IBRC to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform is correct - they spoke of being in a better position than envisaged - there may even be a profit.  However, I am not predicting that will be the case as I would like to wait and see how this works out. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600099#XXXX01300","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1360196700,"counter":1117,"content":"<p>Why did the Minister not protect the workers in IBRC?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600100#YYYY00200","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1360196700,"counter":1118,"content":"<p>Deputy Higgins has been calling for the liquidation of Anglo Irish Bank for years.
