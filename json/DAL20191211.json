The review of the public spending code, carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was considered by the Government yesterday.  The code is the central framework for the control and governance of all public expenditure activities, including social housing construction projects, where our responsibility is to ensure value for money in the essential work we undertake to provide housing for our citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;2 million eligibility threshold for the single-stage process for social housing projects was reviewed as part of the recent review of the code.  This has had regard to the level of public funding involved and that raising the &euro;2 million threshold would remove significant oversight from the Department over a substantial element of the social housing build programme, leading potentially to an increased risk of cost overruns or time delays or both.  Taking account of these issues, as well as the importance of delivering quality and sustainable housing, no change to the &euro;2 million threshold level is proposed in the revised code.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the uptake of the single-stage process has been modest, at best.  Of around 660 capital-funded social housing projects since 2016, approximately 280 are within the &euro;2 million threshold.  Of these, only approximately 45 are using the single-stage arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that the time involved in approving projects is only a small element in the process of bringing social housing projects from initial conception all the way through to construction.  This is borne out by the fact that the single-stage process has the potential to save, at most, six to eight weeks off the pre-construction target programme of 59 weeks.  Most of the time within that 59-week period is required to allow local authorities to complete their work on design, planning, procurement and engagement with contractors.<\/p>  <p>  The social housing approval arrangements have already been streamlined by concentrating the nine review stages of the code into just four.  The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that the streamlined processes are operated efficiently, with a view to moving projects through both the single-stage and four-stage approval processes as expeditiously as possible.  This is evident in the fact that it has been possible, in some cases, to complete the 59-week four-stage process in as little as 44 weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100003#A00900","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1576060200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I am not sure if it is coincidental that this was just reviewed yesterday and the decision was made.

A &euro;2 million threshold basically means eight to ten houses.<\/p> <p>It does not make any sense to me that the Department wants to have absolute control over anything above that.  One of the concerns raised in some information we got from the Department is based on the belief that it would lose control of approximately 44% of the housing budget.  I do not think that is the case.  It is not a question of letting local authorities just go off and do it and that there would be no oversight.  We need to find a mechanism to deliver building of social houses quicker.

They prefer the four-stage process.  We have streamlined the four-stage process down to 59 weeks but now local authorities such as Wicklow County Council are getting it down to 44 weeks.  We will continue to streamline the process and to improve and reform it.  Among the things that we have done is an internal specification for local authority housing that can be taken off the shelf by local authorities, but also an internal specification not for the facade or front of the home but for the actual layout.  If one is going to build 30 homes or 20 homes plus step-down facilities or elderly housing, there are now external layout specifications that can be taken off the shelf by local authorities to help them drive things more quickly.  We are moving the housing delivery office into the County and City Management Association, CCMA, which is another important reform that will put the delivery of social housing at the centre of local government again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100004#B00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1576060500,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

I do not know whether the Minister is ready to provide an update on Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  It is not true to say that local authorities do not want this; there is a particular reason for that.  It is because of the liabilities that may be foisted upon them.  The only reason is the financial stick that is hanging over them.  I believe many local authorities would be in a position to deliver projects quicker if they were allowed to do it themselves with oversight from the Department.  The sum of &euro;6 million was a mid-point.  We would go further, namely, to &euro;10 million, in particular in local authorities' that have large housing waiting lists.  We are looking at more than 130,000 people currently.  If we keep building at the current rate, we are not going to keep up with the demand and we will not start eating into those lists.  I am talking about building social houses, not buying existing built stock.

Next year we will build more homes for social housing than were built in any of the past 20 years, including any of the boom years.  That is very important.  We can do that because of the work that we did in the initial stages of Rebuilding Ireland and it is because of the reforms that we continue to make to the approval process that we can do that more quickly.<\/p>  <p>  If Deputy O'Brien were to put himself in my shoes and look at a recent project such as the children's hospital, which his party and others criticised in terms of cost overruns, he would not then, on reflection, want to lose even more oversight of cost controls in his Department by doing something that would seem to be both risky in terms of capital delivery but also might even lead to further delays if projects came forward that he could not stand over in terms of value for money.  For example, one local authority could come forward with plans to build apartments at a unit cost of at least &euro;500,000 if not &euro;600,000.  We would only see more of that if we increased the thresholds.  Again, the four-stage process has been streamlined down to 59 weeks and it is down to 44 weeks in some local authorities.  The person who has driven that in Wicklow is the chair of the housing committee in the CCMA.

In the past four years, since 2015, the revenue of local authorities has increased by 25%, from &euro;4 billion to &euro;5 billion.  I suspect it is a much bigger figure than is widely known.  This mainly comprises income from goods and services, commercial rates, Government grants and local property tax.<\/p>  <p>  Between 2015 and 2019, Irish Water was not liable for commercial rates and approximately &euro;47 million per annum was paid to local authorities to compensate them for the water services-related rates income they would have previously received.  The local government sector itself, through the CCMA, then sought to have Irish Water globally valued and that process finished recently.  Having regard to a recommendation from that sector that the exemption be removed, commercial rates will be imposed instead of the compensation that existed since 2015.  Irish Water will pay commercial rates directly to individual local authorities, following the global valuation process undertaken by the Commissioner of Valuation, in a similar arrangement as applies to other utilities.  The majority of local authorities will see an increase in their rates income arising from this process.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, this is just one of a number of variables that feed into local authority budgets.  For example, there have also been revaluations of other utilities and all of the local authorities likely to lose rates income from the Irish Water valuation would be likely to see their rates income increase from the ESB revaluation.  In addition, funding is made available from the Local Government Fund, LGF, and Exchequer funding of &euro;156 million, which is being made available through the LGF on a like-for-like basis, will see local authorities receive &euro;23 million more in Exchequer funding in 2020 when compared to 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has kept the anticipated financial impact of the changed approach to the rating of Irish Water under review.  Senior officials have liaised directly with sectoral representatives, including in the most impacted authorities, some of which the Deputy has referred to.  Taking account of other expected changes in incomes and the financial positions, Waterford City and County Council and Wicklow County Council were identified as facing significant challenges and did not have other sources of income to offset the loss.  For that reason the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy and I agreed to a once-off compensatory payment in both of those cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100004#B01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1576060500,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and the clarification.

At these rates, using the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, a couple with a joint income of &euro;44,000 would be in a position to buy any of the 133 homes for purchase.

I will, however, make some observations.  I believe it is a mistake to think about the pricing of these units as a reduction or a discount from market rent because they are not being delivered by market operators.  They are being led by the local authorities.  Clonburris, for example, will be a local authority-led project on public land.  Given that only yesterday I received replies to parliamentary questions back from the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to say that the average cost of construction of new units, including apartments and houses, by local authorities last year was &euro;200,000, one would have hoped that the purchase price for the homes in Clonburris could be below that.  I say this because the average loan offering from South Dublin County Council under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan this year was &euro;200,000.  To purchase either of the price range houses the Minister has just outlined, the households would need a deposit of some &euro;50,000 to &euro;60,000, which is not reasonable.<\/p>  <p>  Likewise with rents, many of us are concerned that with the St. Michael's estate the EIB finance is only for 25 or 30 years.  To get those rents down below &euro;900 - which is where they should be - some form of soft loan refinancing is probably required by the Department to stretch the maturity of the loans, perhaps for another ten years.  Will the Minister explore those two options so that even with the Rebuilding Ireland home loan - or for the lower-income working families - we can get the price points down to genuine affordability, especially for those people who are just above the income thresholds for social housing and who currently cannot afford to rent or buy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100006#D00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1576061700,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I welcome that the Deputy has recognised that the delivery of affordable housing is coming and is welcome under Rebuilding Ireland.  It is happening now and we are on sites.  Obviously we want it to happen more quickly but with cost rental in particular we must make sure the finances add up.  We would not want a person securing a rent for ten or 15 years or for longer, only to then find that five or ten years down the line, the rents must increase because somebody had made a mistake in the early stages of the process.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the fundamentals of private house building are the same for public house building, which are the construction costs and so on.  When we talk about what a discount might be or a discount on market rates it is just a way of putting it into a perspective that most people understand.  The reason we can talk about that is because these homes will not be at a market rate and will not have other aspects built in, such as profit or risk.  They will, however, have built in the maintenance and upkeep of the building over time with regard to the asset degrading over time.  This is why we refer to a below-market rate in that sense.<\/p>  <p>  I was not quite clear about the Deputy's point on deposits.  If a house is to be sold at approximately &euro;225,000 for example, a deposit of 10% would be around &euro;25,000.  The help-to-buy incentive could help with a large chunk of that.  On the EIB issue, we are looking for long-term finance from the European Investment Bank.  We already have them as a hired consultant to help us ensure we get the work right now.

For the Enniskerry Road project, I understand there is an innovative type of financing that allows it to be financed via the Housing Agency up to 40 years.  If a similar arrangement was provided for St. Michael's, we could bring the rents down.  The Minister is absolutely right that we must get the finances right.  The key, however, is the scale of capital intervention by central government at the start and the length of the loan.  If we find the right formula the rents could be brought down.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty with the Clonburris prices is that we must find affordable homes priced between &euro;170,000 and &euro;250,000 to meet the needs of people who are currently applying and being accepted for Rebuilding Ireland home loans but for whom the offer is below &euro;200,000.  While the Minister is right that we could combine the 10% deposit with support from the help to buy incentive, if a person's loan offering from the local authority is only &euro;170,000 or &euro;180,000, it does not do it.  Even though there has been a shift, as with the O'Devaney Gardens site and other projects, the talk was still of &euro;310,000.

These are the National Development Finance Agency, the European Investment Bank and some private consultants for some of the individual sites.

By the end of 2019, approximately 71 ,000 homes, or just over half of the local authority social housing stock, will have benefited from retrofit works under this programme supported by a total spend of more than &euro;144 million.<\/p>  <p>  Improvements in thermal performance are measured by local authorities through the use of pre and post-works building energy rating, BER, certificates which provide a good indicator of the energy savings and the reduction in CO2 emissions arising from retrofit works.  As a condition of phase 2, a registered pre and post-works BER certificate must be provided for all properties and details submitted to my Department in order for the local authority to draw down funding.

We work with local authorities as best as we can.  There are a range of schemes outside of these grants under which houses can be retrofitted.  These grants are linked to specific works and to BER certificates.  A range of works may need to be carried out.  If local authorities propose to carry out other works, we will examine those proposals.  The aim is to achieve a BER of B2, the cost-optimal rating.  This will mean more work in the case of some houses but that can be achieved under planned maintenance work.  This grant is focused on energy efficiency and making our houses more comfortable and warmer but there are other works to be carried out on houses.  As the Deputy will be aware, we discussed the voids programme last night.  At this stage, close to 10,000 houses have been brought back into use.  When local authorities are doing this, a deep retrofit and other works are often carried out on the house.  In some cases, a house identified under the voids programme may require &euro;80,000 worth of work rather than &euro;30,000.  That is the time to do the work.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities collect a lot of rent from some of these houses.  We have asked them to put in place a planned maintenance programme.  That will also consider energy efficiencies.  There are different ways of doing this.  Naturally, we ask local authorities that are drawing down this kind of funding in respect of a house to complete other works at the same time, if possible.  They have maintenance budgets, as they should.  Some local authorities do well and have a good record of collecting rent and spending it wisely.  Others charge lower rents for whatever reason - that decision is made locally - and may not always spend the money raised on maintenance programmes.  We encourage local authorities to collect a reasonable rent to spend on existing housing stock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100007#E01200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Data","time":1576062300,"counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100007#E01250"},{"type":"question","time":1576062300,"counter":77,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[51370\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100007#E01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of new build homes to be completed by each local authority by the end of 2019.

Each quarter, I publish details of progress against those targets and the outputs for the third quarter of 2019 have just been published.  These show 66% delivery to the end of September, or just under 18,000 households securing keys to a home under a social housing programme in the first nine months of this year.<\/p> <p>All stakeholders recognise the critical need to continue to increase social housing supply through build activity.  When Rebuilding Ireland was published in 2016, the construction activity base and pipeline in place were so low that the action plan's build targets had to be weighted towards the latter years of the six-year programme, recognising the time lag between project conception and delivery.  In 2016 and 2017, therefore, the focus was on maximising delivery by returning vacant stock to active use and by supporting the completion of vacant homes, while, in parallel, a major programme was put in place to expand the build pipeline significantly.  This year, we continue to see the fruits of the expansion of the social housing construction programme.  The build target for 2019 is to deliver 6,545 homes, an increase of more than 30% on last year's target.  Along with teams from my Department, I have been meeting local authorities regularly to ensure every effort continues to be made to achieve this target and I am confident we are on track to deliver close to the full target.<\/p> <p> The social housing construction status report, which is published on a quarterly basis on the Rebuilding Ireland website, provides detailed information on build activity in each local authority, including the number of homes on-site and actively being delivered.  In addition to the homes being built this year, more than 3,400 additional social homes are to be delivered through acquisition and leasing schemes.  In total, we are committed to ensuring more than 27,000 households are supported across all of the social housing programmes this year, bringing to 100,000 the number of households that will have been supported since 2016.  Next year, in excess of 11,000 social housing homes will be delivered through build, acquisition and leasing programmes.  This includes more than 7,500 newly built social housing homes, which will be 11 times the level in 2016, the first year of Rebuilding Ireland, and will be the highest number of such homes to be built this century.  My Department and I will continue to work proactively with local authorities and AHBs to ensure this and other targets continue to be met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100007#E01600","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576062900,"counter":82,"content":"<p>The Minister plays with figures and the definition of social housing to create confusion.

On 2019 delivery, both councils are working hard to achieve their targets of 191 new social housing homes in the city and 259 in the county.

We have had quite a lot of discussion on this over the past couple of years.  I have been talking to the Deputy&rsquo;s colleague about it.  Other parties are also very interested in this issue.  The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 provide the basis for the incremental tenant purchase scheme for existing local authority houses.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland action plan on housing and homelessness, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the tenant purchase scheme has been finalised and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations. This has included an examination of the minimum income requirements of the scheme.  That is probably the main issue raised here and at all the various council meetings that the Minister and I attend.<\/p>  <p>  What is intended now is that a comprehensive package of social housing reform measures will be brought to the Government in the near future and the review of the tenant purchase scheme will be included in that package, with the report to be published thereafter.  Until such time as these reforms are completed, the 2016 scheme will remain open and be utilised.  It is quite a generous scheme and suits many people.  While one can argue that the numbers might be lower than in previous years, one should realise the scheme is probably more generous than in previous years.  It remains open and people are actively utilising it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100009#G01200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1576063500,"counter":109,"content":"<p>The Minister of State says the scheme suits many people.

In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.<\/p><p><font color=\"#4F4F4F\">  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children who are joint tenants, named and paying rent, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner or cohabitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#4F4F4F\"> A number of income sources, including certain social welfare payments, are disregarded for the purpose of determining reckonable income.

In response to questions I put earlier the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, alluded to other decisions that have been made.  Do they form part of this?  Will the Government publish this before Christmas?  Does it have a date in mind?  Once we get it, we can move on and evaluate the merits of these secret recommendations.

After that, there will be discussions around this recommendation.  I have discussed it with some of Deputy O'Brien's colleagues and we can discuss it further.  We have had conversations about what people wanted from this.  The sense we got was that people wanted a way of dealing with that &euro;15,000 income barrier.  I will clarify why it is there.  It is not a madcap idea.  There is a logic to it.  The tenant purchase scheme has quite a long history of cases where people could not afford to maintain houses after purchasing them.  In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant's income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure the tenant purchasing the house is in the financial position, as the owner, to maintain and ensure the property for the duration of the charge period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring ownership.  A condition of the transfer of the ownership of the house is that for the duration of the incremental purchase charge, which goes on for 20 or 30 years, the tenant purchaser must keep the house in good repair and condition and maintain house insurance on the property.  The tenant purchaser is also responsible for the normal changes associated with home ownership.  Our research and the history of the scheme showed that this did not always happen without that income barrier.  To be fair, the &euro;15,000 minimum might not be the best way to address that because it prevents someone who has won the lottery or benefitted from a settlement of some sort from buying their house.  We are trying to find ways to deal with that.  That will also form part of the package.<\/p>  <p>  An impression has probably been given that this is the reason people are not buying houses.  In one sample year more than 2,400 applications were made under the scheme.  Fewer than a quarter were refused because of the eligibility criteria.  Those criteria did not affect the other 75%.  I must be clear that this is not the main issue.  It is an issue in some individual cases, but it is not the main reason people are not using this scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100010#H00400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Constitutional Amendments","time":1576064100,"counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100010#H00500"},{"type":"question","time":1576064100,"counter":119,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[51222\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100010#H00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the steps he will take to progress the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) (No.1) Bill 2016 seeking to place the right to water in the Constitution; the reason for the delay to date in moving forward with the legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","time":1576064100,"counter":120,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[51760\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100010#H00700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when he plans to have the revised amendment wording ready to bring to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) (No. 2) Bill 2016.","asker":"1306","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1576064100,"counter":121,"content":"<p>This question relates to the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) (No. 1) Bill 2016, which passed through the House several years ago.

In 2018, 8,000 new social homes were delivered nationally, and this year, a further 10,000 new social homes will be added to the stock.  Delivery will increase again to more than 11,000 homes next year and 12,000 in 2021.  In fact, next year will see the delivery of 7,500 new build social housing homes, the highest level this century.  The Housing Agency has provided my Department with a report on the summary of social housing assessments, SSHA, for 2019.  The report shows that 68,693 households were qualified and in need of social housing support in June of this year.  That is a reduction of 25% over the last three years and a trend which is expected to continue in the coming years.  The reduction reflects the significantly increased level of social housing activity being delivered through Rebuilding Ireland under which more than 90,000 households across the country have had their housing needs met from 2016 to the end of the third quarter of this year.  In 2018 alone, just over 27,100 households were supported, which was 6% ahead of the overall target for the year, and we are aiming again to support more than 27,000 households this year.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting families experiencing homelessness is a priority for the Government, for me and my Department, in particular.  My Department continues to work closely and proactively with the local authorities and other relevant stakeholders to ensure that we provide the necessary supports to deliver homes for all the families currently experiencing homelessness.  For so long as any individual or family experiences homelessness, I am determined to ensure that the most appropriate emergency accommodation is available.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to family homelessness, my Department is working with the local authorities to support the introduction of family hubs, 30 of which are already in operation, providing almost 690 spaces for family accommodation.  Local authorities and their service delivery partners work with families in the hubs to secure a home, with an objective to do so within a six-month period.  However, in some cases it can take longer due to the housing requirements or preferences of a family.  The monthly reports submitted by the local authorities to my Department do not currently provide detailed information on the length of time spent by families in emergency accommodation.  However, the latest information drawn from a separate local authority performance reporting mechanism shows that 38% of adults in emergency accommodation at the end of September 2019 had been there for fewer than six months.

We have gotten people off the streets and into homes.  For every two families that presented to homeless services this year, we prevented one family immediately from going into emergency accommodation.  That is important.  It is important that people know that we are focusing on preventing people from going into emergency accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  If one is in a family hub, on average one will spend six months in emergency accommodation and the majority of people in emergency accommodation throughout the system are there for less than a year.  This is important as well, because it was not always that way.  If it was not for the programmes we were bringing in, people would be suffering far longer in emergency accommodation.  One of the very first cases I have dealt with as Minister - I was in the job a week - was in relation to children not having enough crawl space and not developing their motor neuron skills because they were in the wrong type of emergency accommodation.

It is not a good story and reflects quite badly on the Government.  He has put together a staggering list of more than 214,000 children waiting for healthcare.  Some 117,000 children are waiting for hospital appointments and treatment and another 90,000 are waiting for primary care appointments.  One child in four has been waiting for more than a year, according to the list.  This includes very sick children in need of urgent surgery.  The list includes special needs children in urgent need of therapeutic supports such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy, to name but two.  It includes children waiting for psychology, diagnostic scans and much more.<\/p>  <p>  I will give some examples.  In ear, nose and throat, ENT, close to 3,000 children have been waiting over a year for an appointment.  In paediatric cardiology more than 1,200 children have been waiting over a year for an appointment out of a total list of close to 5,000.  In dermatology there is an overall list of 4,500, with 2,129 waiting for over a year.  In ophthalmology, 4,000 children have been waiting over a year for an appointment.  In psychology there are more huge figures, with more than 2,500 waiting over a year out of a total list of 7,000.  We are aware of the issues in respect of mental health, specifically adolescent mental health.<\/p>  <p>  This underpins the experiences of many in this House in dealing with many parents and families, who are exasperated, frustrated and very anxious about the failure to get assessments and regular access to therapeutic interventions.  We know that early intervention, diagnosis and treatment are the key to a child's treatment, personal development and optimal outcomes.  Worryingly, these figures understate the true picture.  They exclude oral health, for example, and many diagnostic categories are not covered by the HSE.  They are a terrible indictment of our health service and the Government's stewardship of it.  There is a shortage of consultants, therapists and specialist nurses and there is, despite what the Taoiseach says, a moratorium on recruitment in place.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Government remove the hiring embargo to enable the fast recruitment of doctors, therapists, radiographers and so forth?  Will it remove the new entrant pay inequality for consultants in order that we can hire the number of specialists we need?  Will it accelerate the hiring procedures for such specialist and clinical staff, whom we urgently require?  For example, there is a chronic shortage of radiographers in Temple Street Hospital.  In the interim, will the Taoiseach accelerate the provision of additional hospital beds for children, particularly in ICUs, rehab and ward beds across the system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100012#K01200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1576065300,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I note at the outset that it is very sad that there are so many people, so many children, on waiting lists for healthcare and therapies.  It is not good enough.  I know that and I feel it very much in my constituency work with the parents and children I meet from time to time who tell me of their personal stories.<\/p>  <p>  It is only right, however, that we in this House acknowledge that waiting lists for healthcare are now falling.  The NTPF figures show that the waiting lists for outpatient appointments - that is, for people waiting to see a specialist - have been falling consistently for three or four months in a row.  It took years and years of investment and additional staff but we are now finally seeing those outpatient waiting lists falling.  When I became Taoiseach two and a half years ago, more than 60,000 people had been waiting for more than 12 weeks for an operation or procedure.  That figure is now down to approximately 38,000, or over a third in two and a half years.  Much of this is down to the investment through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, of which I know Deputy Martin was very supportive and which he advocated.  We also see that the waiting times for general paediatrics are down approximately 30% so far this year.  This is because of the new urgent care centre that has been opened in Connolly Hospital.  The centre has a dedicated paediatric outpatient department.  That is a big turnaround in one year.  We also see that in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, for example, the waiting list is down approximately 20% in the past year.  This is not down to any waiting list initiative but to structural changes that have been led by the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, in employing a large number of assistant psychologists, moving away from a psychiatric model to a model based more on psychology.  That is real progress as outpatient lists now have been falling for three or four months in a row; inpatient procedural lists are down by approximately one third from where they were two and a half years ago.  Waiting times for general paediatrics - I know it is only general paediatrics, but that is an important part of paediatrics - is down 30% in the past year; and CAMHS waiting lists are down 20% over the past year.  It took years and years of investment and additional staff to reverse the damage that was done, but I am glad I can now say and stand over the fact that waiting lists are falling, not increasing, after a very long time during which they went in the wrong direction.<\/p> <p>We will continue to invest.  There is an additional &euro;1 billion in the budget for the HSE next year.  The Connolly centre has opened and is helping already.  We need to open that over weekends and in the evenings as well, which we are working to do in 2020.  The urgent care centre in Tallaght for children will open next year, which is a big step forward as well.  The main new children's hospital, on the St. James's Hospital campus, with an individual room for every child and space for a parent to sleep in every room, will open in 2023.  After so many false starts, including &euro;35 million wasted on the Mater Hospital project, we finally have that hospital at roof level.  The windows are already in on one level.  We are working on moving speech and language therapy into schools, which I think will work out, but that has only started.  We will see how that pilot plays out.<\/p> <p> To answer the Deputy's question, there is not a moratorium on recruitment.  We have 15,000 more staff in our health service than we had a few years ago.  We have more staff in our health service than we had this time last year.  Managers can fill positions as long as those positions are budgeted for.<\/p> <p> We are working on consultant pay.  We are willing to make an offer to doctors with regard to consultant pay - we will give full pay equality for consultants, provided consultants commit to working in the public service and the public service only.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100012#K01300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576065900,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100013#L00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1576065900,"counter":192,"content":"<p>That will be the first step in our plan to remove private practice from public hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100013#L00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1576065900,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin has one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100013#L00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1576065900,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach acknowledges that it is shocking that so many children have to wait for so long.

Nothing could have prepared me for the trauma and heartache that those stories encapsulated.  We have compiled some of those stories in a document entitled, The Humans of the Housing Crisis.  I have sent it to the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Murphy, and their partner, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I trust that the Taoiseach has read the document but it is important to place on the record of the D&aacute;il some of the stories that were sent to me.  The Taoiseach may have seen Kevin Maughan's letter to Santa Claus, covered in one of the newspapers this morning.  He writes to Santa: &quot;Please come to my hotel again with Batman toys.&quot;  That is what he wants this year.  Kevin is seven.  He lives in emergency accommodation in County Clare with his parents and little sister.  Kevin has developed asthma due to his homelessness because he has stayed in so many cold and damp places.  Here is another letter:<\/p> <blockquote> \tHi, my landlord wants to sell her house, and myself, husband and my two small kids have to be out by February.<br \/><br \/>We have nowhere to go.  I am on the housing list over 13 years. <\/blockquote>  <p>Here is another:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe both have decent jobs with good incomes...<br \/><br \/>We rent a tiny studio apartment.  We pay just over &euro;1,000 for the privilege of tripping over each other and fighting over space...<br \/><br \/>Due to the high rents and high cost of living in this city we live pay check to pay check with little or no savings.  Saving for a mortgage is simply not possible for us and our insecure housing situation has forced us to put our lives on hold. <\/blockquote>  <p>Here is another:<\/p> <blockquote> \tHi, im a student and until recently was living in a converted shed in the back of the landlord&rsquo;s house.<br \/><br \/>I was cramped in there with two others. Rent is &euro;500 and he only takes cash.<br \/><br \/>When I gave in my month&rsquo;s notice he forced me out immediately and took my deposit. <\/blockquote>  <p>Here is another:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am currently living with my partner&rsquo;s parents.  Four years now in an attic with our 11 year old son.<br \/><br \/>We decided to take this step as the rent was absolutely spine-breaking.  We both have really good jobs.<br \/><br \/>We have been trying to attain a mortgage for the last four years with no success. <\/blockquote>  <p>This document is a catalogue of heartbreak, trauma and shattered dreams.  It has been caused by the Government.  What makes matters worse is that it does not have to be this way.  All of these stories can heard and answered with the right policy decisions.  At this stage, the Taoiseach needs to accept and recognise the real harm, financial distress, mental anguish and even physical illness that is being caused to families and to children.  He needs to change direction, and to recognise that there are solutions and adopt them.  Does he now accept that we have a housing crisis that has no equal?  Does he accept that we need to start a radical change in policy?  Will he accept that we can start by dealing with extortionate rents?  Will he commit to supporting the Sinn F&eacute;in legislation that has been debated and will come before the House for a vote tomorrow?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100013#L03400","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1576065900,"counter":223,"content":"<p>We have always accepted that there is a housing crisis and shortage in the country.

I share the Deputy's concern about children who, in the run up to Christmas, are concerned about whether Santa will be able to find them on Christmas Eve.  He will find them, and the same goes for children in hospitals, emergency accommodation, hotels or who are at home with their parents.<\/p> <p> The solution to the housing crisis, on which we all broadly agree, is to increase dramatically the supply of housing in this country.  We have an expanding, growing population and more households are being created every year, which means we need to build many houses.  The Central Bank is right that we need to build about 35,000 new homes a year.  We are not there yet, but in the two and a half years since I became Taoiseach, the number of new homes being built has trebled.  That is significant; it is not enough and houses can only be built so quickly.  It is significant that the number of new homes being built has trebled in the past three years.  We need to double that number again and get up to 35,000 or 40,000 houses per year, which we will do as soon as we possibly can.  This year, we have added 10,000 homes to the social housing stock.  That is significant as it means 10,000 families are now living in homes that were not being used for social housing this time last year.  Santa will arrive in 10,000 houses which were not available for social housing this time last year.

The plan aims to improve childminding in this State, which has been largely unregulated up until now.  Estimates for the number of childminders in Ireland vary, from the Department's figure of 19,000 to the 35,000 suggested by the Central Statistics Office.  However, as few as 120 childminders are currently registered with Tusla.  There is a long road to go to regularise this sector.<\/p>  <p>  The way in which the Government has proceeded with this plan is causing concern to the many thousands of people involved in childminding.  Members across the House will have received serious representations from people worried about their future.  Despite the draft plan's allowance of up to five years for preparation and transition, childminders are concerned that these changes are going ahead without any real understanding or response to the concerns they have vocalised.  Some childminders could be driven out of this important sector by heavy-handed regulation, which would, in turn, affect thousands of parents who rely on the current childminding arrangements to go to work every day.  According to the Government's plan, legislation will be implemented over the course of the next five years which would require childminders to gain formal qualifications and be Garda vetted.  Their homes would also have to be inspected to ensure they meet certain requirements.  In principle, these are sensible proposals, but there is a risk that they will be implemented in a heavy-handed way.  I am hearing that concern across the country from those providing this essential service.<\/p>  <p>  Officials have admitted that childminders must sign up to strict standards of care or face prosecution.

Childminders are also concerned about the level of inspections of their family homes these new regulations may entail.  While health and safety issues are of great importance, there needs to be greater recognition that childminding is an activity carried out in the private space of people's homes rather than in any formal or structured business setting.  Will the Government provide a credit or part-credit towards the required qualifications in recognition of the existing professional childminding experience of those who have been doing this for years?  Will the Government put limits on the range of official bodies that will have the right to inspect the private homes of individuals involved in childminding, as well as the frequency of such visits?

It might be of interest to workers in this country that French workers are fighting to protect a pension entitlement age of 62.  Some workers in hard physical jobs get their pension at the age of 55.  People are on the streets in their millions striking to prevent the pension entitlement age going up to 64.<\/p>  <p>  In this country, we are in a far worse position.  In March 2010, the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government made a decision to commence three phases of attacks on pension entitlements.  They loaded the gun to attack pension rights and then Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the former Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, pulled the trigger in 2014 to provide that people would not get their pension until the age of 66.  As of 2021, workers born after 1955 will not get it until they are aged 67 and, as of 2028, workers will not get it until they are 68.  This will mean that workers in this country will be in the worst situation in the OECD in respect of their pension rights and entitlements.  They will have to work longer than anybody else to get pensions that, in many cases, have been significantly reduced.  Comparisons are, again, worthwhile.  In Norway, a person gets a pension at the age of 61; in Sweden, at 62; and in Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland and the UK, at 65.  However, workers in this country will get it at either 67 or 68.  The age is currently 66.  Irish workers are the most productive anywhere in the western world, even when one strips out the impact of transfer pricing.  <\/p>  <p>  This was all justified in the name of austerity.  Austerity is over.  We are now one of the richest countries in the world with the fastest growing economy in western Europe.  Does the Taoiseach think it is fair that workers in this country should work longer and harder for less or does he think we should take a lead from what French workers are doing and fight to reverse those attacks on the pension rights and entitlements of working people in this country who paid and worked hard for their pensions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100015#N00800","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1576067100,"counter":252,"content":"<p>This is nothing to do with austerity.  Thankfully, in Ireland, austerity has been over for more than three years.  As a result of that, unemployment is a third of what it was not too long ago in 2012, incomes are rising, poverty and deprivation are falling and, as we know from the figures from the CSO survey on income and living conditions released the other day, income inequality is at its second lowest since records began.  We have delivered on all of those in the past couple of years and secured a position where we are one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe, which I thank the Deputy for acknowledging.  I accept the back-handed compliment that our policies have been successful but this is not about austerity.  The objective of this policy is to make sure the State pension continues to be adequate and sustainable in the long term.  We have one of the highest State pensions in the EU and we want to keep it that way and to keep increasing it over the next couple of years in line with inflation if not with wages.  That is what we should aim to do.<\/p>  <p>  We also want to make sure that we will still have a State pension system when people who are now in their forties and fifties retire.  The way it works is that people and employers pay PRSI and it all goes into the Social Insurance Fund, out of which comes the State contributory pension.  Because the economy is now very strong, the fund is in surplus.  However, it is projected to go into deficit because of our ageing population and changes in demographics.  If the economy was to slow down or another downturn occurred, it would go into deficit very quickly so we need to act now.   When this system was set up in the 1970s, circumstances were very different.  The average man lived to approximately 68 years of age while the average woman lived to approximately 72.  <\/p> <p>People paid a relatively small amount of PRSI every year but were only retired for a short amount of time.<\/p> <p> The change since then has been wonderful, in that life expectancy has improved.  Most people now live into their 80s, which is brilliant, but comes with the consequence that the cost of pensions is rising all the time, and will rise faster than the rate at which PRSI is paid into the Social Insurance Fund.  We have to act by either significantly increasing PRSI or increasing the retirement age.  We think the prudent thing to do is to increase the retirement age in line with life expectancy.  It still means that people get ten or 20 years of retirement, but the retirement age is increased in line with life expectancy.  That makes sense because, if we do not do that, the Social Insurance Fund will go into deficit and we will face a pension crisis.  We would then be in a position where pensions would have to be reduced.  We never want to do that, we want to keep increasing pensions in line with inflation and earnings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100015#N00900","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576067700,"counter":254,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach should tell pensioners who have to struggle with high rents, property taxes and a high cost of living that their pension is wonderful.

There are many defined benefit pension schemes that currently have very large deficits.  The solution, as I understand it from Deputy Penrose's Bill, is to make the employer liable for any deficit.  There is a real difficulty in that because we could have a company with thousands of employees that is working well and making a profit but if we load on that company a pension deficit of hundreds of millions of euro, it might become insolvent.  In trying to protect the pensions of some, therefore, we may cause hundreds of people to become unemployed.<\/p>  <p>  We have a difficulty with the semi-State organisations as well.  Quite a number of them have very large deficits and if those deficits are put on the balance sheets of those companies, they would have to curtail their investment plans.

Can we classify them as valid centres for people to present to ensure that we stave off the over-crowding that is currently taking place in CUH?  We cannot have a situation whereby Dr. Padraig McGarry, president of the IMO, is rebutting the idea coming from management at CUH that GPs need to come in to carry out shifts in the accident and emergency in CUH at a time when primary care centres and GP surgeries are completely over-run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100018#Q01200","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1576068900,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I think greater use of hospitals like those in Ennis, Nenagh, Mallow and Bantry as well as others, including the hospital in Loughlinstown in Dublin, makes good sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100018#Q01300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1576068900,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Will the Taoiseach take a look at it personally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100018#Q01400","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1576068900,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Yes.

Approximately 12 months ago, it was reported that in a rape case in Cork, the defence lawyers introduced as evidence a lace thong belonging to a 17 year old complainant.  It was an appalling and indefensible strategy that clearly implied that the victim was in some way responsible or to blame.  The dreadful approach taken by the defence team in this case rightly drew criticism here and internationally.  It was discussed in the D&aacute;il when Deputy Coppinger brought the issue up.  She quoted the barrister, who said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDoes the evidence out-rule the possibility that she was attracted to the defendant and open to meeting someone and being with someone?  You have to look at the way she was dressed.  She was wearing a thong with a lace front. <\/blockquote>  <p>This was an appalling commentary and it was of no evidential value.  Ultimately, it was an extremely cynical strategy.<\/p><p>It was clear to me and to Deputy Martin Kenny as a consequence of this that there are not adequate protections for victims of rape and sexual offences to prevent this kind of behaviour, which has no evidential value.  We have tried to fix this clear failing in the law.  The legislation we are bringing forward tackles the use of references to clothing of the complainant in sexual offences trials.  It would also ensure that there are greater safeguards to sexual history evidence being introduced.  The manner in which this will work is that where it is sought to introduce clothing evidence, the defendant must make an application to the judge, who would have a hearing without the jury but with the legal representatives of the defence, the prosecution and, crucially, legal representation for the complainant, before deciding whether it would be admitted.  This procedure exists in respect of sexual history.  It could only be admitted if it was the case that it would not be possible for the defendant to have a fair trial without it being introduced.  It is a very reasonable and sensible Bill.  The other reform it introduces is that the complainant would be represented in any hearings on admissibility.  That is not currently the case.  <\/p><p>There was no evidential value for the introduction of that evidence at the time.  It was a form of victim blaming, which caused disgust in Ireland and throughout the world.  We need to ensure that where evidence is introduced such as clothing or sexual history, it is done in a way that is relevant to the case and that there are safeguards.  We need to ensure that it is not introduced in such a way as to impugn or shame the complainant or in a way that has no evidential value.  This legislation has great value and will improve the conduct of sexual offences trials in this jurisdiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100020#S00500","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1576070100,"counter":345,"content":"<p>This Bill is warranted in the context of so many young women who fall foul of sexual violence and sexual attack and do not come forward.  Very often, they do not come forward because of what they read in the newspapers and because of the atmosphere around all of that.  They see these trials as a re-victimisation of the person and a degradation of their humanity.  That is what happens in many cases when we have this type of aggressive cross-examination.  The introduction of clothing in that manner, in that particular case and in others, has shone a bright light on the situation.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire pointed out, the Bill is about dealing with this specific aspect.

In 2019, Cabinet committee D met twice, and post the restructuring of Cabinet committees in July, the Cabinet committee on infrastructure has since met twice.  The Cabinet committee works to ensure a co-ordinated approach in the areas of infrastructure investment and delivery, Project Ireland 2040, and Rebuilding Ireland.  There is significant work under way across each of the areas covered by the committee through Departments, agencies and a range of interdepartmental groups such as the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board.  These matters are also regularly considered at meetings of Government and in bilateral meetings with the relevant Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  Significant work is continuing to deliver Project Ireland 2040.  Recent projects delivered on budget include the M11 Gorey-Enniscorthy road, which was under budget, the N22 Tralee bypass, the Luas green line infrastructure and capacity upgrade, a 100-bed community nursing unit in Tymon North and the Cork radiation oncology unit, among others.  Long-term projects under way include the national broadband plan, the contract for which is now signed, and the north runway at Dublin Airport, which is now under construction.  The four funds launched under Project Ireland 2040 have a total of &euro;4 billion to invest.  The first round of funding allocations under these funds, amounting to just over &euro;150 million in 2019, have been announced.  Second round calls have been launched for the disruptive technologies innovation fund and the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF.  A further call for the urban regeneration fund will be announced soon, and work is continuing on legislation to underpin the climate action fund, to be funded by a levy on the oil industry.<\/p>  <p>  As we know, effective project delivery needs effective governance.  The Government is considering some reforms to oversight and governance of project selection, appraisal and delivery.  This includes updating the public spending code, which was approved at Government yesterday.  Targeted interventions under Rebuilding Ireland are also working to respond to housing needs.  In the 12 months to the end of quarter 3, more than 20,000 new dwellings were completed and we have seen strong growth in leading indicators such as planning permissions, commencement notices and housing registrations.

His memory is, again, very selective.  The statement that capital projects would be re-profiled was made by his Government.  For example, on 4 April, the Minister for Finance announced that he had decided to re-profile money allocated to Project Ireland 2040, the new marketing name for the national development plan, NDP.  One of the direct cuts involved in this was a &euro;24 million reduction in funding for repairs and renovation projects in the health sector this year.  I am looking for some honesty about the timing of projects on which the Government has spent millions of euro in public money marketing to national and local audiences.  When the now inevitable video with drone shots of the Cliffs of Moher was published at the start of this marketing campaign, we were told there would be absolute transparency about funding and timing.  Yet, when we seek clarity following billions of euro in overruns, the Taoiseach comes out with this nonsense that we are seeking cutbacks.<\/p>  <p>  It takes a special form of almost childish brazenness to sign a contract rapidly to make a project irreversible and then attack others for not proposing to incur massive costs for the State by reversing it.  This appears to be the core Fine Gael strategy now, so we will all have to get used to it.  The Government not only wants to pretend that it is funding projects, which will not be planned or funded for many years; it wants to deny the impact of overruns.  It should be noted by the House that each of the major overruns has been hidden from the public until the last moment.

It is reported that this &euro;350 million project - that is the current estimate; it could be a lot more than that - may not be put out to tender until these matters are determined.  Even when the hospital is finally built and funded, with a significant outlay of taxpayers' money, we have no legal certainty in terms of its public ownership.

If the Taoiseach is concerned about diesel cars, the only way of getting a significant number of those cars off the road is to develop public transport.  However, there has been neither sight nor sound of a project to electrify the Dublin to Maynooth railway line.  It seems to have been put out to the back end of 2040.

The Religious Sisters of Charity own the land on which the new facility is being built and the Government is negotiating with the order through its company, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  That group will have a majority on the hospital's board of management and will chair it.  If things do not change, the reality is that women's healthcare will be at risk, as well as the State's finances.  Ethos will follow ownership.  It is unrealistic to expect a Catholic maternity hospital owned by the nuns' company to provide a full range of services, including contraception, sterilisation, abortion, IVF, etc., because those services contravene the Catholic code.  There must be a review of the contract agreed between the Minister for Health and the Religious Sisters of Charity and measures proposed to bring the hospital into public ownership with a secular ethos and a secular board of management.<\/p>  <p>  I have a question regarding the carbon emissions specifications to which the national maternity hospital and the national children's hospital are being built.  When I asked about this in a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health, I received an answer from the HSE stating that the maternity hospital is being built to A3 standard.  The expert advice I have received on the matter makes clear that this is nowhere near the near-zero energy building standards required for all new public buildings from 1 January 2020.  In fact, the building is being designed to 2008 building regulations rather than the 2019 regulations.  If it continues to be built in the current way, the hospital will need to be retrofitted at up to ten times the cost of building it to near-zero standards from the outset, if a deep retrofit is even possible.

The council analyses and reports on strategic policy matters relevant to Ireland's economic, social, environmental and sustainable development.  The NESC is a valuable forum where economic, social and environmental issues can be discussed between a variety of actors and Departments.  The council's work focuses on the strategic and long-term view and its current work programme comprises four themes: Ireland's transition to a low-carbon and digital future; reforms to the social welfare system; land use, land value and urban development; and climate change.<\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland 2019 also includes a request for NESC to develop policy recommendations for the operation of transition teams to manage the impact of economic transition on vulnerable workers and sectors.  The project will provide a forward look at the economy in the context of a transition to a low carbon and more digital future.<\/p>  <p>  I present council reports to Government prior to their publication, or prior to laying them before the Houses, as in the case of the annual reports.

There are also seven independent members on the council.  This composition means that it plays an important and unique role in bringing different perspectives from civil society together with Government.  This helps NESC to analyse the challenges facing society and to develop a shared understanding among its members of how to tackle these challenges.

At its launch, and during the extended period of partial briefing and marketing that surrounded its appearance, it was claimed by the Government that the plan was specific, ambitious and credible in setting out exactly how Ireland can reach its emissions targets.  One of these targets is that, within ten years, Ireland will have 1 million electric vehicles on the road.  It has been estimated that to hit the Government's target every car sold from January onwards for the next ten years will have to be electric.  This is obviously nonsense.  The cars are not available, the charging network is not available and there is no policy in place capable of delivering even a fraction of the target of a one hundredfold increase in sales starting in three weeks.  Can the Taoiseach tell us how exactly he believes the target for electric vehicles will be met?  We need precision, not the general stuff that he has been going on with for the past few months.

It appears the Government has abandoned the report's recommendations.  Everything that has been done since its publication has gone in the other direction.  For instance, the Land Development Agency, LDA, which does not have compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers, is off-balance sheet and, effectively, is a fully independent commercial entity that only has regard to Government policy rather than delivering on it.  It is under no statutory obligation to deliver social or affordable housing.  When a conflict of interest between commercial concerns and social goods arises for the LDA, the commercial interests always win out over affordable housing, as was previously the case with NAMA.

I accept that we have more work to do in this area, particularly when it comes to Secretaries General.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of problems attracting candidates and retaining them in employment, the Public Service Pay Commission was established to advise the Government on aspects of the public service remuneration policy.  In the second phase of its work, the commission was tasked by its terms of reference to undertake an examination of whether and to what extent there are difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff in the public service.<\/p> <p>As part of this final module, the commission considered the issues and policy challenges associated with pay setting for top level posts in the public service at the current time, as evidenced by recent competitions to appoint a Garda Commissioner and a new director general of the HSE.  In its final report, the commission included findings regarding senior executive recruitment and retention issues.  It noted as a matter of fact that the pay reductions introduced during the fiscal crisis were structured with greater reductions at the most senior levels, steps that in my view, were appropriate at the time.  The commission also noted that the unwinding of pay reductions, which commenced in 2015, has been progressive and focused rightly on prioritising restoration for those at the lower income levels first.  That action will be ongoing at more senior levels until July 2022 under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, which provides a statutory roadmap for the continued controlled unwinding of FEMPI as it applies to all public servants, including those in the most senior positions.<\/p> <p> On the question of pay determination for future such posts, the commission stated it would be appropriate, should it be decided to conduct a review of remuneration of senior level posts, that the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector, which was in place between 1969 and 2009, be reconstituted for this purpose, given the diversity of posts in question, as well as the range of issues affecting them.  I understand the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has asked officials in his Department to examine the re-establishment of this review body.<\/p> <p> In regard to Deputy Martin's assertion that financial decisions are being re-politicised, I would not accept that assertion.  In fact, I would give an example of the contrary, which is the sports capital programme.  When I was in the Department with the Minister, Deputy Ring, we put in place very clear rules to determine which projects were valid or invalid, and we put in place a points system which means it is the officials who score the different projects using that points system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100024#W00500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576073100,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Who gets the points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100025#X00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1576073100,"counter":423,"content":"<p>Mayo gets extra.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100025#X00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1576073100,"counter":424,"content":"<p>There is also an appeals system, which was a very significant change to the approach taken by the former Minister, John O'Donoghue, and the former Minister, Jim McDaid, before that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100025#X00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1576073100,"counter":425,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach should talk to the Minister, Deputy Ross.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100025#X00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1576073100,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Mayo won on the grants, not on the field of play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100025#X00600","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1576073100,"counter":427,"content":"<p>IGEES is a very good project and is continuing to develop.

It will be the first meeting chaired by Charles Michel, who took over as President of the Council on 1 December.  It will also be the first meeting attended by Ursula von der Leyen in her role as President of the Commission, and by Christine Lagarde since she took up office as President of the European Central Bank.  We have a busy agenda and, at the top of it, are climate change and the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, the EU's seven-year budget.  We will also discuss external relations, as well as the proper functioning of the World Trade Organization.  On Friday, there will be a euro summit where we will take stock of progress achieved by Finance Ministers on EMU reform since the last summit in June, and we will provide direction on how we take the work forward.  We will also meet in Article 50 format to consider the state of play on Brexit and the next steps.<\/p>  <p>  In his wrap-up remarks today, the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, will speak on the WTO issue and other external relations issues.  I will focus my remarks on the other items on the agenda.  The European Council will begin on Thursday with an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli.  I understand he will raise the idea of a conference on the future of Europe, something both the Parliament and the European Commission have been doing some thinking about.  This will be the first discussion on this issue at the European Council and I look forward to hearing President Sassoli's thoughts and the views of colleagues.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union has a significant programme of work to undertake in the coming period, including implementing the strategic agenda which we adopted in June.  This built on successful citizens' dialogues in Ireland and elsewhere.  The European Council will continue on Thursday with a formal working session where we will discuss climate change.  Last October, we welcomed the outcome of the UN Climate Action Summit 2019 and confirmed that we would return to this issue in December.  This week, we must finalise the guidance we give to the European Commission on the EU's long-term strategy on climate.  This will enable the adoption and submission of the EU's long-term strategy to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change next year.<\/p>  <p>  For me, the priority is to build a consensus for our objective of achieving climate neutrality at EU level by 2050.  As it is the best way to encourage other countries in other parts of the world to scale up their short-term and long-term ambitions under the Paris Agreement, global leadership by the EU is required.  We aspire to become the first carbon-neutral continent.  We know this is good environmental, social and economic policy but we also need to bring citizens with us and ensure that the transition is both just and socially balanced.  I believe this means supporting the most affected regions and sectors, where necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The Union's future budget will be the main topic for discussion at our dinner on Thursday evening.  We will also discuss foreign policy and the World Trade Organization.  At the last European Council in October, we asked the Presidency to submit a \"negotiating box\" ahead of our meeting this week, in other words, a paper with detailed figures which would be used to structure MFF negotiations and to facilitate discussion on individual issues.  The Finnish Presidency has now brought forward a proposal based on an overall budget of 1.07% of GNI and has set out suggested allocations across each of the main expenditure headings.  We welcome the efforts of the Finnish Presidency to progress the negotiations and I look forward to discussing the proposal with colleagues this week.<\/p>  <p>  As our prosperity has increased and our economy has grown, so have our contributions to the EU, and they are projected to increase considerably further in the next MFF.  We benefit so much from our membership of the EU, including through our membership of the Single Market, and it is in our interests that the Union has a budget that is fit for purpose and adequate.  Above all, we want to see long-established, well-funded and successful programmes, such CAP and cohesion funding, continue, as well as investment in new challenges, such as migration, security, climate change and digitalisation.  Programmes such as Horizon, INTERREG and Erasmus+ are successful and must be properly funded.  I welcome the Finnish Presidency's proposal to increase funding for the PEACE programme to &euro;100 million.  With contributions from Ireland and the UK, this potentially allows us to have a PEACE PLUS programme of almost &euro;1 billion in the next MFF period, which will be of huge benefit to Northern Ireland and the Border counties, and is a priority for me in the negotiations.  I will continue to advocate for CAP because it is a successful policy that ensures food security, promotes regional and rural development in Europe and enables us to encourage greener and more environmentally friendly agriculture.  The importance of stopping climate change is reflected more broadly in the proposed budget, with an overall target of at least 25% of expenditure delivering on climate objectives.  This is not going to be a meeting where we make decisions but it will set the course for the future discussions on the MFF.  I expect the European Council to take a more central role on this from now on.<\/p>  <p>  On Friday morning, our day will begin with the euro summit, at which we will take stock of progress achieved by Finance Ministers on EMU reform since the last summit in June.  This will be an opportunity to provide direction on how to advance this work further.  The main elements for discussion are reform of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, the proposed new budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness for the euro area to be provided for in the new MFF, and banking union.  On Friday, we will also meet in Article 50 format to discuss Brexit.  It is likely that, by then, we will know the outcome of the UK election and its potential implications for ratification of the withdrawal agreement.  I will urge the European Council to call on the Commission to propose a comprehensive mandate for the negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship.  We need to demonstrate our ambition to have as close and broad as possible a relationship with the UK in the future.  The joint political declaration agreed between the EU and the UK provides a negotiating mandate for this next phase.  We need to be ready to begin negotiating the future relationship with the UK as soon as it is ready.  It is good to see that Michel Barnier will continue to act as the EU's chief negotiator during this phase.  It is also essential that the task force maintains close engagement and co-operation with the other EU institutional actors, as it has done to date.<\/p>  <p>  Commissioner Hogan, as Trade Commissioner, will also have a leading role.<\/p> <p>The European Council in particular will continue to follow the negotiations closely and provide political direction as necessary.<\/p> <p> Ireland has always said we want the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, trade, security and political.  It is also vital to our economic interests that the Single Market is protected and the level playing field provisions that underpin that close relationship continue.  In the coming weeks our focus will be on ensuring the timely ratification of the withdrawal agreement because so much depends on an orderly withdrawal.  We will continue to expect the UK to ensure the agreement's faithful implementation.  In his statement later, the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, will comment on external relations issues expected to arise at the European Council.  For my part, I look forward to engaging with my EU colleagues collectively and bilaterally and welcoming and congratulating the new Finnish Prime Minister on her election.  I will of course report back to the House next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100025#X01200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576073700,"counter":434,"content":"<p>This week's Council meeting is not due to involve any major action on the range of short- and long-term issues of concern to the European Union as a whole.  This is disappointing given that this is the moment when the leadership of the Union has been transferred to new hands for the next five years.  Fianna F&aacute;il wishes the new Presidents of the Council and the Commission well in their work.  We understand that the transition to a new Commission has been delayed but we hope the new year will see a clearer picture of what they are proposing in terms of reform and action on urgent priorities.<\/p>  <p>  Over quite a few years my party has sought a much deeper engagement with European Union reform in the D&aacute;il and in public debate.  We have been very specific in setting out an approach which would lead Ireland to become a leader in reform and a country which understands that either critical weaknesses need to be addressed or Europe will continue in a cycle of division and crises.  Unfortunately, the Government's approach has been very different, and it appears now to be Fine Gael's policy to try to import ridiculous rhetoric and political attacks from elsewhere into our politics.<\/p>  <p>  The year 2020 is likely to be defining in the future of the European Union.  There will be decisions about the future of the budget, relations with the United Kingdom, enforcement of fundamental democratic values within the Union, the ability to fight economic downturns, the capacity of critical elements of monetary union and Europe's place in a world of increasing attacks on free democracy.  We believe it is long since time for Ireland to contribute in a meaningful way to these debates and to put aside the complacent and at times damaging strategy of the Government.  While the anti-Europeans of the left and the right like to blame the European Union for as much as possible, what they never admit is that the Union has repeatedly been denied the capacity to help regions and countries when they are most in need.  A budget which is limited to at or below 1% of combined national incomes is simply not credible as a force for shared growth and prosperity.  In fact, this incredibly low figure forces the Union into zero-sum fights which are destructive and which alienate many communities.<\/p>  <p>  In the discussions about the multi-annual financial framework we are basically discussing whether or not the European Union will be allowed to do the work for which it has been given responsibility.  However, because of the position of some states, including, unfortunately, our Government, we see different camps arguing about programmes which are each fundamental.  In particular, support for rural communities and farm families should not be under this scale of pressure, and it is surprising that the Government does not appear to see the link between the fights on the Common Agricultural Policy and cohesion funding and its own position of opposing an increased budget.  Similarly, there is simply no way that the vital objectives set for the Union in the areas of innovation and climate can be met by the budget as proposed.<\/p>  <p>  Related to this is the issue of creating a new fiscal capacity in the eurozone to assist countries and regions at times of serious pressure.  President Macron's proposal in this regard was proportionate and reflected one of the core lessons as to why the financial crisis became a deep economic crisis in much of the eurozone.  Ireland's position as part of the core group which frustrated and finally effectively neutered the new eurozone fund was a disgrace.  The House will remember that when this was revealed, the Taoiseach first claimed not to have read the article which exposed Ireland's position, using his now typical line of denying media reports even when they turn out to be true.  Ireland's position is self-defeating.  Yes, we will have to pay more to the Union if its budget increases, but we will benefit many times over from the extra stability and new growth opportunities which more soundly based financing of the European Union and the eurozone would bring.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Brexit, while we cannot predict the outcome of tomorrow's election, the indications are that the ratification of the withdrawal agreement Bill will proceed to a conclusion in the next six weeks.  At that point Brexit will not, irrespective of the industrially promoted slogan to the contrary, be done; it will be very far from done.  The most fundamental issue of all, the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, will begin to be negotiated in substance.  The political declaration about the future relationships currently proposes what is for Ireland roughly the worst possible outcome.  It is a hard Brexit whereby the United Kingdom seeks both to conclude a free trade agreement with the European Union and to be free then to lower standards and have different relations with the rest of the world.  In other words, both trading and broader social and economic relations between the United Kingdom and Europe will under every conceivable outcome be less free and subject to more barriers.  The United Kingdom is seeking to maximise access but minimise the ability of the European Union to use established procedures to guarantee free and fair competition.  This contradiction has not even begun to be reconciled.  Given the nature of the Conservative Party's campaign and the details of its position, something close to a crash-out remains a possibility at the end of next year.  Ireland dodged an enormous bullet earlier this year when a crash-out Brexit was avoided at a time when we were manifestly not ready for it.  For example, we had extra customs bays in Dublin Port but did not have the staff to man them.  Clearly, we must keep showing urgency in preparations.  We must finally reach the stage at which we should have been many months ago, with all businesses having the requisite registrations and a move from general information to specific and practical action to support them as they seek to protect or replace business in the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Northern Ireland, the leaked Treasury report published by the British Labour Party last week and confirmed by other reporting suggests that the withdrawal agreement threatens major economic damage unless serious mitigation is provided.  The fact that Northern Ireland has been denied a voice in the Brexit debate because its democratic institutions were collapsed by Sinn F&eacute;in based on a controversy about a heating scheme has already caused immense damage.  The new 13 January deadline appears to be concentrating minds, and it is hoped democracy will be restored - not before time and to the credit of no one involved.  If it is, there is no time to waste in getting to work on both limiting the damage of Brexit and taking advantage of the special economic status which Northern Ireland is likely to have following 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union also faces a serious challenge to its core principles of the rule of law and fair democracies.  This comes from both within and outside the Union.  When governments take over their judiciaries, exercise extreme partisan control of the media, attack civil society and deny basic accountability, they explicitly step away from the core principles on which they were admitted to the Union and which are in its treaties.  These are values and laws which they agreed to and which were ratified by their populations in free referendums.  There cannot be a backing off from this.  The European values which are under threat are threatened by governments which embrace the idea of tight control of their peoples and a growing illiberalism.  Any attempt to step away from the priority given to this issue by the previous leadership of the Council and the Commission should be opposed by Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Equally, Ireland needs to stand with Ukraine as it continues to endure the invasion and partition imposed on it by an authoritarian neighbour.  What would it say to countries such as the European Union's Baltic members if Europe allowed Ukraine to be dismembered and undermined like this?<\/p>  <p>  We also need the European Union to understand that business as usual with Israel is becoming increasingly unacceptable.  Prime Minister Netanyahu has, despite what the T&aacute;naiste told us, become more extreme and is proposing annexations which would permanently deny Palestinians statehood.  The Taoiseach has yet again said he will continue blocking the Bill on trade with illegal settlements because it is an EU competency.<\/p> <p>I remind the Taoiseach that there is no evidence of him or the T&aacute;naiste proposing at EU level that this legislation should be allowed or adopted by the European Union as a whole.  How far does Prime Minister Netanyahu have to go before we in this House will take substantive action?  This week's summit will be overshadowed by the British election.  Irrespective of what happens in that election, the fundamental structure of United Kingdom-European Union relations must be addressed and the need to reform and support the working of the European Union will remain as urgent as ever.  Given the scale and importance of the issues involved, it is long since time for Ireland to start playing a constructive and proactive role in these debates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100026#Y00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576074300,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I was not sure if Brexit would be formally discussed at the European Council meeting until I heard the Taoiseach's speech.  We would all accept that Brexit casts a long shadow.  Polls in the Westminster election will close at 10 p.m. tomorrow and we should get the first exit polls shortly after that.  This will occur during the European Council meeting.  I am sure that the Taoiseach and all the other Heads of State and Government will be eagerly following these developments closely.  I want, first and foremost, to wish all the Sinn F&eacute;in candidates well.  We won a historic seven seats in the 2017 elections and we hope that we can retain these seats and even gain one more.<\/p>  <p>  I note that the Taoiseach has endorsed a candidate that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was canvassing for at the weekend in Derry.  The Taoiseach indicated his support for more Irish MPs in Westminster rather than here in the D&aacute;il, which I find bizarre coming from an Irish Taoiseach.  The electorate in the North will have their own say tomorrow.  I want to put on record my concern regarding the hate campaign that was waged against John Finucane.  This was organised loyalist intimidation.  It is wrong, dangerous and needs to be condemned.  This election is about the toxic Tory-DUP Brexit agenda and their disastrous cuts to public services.  Since the referendum, Sinn F&eacute;in has worked with the other pro-remain parties to send a clear message to the British Government, the EU, the Irish Government and the US, that the DUP does not speak for everyone in the North.  Sinn F&eacute;in has stood up for the majority who voted to reject Brexit.  Westminster is undoubtedly a house of dysfunction and farce.  It is increasingly clear that Irish interests will never really be taken seriously there.  Those who argue for any self-respecting Irish democrat to insert themselves into that mayhem are stretching the boundaries of political sense and reality.<\/p>  <p>  Since the referendum and the ideological crusade on which the Tories and the DUP have embarked, we have consistently said there is no such thing as a good Brexit.  All parties here have worked to secure unique arrangements for the North to offer some protection for the economy, to avoid any hardening of the Border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement.  We have never said these arrangements are perfect.  It imposes an EU exit for the North against the express wishes of the people there, but I am confident that the agreement will ensure that there is no hard border on the island of Ireland.  We believe that partition has failed and the only complete solution is Irish unity.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever transpires after the election in Britain, significant and ongoing challenges will face us.  I note that the T&aacute;naiste felt the need to tell journalists this week after the EU Foreign Affairs Council that there is little chance that future relationship deal between the EU and Britain could be hammered out before the end of December 2020.  The T&aacute;naiste is correct.  This will be a difficult negotiation.  The rhetoric from Boris Johnson that everything can be wrapped up by December 2020 is a dangerous attempt to fool the British public.  Ireland's interests in any future trading relationship will have to promoted and protected.  We must strategise for east-west trade to ensure we get the best economic and political outcomes for our island.  We must ensure that there is never any barrier to trade and movement on this island.  Ultimately, we need to start planning for Irish unity.  The Taoiseach should start this process without delay.  The Irish people and civil society are far ahead of the Government on this issue.  We need to make up for lost time.  If a Sinn F&eacute;in Government is returned after the quickly approaching general election in this State, we will do just that.  It should be a core priority of any future Government.  It is now clear the British Government is involved in an increased and sustained move to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.  The example of the DeSouza judgment demonstrates that.  This cannot be tolerated.  The Government must be proactive and staunch in defending our peace agreements and the hard won rights of Irish citizens.<\/p>  <p>  This European Council meeting will also focus on climate change.  Ireland's record to date regarding climate has been awful.  The Environmental Protection Agency published a report in October that revealed this State exceeded its carbon emissions budget by 5 million tonnes in 2018, and is moving further from its climate commitments.  It was the second year in a row that we missed our targets.  This shows a systemic political failure to take climate change seriously.  We need a paradigm shift in State investment in public transport.  We should be leaders in the fight to reduce carbon emissions and to mitigate climate change.  We should be heading to this meeting with clear and positive results on our climate targets after undertaking significant change.  Instead, the Taoiseach will go there as the head of a Government that continually fails to meet its own and international targets.  The Government continues to sell off our public transport network and to neglect investment in new rail lines, particularly outside Dublin where they are most needed.  The Government's agricultural policy shift in 2015 to encourage more dairy and milk production has added to emissions.  Under the Government's watch, afforestation is also missing its targets and has been falling since 2016.  The sole response by the Government is to introduce a regressive carbon tax, even though the alternatives are simply not there.  It is time for the Taoiseach to wake up and get serious.  Targets for 2050 and beyond are no good.  We need to ensure that transformative and ambitious targets for 2025 and 2030 are put in place and met in Ireland and across the EU.<\/p>  <p>  I encourage the Taoiseach to raise issues facing the Palestinian people at this European Council meeting.  Israel continues to completely ignore international law, build illegal colonial settlements in Palestine, and continues to implement an apartheid regime in Palestine.  Words of condemnation are not enough and action is needed.  On this week five years ago the, D&aacute;il unanimously passed a Sinn F&eacute;in motion calling on the Government to recognise the state of Palestine.  Successive Fine Gael-led Governments have ignored this democratic demand from the D&aacute;il and from the Seanad.  Other EU countries, such as Sweden, have taken this step in recent years, yet again this Government continues to sit on its hands.<\/p>  <p>  This European Council also needs to discuss the current situation in Malta.  There have been huge protests in Malta in recent weeks against the Government of Joseph Muscat.  This is because of mounting concerns surrounding the alleged involvement of his former chief of staff and other employees of the office of the Prime Minister in the murder and its subsequent cover-up of the investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.  She was investigating corruption that went to the heart of the Government before she was assassinated.  Her family said the Prime Minister had been left deeply compromised and should resign because he had failed to take action to clean up politics in Malta.  They argued that as long as he remained in place, a full investigation into her death was not possible.  A European Parliament delegation visited Malta last week and offered scathing criticism of the Maltese Government's handling of the situation.  It declared that trust had been severely damaged.  This issue must be discussed at the European Council meeting.  I urge the Taoiseach and his officials to address the issue formally and also informally outside meetings.  It continues to be a blight on Europe and needs to be addressed in a formal way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100027#Z00200","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1576074300,"counter":437,"content":"<p>We have these debates because all parties looked at how we dealt with European issues after the rejection of a number of European treaties.  To make the work of the European Council more relevant, we wanted to have a debate in this House in advance of Council meetings and for the Taoiseach to come back to report after Council meetings.<\/p> <p>The level of attendance at this debate and the fact that a single Minister of State is here is not in keeping with the seriousness of European issues and how they impact us.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, but it is an indication of the Government's perspective.  The Government should be listening to each of the contributions made in advance of the European Council meeting.  The views of Parliament should be reflected at the Council, or at least be heard by the Government in advance of its meeting.<\/p> <p> The purpose of the meeting being held tomorrow and Friday is to discuss climate change, the multiannual financial framework, external relations, economic and monetary union and Brexit.  The issue of Brexit has wisely been left until Friday, as the results of tomorrow's UK election will represent a decisive moment of choice in what happens next.  If Boris Johnson wins a majority tomorrow, the latest withdrawal agreement will be ratified before the end of January and the UK will effectively leave the European Union.  If Jeremy Corbyn becomes Prime Minister tomorrow, he will seek to renegotiate the deal and put it to a new people's vote before June of next year.  Boris Johnson has made it clear that he intends to take the UK far from European norms and to trade with the European Union on a similar basis to Canada.  The Conservative Party has become the de facto Brexit party under Boris Johnson.  It is pursuing a fantasy of global trade despite evidence to the contrary, such as the Trump administration's recent treatment of its ally Brazil.<\/p> <p> The British Labour Party will seek to preserve jobs, workers' rights and environmental protections to a much greater extent and it will seek to remain in a customs union with the European Union to facilitate trade in goods.  Many in the British Labour Party will campaign to remain in any referendum to confirm a new deal.  I will not speculate on the opinion polls and potential results of tomorrow's UK election, but a UK Government led by the British Labour Party would be far better for Ireland because only the British Labour Party is committed to retaining that level of close alignment with the European Union.  My colleagues have met with representatives of British manufacturing who predict that the UK could lose its entire motor industry because of Brexit, even if it secures a trade deal.  That is because modern manufacturing in Europe is international.  Materials and components are sourced from across Europe and it is only possible to have a seamless supply line if one remains within the ambit of the European Union.  The manufacturing industry has regular meetings with the British Labour Party, but not with the Conservative Party, as only the British Labour Party is willing to discuss seriously the impact of such matters on industrial policy.<\/p> <p> If Boris Johnson secures a majority and passes the withdrawal agreement, we face the risk of a no-deal exit by the UK at the end of next year.  It is highly unlikely that the UK will conclude a trade deal in that timeframe and it remains to be seen whether Boris Johnson is prepared to back down on his often-stated claim that he will seek no further extension beyond December 2020.  If the political situation in Britain is still volatile, he may prefer to take the plunge rather than prolong the inevitable tension with Brexiteer supporters.  The end of 2020 will be a cliff edge for Ireland, as the economic and political effects of Brexit will be much worse in the event of a no-deal scenario.  Even if the balance of power in the UK Parliament does not change much after this election, it is important to remember that the Conservative Party has purged many pro-EU moderates from its ranks and thus the Conservative MPs elected tomorrow are more likely to take a hardline pro-Brexit stance, regardless of the consequences to their country.  I urge the Government to continue to plan for a no-deal Brexit as it is now a real possibility that the next UK Parliament will not have the numbers or capacity to prevent it.<\/p> <p> Heads of government are also set to discuss the EU's climate strategy and a target of climate neutrality by 2050 at the European Council meeting.  The Taoiseach should push for greater ambition at European level than the Government has demonstrated to date in our domestic planning.  Given the votes of Fine Gael and its European People's Party, EPP, allies in the European Parliament, it is very much up to the Government to prove its climate action credentials, regardless of what the Taoiseach said today.  I hope the multiannual financial framework will include a significant allocation of funding for climate action. <\/p> <p> It was suggested before the last European election that the EU would provide funding to support member states to build more housing.  I hope the Government is still pursuing that proposal.<\/p> <p> Regarding international relations, a range of external issues require greater attention and focus from Europe.  The Taoiseach should join others in pushing for the beginning of accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia.  With the UK leaving the EU, it is vitally important that we continue to show the vitality and attractiveness of the European project and its values.  We also have to fill a void where both Russia and China have been heavily investing in the Balkans to undermine European influence in the region.  We would be foolish not to have regard to that.  The Government should also push hard for greater resources to assist migrants and asylum seekers making the hazardous journey across the Mediterranean to Europe.<\/p> <p> In relation to the EU's economic and monetary policies, there is evidence that some governments and central banks around the world are prepared to allow further deregulation of the banking and financial sector, partially in response to the current tensions in US trading relations, including with Europe.  An enormous quantity of money, which is growing exponentially beyond many people's comprehension, passes through banks and financial institutions in Ireland.  Does our Central Bank have sufficient capacity to ensure that money is properly overseen and is legitimate?  There have been enormous investments in Cyprus and Malta and many questions have been raised about the sources of that money.  While the proportion of foreign money in Ireland is smaller as part of the overall financial sector, the quantity is of a similar scale to that in Cyprus or Malta.  We have to be able to give reassurances that all the money coming through our banking system is legitimate.  Any deregulation of banking and finance at European level should be avoided and the Taoiseach should resist any attempts to do so.  Christine Lagarde has signalled that she wants the European Central Bank to play a greater role in climate action, which the Taoiseach should strongly support.  Much could be said about European economic policy and perhaps the Government could facilitate statements on that as part of a separate debate in this House.  Major decisions are being taken about the direction of travel over the next five years, which we need to debate in more detail.<\/p> <p> The greatest threat to our economy remains Boris Johnson and the cavalier way in which he is prepared to treat Ireland's concerns about Brexit.  Given that the British Labour Party is committed to a much closer relationship between the UK and the European Union into the future, I sincerely hope it is successful in tomorrow's election, as that would be in Ireland's interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100027#Z00300","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576074900,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I will focus on the matter of climate change in the context of COP25, which is taking place in Madrid currently, as well as the plan launched by the European Commission today which will be discussed by the European Council over the coming days.<\/p> <p>COP25 and the European Council and European Commission discussions take place in the shadow of a quite incredible article that appeared in <i>Nature<\/i>a few weeks ago.  As the Minister of State will be aware, <i>Nature<\/i>is one of the two most prestigious science journals we have.  It is not in its style to have scary headlines that exaggerate things.  It is a scientific journal.  In that context, a comment piece written by a number of scientists with the headline, &quot;Climate tipping points - too risky to bet against&quot;, is something that everybody with an interest in the environment should read and act on.  The fundamental point made by the authors is that:<\/p><blockquote>\tIf current national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are implemented - and that's a big 'if'- they are likely to result in at least 3<sup>o<\/sup>C of global warming.  This is despite the goal of the 2015 Paris agreement to limit warming to well below 2<sup>o<\/sup>C.  Some economists assuming that climate tipping points are of very low probability (even if they would be catastrophic), have suggested that 3<sup>o<\/sup>C warming is optimal from a cost-benefit perspective. However, if tipping points are looking more likely, then the 'optimal policy' recommendation of simple cost-benefit climate-economy models aligns with those of the recent IPCC report.  In other words, warming must be limited to 1.5<sup>o<\/sup>C.  This requires an emergency response.   <\/blockquote> <p>The authors go on to list a series of tipping points they argue we are very close to.  The report states that rate of melting of ice indicates that at 2<sup>o<\/sup>C, the Arctic region has a 10% to 35% chance of becoming largely ice-free in summer.  It goes on to talk about the tipping points that we have reached, including mass coral bleaching.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\tA staggering 99% of tropical corals are projected to be lost if global average temperature rises by 2<sup>o<\/sup>C, owing to interactions between warming, ocean acidification and pollution.  This would represent a profound toss of marine biodiversity and human livelihoods. <\/blockquote> <p>The article then refers to deforestation, stating:<\/p><blockquote>\tDeforestation and climate change are destabilizing the Amazon - the world's largest rainforest ... Estimates of where an Amazon tipping point could lie range from 40% deforestation to just 20% forest-cover loss.  About 17% has been lost since 1970 ... The world's remaining emissions budget for a 50:50 chance of staying within 1.5<sup>o<\/sup>C of warming is only about 500 gigatonnes (Gt) of C0<sub>2<\/sub>. Permafrost emissions could take an estimated 20% (100 Gt C0<sub>2<\/sub>) off this budget ... If forests are close to tipping points, Amazon dieback could release ] a further amount of almost 20% and boreal forests a further amount of over 20%.]  <\/blockquote> <p>We can, therefore, see that all of the budget could be used up very quickly in these tipping points we hit and the kind of feedback loops that respond.  The authors conclude that:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn our view, the evidence from tipping points alone suggests that we are in a state of planetary emergency: both the risk and urgency of the situation are acute (see 'Emergency: do the maths').  We argue that the intervention time left to prevent tipping could already have shrunk towards zero, whereas the reaction time to achieve net zero emissions is 30 years at best.  Hence we might already have lost control of whether tipping happens.  A saving grace is that the rate at which damage accumulates from tipping - and hence the risk posed  could still be under our control to some extent.  The stability and resilience of our planet is in peril.  International action - not just words - must reflect this. <\/blockquote> <p>This reflects a growing scientific consensus on the science and a sense that scientists have a duty to speak and demand action because they cannot simply sit there and analyse the world as we head for catastrophic climate change.  <br\/><br\/>The contrast between the science and the words and demands of the protesters and people such as Greta Thunberg to do what the science demands and the reality of the action, or inaction, of politicians is so striking.  COP25 is taking place at the moment in Madrid.  It takes place in the context of the US preparing to withdraw, although it is still present.  What is being discussed is, again, completely inadequate relative to the scale of the emergency and the scale of the task before us.  The focal point of the discussions is on carbon markets accepting that there are problems in carbon markets, for example, allowing a power plant in Germany to buy credits for emissions savings from a wind farm in India.  Their answer to fixing the problems that exist in carbon markets and a focus on carbon markets is simply to regulate those markets as opposed to recognising the reality that having a price on carbon and having a carbon market will not resolve the problem and get us the very rapid just transition towards the net zero carbon economy we need.  It simply will not do this.  Instead we will just have a situation where Ireland is paying in excess of &euro;100 million - it has paid &euro;121 million to date - purchasing carbon credits to comply with its targets.  This basically means that Ireland is polluting and creating greenhouse gas emissions and paying money to others to justify that.  <br\/><br\/>The European Commission is now using the language of a green new deal, which is quite scandalous.  It is a greenwashing its own policy - attempting to make it look far more radical than it is.  In reality, the Commission is talking about a 2050 target for net zero emissions, which is completely inadequate.  In the developed world, we need to go for net zero emissions by 2030.  The range of prescriptions the Commission has all remain in the framework of the capitalist market, allowing these corporations to make the decisions about what they do with their production to maximise profit.  That is a recipe for continuing to toboggan towards climate disaster.  The only way to transition rapidly is an unprecedented change in the nature of an economy that must happen at a global level in an unprecedentedly short time.  The comparison would be to the US economy being retooled to war production in the run up to World War II.  That was not done on the basis of incentivising the private market.  It was done based on the State intervening.  On a global basis, this is what must be at the centre of a real and radical green new deal - a green new deal with socialist policies.  It is the idea that fundamentally we need economic planning that has the environment and ecology at its core and that requires public ownership and democratic planning on as wide a basis as possible.  <br\/><br\/>There are positives in this situation - 500,000 people out on the streets in Madrid with Greta Thunberg leading them.  She made interesting comments the other day when she said that the school students' strikes on climate change have achieved nothing because of the fact that greenhouse gas emissions have increased by approximately 4% since 2015.  However, they have achieved something.  They have raised awareness internationally, shifted consciousness on the question of the environment and put politicians under substantial pressure but it does point to the need to do more.  In particular, one of the positive developments of the school strikes is the popularisation of the idea of strikes - the idea of people withdrawing from school, college or work.  It places on the agenda for the trade union movement the need to build for serious action on climate change, ultimately, including strike action on climate change to demand action, a just transition and the protection of the interests of workers.  It is positive that Extinction Rebellion in Ireland has taken the initiative to try to bring together a broad coalition for a substantial march, probably scheduled in March 2020, calling for climate action now.  It has brought together different sections of the trade union movement, civil society, etc., which is an important step forward in terms of broadening the environmental movement to ensure we can build for the kind of action we need to demand the change we need, which will not come just from asking the establishment politicians we have or those at COP25 nicely.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100028#AA00200","speaker":"1433","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576076100,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I will also speak about climate change.  On one hand, it appears that we are finally realising the urgency of the effects of climate change but on the other hand, the actions we are taking are not matching that realisation.  The European Council will focus on a particular target of achieving climate neutrality by 2050.  That is vital because the past 20 years have included 18 of the warmest years on record.  There are also heatwaves, forest fires, floods, a rise in global temperatures and the devastating effects those things are having on nature.  There was a story in the newspapers last week about a village in Russia that was trying to feed polar bears that are underweight.   A global response is needed and the EU has a major role to play in that.<\/p>  <p>  Another aspect that must be looked at in the context of this discussion is the principle of climate justice to which the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, committed in the D&aacute;il.  I refer to the work of Dr. Lorna Gold from Tr&oacute;caire who speaks of the need to go to war against pernicious enemies.  She has said, about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts, that the war on emissions means a war on everything that we have come to associate with a modern, successful life.  Rising wealth equals a rising ecological footprint and rising emissions because we live in a high-carbon economy in which 10% of emitters contribute 50% of global emissions.  The point is that the richer one is, the more one emits.  Some 90% of those producing less than half of all global emissions are living in varying degrees of poverty.  There is a double injustice of climate change and poverty, and climate change drives both poverty and displacement.<\/p>  <p>  Even though it is four years since the signing of the Paris Agreement, we are not winning the war on tackling climate change.  Scientists remind us that we have 11 years to cut our emissions in half.  We also have 11 years to realise the UN's sustainable development goals and not making real inroads on climate change will undermine those goals.  Those goals are voluntary and not legally binding, but they are morally binding.<\/p>  <p>  I will look at sustainable development goal No. 14 on the UN's list, which relates to life below water.  The targets within that goal relate to reducing marine pollution, the ecosystem, coastal and marine areas and sustainable fishing.  It was positive to hear at the Parliamentarians for Global Action, PGA, forum recently the number of treaties that Ireland has signed in this area, including the Cape Town Agreement, the Agreement on Port State Measures and the International Labour Organization's work on fishing.  The UN plans for a treaty to protect the high seas because they are home to a vast array of species that help to support life on earth.  Tiny marine plants of the high seas produce half the earth's oxygen and yet less than 1% of the high seas are protected according to a recent report on the extent of pollution in seas and oceans.  I hope that issue will be a part of the EU debate. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, climate justice needs a legal basis.  That leads me to a statement that was made by the EU ambassador to the African Union following a study suggesting that a core group of the world's poorest nations have received less than 10% of EU aid in spite of the fact that the EU is the world's largest donor, contributing &euro;72 billion in 2018.  We know that private investment is being actively pursued but it must be accompanied by mandatory human rights due diligence in order that workers are protected from exploitation.  Ireland could lead by example, as we have with untied aid, and our national plan on business and human rights needs more weight.  Corporate HR abuses include evictions, displacement, dangerous work conditions and poor wages, which affect women and indigenous communities the most.  We know about the assassination and torture of human rights defenders, not to mention tax avoidance and evasion.  Stronger regulation is needed and that means a legal framework.  I see that human rights abusers will face asset freezes and a travel ban under the EU, as agreed by the foreign ministers on Monday, and that is a positive step.  All these things are connected.  Climate change, business, investment and human rights due diligence are related.<\/p>  <p>  Certain countries in Europe owe a vast debt to the people of Libya because of the destruction and devastation that was caused in the rush to overthrow Colonel Gaddafi.  Oil was a factor then and a gas line is a factor now.  The Libyan warlord, Khalifa Haftar, backed by mercenaries, is ready to do battle for Tripoli.  The EU and UN backed the Government of National Accord, which is now looking for help.  Will that come up at the Council meeting?<\/p>  <p>  A case has been taken by The Gambia in the International Court of Justice for the UN to recognise the genocide against the Rohingya which began in 2017.  The debate on the nationality of the Rohingya, whether they are Burmese or Bengali, does not take from the fact of how they have been treated in Myanmar.  There has been sexual violence, rape, the burning of homes, destruction of land and the Rohingya have been forced to flee their homes.  Even if there were attacks by so-called Rohingya militants, it does not excuse or condone what is being done to the Rohingya people, in spite of what Aung San Suu Kyi is now saying at the International Court of Justice.  Those 700,000 people would not have fled their homes unless there was a reason to do so.<\/p>  <p>  While climate change and budgets are on the agenda, I hope the human rights issues I have raised will also be considered at the Council meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100030#CC00100","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1576076100,"counter":442,"content":"<p>A central item on the agenda for tomorrow and Friday is the next multi-annual financial framework, MFF, for 2021 to 2027, which was published in May.  This next budget for the European Union comes at a period of great change and massive challenges posed by major migration into the Union, climate change, to which my colleagues have alluded, and coping with Brexit in Ireland's case.  We are all hoping that tomorrow's election in the UK will yield a result that will not keep us in the intolerable Brexit struggle and that, towards the end of 2020, we will not be facing another cliff edge.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State knows, Ireland's net contributions to the European budget have been steadily increasing and we have been a net contributor for the past six years.  We must be careful that our budget contributions do not replace national debt interest as a considerable burden on our national budget, year in and year out.  The UK will contribute to the EU budget until at least the end of 2020, depending on tomorrow's result.<\/p>  <p>  A few weeks ago, the Minister for State forecast that our budget contributions would rise to just under &euro;3 billion in 2020, &euro;3.2 billion until 2022 and up to approximately &euro;3.5 billion by 2023.  Of course, these projections are based on a number of contingencies, including the performance of our own gross national income, GNI, and whatever budget is agreed at meetings such as the one happening today.  <\/p>  <p>  More important than keeping a close eye on the overall budget for the Taoiseach and our Ministers is the necessity to make changes and amendments to the fiscal rules in the Stability and Growth Pact.  This framework of budgetary discipline has evolved significantly over the past 20 years but we know from meetings of the finance and budgetary oversight committees and so on that there are elements to the fiscal rules that are almost like a straitjacket for our country and which need to be amended and changed.  The five-year review of the six pack and two pack rules that are part of the fiscal rules was due to be published by the end of the year and I wonder whether we have got our hands on that yet to be able to see what is being proposed.  Have the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance made submissions to the review on behalf of Ireland?  There are many elements of the Stability and Growth Pact which do not suit our economy and budgetary strategy.  We need those amended and to wriggle out of the straitjacket.  The Germans have been apologising to us for the suffering we underwent in the austerity years but in actual fact, the overall system that they have implemented on budgetary rules is not appropriate for our country.<\/p>  <p>  We also have the European Fiscal Board's assessment of the fiscal rules, which were discussed at the September meeting of ECOFIN.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance should be clearly articulating Ireland's dissatisfaction with the way the fiscal rules have operated and making proposals for reform.<\/p>  <p>  We earlier learned that members of the eurozone were being asked to devise a budget for the eurozone, which will also have a major impact.  That was to be a part of the overall MFF and there is talk about a budgetary instrument for competitiveness and convergence, contributions on which are open to all members, and candidate members, of the eurozone.  Will this be something that will come up at the Council meeting today and tomorrow in the context of negotiations for the MFF?  It was reported that the general principles underpinning this budgetary instrument had been agreed but it will have a major impact on our budgetary strategy.  It is something else about which the Taoiseach needs to report to us.<\/p>  <p>  The other element on the financial side of the Council agenda is technical work on strengthening the banking union.  It must be said, as Ms Christine Lagarde takes over as President of the European Central Bank, ECB, that it has failed to achieve appropriate goals, particularly in respect of employment, growth and inflation, and giving the necessary stimulus to the European economy in 2019 and from 2020 onwards.<\/p> <p>The ECB is not accountable directly to the Council but it is accountable to the European Parliament and to this House.  It is an area the Taoiseach should be raising.  He should be asking for a more dynamic European Central Bank to help our economy and those of the other 27 member states, or 26, as may be shortly the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100030#CC00200","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576076700,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on this issue this afternoon.  As I understand it, and in line with its June conclusions, the European Council will return to the issue of climate change with the aim of finalising its guidance for the adoption and submission of the EU's long-term strategy and focusing in particular on the target of achieving climate neutrality by 2050.  I ask the Minister of State for more detail on what exactly this proposed climate neutrality would look like, especially the implications it will have for the Irish agriculture sector and the beef and dairy sectors.  These are important questions.  Many farm families are aghast at what may be coming down the tracks and are very uncertain about their future.  As the Minister of State is aware, farm families are a vital part of our rural economy.<\/p><p>When Mick Wallace, who has gone to greener pastures in Europe, was a Member of this House he spoke about climate neutrality on one occasion and our meat and dairy herds.  He stated: &quot;The meat and dairy herds are to Ireland what the coal industry is to Poland and the fracking gas industry is to the United States, namely, a short-sighted cash generator, the expansion of which is undermining the chances of survival of the planet and the people of the global south and in less than a generation the people of the global north.&quot;  How can anyone take this stuff seriously?  I am worried, as are many people, about the role the Minister is taking in respect of such statements and issues at EU level.  Apparently, the EU agrees with Mick Wallace.  By insisting that we all move to carbon neutrality the EU is giving the appearance that Irish farmers are not doing their bit in this area.  I believe they are grappling to do a great deal in the teeth of huge numbers of imports of beef, pork and other commodities not only from across Europe but from Mercosur countries also.  They are scared stiff.  We saw them on the streets of Dublin this day two weeks ago.  They had to come to Dublin to protest because they were not being listened to by the Minister of State's Government.  Meat Industry Ireland, MII, is trying to crush them into the ground and the Minister, Deputy Creed, simply rubs his hands and sets up a task force that is toothless, useless and fruitless.  It is headed up by a retired Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who was in place when all the regulations that are now crippling the farmers were introduced.  I refer to the 30-month rule.  All the advantages for the factories and the meat producers were put in place by that man.  I have nothing against him personally but he could not be envisaged in any way as being an independent chairperson.  We needed someone who knew nothing about farming or the meat industry to chair this openly and honestly with a view to levelling the playing field, but that did not happen.<\/p><p>As I said, the EU seems to agree with what Mick Wallace said.  That is despite the fact that the European Commission Joint Research Centre report found that Ireland was the most carbon efficient beef producer in the European Union per unit of dairy silage production and the fifth most carbon efficient producer of beef per kilogram.  We are not saying that.  The European Commission Joint Research Centre found these figures, which I will repeat.  Per unit of dairy production, Ireland was the best and we are the fifth most carbon efficient producer of beef per kilogram, so what is all this talk about?  Why are we scaremongering and accepting this <i>carte blanche<\/i>attitude?  Why are we not defending our right?  A great deal of effort has gone into the agricultural industry to keep it green and to ensure traceability from the farm to the fork.  It is welcome to have that recognition at EU level.<\/p><p>We are concerned about the policy position or guidance the Minister will be giving to the EU when it comes to outlining the ways in which we can approach carbon neutrality by 2050.  There are many questions to be asked, and many concerns.  We have the campaign to elect a new IFA president.  I hope the Tipperary candidate, Tim Cullinan, is successful.  The other farm organisations are concerned about the measures the Minister will bring to the table.  Is he quoting these figures to them?  I hope he is because we are top of the class as regards carbon efficiency and the fifth most carbon efficient producer of beef per kilogram.  Those are significant facts from the European Commission that I hope are independent.  We must maintain that and protect our important agriculture industry.  I have lived through three recessions and it was agriculture industry that brought a recovery to our economy.  The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, should know that as he comes from a rural constituency.  <\/p><p>I want to know the policy position and what the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will be saying to our farmers.  I am disappointed they are not in the Chamber, although the Taoiseach was here earlier.  What clear message will they be giving to our farmers?  Will the Minister and the Government be agreeing with the assessment of Deputy Wallace - I certainly hope not - that the national herd is a threat to the survival of the planet when we have those independent assessments?  Apart from the EU, we might need more independent people to come from abroad to prove those figures are correct.  We will take our medicine when we have to but when we have those standards recognised through the European Commission, which represents the 27 member states, why should we not defend them with gusto and pride, albeit having interest in and concern about climate change?  Of course, we have to deal with that issue but we must stand our ground as regards our valuable national herd, of which dairy is the most important part, with beef exports second and pigmeat exports third.<\/p><p>The Acting Chairman might allow me to digress briefly.  I have raised very serious concerns about shipments of pork coming here from areas close to where African swine fever is raging.  I have serious questions about checks at ports and airports.  They are non-existent.  I understand they are closed from 6 p.m. to 9 a.m.  We are sleepwalking into something that could be as catastrophic as foot and mouth disease.  The pig industry was on its knees for 30 years.  Thankfully, due to issues in Poland and other countries, it is doing well now but MII and the meat industry bringing in shipments from these areas adjacent to an outbreak of swine 'flu, which wiped out herds of pigs, is reckless.  Are we sleepwalking in that regard?  What is the Department doing?  Farmers are persecuted every day with the burden of regulation.  Many pig farmers living in rural areas have contacted me about this issue.  They have been engaged in the pigmeat industry for a long time and have given great employment but they cannot get assurances about this and they are extremely concerned.  We cannot even get an answer from the Taoiseach.  He said he would pass the question to the Minister, Deputy Creed.  It is a matter of great concern that such shipments would come into this country, and that the country could face that risk through one meat product overnight.  Will the Government be agreeing with the former Deputy Wallace&rsquo;s position or will it robustly defend our rights?  We have been good Europeans for long enough.  We have been the good boys of Europe and we found out when we had the banking crisis what they thought of us.  It is now time to assert our authority and state that our industry is green and clean.  There is more to be done, as the saying goes, a lot done and more to do.  Nonetheless, we are starting from a very good point and we will not wipe out the planet with emissions from our agriculture industry.  The Taoiseach stood up in this House and said we should eat less beef.  There has been an undermining of and an attack on beef and other products in terms of many of the issues raised.  It is not merited or proven in science.  If the Minister does not defend the industry, what exactly will he say to the European Commission in terms of protecting the interests of Irish farmers and the agrifood sector when it comes to the EU implementing measures aimed at reducing the carbon footprint in the sector?  I hope I get answers from the Minister.  The facts speak for themselves.  Out industry is well recognised.  We need a clear answer from the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, on this issue.<\/p><p>When the Minister, Deputy Creed, spoke recently, specifically on carbon neutrality, which is on the Council agenda, he said that the higher ambition on environmental and climate action is part of the new Common Agricultural Policy post 2020 and that it is proposed that 40% of the overall CAP budget would contribute to climate action.  Where will that leave us?  That is what the Minister said.  Why are people not concerned about that?<\/p> <p>The Government is the elected Government of the day, albeit a lame duck Government on its last legs.  Nonetheless, it is expected to defend our prime industry.  Yet, the Minister also said - this was what is alarming - this would require farming to achieve a higher level of environmental ambition through mandatory and incentive-based measures.  I do not like the word \"mandatory\" because we are doing it already.  Why should any more be mandated?  We have enough regulation.  There is over-regulation.  What mandatory measures does the Government support at EU Council level?  I want answers because we do not want to take any more of them.<\/p> <p> We have to put our shoulder to the wheel and play our part with climate change but we have a good standard and good quality beef, dairy and pork products.  They are clean and recognised as such by independent people from Europe.  There is assessment from world experts but the Government should not be kow-towing and threatening mandatory regulations on those in our farming industry.  They need support.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  They should not be attacked, undermined and threatened with more mandatory regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100031#DD00200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576077300,"counter":446,"content":"<p>It is disappointing that neither the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, nor the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, are here to respond to the debate.  I imagine they have good reason for not being here but it is important that those of us on this side of the House have an opportunity to get answers to our legitimate questions on the Brexit agreement.  My view is that on the occasion of these statements on the European Council, where clearly Brexit will be a significant issue, we should have had the opportunity to get responses from the relevant Ministers.  Unfortunately, it does not seem as if that will be the case.  I will ask my questions nonetheless.<\/p>  <p>  These are essentially the same questions that I raised in October, when we had statements on the Brexit agreement.  I made the point at that stage that in the months leading up to the agreement, those of us who are party leaders on this side of the House were facilitated very well by the T&aacute;naiste and his officials.  They kept us briefed on all the developments in respect of a Brexit agreement.  However, on the occasion an agreement was reached no briefing at all was provided of any consequence to Opposition leaders.  Since then, there has been no contact at all from the T&aacute;naiste's office.  That is really problematic because there are many big questions that are still hanging unanswered relating to the implications of the Brexit agreement for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In the two-year lead up to the Brexit agreement, from Ireland's point of view the whole emphasis was on the importance of the backstop.  As many people said on many occasions, there was that circle to be squared.  How could we have a situation where Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland were not aligned?  This would arise because the North would no longer be a member of the EU under Brexit.  Obviously, the whole question of the integrity of the Single Market was critical.  We were briefed on this on an ongoing basis.  It was unthinkable that we would have any border checks on the Border between the North and the Republic because of all the implications for trade and especially the Good Friday Agreement and peace.  The backstop was the insurance policy.<\/p>  <p>  We were also briefed on a regular basis by the T&aacute;naiste.  He told us about the critical importance of retaining or ensuring the integrity of the Single Market.  That was the justification for the backstop.  Yet, when it came to the 11th hour of the negotiations the backstop was dropped fairly quickly by the Government without an explanation of how Ireland's interests could be protected in its absence.  We still do not know how that will be achieved.  We are still left with a situation where there is a circle to be squared.  How do we ensure that the kinds of standards and safeguards that exist in the Single Market will be upheld in Ireland if there is an open border between North and South?  This key question was glossed over when the agreement was announced.  Suddenly, after two years of saying the backstop was critical, the backstop was dropped and has not been replaced with anything that gives any kind of assurance whatsoever or any confidence that our trade will not be affected by this Brexit deal.<\/p>  <p>  We were told that an arrangement would be put in place with a special committee to be set up that would oversee the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  No one could explain how those special arrangements would work.  We see particular arrangements in all manner of circumstances around the world between two states where there is a border that needs to be policed.  In such circumstances, there is a border between two different authorities.  However, the border that Brexit refers to is a border in the Irish Sea.  The authorities on both sides are UK authorities.  Where is the incentive or independent oversight to ensure that proper checks are in place?  In the absence of those checks one has to ask: in what way will potentially inferior goods produced to inferior standards coming in to Great Britain and moving to Northern Ireland be managed?  How can we be assured that those inferior goods, in terms of quality and safety standards and so on, will not come into the Republic of Ireland?<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the negotiations and over the past couple of years the T&aacute;naiste raised this issue on an ongoing basis.  He referred on one occasion to the fact that several other EU states had warned that unless arrangements were put in place to secure the borders of the Single Market, then confidence in Irish products and trade would be impacted, with a resultant loss of demand or interest in other states trading with Ireland.  Presumably, those concerns of other member states still stand.  In the absence of explanations from the Government on how these arrangements will work I wonder whether Ireland's interests have been sacrificed in the rush to do this deal with the United Kingdom.  I do not say this lightly but I am raising questions about how we are going to protect the integrity of the Single Market under the Brexit deal.<\/p>  <p>  I raised the issue with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee.  She was unable to answer.  She said that those details would be worked out. I asked who would be carrying out the checks.  She did not know.  I asked where the checks would be done.  She did not know.<\/p>  <p>  This is why it is difficult to have confidence that Ireland is doing okay out of the Brexit agreement.  All of the focus around the time the agreement was done was that finally, after two or three years, an agreement was reached.  Then, the focus was on whether the deal would get through the House of Commons.  Then, the question was how the DUP would respond.  Despite all of the clatter around all of those big issues, at no point did the Government address the issue of whether the Brexit agreement is actually helpful to Ireland's interests.  Does it protect our interests as a member of the EU?  That question remains.<\/p>  <p>  We know that in recent days the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Johnson, was obviously being economical with the truth yet again in terms of checks.<\/p> <p>He denied that there would be any checks required for goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and he was quickly pulled up on that by Mr. Jeremy Corbyn MP, when Mr. Corbyn produced documents from the UK Treasury which point out that checks would be needed in some cases.  Indeed, when that question was put to the T&aacute;naiste on Monday, he stated, \"Goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland will need to have some checks to ensure that the EU knows what is potentially coming into their market through Northern Ireland.\"  This is a critical point.  How do we have a system of checks for goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland which can then move freely into the Republic of Ireland?  The point is it is very much in Ireland's interests that we are seen to have a tight border in relation to the Single Market.  It is in our interests in terms of ensuring confidence is maintained in Irish goods and yet nobody in government can explain how this critical issue will be dealt with.  I do not know whether the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, has answers today.  I was hoping that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, or the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, would provide clarity in relation to that.  We are still left in the extraordinary situation where neither we nor anybody in government has a clue about how the Brexit agreement will operate in terms of safeguarding the integrity of our trade and the goods that we trade.  That is a dangerous situation to be in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100032#EE00200","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576077900,"counter":448,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has five minutes to conclude.

The Taoiseach has also set out the issues of primary focus for leaders at the Euro summit taking place on Friday.  I will direct my remarks on a number of important foreign policy issues and on the current situation at the World Trade Organization, which are also on the agenda of this week's European Council.<\/p>  <p>  As is customary, leaders will take the opportunity at the European Council for an exchange on current foreign policy issues.  Among the topics for discussion is the EU's relationship with Africa.  At its meeting in June, the European Council emphasised the crucial importance of the EU's strategic partnership with Africa and committed to developing that relationship further.  This week, discussion on EU-Africa relations will focus on preparations for the EU-African Union, AU, summit in late 2020.  The summit, together with the conclusion of post-Cotonou negotiations next year, will make 2020 a key year for EU-Africa relations.  I was pleased to launch Ireland's new Strategy for Africa with the T&aacute;naiste on 28 November last.  As well as enabling Ireland to build on our already deep bilateral relationships on the African continent, this strategy places a strong emphasis on the need for, and benefits of, Africa and Europe working more closely together.<\/p>  <p>  The prosperity and security of our two continents are closely intertwined.  The EU is Africa's largest partner in trade, investment and development and we should work together to strengthen our political partnership.  Ireland strongly supports Commission President von der Leyen's priority of delivering a new ambitious Africa strategy.  Dr. von der Leyen's visit to Addis Ababa, the headquarters of the African Union, in her first week in office was a clear statement of the importance she attaches to the EU-Africa relationship.  It is expected that EU leaders will call this week on the European Commission and on the High Representative to begin to prepare the ground for a strategic discussion of EU-Africa relations at the European Council in June 2020, which in turn will provide political direction in advance of the important three-yearly EU-AU summit scheduled for December 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Relations with Russia and the extension of EU economic sanctions for a further six months to 31 July 2020 will be discussed also at this week's European Council.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the situation in Ukraine, Germany and France are expected to update leaders on the Normandy Format meeting, which took place at Heads of State level in Paris on 9 December.  Ireland is a firm supporter of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and recognises that Russia must respect the fundamental principles of international law and restore Ukraine's internationally recognised borders.  Ireland supports the efforts of France and Germany to find a resolution through the Normandy format and welcomes the resumption of dialogue between Russia and Ukraine in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Leaders are expected to discuss the risk of paralysis of the World Trade Organization's mechanism for settling disputes.  The Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization, WTO, ceased functioning due to the United States' continued veto of new members to its panel.  As a small open economy, Ireland values its membership of the WTO and the protections it affords to all its members as part of a rules-based multilateral trading system.  However, like others, we acknowledge the need for reform and the need to address areas of unfair trade or advantages within the WTO.  We support the interim appeal arbitration mechanism developed by the European Commission as a temporary workaround, while also emphasising the need for perseverance in resolving the wider impasse with the US.<\/p>  <p>  Leaders have a busy agenda ahead of them this week with a broad range of pressing issues to discuss, including climate change, the EU's seven year budget and Brexit, as well discussing economic and monetary union, EMU, reform at the Euro summit.  There are also a range of other challenging global issues on the agenda, including Russia, the EU's strategic partnership with Africa and the functioning of the WTO and I welcome the focus which the European Council will give to these this week.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for their attention.

The design, planning and construction of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TIl, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  This also includes the improvement, upgrading and maintenance of the road network.  Once I have put in place funding arrangements with TIl, it is a matter for TIl to distribute the funds to the various local authorities, including Roscommon County Council.  Therefore, within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter, in the first instance, for Tll.  The National Development Plan 2018-2027 marks a significant step forward in terms of restoring national road funding to the levels needed to maintain the national road network in a steady-state condition and to allow for investment in road improvement schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Each year, the safety section of TIl carries out a collision analysis of the entire national road network, in compliance with the EU Road Infrastructure Safety Management, RISM, Directive, to identify locations that have high concentrations of collisions.  The 1 km section of the N4 referred to by the Deputies includes two junctions at Croghan and Cootehall.  These junctions were identified through the HD15 safety programme and improvements were made by Roscommon County Council in late 2016-early 2017 in terms of signage and lining improvements, including arrows.<\/p>  <p>  Further to meeting with a delegation from Roscommon in December 2018, Tll agreed to fund a scheme at this location, subject to a feasibility report from Roscommon County Council.  TIl provided funding for this scheme in January 2019 on receipt of this feasibility report from Roscommon County Council.  TIl understands that a design report and road safety audit has since been carried out on this scheme.  It should be noted that Roscommon County Council is the road authority for this scheme and any further actions are currently with Roscommon County Council.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, TIl is maintaining an ongoing rolling programme of minor works projects in the area.  County Roscommon has four schemes included in this programme and these are: the N61 Coolteige scheme, main construction contract is completed, an archaeological testing contract is ongoing; the N60 at Oran, construction is ongoing; the N61 Ballymurray to Knockcroghery, technical advisers have been appointed by Roscommon County Council to progress the project through the planning and design phases; and the N61 Clashaganny to Tulsk, route options are currently being assessed.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that local residents have begun a campaign to have the two junctions at Cootehall and Croghan addressed due to safety concerns and I fully understand their concerns.  I would like to emphasise that I am committed to the maintenance and development of our road network across the country and I support any targeted investment that would improve road safety.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously outlined, TIl's safety section carries out assessments of the network under the HD15 programme which identifies accident clusters and under the HD17 programme which is also carried out under the European directive and which involves route assessments.

Sections of road which are amenable to engineering solutions are prioritised for treatment.  In addition, TII operates a HD17 programme based on road safety inspection reports that indicate which issues - for example, signing, lining or safety barriers - need to be addressed on different sections of road and programmes are drawn up to deal with the priority issues.

This data are used by the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and TII for research purposes.

We have had a summer and autumn of discontent in the beef industry and the live export outlet is essential to keep competition in the trade.  It is obvious that we must reduce the number of cattle that are available for slaughter if we are to ensure a viable and commercial price.  Last spring, there was a backlog and logjam in live exports getting to the Continent.  This coming spring, the calfing is likely to be more crammed than normal, thanks to the good weather we had earlier in the year.  Lairage space, truck space and ship space are critical factors in maximising the number of calves that can be sent to the Continent for veal production.  Everything that can be done in this regard must be done.  The Minister will say that this is the responsibility of live exporters, to which I say that An Bord Bia also has an essential role in ensuring this outlet to market is maximised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100036#OO00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1576079400,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  The welfare of all animals is a priority for my Department and we continue to engage with stakeholders to ensure the welfare of cattle born on dairy farms next spring is provided for appropriately.  Further meetings between my Department and stakeholders are planned over the coming period, well in advance of the peak calving season.  Several measures are being taken to ensure high calf welfare standards.  Currently, calves may not be moved from their farm of birth or sold until they have reached at least ten days of age.  This requirement is being further evaluated.  Recognising that the numbers or dairy bull calves being traded in farm-to-farm sales has been falling off in recent years, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, and the marts are playing a key role in co-ordinating and linking dairy farmers and specialist calf rearers.  The Irish Farmers Association, IFA, recently arranged a series of calf health and welfare seminars, while Teagasc and Animal Health Ireland, AHI, are providing further calf care seminars early next spring.  A recently compiled AHI calf care booklet has been distributed to all co-operatives, and the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council, FAWAC, is finalising a new calf rearing advisory booklet.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has engaged with exporters to ensure the welfare of calves being transported to the Continent and has advised them of updated standards and requirements.  Live exports are a critical part of Ireland's livestock industry, stimulating price competition and providing an alternative market outlet for farmers.  My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its importance to the agrifood sector, while placing a strong emphasis at all times on the welfare of the animals being transported.  In 2018, overall total live exports of cattle, including calves, increased by more than 30% compared with 2017, to 246,000 head.  This growth trend has continued into 2019, with live exports already totalling 266,000 up to the week ending 19 October 2019.  This increase reflects the incremental growth in the numbers of calves born on dairy farms but is also, in part, a consequence of the decision in 2017 to reduce the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves aged less than three months from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20.<\/p>  <p>  The transport of calves requires the use of lairage facilities at Cherbourg and the development of additional lairage capacity there is a commercial matter for the export sector.  However, officials from my Department met their French counterparts in the summer in Cherbourg and, during those discussions, the French authorities indicated that they would be willing to consider applications submitted for additional lairage capacity, should they arise.  My officials are in ongoing communication with Irish exporters on the need for co-operative management to ensure that the lairage capacity at Cherbourg is optimised.  I have urged the live export sector to consider developing an additional lairage in Cherbourg or engaging with the owners of existing facilities to explore the potential for additional capacity.  This has proved possible, as evidenced by the French authorities' approval of an increase in the holding capacity of the Qualivia lairage in Cherbourg earlier this year.  My Department worked closely with the French authorities in this matter.  The move provided for additional daily capacity for 400 calves, bringing the total daily capacity to 4,400.<\/p>  <p>  I met with exporters in September to discuss and review existing export procedures, and officials from my Department have had continued regular engagement with them.  I visited the Netherlands recently with a delegation from An Bord Bia where we met with importers of Irish calves, who expressed strong satisfaction with the quality of Irish calves.  Other market opportunities are being explored by An Bord Bia for older male dairy calves.  My Department's veterinary inspectorate will continue to undertake its risk-based and random inspections across all industry locations to monitor compliance.  I assure Deputies that calf welfare issues are being accorded the highest priority within my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100036#OO00300","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1576079400,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.  It is clear in hindsight, with the removal of quotas in the dairy sector, that insufficient thought was given by the Department and national agencies to the impact that change would have on the beef sector in particular.  We have seen some of that impact in the prices that have prevailed in recent times and in the increased number of dairy bull calves.  There is clearly a need to develop new markets.  Teagasc admitted recently that sufficient consideration was not given to the market outlets for dairy bull calves as a result of dairy expansion.<\/p>  <p>  As I said in my initial contribution, farmers expect and deliver the highest of welfare standards for their animals.  Consumers, too, expect the highest of standards.  It is essential from both their perspectives that there be clear oversight by the Department to prevent any exceptions to or breaches of those standards.  Will the Minister provide clarity regarding the oversight exercised by his Department to ensure there are no individual farmers breaching the standards which consumers and fellow farmers expect?<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is time for the Department address the issues in regard to cross-bred Jersey-Friesian calves, for which there is little beef value.

There is an onus on dairy farmers to produce an animal that is economically viable for beef production.  There are question marks over the current viability of cross-bred calves.

I have emphasised that in all my engagement with various stakeholders, including farm and co-operative leaders and others involved in the export of these animals.  In that context, we have introduced revised regulations which improve welfare standards for calves being exported, including by requiring more space to be available on trucks among other measures.  That is an important factor in reassuring the market destinations of these calves.  I most recently visited the Netherlands on this issue and have also engaged with people in Spain who buy these calves.  They are very satisfied with the current standard but, obviously, we need to constantly reassure them.  In essence, primary responsibility rests with dairy farmers to ensure the welfare of calves and that they are complying with the law.  There are random inspections at marts and on farms to ensure compliance with the regulations.  Those inspections will be stepped up according to risk-based analysis in the context of peak calving in spring etc., which is important.<\/p>  <p>  On cross-breeds, there is a danger of talking ourselves into a difficulty.  We developed the dairy beef breed index specifically to give greater certainty to farmers on what they are getting when they buy a calf in the calf ring.  That is important in respect of the breeding decisions being made by dairy farmers and ensuring the progeny has a realistic prospect of delivering economically for the purchasing farmer.  There has been an increase in the use of those sires in the most recent breeding season and we need to accelerate that.

I have spoken to several school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.  Earlier this year, I relaxed the moratorium for community, comprehensive and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 or more to allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school.  It is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.  In budget 2020, I increased the number of secretaries and caretakers in certain schools to allow schools with an enrolment of 500 to 625 pupils to fill secretarial vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries.  Similarly, schools with an enrolment of 626 to 699 pupils may fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two secretary posts filled and schools of 700 pupils or more may fill caretaker vacancies provided they have fewer than two caretakers.  These measures will take effect from September 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Schemes initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools were withdrawn completely in 2008 and have been superseded by the capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress published in 1991.  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.  Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of the individual school and specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of a chairman's note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, my Department engaged with the unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015.  The arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.<\/p> <p>This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers.  For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015, prior to the arbitration, has been paid &euro;13 per hour from 1 January 2019, which is a 50% increase in that individual's hourly pay.<\/p> <p> Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.  Last May, officials from the Department had discussions with F&oacute;rsa trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting and F&oacute;rsa took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff, which lasts until December 2019.  The Department issued surveys on 10 July to establish the full current cost of the trade union's claim.  This is standard practice.  Officials from the Department met F&oacute;rsa representatives in September.  Management bodies representing the employer schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting.  The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&oacute;rsa and the nature of the industrial action.<\/p> <p> On 30 September, F&oacute;rsa asked the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice, the Department agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the State in an effort to resolve it.  To address the various issues in the claim and arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department is in discussions with F&oacute;rsa under the auspices of the WRC.  Talks have been ongoing since October.  At the WRC this week, the management side met with representatives of school secretaries and caretakers from the F&oacute;rsa union.  The matter is still being progressed at the WRC where talks are ongoing and subject to the normal procedures, including confidentiality.  In these circumstances the resumption of industrial action announced by F&oacute;rsa for the new year is disappointing while the WRC process remains ongoing, and I call on F&oacute;rsa to reconsider its action.

As Members of the House are aware, the quantity of illicit drugs on our streets and in our communities is at a level we have not previously seen.  They are having a devastating effect on the lives of individuals and families and on communities.  These are not just words; the evidence supports them in every sense.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seized as many drugs in 2017 as were seized in 2015 and 2016 combined.  Members of the House who are members of policing fora, joint policing committees or drugs task forces are very familiar with the issue.<\/p> <p>It is raised constantly and members of all parties are dealing with it.<\/p> <p> The Central Statistics Office figures, which referred to controlled drug offences for the year July 2018 to July 2019, have seen an increase in drug-related offences of 16%, year-on-year, and we see the number of people presenting for treatment has also increased.  There are currently 10,300 people on methadone treatment and, regrettably, in 2016, 736 people died a drug-related death.  The figures are appalling.<\/p> <p> Today, Dr. Johnny Connolly published a report, Building Community Resilience.  While it looks at a whole range of issues around drugs, gangland and crime, it specifically made reference to the issue of children caught up in the drugs trade.  It followed on from a report at the beginning of last year, when the Blanchardstown local drug and alcohol task force published research which indicated that children as young as eight were working as drug runners and ten year olds were working as drug dealers, although many of us knew this information already.  The use of minors in drugs distribution networks is appalling but occurs because, due to their age, there are fewer consequences if they are caught.  The Blanchardstown local drug and alcohol task force report exposes the growing prevalence of coercing and exploiting children to supply drugs in our communities.  Organised crime gangs appear to be targeting teenagers to handle drugs, knowing they are far less likely to attract attention.  It also removes the risk of gang members getting caught with the supplies.<\/p> <p> The promise of a lucrative lifestyle tends to prove irresistible for many teenagers.  Supplying and dealing drugs in return for quick cash is easy when, in their minds, there is little or no sanction for getting caught with quantities of class A drugs.  Younger generations may not necessarily be aware that a criminal conviction for drug offences can have a major impact on a person's future prospects, including when it comes to future employment and travel.  We cannot assume that parents are encouraging their children to stay clear of the dangers associated with illegal drugs.  Sadly, in some cases, it can be a parent or another family member who gets a child involved in drug dealing.<\/p> <p> People regularly complain about the lack of garda&iacute; on the streets, the easy tolerance of drug abuse and the open selling of drugs, including transactions on streets and on public transport, and people injecting drugs in plain sight.  The use of cocaine is up 30% and cocaine use in Ireland is now the third highest in Europe.  Europol's 2019 Drug Markets Report illustrates the degree to which violence, death, intimidation, stealing and spreading fear across every community in Ireland is now a feature and a consequence of our rampant drugs trade.  The State's and the Government's response to date, notwithstanding the good work of garda&iacute;, is not at a scale, or not comprehensive enough, to deal with what we are currently facing.<\/p> <p> The unavoidable fact is that violence follows the drugs trade, and there would be no drugs trade without the end user.  Cocaine is being consumed by all sectors of society and in every part of the country.  However far removed geographically and demographically, each of those users bears some responsibility for the gangland deaths and the terror inflicted on communities by the drugs trade. <\/p> <p> I have set out what I view to be an appalling vista for the young children involved.  I want to refer specifically to the Blanchardstown local drug and alcohol task force report, based on research undertaken by Janet Robinson and Jim Doherty.  They found the average age of drug dealers under 18 was just 14, with the youngest as young as ten.  When it came to drug runners, who are used to transport drugs between dealers, they had an average age of 13, with the youngest just eight.  These children are being groomed, they are vulnerable and they are being taken advantage of.<\/p> <p> It is in that context that we are bringing forward a Bill to tackle the use of children in the distribution of drugs.  We are open to working with the Government and other Members on any constructive amendments they may suggest.  In that regard, I welcome the Taoiseach's comment today that the Government would support the Bill.  I urge the Government to work closely with us to ensure it goes through the various stages and is enacted at an early date.  The Bill creates two new criminal offences.  If it is passed, it will become a criminal offence to purchase drugs from a person under the age of 18.  It is hoped this will make drugs purchasers less inclined to purchase from minors and, in turn, those higher up the chain less inclined to use young people in the distribution network.  The Bill also creates a new offence of causing a child to be in possession of drugs for sale or supply.  It is hoped the combined effect of these two new offences will protect young people against getting involved in the drugs economy.<\/p> <p> I refer to the provisions of the Bill, which is a straightforward and short Bill with just three sections.  As I said, the main purpose is to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, as amended, to create two new criminal offences.  The Bill criminalises the purchase of drugs from children and the use of children in drugs distribution.  Section 1 is a standard general interpretation provision for terms which will be used throughout the Bill.  A child is defined as a person under the age of 18 years.  Section 2 introduces two new criminal offences into the principal Act.  This section makes it a criminal offence to purchase drugs from a child or to cause a child to be in possession of drugs for sale or supply.  An offence is committed under this section irrespective of the quantity of drugs involved.  The section provides certain evidentiary presumptions in favour of the prosecutor.  In prosecuting under this section, the prosecutor need not prove that the drug is a controlled drug.  The prosecutor need not prove that the person being prosecuted knew that the child was a child.  Offences under this section are hybrid offences that can be prosecuted in either the District Court or the Circuit Court.  The maximum penalties in the District Court are a fine of up to &euro;3,000 and-or imprisonment up to a maximum of 12 months.  The maximum penalties if the case is tried in the Circuit Court are a jail term of up to ten years and-or a fine.  Section 3 provides for the Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement of the Bill.<\/p> <p> From that point of view, the Bill is straightforward and simple.  As I said, I welcome the Taoiseach's acknowledgement today in the D&aacute;il that he is prepared to accept the Bill.  He said he had some reservations and he wanted amendments, but that can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  To other Members in the House who have said they will support the Bill and who had issues, I am prepared to work with them too.  This is straightforward legislation that can be passed.  On its own, without Garda resources, it will not be enough, but it will send a very clear message that Members of this House do not condone the use of children in the supply of drugs.<\/p> <p> When we read the reports, it is clear the children who are involved are either dealers or runners.  They are vulnerable children who are being exploited.  This legislation will give the Garda additional legislative procedures to tackle some of those issues.  It will make people think twice if they are buying drugs.  If they are buying from a minor - a child under the age of 18 - it is a more serious, aggravated offence and, if convicted, the maximum conviction will be a sentence of up to ten years.  I hope this legislation will be a wake-up call to people that it is no longer acceptable that vulnerable children would be exploited and used in this way.  The legislation can be passed and enacted in a relatively short period of time.  However, if it is not backed up with additional resources to the Garda drugs units, it will not have the effectiveness we desire.  I appeal to the Minister of State, when responding to this debate, to make reference to the huge drugs seizures by the Garda in light of the continuing evidence that we have a growing drugs issue.  Will the Minister of State confirm to the House that he will ensure the resources of the Garda increase to match the scale of the problem?  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100038#QQ01200","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576081200,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Curran on bringing forward this Bill.  Drugs are one of the greatest challenges facing our communities today.  It is not just an urban issue.  Unfortunately, drugs are in every town and village in our 26 counties and they are becoming a serious issue with huge repercussions.  As Deputy Curran said, in recent years, we have seen the very worrying development of the use of children for the distribution of drugs.<\/p> <p>We are bringing forward this Bill to try to tackle this sinister development.<br\/><br\/>At the beginning of this year the Blanchardstown Local Drugs &amp;amp; Alcohol Task Force published research showing what many of us already knew to be the case: children as young as eight years old are working as drug runners, with ten-year-olds dealing drugs.  While the research focused on our capital, there is no doubt but that this practice of drug criminals protecting themselves by using children is seen as successful and will become the <i>modus operandi<\/i>wherever drugs are dealt in this country.  It is therefore important we now amend legislation to discourage and criminalise the use of children in this way.  The use of minors in drug distribution networks is appealing because, due to their age, there are fewer criminal consequences if they are caught.  The Bill seeks to change this and in doing so make it less attractive for those higher up the distribution chain to use young people in this manner.<br\/><br\/>The Bill creates two new criminal offences.

It is hoped this will make drug purchasers less inclined to purchase from minors and that those higher up the chain will in turn be less inclined to use young people in the distribution network.  The Bill also creates a new offence of causing a child to be in possession of drugs for sale or supply.  It is hoped the combined effect of these two new offences will be to protect young people from getting involved in the drug economy.<br\/><br\/>The Blanchardstown report exposes the growing prevalence of coercing and exploiting children to supply drugs in our community.  Organised crime gangs appear to be targeting teenagers to handle drugs, knowing they are far less likely to attract attention.  This also removes the risk of gang members themselves getting caught with supplies.  The promise of a lucrative lifestyle tends to prove irresistible for teenagers.  Supplying and dealing drugs for quick cash is easy when in their minds there is little or no sanction for getting caught with quantities of class A drugs.  Younger generations may not necessarily be aware that a criminal conviction for drug offences can have a major impact on a person's future prospects.  We cannot assume that parents are encouraging their children to steer clear of the dangers associated with illegal drugs.  Sadly, in some cases, it can be parents or family members who encourage their offspring to get involved.  The drug dealer will cynically seek to use children from communities that are already marginalised.  The result is that the opportunity for these children to develop productive and rewarding lives as adults is greatly reduced.<br\/><br\/>The success of this legislation, like all laws enacted, will be to ensure the resources are put in place to guarantee effective implementation.  The number of garda&iacute; working on drugs crimes is less than encouraging.  The number of personnel in the drugs unit since 2015 has declined.  The case is the same in the specialist organised crime unit, where numbers are static at best.  In my county of Tipperary we have only six garda&iacute; attached to the drug unit, and the inspector in charge of the unit does not even have a squad car at his disposal.<br\/><br\/>If we are serious about legislation, this legislation is extremely necessary, but the resources must be put in place for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with this ever-increasing scourge of drug use.  The other issue we need to address is education.  Education is key to showing young people the damage drug use can do and the misery it will cause.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100039#RR00200","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576081800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I also compliment my colleague, Deputy Curran, for bringing forward this legislation to tackle the use of children in the distribution of drugs.  As my colleague said, we are open to working with the Government and other Members on any constructive amendments they might suggest.<\/p>  <p>  The scourge of drugs in modern-day life and society and its far-reaching effects on families, communities and everyday life cannot be overestimated.  Susan Collins, the managing director of Addiction Response Crumlin, has said the availability and accessibility of substances have changed with the advent of technology.  The drugs issue is now more complicated.  More drugs are available.  They are on the Internet and on street corners.  Drugs can be delivered to people's homes.  There are so many different ways in which drugs can be purchased.  Unfortunately, this is where young people, our children, come into this.  The use of minors in drug distribution networks is appealing because, due to their age, there are fewer criminal consequences if they are caught.

Young generations may not necessarily be aware that a criminal conviction for drug offences can have a major impact on a person's future prospects, including when it comes to future employment or travel.<\/p>  <p>  A study of drug dealing and organised crime in Dublin's south inner city has found that children as young as 12 years of age are being induced into gangs.  I believe, however, that this is happening not only in Dublin but all over the country.  As my colleague, Deputy Cahill, said, drug dealing is not just confined to cities; it is everywhere, in every town and village in the country.  The report, entitled Building Community Resilience: Responding to Criminal and Anti-Social Behaviour Networks Across Dublin South Central, identified two large criminal organisations with approximately 100 members between them.  It outlines responses to community-based organised crime, including increases in the number of outreach workers and community garda&iacute;.  The report was carried out by Dr. Johnny Connolly from the University of Limerick centre for crime, justice and victim studies.  Speaking on \"Morning Ireland\" today, he said the vast majority of people in communities where gangs operate want to live safe and normal lives but are disengaging from the policing and criminal justice system due to fear and a belief that the system is not bringing solutions to their problems.<\/p>  <p>  There is a growing sense that the Government is losing the battle against illegal drugs.  People now regularly complain of a lack of garda&iacute; on our streets, the easy tolerance of drug abuse, the open selling of drugs, including transactions on our streets and on public transport, and people injecting in plain sight.  The use of cocaine is up 30%.  Cocaine use in Ireland is now the third highest in Europe.  The response to date of the State and the Government, notwithstanding the good work of garda&iacute;, is not at a scale or comprehensive enough to deal with what we face.<\/p>  <p>  As I said at the start of my contribution, the issue of drugs is getting more complicated all the time.  Drugs are a reality.  Because the crisis is so prevalent, nine former Ministers who have held responsibility for the national drugs strategy came together recently and called on the Taoiseach to intervene to restore confidence in the strategy.  Figures published recently show that the most significant increases in recorded drug crime nationally are outside Dublin, leading to warnings that the country is undergoing a drugs boom, most of it centred on regional towns and cities. In Waterford, my constituency, possession and intent to supply offences have risen by one third in the past year, which is a very worrying trend.  Recently, 30 publicans who have premises in Waterford gathered in a co-working space for a masterclass on drugs, such is the seriousness of the situation.  Publicans are operating a zero-tolerance approach but, unfortunately, there is no typical drug user.  That is what we have learned.  An increased Garda presence on the streets and high levels of engagement between the force, the community and business owners are crucial in tackling the issue.  Much good work is being done by the Garda but it is rowing against the tide as the problem continues to grow at an alarming rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100040#SS00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1576081800,"counter":493,"content":"<p>The Minister sends his apologies - he is in the Seanad - but he would like to thank Deputy Curran, who has brought this Private Members' Bill before the House, for highlighting the serious issue of the involvement of children in criminal wrongdoing in respect of controlled drugs.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 to criminalise the purchase of a controlled drug from a child and criminalise the act of causing a child to be in possession of a controlled drug for sale or supply.  The grooming of children by those who control criminal activity and the identification of crime networks as a separate and plausible risk factor underlying criminal offending by certain children are extremely serious matters.  No one could disagree with Deputy Curran's objective, and the Government will therefore not oppose the Bill today.<\/p> <p>However, while the Minister appreciates the Deputy's good intentions, there are significant legal, policy and operational issues with the Bill as drafted.  Our intention is to work with the Deputy to deal with those issues, as he suggested himself.  The Bill proposes to make it an offence to purchase or acquire a controlled drug from a child.  This would appear to be an offence already under existing criminal law, whereby if a person purchases or otherwise acquires a drug from a child he or she is then in possession of the drug and will have committed an offence under section 3 or section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, depending on the quantity involved.  The existing offence does not require physical custody of the drug and the prosecution can prove constructive possession, for example, when drugs are purchased online but not delivered into the hands of the accused.  In the new offence proposed here, additional proofs may be required which are not required to prove possession, and therefore this offence might unintentionally be more difficult to prove than the existing offence.  The Bill proposes to make it an offence to cause a child to be in possession of a controlled drug for sale or supply.  However, a person causing a child to be in possession in this way would have to supply the child with the drug, which is already an offence under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  The Bill proposes that it shall not be necessary for the prosecutor to prove that the drug was a controlled drug.  However, this would seem to be a fundamental element of the offence and therefore necessary to proving the guilt of the accused.<\/p> <p> Significantly, the Bill provides that it shall not be necessary to prove that the person knew that the child was a child.  This potentially gives rise to constitutional concerns.  The provision would appear to be seeking to create a strict liability element to the offence, which on the face of it is problematic given case law requiring the availability of a defence of honest mistake as to age in sexual offences trials.  It is also worth noting that, with regard to fines and terms of imprisonment, the penalties proposed are less severe than those currently available under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  In this regard, the sale or supply of drugs to a minor child as already provided for in existing law would be an aggravating factor, and the sentencing judge could take this into account in the penalty imposed.<\/p> <p> These proposals brought by Deputy Curran sit within a wider context of the grooming of children to commit various types of crime, not just drug-related crime.  The Deputy will be aware of research published today by the University of Limerick in this area which the Minister is considering carefully.  Other relevant research about the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland includes the Greentown report which identifies crime networks as a separate and plausible risk factor underlying criminal offending by certain children.  This report outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations.  As well as analysing how criminal networks recruit and control often vulnerable children, the Greentown project has attempted to identify the scale of the problem in the State and is now designing a bespoke form of intervention, which will be trialled on a pilot basis commencing next year.  This work has been assisted by an international team of experts on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development, strongly supported by key State agencies, particularly An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The intervention is designed to reduce and disrupt the influence of criminal networks on children in a local area and provide supports for the positive development of the affected children.<\/p> <p> Government policy on drugs and alcohol is set out in the national drug strategy which is entitled Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017 - 2025.  The strategy reflects a change in attitudes to substance misuse and promotes a more compassionate and humane approach to people who use drugs, with addiction treated first and foremost as a public health issue and is underpinned by the key values of compassion, respect, equality and inclusion.  Children living in communities with higher prevalence of problem substance use are at increased risk of developing problems themselves.  For some children, there are early identifiable behaviour patterns that indicate possible problems with substances later in life.  The new youth justice strategy, which I am leading, will align with the objectives of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures and the next iteration of the national policy framework for children and young adults.  It will address a wide range of issues connected with the involvement of young people with the justice system and the steps that can be taken by all agencies, working with community partners, to help to keep young people out of trouble.  These include the Probation Service and its community-based initiatives, the bail supervision scheme developed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and other community-based initiatives and Garda youth diversion projects that my Department funds that work with harder to engage young people.  The Greentown initiative was already mentioned, as was the youth version of the joint agency response to crime, YJARC, which seeks to intensively manage the most prolific young offenders.<\/p> <p> The prosecution of any new offences involving incitement or coercion of children would not be straightforward and there are likely to be difficulties with the workability of such law in practice.  Therefore, proposals for new legislation in this area, such as those proposed by Deputy Curran in his Bill, must be considered with the utmost care, taking cognisance of the views of prosecutors, law enforcement and other experienced professionals working in the area when framing any such proposals.  Irrespective of what changes we might make to the law, the fact remains that attempting to deal with the exploitation of children for any criminal purpose requires a carefully considered approach, involving consideration of prosecutorial, operational and other service delivery issues, as well the strict letter of the law.  The Department of Justice and Equality will be considering the most appropriate approach to countering the grooming of children for criminal activity via engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p> <p> While there are significant legal, policy and operational issues with the proposed Bill, as drafted, the Minister considers that the intention behind the Bill has merit.  The Minister will be happy to have his officials to engage with the Deputy to talk through and tease out these issues to assist the Deputy with his engagement with the Oireachtas legal advice and drafting services, in order to ensure that these difficulties can be addressed prior to the Bill progressing to Committee Stage.  It has been mentioned here that there is no typical drug user and that the garda&iacute; have been very successful recently.  We all join in thanking them and wishing them well in their work.  The number of seizures by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is well up on other years which indicates that there may be an underlying problem in that when there is no money available in the community and society, a lot of funding then goes to the purchase of illegal drugs.  Reports indicate that people who use drugs as a leisure activity may be people who should know better.  They are fuelling the so-called drugs trade.  It is not just people with drug addiction that are the issue.  Many people in society use these controlled substances and have the money to spend on them.  Cocaine has been mentioned as a significant issue and I agree with the Deputy who mentioned that.  This is not a simple issue but the use of children is deplorable.  We are very aware of it.  Much work has been done in the Greentown study and by YJARC.  I thank Deputy Curran for bringing forward this matter for debate.  It is an important issue that we should all work together on to counteract the negativity involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100040#SS00300","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576082400,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I will share time with my colleagues, Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Ward.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill, which is an important amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Act.  It addresses a gap in the current legislation regarding those who are exploiting children as drugs couriers and in other illegal drug-related activities.  We need to urgently plug this gap in current legislation and criminalise this growing form of child abuse and child exploitation.  It should be without question an offence for someone to groom children for the purpose of selling or carrying drugs.  Vulnerable children are being groomed in a way that is no different from those who groom children for sexual exploitation.  Using children as drugs couriers is just another form of child abuse.  These abusers are destroying young lives and robbing them of their future.  Gangs are increasingly using children as couriers to avoid the risks of being caught in possession of drugs themselves.  They believe that children are less likely than adults to be stopped and searched by police or suspected of having drugs on them and so can operate beneath the radar of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These abusers know that children will be attracted by the false glamour and material wealth of drug dealers and are more vulnerable to being exploited.  Children are also bullied and threatened into acting as drugs couriers.  They often fear the retribution of the drugs gangs and the threat to their families more than they fear the consequences of their actions if caught by the Garda.<\/p>  <p>  I want to speak about an issue in my home city of Limerick.  In a recent drugs seizure in the city, crack cocaine was among the drugs seized.  Crack cocaine is being sold openly in Limerick, mixed with heroin.  The drug is devastating.  It has destroyed communities across the world.  It is extremely addictive and is regarded as the most addictive form of cocaine.  There really is a special place in hell for anyone who sells, distributes or benefit from profits from the sale of crack cocaine.  I am contacted almost daily by constituents who have concerns regarding drug use, addiction services, mental health supports, or the crime and intimidation associated with the drugs trade.  They often feel that nothing is being done to address their real concerns.  From my own work and talking to community workers who have told me about it, I know that low level drug dealing is rife in areas of Limerick.  Whereas in the past this activity was undertaken by a limited number of drugs dealers, drugs pushers currently use a network of people, often children, in the sale and supply chain.  For drug dealers, children are a cheap, expendable, easily controlled resource to be used, abused and discarded when their usefulness runs out.<\/p> <p>They do not see them as children or if they do, they do not seem to care.  They only care about the profits they make from selling drugs, regardless of how many young lives they destroy in the process.  We need not only to strengthen the laws in this area, but to give those at the coalface of the problem the tools to defeat the drugs scourge in their local communities.<\/p> <p> It is an indictment of the priorities of the current and previous Governments that the funding for drug and alcohol task forces was cut each year between 2008 and 2014.  I speak as a director of the Mid-West Regional Drugs and Alcohol Forum, of which I have been member for a number of years.  Despite the escalation of the drugs crisis, funding for such groups has effectively been frozen since 2014.  This lack of proper funding has severely affected the delivery of services for communities, and has led to the loss of expertise, as well as experienced and irreplaceable personnel.  Additionally, alcohol has been added to the remit of drugs task forces and forums, without any extra funding or resources being allocated.  That is not sustainable.  We need to restore funding to 2008 levels, at a minimum.  As Deputy Curran noted, former Ministers of State who oversaw the national drugs strategy recently warned that delivery of the plan was \"in danger of collapse\" as powers are being centralised under the HSE.  The current Minister must heed this warning and ensure the task forces are once again made responsible for drafting and implementing local strategies to combat the drugs crisis in their own areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100041#TT00200","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576083000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss Ireland's approach to drugs both publicly and politically and how that it is reflected in policy.  I have worked in addiction centres across Dublin for many years, including in my area of Clondalkin, where I worked for the Clondalkin Addiction Support Programme.  I have years of real-life experience working with people across the spectrum of addiction, from those living chaotic lives to those who have abstained for years and everyone in between.  One of my most challenging but rewarding roles was working with a group of under-18s in the Inchicore area who had fallen through the cracks of society.  These young men had been excluded from schools and youth clubs and were very vulnerable.  Anyone who has worked with under-18s knows that a person would be rebuked - that is the polite term - for calling them vulnerable but that is exactly what they are.  They are very vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  Drug use and drug selling by young people from disadvantaged areas is not a new phenomenon.  However, speaking as a director of the Clondalkin drug and alcohol task force, there has been a spike in such activity over the last 18 months.  Young people are being targeted by older, experienced drug dealers to sell and deliver drugs.  Children are being groomed by unscrupulous drug dealers and are attracted by the flashy cars, the new runners, the few bob in their pockets and the status of being considered a so-called somebody.  We need to examine the underlying issues to know what makes this lifestyle attractive to them.  Poverty and lack of opportunities are always top of the list in my conversations, not only with the young people in question, but also with the services needed to support them.  As legislators, we need to look at the causes and effects.  We need to be proactive rather than reactive and target these young people before they end up in the hands of drug dealers.<\/p>  <p>  Years of underinvestment in our communities by successive Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Governments, including in the local drug task forces, has left many areas bankrupt of the resources needed to tackle these issues.  For example, Clondalkin and Lucan do not have a specific programme for drug users who are under 18, although such a service will be provided this year as part of the Clondalkin drug and alcohol task force's strategic plan.  This is not due to new moneys or funding but because the current task force budget, which has been cut year on year, has been restructured.  In order to introduce a new service, a previously funded service will have to lose out.  These are the kind of arduous decisions task forces across this country have to make.  The failure to properly fund the local drug and alcohol task forces demonstrates the Government's indifference to the damage and devastation drugs cause to families and communities.  The crisis facing communities across Ireland because of the illicit drug trade manifests itself in many parts of Dublin Mid-West.  There is open drug dealing, children are being used as drug mules and couriers and there has been an increase in intimidation due to alleged drug debts or increased personal debts.  Enormous pressure is being put, yet again, on our under-resourced community organisations.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation may have unintended consequences.  For example, what would happen to a child who sold drugs to another child?  While children are vulnerable, so too are drug users.  It would more productive to direct drug users into treatment and rehabilitation programmes rather than the judicial services.  I welcome this Bill and will be interested to see how it can be improved on Committee Stage.  In this trio of child, drug user and drug dealer, only one group is not vulnerable, and that is the dealer who puts drugs into the child's hands.  Those who engage in grooming vulnerable children to sell and deliver drugs must be prosecuted to the highest degree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100042#UU00200","speaker":"1446"},{"type":"speech","time":1576083000,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I support tonight's Bill and commend those who moved it.  Drug abuse and addiction have greatly increased recently, due in no small part to the use of children to transport, store, and sell drugs.  It may come as a shock to people that we must consider, let alone explicitly legislate for, the fact that children of a very young age are directly involved in the supply and sale of drugs.  We must also rid ourselves of any notion that drug abuse and drug addiction are issues facing urban areas alone.  Sadly, it is widely accepted that drugs and drug abuse are a feature of nearly every town and townland across this State.  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, services for treatment of drug addiction, such as the Cavan Drug Awareness, CDA, Trust, are under threat of closure due to their perilous financial situation.  Such organisations provide an essential service to people with drug and alcohol addiction issues across counties Cavan and Monaghan, including very young people and those who started on this road when they were children themselves.<\/p>  <p>  Only a few weeks ago, the CDA Trust had still not received funding for the final quarter of this year.  This resulted in it operating off a bank overdraft, with the associated high interest costs, which were unnecessary.  Two years ago, the new national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - A health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025, called for increased planning and co-operation in this area.  However, communities are being excluded from a role in key decision-making, breaking a commitment given by the Government in that same strategy.  This is a very serious matter.  If the Government expects agencies involved in helping those with substance addiction to plan for the future and co-operate successfully with other related bodies, it must provide for those agencies to function efficiently and effectively and not to be obliged to limp on day by day under the real threat of closure.<\/p>  <p>  In October, I raised the case of Cavan Drug Awareness Trust directly with the Minister of State through a Topical Issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, told me that &euro;190,000 was to be invested in support services for young people with substance abuse problems in Cavan-Monaghan.  While I welcome such a commitment, who is to deliver those addiction services for this overwhelmingly young cohort of people if the threat to the CDA Trust remains?  Rather than making vague promises of future funding, the Government should ensure the future of the CDA Trust and its staff, who have the requisite experience and knowledge particular to that region.  Otherwise, through what means and to whom would the funding be given?<\/p>  <p>  The national drugs strategy can be delivered successfully through existing structures.  First, the Department of the Taoiseach should take responsibility for oversight of the new strategy.  Second, the Taoiseach should convene a national forum of all national drugs strategy stakeholders to set out clearly what is expected of them in their roles implementing the strategy in line with the principles therein.  Third, a community development plan should be put in place at the core of the national drugs strategy.  The bottom line is that the drug and alcohol task forces must be allowed to do as the national drugs strategy promised, which is to co-ordinate an interagency approach to the implementation of the strategy, in the context of the needs of their respective regions and areas.<\/p> <p>I can say that not only with regard to the Cavan-Monaghan issue and the CDA Trust's future.  It has formally put us all on notice that it will cease operation at the end of the coming year if there is no increase in funding.  The North Eastern Drug and Alcohol Task Force, which is the overarching body across the region of Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath, has echoed the CDA position only a short number of weeks ago in the audiovisual room in Leinster House.  There is a serious problem here.  While I welcome the Minister of State's indication of support for the Bill, it is critically important that this Government takes a real hold of this issue because what I see in my community across my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan is an unravelling of good work done at a community level.  There needs to be a realisation of this and an intervention at the highest level to arrest that decline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100042#UU00300","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576083600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Labour Party I support the Bill and welcome the initiative by Deputy Curran in respect of this matter.  I share the sentiment expressed by the Minister of State about the existing offence.  He said that the existing offence does not require physical custody of the drug and the prosecution can prove constructive possession, for example, when drugs are purchased online but not delivered into the hands of the accused.  In the proposed offence, additional proofs may be required, which are not required to prove possession, and, therefore, this offence might unintentionally be more difficult to prove than the existing offence.  I am sure Deputy Curran will clarify that at a further stage in the proceedings.  It is a legitimate issue to be raised.<\/p>  <p>  Through popular culture and various television dramas, we are now seeing the articulation or expression of the exploitation of children, be it the passing of the burner phones or children acting as mules or lookouts.  It is a reflection of the reality on the ground.  We are faced with the vista of children being exploited in this way, with impunity, by these malevolent forces in our society.

Numerous Deputies have spoken about this issue.  Today's report on the south inner city was a critique of the inner dynamics of criminal gangs and how their insidious behaviour affects communities.  The picture is pretty bleak.  Children as young as ten or 12 are exploited and involved in the drugs industry.  There is still light, as the author of the report said, with regard to going from antisocial to pro-social behaviour, which is very important.<\/p>  <p>  I am quite outspoken on this issue.  There are two vacuums that create this situation.  One of them involves socioeconomic reasons while the other one manifests itself in the criminal justice system and State policy on drug use.  Children being caught in the drugs trade by unscrupulous individuals is not new.  I know of instances in Dublin Mid-West where children as young as 12 are selling crack cocaine, heroin and all sorts of illicit drugs.  This is deeply depressing.  Children are selling illicit drugs to adults and are being put in harm's way through that.  Through the lure of money and the apprenticeship of glamour, the souls of these children are being taken away by unscrupulous individuals.  The level of manipulation and the grotesque violence that come with it constitute an affront to society.  This is nothing new.  <\/p>  <p>  There is an alternative economy in working-class communities - a black economy - where people do extremely well out of drug dealing.  They make vast amounts, which trickle down to the middle layer.  It is a bit like the capitalist economy.  There are the main ones who make all the money and usually do not live in the area and then there is middle management and a floor of factory workers and people beneath them who do all the work and must take all the slack.  The collateral damage of that is communities being destroyed by drugs.  There is no way of getting around it.  There is no glamour involved in drugs yet people still take them.  <\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Curran said, the demand for drugs has never been so great so something is obviously wrong here.  We have powers under the Misuse of Drugs Act under which if people use drugs, they will receive custodial sentences sometimes.  Obviously, that is not working.  We must look at something very different because if it is about demand and supply, there is huge demand out there.  All sorts of people use drugs.  There are probably people in this Chamber who have used drugs.  I have used drugs in the past and I have said that publicly.  Other people have used drugs so this goes on and we need a rational and grown-up debate about why people turn to drugs for all sorts of complicated reasons.  Using the criminal justice system as a bulwark against people is simply not going to work.  We must look at something very different when it comes to how we treat people who use drugs and how they supply drugs.  We need to look at regulating all drugs.  Probably a lot of people will disagree with me on that but I would look at a policy that is very different because once that vacuum exists, people will fill it.  They will be extremely unscrupulous and once that vacuum exists, this is what will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100043#VV00300","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1576083600,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I attended the launch of Dr. Johnny Connolly's report this morning in Dublin South Central and I recommend it.  It makes for very interesting reading and reflects many communities around Ireland where this is a problem.  The Bill is welcome and if it gets past Second Stage, we will probably table amendments to it.  The fact that children as young as 12 are becoming involved in drug distribution networks is very frightening.  It is particularly frightening for the communities affected by it.<\/p>  <p>  The one thing I would like to focus on concerns the socio-economic issues in this report.  Dr. Connolly illustrates very well that areas with higher deprivation ratings - E and F - such as Cherry Orchard, Ballyfermot and parts of Crumlin and the south inner city have the highest number of children involved in the distribution networks.  As has been said, they are often controlled by some nasty people who wield a lot of power to intimidate not just these children and their families but the entire community.<\/p> <p>Dr. Connolly also discussed in his report the under-reporting to the Garda from within these communities.  He interviewed people and much of the reason for that under-reporting is down to a disbelief that anything will change or happen.  I honestly believe that stems from the idea that people in these communities feel trapped into a certain level of expectation, that they can only go so far and nothing will change.  These people feel contained in those communities and that nothing will change for them.  <\/p> <p> The report of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, published yesterday morning, showed that 140,000 children are living in cold because of fuel poverty.  That reiterates the message to people in these communities.  Those 140,000 children are not confined to rural areas or old houses as they are scattered throughout this country, and that illustrates a tale of two countries because some of the poorest parts of our city in the Dublin South-Central constituency are beside some of the most affluent parts of the city.  It was in the poorest of local areas that drugs projects, family resource projects and youth projects were cut during the austerity years, in particular.  The young people affected are the children of austerity.  I remember well when the then Minister for Finance said he had to pick the low-hanging fruit first, by which he meant the facilities, supports and employees in those areas.  The projects that were lost were able to intervene and offer a community network.  They acted as the veins that tied those communities together.  Austerity meant that elements like that were not able to mushroom, grow and influence children who fell outside the acceptable norms in society.<\/p> <p> The clear messages that need to be heard are those that Dr. Connolly mentioned in his report.  The response to this problem must be driven, in the first instance, by the human rights of the communities affected, the families and people who live in those communities and their rights to live peaceful, decent and safe lives.  He also referred to the human rights of the children who are being abused by their handlers by making them peddle drugs, the need for balance in the care and response to those communities and the adoption of a restorative approach.<\/p> <p> If we are to accept those recommendations, things that are currently happening to drugs projects and youth services in those areas must stop.  For example, the withdrawal of funding and the HSE from the drugs community project in the canal community, which is an area that is among the worst affected, is not acceptable.  The HSE needs to engage with community leaders, activists and workers; otherwise, we are not going to find a restorative and holistic approach to how communities affected by this scourge can grow, develop, and be safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100043#VV00400","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576084200,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I acknowledge Deputy Curran not only for his work on this Bill but for his work on drugs generally, going back to the time of his drugs strategy when he was a junior Minister in a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.<\/p>  <p>  I was at the launch of the national drugs strategy, entitled Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery.  There were many positives in that strategy, the cover of which stated it was a health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland.  The cover mentioned family, children and friends, healing, community and recovery.  Strong speeches were made at that launch by the Taoiseach and the Minister of State with responsibility for communities and the national drugs strategy, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  The vision in that strategy mentioned a healthier, safer Ireland in which harm was reduced and those affected were empowered.  The values underpinning the strategy included compassion, respect, equity and, of course, partnership.  <\/p>  <p>  There were five goals in that strategy and it was good that well-being was among them because we are not only concerned with good physical health.  Other goals aimed to minimise harm and promote rehabilitation and recovery, reduce access to the drugs markets and support the participation of individuals, families and communities.  There were performance indicators attached those goals to measure the overall effectiveness of the strategy and key bodies were to report to the Minister.  There was to be a national oversight committee and a standing sub-committee to drive implementation.  <\/p>  <p>  There was widespread support for that strategy from all of the projects, communities and organisations concerned.  It is all there, but the question lies in its implementation and, if there had been effective implementation, we would probably not be having this debate tonight.<\/p>  <p>  I have concerns about the Bill because I do not believe it gets to the root of why drug dealing goes on and why children are involved.  Children and teenagers sell drugs either through fear and intimidation, to which I will return shortly, or because they see dealing as a viable and lucrative career choice.  These children have role models who are doing  well out of dealing, have designer clothes and watches, cars, extensions on their houses, and holidays.  Why would those children not sell drugs when the alternatives are not viable?  The alternatives are a job that, if one is lucky enough, pays minimum wage, or hanging around doing nothing.  I will qualify that by saying that positive work is going on in the north inner city through the programme implementation board under the chairmanship of Michael Stone.  However, it is going to take years before the long neglect of the north inner city is reversed.  Good work is going on and there is a more positive atmosphere in spite of the many challenges involved.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the progressive initiatives are to do with education and work because we know how important it is for young people to stay in school and, for those who can and want to, to progress to further education.  It is also important that there are alternatives for those who do not want to pursue further education to follow up on apprenticeships, etc., and we are seeing movement on that.  There are also youth projects, for example the career LEAP project, which works with firms and businesses in the area to provide apprenticeships, mentoring, work experience and jobs with a future.  <\/p>  <p>  There are other positives, including the inclusion hub, the progress on case management and stabilisation beds, etc.  All of those are important but the invaluable work has to be undertaken on prevention, education and awareness for those people who end up taking drugs, those who end up dealing as a career choice and those who are forced into dealing.  Unfortunately, we could walk from here tonight to the north or south inner city and buy any drug, including weed, tablets, crack cocaine and heroin.  That is the reality of life in those areas.<\/p>  <p>  One of the terms of reference for the standing sub-committee under the drugs strategy was to develop, implement and monitor responses to drug-related intimidation as a matter of priority but the lack of implementation of the strategy has led to this Bill being before the House tonight.<\/p>  <p>  It is hard to describe the fear that is experienced by people I know in the constituency I represent.  Dealers are bursting into homes, sometimes mistakenly, but other times into the homes of family, friends and partners of an addict who owes money, or a dealer who is not paying up.  It is the fear that drives some of those family members to do things that they would never do and get involved in criminality such as burning out somebody's car, attacking somebody's house, robbing people, committing physical assault and even murder to pay a drug debt, either one's own or the debt of a family member whose life is at stake if the debt is not paid, or who may have to move out of Dublin or Ireland to avoid being murdered.  The family will be left to pay and I am not sure that reality will be helped by the Bill because where is the evidence coming from?  If fear drives some children into dealing, fear will keep them dealing.  Support is needed to address that fear.<\/p>  <p>  There are also children and young people who are members of families with a history of criminality.  We want to break that cycle but I am not sure this Bill will do that, despite the very best of intentions.  The answer is to ensure the Government's commitment in the national drugs strategy is implemented and that the policy structures of the strategy and the structure of the task forces are re-empowered and resourced to do the work.  <\/p>  <p>  There are many outstanding issues when it comes to drugs.  There have been five drug-related deaths in the north inner city in recent weeks.  A report from the Health Research Board, HRB, is due out but that will be about drug-related deaths that occurred two years ago.  As a result of legislation relating to coroners, we are not getting up-to-date information.<\/p>  <p>  It is opportune that Dr. Connolly's report came out today and, while it relates to the south inner city, he has many years' experience of the north inner city.  We know about the findings that highlighted the reluctance of residents to report crime either through fear of reprisal or because they believe that little or nothing was going to be done about it.  He suggested certain actions, including the inter-agency approach to what he calls career criminals, using a carrot-and-stick approach like the joint agency response to crime, JARC, and intensive outreach to young people involved in dealing, with trained youth workers using restorative practices and, to summarise, a whole system approach.  Dr. Connolly called his report, Building Community Resilience, and emphasised strengthening and resourcing community policing and seriously listening to what young people are experiencing on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  That brings me to the community policing forum that he was involved in setting up, supporting and evaluating.  The north inner city forum was in existence for 20 years and was a conduit and liaison for the community in the area.  The community found in the forum a safe place to discuss drug debt, intimidation and antisocial behaviour and the conduit it provided was to the garda&iacute; or the local authority, and it was all to do with drugs.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, the HSE was the funding stream for the community policing forum.  The Department of Justice and Equality is the funding stream for the Cabra community policing forum and the HSE no longer sees this as relevant to its health focused programmes.<\/p> <p> The CPF did invaluable work over many years in supporting individuals and communities making a real difference, unlike the joint policing committees, JPCs.  I have experience of all them.  The JPCs are talking shops.  We have PowerPoint presentations of statistics.  Public representatives can ask questions but they can ask them anyway by picking up the phone or emailing.  I have sat in JPCs where there might be one or two public representatives, five or six garda&iacute; and five or six people from the local authority in attendance whereas the community policing forum is for the community.  The community of the North inner city is now deprived of that CPF and its lack is obvious.  People will not go to garda&iacute; but they would go to the CPF co-ordinator because they trusted that person with the information.  The residents want it back.  It was central to the community partnership model.  It seems that model is being undermined.  We are back to a top-down approach, that the statutory side knows what is best for the community, and not a bottom-up approach from the community.<\/p> <p> I listened to Deputy Curran and the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, earlier.  We know the statistics with regard to the worsening problem.  The Bill will punish those who do not care about a jail sentence because to many people a jail sentence is a sign of status.  The answer is to work with young people, get to the reason they are involved in dealing and, importantly, what it will take to get them to stop and think about their actions.  That comes back to prevention, education, the youth diversion projects, sports, arts and the Greentown Project, which we have discussed.  It is a long time coming but I believe that is the targeted approach we need.<\/p> <p> Many years ago we had the young people's facilities and services fund, which I was involved in as chair in the north inner city.  That was targeted at those most at risk when it comes to drugs.  We need a young people's facilities and services fund targeted at those who are getting into this criminal behaviour.  It is about working with them to get them out of what they are doing and supporting them, especially those who are under intimidation and threat if they continue dealing.<\/p> <p> We had a programme in the north inner city, which the programme implementation board, PIB, supported, in two of the local second level schools.  The evaluation was good because we had trained outside facilitators coming in who understood the issues.  An overall programme for schools is not taking into account that some of our young people are living with this every day.  Young people in other communities are not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100044#WW00200","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576084800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which proposes to criminalise the purchase of a controlled drug from a child and criminalise the act of causing a child to be in possession of a controlled drug for sale or supply, and to provide for related matters.<\/p>  <p>  As we are well aware, the misuse of illicit drugs has reached a level in this country we have not seen before.  It is affecting people from all walks of life - from the vulnerable to the well-off.  Illegal drugs have managed to get a hold in our cities as well as our towns and villages in increasing levels, which are affecting all communities as well as our schools.  I repeat for the Minister that it is affecting our schools, which is a very serious issue and one that has been overlooked and not managed very well in schools throughout our country.<\/p>  <p>  We hear stories from all over the world that drug dealers are using children under the age of 18 to distribute and sell illegal drugs, but we do not need to look abroad to see that.  It is happening on our own streets.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to see harsher penalties imposed on people who use and manipulate children into dealing drugs.  This amendment Bill states that offences under this section are hybrid offences that can be prosecuted in either the District Court or the Circuit Court.  The maximum penalties in the District Court are a fine of up to &euro;3,000 and-or imprisonment of up to a maximum of 12 months.  The maximum penalties if the case is tried in the Circuit Court is a jail term of up to ten years and-or a fine.  I believe the District Court penalties are too lenient.  A real deterrent must be put in place to stop these people from dragging children into a lifestyle surrounded by addiction and crime.<\/p>  <p>  According to the Ireland Drug Report 2018, cannabis is the most popular illegal drug in Ireland.  Those figures do not distinguish between recreational users and people who use cannabis for medical purposes.  Vera Twomey, Yvonne Cahalane and other families in Ireland had to endure terrible hardships to get life-changing medicine for their children.  It is a disgrace that they had to go to the lengths they did to get medicinal cannabis for their children.  We should introduce medicinal cannabis safely into our country that would only be available through a pharmacy and under strict regulations.  Medicinal cannabis has been legalised in more than ten European countries, Canada and Australia and 30 states in the US.  We need to step up to the plate and stop innocent children who have rare conditions suffering more than they already do.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the stellar work that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing in taking illegal drugs off our streets.  Almost weekly we hear of high-profile drug seizures.  It is my understanding that if a child is over the age of criminal responsibility and that leads to the child being charged and brought before the Courts Service, penalties are usually minimal and not a deterrent.  We need to examine ways to deter young people from being talked into going down this path.  That is the road we need to travel at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100045#XX00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1576084800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I am happy to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  I commend Deputy John Curran on his work in advancing it.  The Bill seeks to criminalise the purchase of a controlled drug from a child and to criminalise the act of causing a child to be in possession of a controlled drug for sale or supply.  It is appalling to think that there are people of such brutality and lack of conscience who would seek to use a child as a conduit to sell and profit from the sale of drugs.  It is a shocking thought.  Where have we come as a society when such practices are now commonplace?  The value of a child's life has become degraded in this State, thankfully, not for all but certainly for a dangerous and criminal element who could not care less about a child's welfare.  It is shocking.  As Deputy Curran said on First Stage of the Bill, while it will not solve our drug problem, it will offer a small degree of protection to young people, na daoine oige, in a vulnerable position who are being targeted and whose future is selfishly and needlessly being taken from them.<\/p>  <p>  We need measures such as this Bill, but we also need many more community garda&iacute;.  That is why I am talking to the Minister.  Community garda&iacute; have built up and generated relationships of trust within local communities and families and they can steer children away from being associated with such brutal criminality.  In my area, in towns such as Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and Cahir, the community garda&iacute; do sterling work.  They sit in people's kitchens and listen to them.  They are respected by people.  However, all that has been taken away because the Garda is starved of resources.  In terms of numbers, garda&iacute; have been taken off those jobs.  Towns like Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir in my constituency are being decimated as a result of open drug dealing.  That is common knowledge.  <\/p>  <p>  I made a passionate plea about the lack of garda&iacute; to the new Commissioner recently at a JPC meeting.  Much has been spoken about the JPCs being talking shops.  They are talking shops.  Clonmel needs an additional 30 garda&iacute;.  We had the passing out of 200 new garda&iacute; in Templemore last Friday week and we did not get even one.  It is shocking that the Commissioner dismissed us like that.  The Minister said it was not his job, as did the Taoiseach, but it is dangerous not to have a sufficient number of garda&iacute; on the streets.  We do not have the number of garda&iacute; required to tackle crime in the Clonmel or Carrick-on-Suir district.  It is shocking that not a single garda was provided from the last tranche of graduates from Templemore.  Ten garda&iacute; have left the district - two sergeants and eight garda&iacute;.  That is sad.  Two have resigned, which is very sad.  They did not have the resources or the tools of the trade.  The Minister will want to pass responsibility for that to the Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100045#XX00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1576084800,"counter":508,"content":"<p>A gentle reminder for the Deputy.

He knows much more about this problem.  I served in the D&aacute;il with him in 2007 when he spoke about issues in Dublin city.  We did not know what he was talking about at the time.  We know now because the problem is in every town, village, townland and community in the country.  I had a meeting last Sunday night in the Hotel Minella with the proprietor, John Allen, Michael O'Loughlin, Peter Murchin and a number of other public representatives to see what we could do to stop the prolific use of drugs by people in suits, like myself, who are in good jobs.  They call it recreational use yet it is causing devastation and putting families through torture.  In the past 18 months in south Tipperary, at least ten people have died because they owed small drug debts.<\/p> <p>They went abroad and their families were terrorised.  Then they came back and they were terrorised and they took their own lives.  Yet, we do not have a mental health bed in Tipperary.  The issues are staggering and we have to deal with them.<\/p> <p> The amount of cocaine and other drugs being used nightly in the pubs and clubs is unbelievable.  Our schools are doing their best but the whole thing is of epidemic proportions.  Something has to be done and this is tosach maith, a good start.<\/p> <p> They will be using these children as mules.  That is well known.  There are small children of seven or eight years of age going around dropping and delivering.  It is pure shocking.  In the towns of Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir, everyone knows who is doing this - they know the people.  They pass the information on to the Garda but it does not have the resources to address it.  We have six garda&iacute; in the drugs squad for the whole country of Tipperary, which is 120 miles long.  There used to be 15 or 20 garda&iacute; in the unit and they did a great job, but six cannot do anything - they are powerless.<\/p> <p> We have protected communities.  We see what is going on in Drogheda, Mullingar and Dublin.  There are significant Garda resources in place and I commend the members of the Garda on the brave work they do, but they are being threatened and intimidated.<\/p> <p> I see what is going on in my native county of Tipperary and if it is not dealt with soon, it will be out of control completely.  These gangs are terrorising people and operating with impunity because we do not have the resources to deal with them and put them away.  The Bill is an effort by Deputy Curran to deal with that.  It is a sad state of affairs that the schools and everywhere else are being destroyed because of this.  It affects future generations.  I have grandchildren, thankfully, as do many other people here.  The Minister for Justice and Equality probably has grandchildren too.  We do not want this or need this.  We need to sit up and listen to what is happening.  We are being flooded with them.  There are gangs in Clonmel terrorising the people.  Not a day goes by in my office without a parent or grandparent coming in to talk about what is going on or what happened to their Jimmy, Mary or Tommy.  They press things on families when they are deceased at their own hands because of the pressure, and then they pass it on to the parents and grandparents.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, many of these gangs have protected status, which was bestowed on them in this House a couple of years ago.  It is a farce, nothing short of a farce.  They are an ethnic group and they can do what they like to whom they like when they like and where they like above the law.  It is a disgrace and a farce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100045#XX00700","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576085400,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Deputy, unfortunately, your time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100046#YY00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1576085400,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I will start by commending Deputy John Curran on bringing forward this legislation.  It is important legislation.  I know Deputy Curran has extensive experience in this area and he speaks with authority on the matter.  I also know how much work is involved in actually producing a Bill - well done to him.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Bill progresses swiftly.  I note that the Government is supporting the Bill or at least not opposing it.  I welcome that.  The Bill will certainly be strongly be supported by all parties in the House.  I hope it progresses quickly and that it will not simply be a case of the Government not opposing it but not really supporting it either.  I also hope that priority is given within Fianna F&aacute;il to the future Stages of this Bill and it will be facilitated through to its conclusion at an early stage.  At this stage in the electoral cycle, the fear is that while things might get through Second Stage they may not be seen through to conclusion.  Yet it is important that happens.<\/p>  <p>  This issue has been growing over several years.  It is something that many of us in the House have raised on several occasions.  Unfortunately, from the Government perspective, the response has been quite inadequate despite what we were all seeing before our eyes in recent years.  It was what can only be described as an explosion in drug use, especially use among minors, as well as recruiting runners and getting them to carry and sell stuff.  The manner in which young people are recruited into the drugs trade is clear.  It starts off with inviting young people to a party and providing drugs free of charge there.  They are told where they can get further drugs without any charge and the suggestion of making extra money is made to them.  The message is that it is easy.  We see the attraction of this, especially in working-class areas where the ambitions of many young people may be quite limited for various reasons, including the impact of disadvantage and circumstances where they do not see much opportunity being provided to them either through school, training or employment.  Involvement in the drugs trade is often held up as a rite of passage to adulthood and a route to developing a lucrative way of living.  Of course we know it is anything but that.  Yet, the early attractions are undeniable for young people.  They see others around them who have the gear and spare money.  They may go on to have a motorbike or car and may be influential in their local community.  It all looks attractive for young people to get involved, especially where there may not be many other options open to them.  That raises the whole issue of the social circumstances that predispose young people to getting involved in taking drugs and the trading of drugs.<\/p>  <p>  Over recent times, we have heard the line that the response to drug misuse is health-led.  That is fine and there is need for a strong health-led response.  However, there is also need for criminal justice and policing responses.  Sometimes I get the impression that the line about a health-led response is actually cover for inactivity in the other responses required.  I am not saying as much for no reason but because the data back up the claim.  We can see how when the Garda figures took a dramatic dip, there was a price to be paid.  The price is that drug misuse, dealing and a host of other issues relating to anti-social activity, community crime, lawlessness and antisocial stuff increase, thus creating a seedbed for young people to get involved in drugs generally and in the dealing of drugs.<\/p>  <p>  Successive Ministers, Garda Commissioners and politicians generally have been fond of saying that community policing is the centrepiece of policing.  I am unsure how often I have heard that said.  We must put community policing up with the other more high-profile policing.  We all know that unless we get the community policing part of policing right and resource it adequately, then much of the rest it will be too late in terms of an intervention.  We must deal early with youth crime and the things that we often talk about in the House, including the proliferation of quad bikes, scramblers, urban horses, petty theft, gangs, intimidation and bullying.  All of these things are regarded as low-level stuff but they lead to an atmosphere and culture of lawlessness.  We must have a strong community policing force to address these low-level issues and nip the problem in the bud, as it were, if we are to have a serious impact on more serious crime.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider the figures for community policing over recent years.  We can see a major dip in the numbers, from a high in 2012 or 2013 of over 1,000 community police to a current strength of 700.  It is a huge dip and in urban areas in particular, this is having a major impact.<\/p>  <p>  Those involved in criminal groups within communities know well that the Garda ability to respond to their activities is limited.  When I look across my constituency, I can see this in the different areas and Garda stations.<\/p> <p>The number of garda&iacute; allocated to the community Garda service is less than 10% of the overall allocation of garda&iacute; for those stations.  It is clear the Government is only paying lip-service to this principle of putting the community Garda service front and centre.  Unless we support that service and ensure that adequate resources are provided for it, what starts off as minor crime and small incidents of anti-social activity will inevitably provide the circumstances and the seedbed for much more serious gangland drug-related crime, which is what we have seen happening.  We are paying a price for those cuts.  Equally, in the drug units, the numbers are small and thinly stretched over large areas.<\/p> <p> I welcome the provisions of this legislation.  It is discrete legislation.  It addresses a particular growing issue, which has been raised with the Minister on many occasions, that is, the recruitment of minors, particularly in disadvantaged areas, into what looks like an attractive way of life but, of course, ends up as anything but.  I strongly welcome this legislation, very much commend it to the House, and congratulate the Deputy on bringing it forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100046#YY00300","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576086000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy O'Loughlin-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100047#ZZ00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1576086000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>There are two minutes for the non-aligned Deputies.

Its main purpose is to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act and to create two criminal offences - the use of young children to be a runner or mule, and the purchase of drugs from a child.<\/p>  <p>  It is not the first time I have stood in front of the Minister to discuss similar issues.  This is a minor step and a considerable step, all in one.  If we do not get a handle as to how to protect our young children in this regard, it will get out of control.<\/p>  <p> The role of children within the drugs world is becoming normalised.  It is unforgivable that it has reached this stage.  What has normalised as well within it is that it has become a lucrative market where children are becoming the pawns in a bigger world.  They are being used for the price of a pair of runners.  That is what children are paid when they are first lured into it.  The better they get at it, the more they receive.  Runners become tracksuits, the brand names, etc.  All of sudden, they are hooked as they get older.  I have gone from the 12 year old now to the 15 year old and I am nearly at the 18 year old, at which age they are nearly into dealing.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier, Members referred to JPCs.  I have a totally different view of their role, which I welcome.  They provide an invaluable opportunity for public representatives and members of the community to attend meetings every three months when all the local chief superintendents and superintendents are present and we can convey the views of the public.  Only three months ago, in Galway, a county JPC meeting took place at which drugs was a significant issue.  In fairness to Chief Superintendent Curley, he listened to the public representatives and to the community, and gave us every opportunity to talk it out in detail and to air our concerns.<\/p>  <p>  The main concern we had that day was the vulnerability and the exploitation young people.  We talked about the invaluable role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in going into the schools and informing young people.  They do this mainly around junior certificate time but it possibly needs to be done a little more often to tell them the consequences for travel and for job opportunities in the future if they are caught in possession or if they see it as an opportunity to make money.  We must educate these children that they are being used as pawns in a bigger game.  In some cases, young people see family members benefit well from it, which is sad.<\/p>  <p>  There are opportunities in youth projects.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith spoke about it earlier.  Planet Youth is a fantastic youth initiative pilot in Galway, Roscommon and Mayo where those involved go around educating young people.  They examined the Scandinavian model and saw why there was an issue with all forms of addiction, in particular, drugs, and how they could bring people on board.  It started with a survey and, in four years, they were able to reduce the incidence from a high percentage to quite a low percentage.  I recommend that we consider youth initiative projects as well to support our young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100047#ZZ00400","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1576086000,"counter":519,"content":"<p>It is no coincidence that last week I was at two public meetings in my constituency of Kildare South within three days on drugs.  Drugs have invaded every village, town and community throughout the country.  Every day we hear stories of families and communities being ravaged by drugs.  Research shows that drug crime has increased.  Drug use is up by 20%.  In fact, the majority of the increase has been outside Dublin.  There used be a sense that drugs were a problem in working-class areas in Dublin but 90% of drug users have stable backgrounds and stable homes and, therefore, every community and class has been impacted.<\/p>  <p>  I referred to two meetings.  One was in Newbridge and was organised by the JPC.  I want to put on record my appreciation for the work that the JPC and the Garda are doing in on this.  The community garda&iacute; are doing a good job in reaching out and connecting with schools and communities.  There are just not enough of them.<\/p>  <p>  At that meeting the Dublin footballer, Mr. Philly McMahon, spoke about his life experience.  The message that Mr. McMahon gave was far more important than any anyone like me, the Minister, a garda or a HSE worker or supporter could give.  He spoke about how his family were devastated about his brother getting caught in the trap of addiction, wanting to give up, not being able to get the help when he needed it and relapsing, and sadly, dying when he was only 32.  Philly spoke about that half-time check.  When he is playing a game and needs to be at the best of his form, he has that half-time check with himself.  The young people who were present got a valuable message in terms of having that half-time check with oneself when one finds oneself on the road to something else.<\/p>  <p>  The other meeting was in Rathangan.  It was organised by two small community groups, Lullymore, Barnaran, Drumsru and Cappanargid, LBDC, and Rathangan Community Alert Body, RCAB.  It was about communities concerned about drugs ravaging our communities.  It is not only about the vulnerable people who are led down the road to addiction, but about their families and the safety of their families.  In those communities, houses have been burned down.  Families have had to remortgage their houses to pay for drug crime.  We need to do everything that we can as a society working together to ensure that we stop this blight on our communities.<\/p>  <p>  I commend my colleague, Deputy Curran, on the Bill.  He has done a significant work on drugs.  It is quite shocking to think of those aged eight and ten being used as drug dealers or, essentially, drug pushers.  At a time in a child's life when he or she should be thinking about Christmas, Santa and making their first communion, this is what they are being used for by scumbags who identify young children and think that people will look at innocent children and not think that they have drugs.  Sometimes the children deal with money as well.  The research that was carried out in Blanchardstown is an eye-opener to all of us.<\/p> <p>The two measures Deputy Curran has proposed here in terms of the criminal offences are very much to be welcomed.  As Deputy Curran said, he is very open to amendments.  If we can make it all the more difficult for those who are peddling drugs and trying to get vulnerable people in, it has to help.  Obviously there is an awful lot more we need to do.  Money needs to be invested in rehab facilities.  When people have gone down the vulnerable road of addiction and they want help, they absolutely should get it and it should be provided for them.  I cannot let the evening go without mentioning Sr. Consilio, who got an award here from the Oireachtas last Thursday and who has done so much to help people in addiction, and Aubrey McCarthy in terms of his work with Tiglin.  They do incredible work which needs to be helped, resourced and supported.  We need good, strong legislation like the Bill my colleague, Deputy Curran, has introduced tonight.  I really hope the House accepts and progresses it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100047#ZZ00500","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576086600,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be here for the conclusion of this debate.  I acknowledge the contribution of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, earlier when I was in the Seanad.  As was mentioned earlier, I very much welcome the research published today by Dr. Johnny Connolly of the University of Limerick, UL.  I wish to assure the House, as it was mentioned earlier today by Deputies Broughan, Miche&aacute;l Martin and others.  I would be very pleased to consider it most carefully and was very pleased to note that the research was led by Dr. Connolly, who was a very valued member of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which reported last year and following which report an implementation group was set up by Government to ensure the progressed implementation of in excess of 150 recommendations in that regard.  I want to confirm that my Department is developing legislation to mandate what will be a joined-up, whole-of-government approach to issues of community safety, involving all of the relevant stakeholders in harm prevention.  I welcome the contribution of Deputy Shortall and others who for many years have been speaking of their own experience in constituencies, perhaps none more so than Deputy Curran himself, who held a very important role as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy and indeed represents, as he does, an urban constituency.  We must all work together to ensure the involvement of all appropriate stakeholders.  That will involve the Departments of Justice and Equality, Health, Education and Skills, Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Housing, Planning and Local Government, as well as many other agencies.  I share the concern of Deputies.  I am particularly concerned about children being lured into criminality at an early age.  My Department has long supported the University of Limerick's ground-breaking Greentown study which is informing the development of both policy and practice on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  On the matter of this Bill, I recognise that the intentions of the sponsoring Deputy are entirely laudable.  There is widespread agreement that the grooming of children by criminal gangs is a most serious matter.  However, there are significant legal and policy issues involved here.  There are also operational issues that need to be addressed in the context of the current Bill.  I recognise that Deputy Curran realises this and I wish to assure him of a collaborative approach as we take matters forward.  The prosecution of new offences involving children is complex and far from straightforward.  There are often difficulties with the workability of such proposals in practice, especially where any likely witnesses may be children or their family members, who may be already subject to coercion by the criminal elements involved in the offences or allegations of criminality.  Any new legislation in this area must be considered carefully and with the utmost diligence.  In many cases, people buying from children are other children themselves.  It would be most unfortunate if proposals motivated by a desire to assist children who are exploited simply contributed further to the criminalisation of other children who perhaps have been themselves both coerced and exploited by criminals and criminal gangs.  There is no guarantee that those who are ultimately controlling the activities of the children involved would be targeted effectively by the provisions of the Bill.  I acknowledge the youth justice strategy and the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, in that regard, as well as resources that are being made available to assist communities in that strategy.  I acknowledge the importance of the JPCs.  I heard some criticism, I think, as I entered the House but I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the committees are most useful opportunities for public representatives to engage in a meaningful way with the chiefs of policing communities.  I want to acknowledge a recent undertaking on the part of the Garda Commissioner and his senior team to visit as many joint policing committees as possible and hear first-hand from local communities.  Once that exercise is complete, which it will be in the spring, I would see a far greater role for the JPCs in the context of the new divisional model where the decision-making process will be undertaken more intensely by the chief superintendent and superintendents at divisional level rather than at national level.  I see important opportunities for constructive engagement of the type mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte if the JPCs use these opportunities, and I trust they will.<\/p>  <p>  As I have indicated, I appreciate that the bona fides of Deputy Curran are not in doubt but are clear.  The Government will not be opposing the Bill.  I want to assure Deputy Curran and his colleagues that my officials will be available to meet with him if he considers that helpful, to discuss the legal, policy and operational issues that are raised by the Bill with a view towards assisting the Deputy further in his engagement.  I want to acknowledge the importance of the Oireachtas legal advice and drafting services with Private Members' Bills.  I do not believe there is a Department that experiences as many Private Members' Bills as does the Department of Justice and Equality, on the civil side and on the criminal side.  I want to assure Deputy Curran that notwithstanding the full agenda we have, we will regard this initiative as being important and we would be happy to engage with the Deputy at an early date to ensure issues that require to be addressed are addressed prior to the Bill progressing to Committee Stage in the Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100048#AAA00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1576086600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his concluding remarks, in which he quite clearly indicates he is prepared to work and develop this Bill.  Two things are clear from the debate in the House today.  The issue of problem drug abuse is a national one; it is not a Dublin issue any more, and we heard contributions from right around the country.  This phenomenon of children being exploited, while it has been around, is a growing problem and is becoming much more apparent and obvious.  There is a willingness in this House to address it.  Everybody who spoke on this issue believes there has to be a legislative response.  I listened and have heard some of the arguments that have been presented in terms of the problem with the legislation as presented.<\/p> <p>The purpose of the Bill is to make it an offence to purchase or acquire drugs from a child.  This would appear to be an offence under existing criminal law whereby if a person purchases or otherwise acquires a drug, he or she is then in possession of the drug.  We are trying to make it an aggravated offence to buy or receive drugs from a minor.  That is the principle.  These children are being groomed and taken advantage of.  There is a willingness in this House to offer a level of protection to those children that is not there at the moment.  <\/p> <p> I take the Minister's offer very sincerely and will engage with the officials in the Department because all the Members who contributed to this debate want to see this issue addressed in a proper manner.  I would not like to say that only legislators have a role to play in this.  We already have heard about the Garda.  While I am aware of the separation of powers, and often we do not reflect on that here, it is important that the Judiciary and the sentences passed are in line with the thinking and the spirit of what was meant to happen.  I refer specifically to section 15A of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, which makes it an offence to possess drugs with a market value of over &euro;13,000.  Persons found guilty of that offence under this section face a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years' imprisonment.  It is extremely unusual for Irish legislation to provide for mandatory minimum jail terms.  The norm is that the judge has discretion in determining the appropriate sentence in all the circumstances.  The decision in making a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence for the drug offence was to recognise the harm caused to society by drug trafficking.  The legislation, however, under a different section provides an element of discretion to the trial judge to impose a lesser sentence if there are exceptional and specific circumstances which would justify departing from the minimum ten-year sentence.  The norm should be a ten-year plus sentence.  According to the figures the Minister gave me for 2018, there were 141 convictions under section 15A.  One of those convicted received a ten-years plus sentence.  That was not the intention of this House.  While there will always be exceptional circumstances, 99 of those convicted received a sentence of five years or less.  That was not the intention of the legislation.  It specifies exceptional and specific circumstances.  It is now the norm that people caught with significant quantities of drugs do not get the minimum mandatory sentence that this House had envisaged.  <\/p> <p> As we develop this legislation to protect young children, it is important that the Judiciary does not act just on the words we write but on the view of this House.  This measure will not solve the drug problem.  There will still be illegal drugs, and the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the joint policing committees will continue.  The purpose of this legislation is solely to try to prevent vulnerable children being coerced, groomed and taken advantage of.  I thank the Minister for his contribution and will gladly work with him and others to address the concerns of the Government to ensure that the legislation brought forward on Committee Stage is robust and fit for purpose.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100048#AAA00300","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1576087200,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Teachtaireacht \u00f3n Seanad - Message from Seanad","time":1576087200,"counter":525,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100049#BBB00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1576087200,"counter":526,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill 2019 without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100049#BBB00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2019: Message from Select Committee","time":1576087200,"counter":527,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100049#BBB00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1576087200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimate for public services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2019: Vote 32 - Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100049#BBB00475","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"majorheading","content":" Blasphemy (Abolition of Offences and Related Matters) Bill 2019 [Seanad]: Order for Report Stage","time":1576087200,"counter":529,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100049#BBB00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1576087200,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Report Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100049#BBB00550","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1576087200,"counter":531,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Blasphemy (Abolition of Offences and Related Matters) Bill 2019 [Seanad]: Report and Final Stages","time":1576087200,"counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100049#BBB00587"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1576087200,"counter":533,"content":"<p>Bill received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1576087200,"counter":534,"content":"<p>Question proposed &quot;That the Bill do now pass&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1576087200,"counter":535,"content":"<p>The Bill before us this evening does not vary from the general scheme as published.

Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is aware from my Department's engagement with him that the Government supported the adoption of this Bill on its legislative programme so that I may now facilitate its movement though this House.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and his team, and his co-sponsors, Senators Boyhan, Marshall and McDowell, deserve much credit for the work that has been undertaken to date in this commendable and important Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Members of this House would be aware, the current legal position is that perjury is a common law offence that has rarely been prosecuted in this country.  In fact, over the course of the past ten years, according to figures supplied by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Central Statistics Office, there have been just 31 recorded incidents of perjury before our courts, an average therefore of approximately three perjury cases per annum. <\/p> <p> The core objective of this Bill is to deliver a clearly defined statute dealing with the offence of perjury and related offences.  The Government and I are fully supportive of the Bill in its intention to provide for a codified legal framework to hold persons to account who engage in deceitful and fraudulent activity in their submission of sworn testimony or statements, across various forms of judicial and other proceedings.  The deterrent effect of this legislation, in its acting as a bulwark against vexatious and dishonest evidence, is likely to be considerable.  Its provisions will be a welcome development, particularly in regard to the cost of insurance.  It is a part of a package of measures dealing with insurance issues, including insurance fraud and exaggerated claims, and it will also have general application in other areas of law.  It will serve as a clear message to everyone engaged in legal proceedings that they must be mindful of the need to tell the truth and that any deliberate departure from the truth may have serious consequences in terms of the level of sanctions and penalties that will be at a judge's discretion to impose in the appropriate circumstances.<\/p> <p> History tells us that people have deliberately lied in court or misrepresented the truth in affidavits, which had a material impact on the course of justice and equity.  This Bill will serve as a mechanism to address that reality.  It creates significant deterrents for people who provide such false evidence and statements and, as a result, materially affect the course of justice.  The Bill provides a clear definition of perjury and offers direction with regard to the resulting penalties.  It updates the common law offence of perjury in Ireland and consolidates other relevant legislation in this regard.  There are references to perjury in legislation as varied as the Companies Act, the Cork Harbour Act, the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act and the Mental Health Act, reflecting the all-encompassing nature of this Bill in the context of legal and other official proceedings in which a person may be liable to prosecution for perjury.<\/p> <p> The common law offence of perjury was, along with kindred offences, consolidated and simplified by the Perjury Act 1911.  However, this Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom was never extended to Ireland.  In Northern Ireland, the Perjury Act (Northern Ireland) 1946 was replaced by the Perjury (Northern Ireland) Order 1979, to statutorily provide for the offence there.  However, no consolidation or simplification has ever been legislated for regarding the offence of perjury in this jurisdiction.  This Bill changes that and establishes a statutory criminal offence for the act of perjury.<\/p> <p> The Bill has four core, overarching objectives.  The first is to provide for a statutory offence of perjury that can be clearly interpreted by investigators, prosecutors and the courts alike.  In a similar vein, the second is to provide for offences related and connected to perjury on a statutory basis, including the making of false statements on oath or false statutory declarations.  This is not limited to judicial proceedings but has a wider general application, including, for instance, the making of false declarations in obtaining registration for carrying on a vocation or profession.  The third objective is to provide for clear statutory penalties for the offence of perjury and related offences.  A form of discretion is afforded to the presiding judge in determining any sanction but the Bill sets out sanctioning limits of up to 12 months for conviction on a summary offence and up to ten years for conviction on indictment.  Finally, the Bill will update, repeal and consolidate historical statutory provisions concerning the offence of perjury.<\/p> <p> The Bill is comprised of 17 sections and two Schedules.  Section 1 is a standard provision defining words and phrases used in the Bill.  In terms of the context in which the offence of perjury applies for the purposes of this Bill, \"judicial and other proceedings\" covers proceedings before any court, tribunal, including a tribunal of inquiry or a commission of investigation, or person having by law power to hear, receive and examine evidence on oath.  Section 2 provides for the definition of perjury in that it arises in the context of \"judicial or other proceedings\" where two conditions are met.  The first is that a statement, made orally or in writing, has been lawfully sworn and the person so swearing knows it to be false.  The second condition is that the statement is material to the proceedings concerned.  Section 3 refers to the meaning of subornation of perjury as persuading or otherwise causing another person to commit perjury.  Section 4 provides that references in any law or enactment to perjury or subornation of perjury shall be read as references to perjury or suborning another to commit perjury as so provided for in the relevant sections of this Bill.  Section 4(2) refers to lists of references to perjury or subornation of perjury contained in Acts and instruments referred to in Schedule 1.<\/p> <p> Section 5 provides for an offence of perjury to apply in relevant cases where a person is required or authorised to make a statement on oath in circumstances other than in judicial or other proceedings.  The offence provision provided for also applies in the case of false affidavits.  Section 6 provides for an offence of perjury to apply in relevant cases of false statutory declarations and any falsification of documents required to be made, attested or verified by or under any relevant Act as defined in section 1.  Section 7 refers to a new offence, namely, fabrication of evidence, whereby a person commits an offence when he or she, with the intention of misleading any judicial or other proceeding, fabricates evidence by any means, or knowingly makes use of such fabricated evidence.  Section 8 provides for an offence of perjury to apply in relevant cases of false declarations where there is a legal requirement for a person to be registered before he or she can carry on a vocation, profession or other calling.  Section 9 provides that a person commits an offence if he or she incites another to commit an offence under this legislation.<\/p> <p> Section 10 refers to the requirement for corroboration in respect of any perjury conviction.  The section provides that a person shall not be liable to be convicted of any perjury offence exclusively upon the evidence of one witness as to the falsity of any statement alleged to be false.  Section 11 provides for procedural matters relating to certain proofs in respect of a prosecution for the alleged commission on the trial on indictment of perjury or for allegedly procuring or suborning the commission of perjury on any such trial.  Section 12 provides that the forms and ceremonies used in administering an oath are immaterial if the person or court administering it has the power to so do for verifying the statement concerned and it has been administered in a form, with ceremonies, which the person taking it accepts without objection or has declared to be binding on him or her.<\/p> <p> Section 13 provides for penalties for an offence under this Bill both in respect of summary proceedings and proceedings on indictment.  The maximum penalty on summary conviction under this legislation is a class B fine up to a maximum of &euro;4,000 or a term of imprisonment of 12 months or both.  The maximum penalty on indictment for which a person may be liable on conviction under this legislation is an imprisonment term of ten years or a fine of &euro;100,000 or both.  Section 14 allows that proceedings for offences under this Bill, or for proceedings under any other Act for perjury or subornation of perjury, may only be brought and prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Section 14(2) provides time limits within which proceedings taken in a summary manner for an offence under this section may be commenced.<\/p> <p> Section 15 refers to the interaction of this Bill with other statutes.  Section 15(1) provides that where a false statement is not only an offence under this legislation but is also, under any other enactment, a corrupt practice, or subjects the offender to a penalty other than imprisonment or a fine, then the liability under this proposed Act is in addition to and not in substitution for his or her liability under that other enactment.  Section 15(2) provides that this Bill does not apply to a statement made without oath by a child under Part Ill, concerning evidence of children, of the Children Act 1997.  Section 15(3) provides that where the making of a false statement is an offence under any Act and is punishable on summary conviction, then summary proceedings may be taken under this proposed Act or any other Act.  However, this only applies to an Act passed before the commencement of this proposed Act if the related offence under the other Act so passed is also punishable on indictment.  This is to avoid the possibility of the imposition of a higher penalty than would otherwise apply when the alleged offence was committed.<\/p> <p> Section 16 provides for the repeal of both the Perjury Act 1586 and the Perjury Act 1729 and for consequential amendments to the 52 Acts that are set out in Schedule 2.  Section 17 is a standard provision, providing for the Short Title of the Bill, citations and its commencement.<\/p> <p> Schedule 1 relates to section 4 and lists references to perjury in \"relevant Acts\" and other enactments.  Schedule 2 relates to section 16 and lists amendments to be made to certain Acts, all of which are listed under \"relevant Acts\".<\/p> <p> I am mindful that, historically, it has proven difficult to prosecute the offences of perjury and subornation of perjury in common law.  There is a need to provide for a more effective and streamlined process through which perjury can be prosecuted.  We can move towards realising this objective by placing the offence and related offences on a statutory footing as this Bill purports to do.<\/p> <p>There is no doubt that Deputies are aware the offence of perjury and the making of fraudulent and exaggerated claims have been the subject of much media commentary recently.  The Government is working on a number of fronts to do what we can to address the high costs insurers impose on their customers and our support for this legislation is part of that work.  There will be a strong welcome for this legislation from many in the business community who have supported moves to make perjury easier to prosecute, particularly in the context of personal injury claims which appear to be having an excessive effect on the cost of insurance.  I wish to acknowledge the work of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, in that regard.<\/p> <p> The House will be aware that the passing of the Judicial Council Act by the Oireachtas on 9 July last facilitated the implementation of a recommendation of the Personal Injuries Commission regarding the need for guidelines for award levels in personal injury cases.  In that regard, I again acknowledge my appreciation for the work of colleagues on a collaborative basis in order to ensure the smooth passage of that Act.  Intensive work has been under way since then to establish the judicial council and we are on track for it to be established by the end of the year.  In the meantime, my Department is working closely with the Courts Service and the Chief Justice.  I very much welcome the appointment of the personal injuries guidelines committee designate, chaired by a Supreme Court judge, Ms Justice Mary Irvine.  The establishment of a committee designate pending the formal establishment of the council will allow the committee to hit the ground running and complete its work in an expeditious manner.  I wish to thank the Chief Justice and the new committee for the alacrity with which they responded to the House passing the Judicial Council Act.<\/p> <p> Similarly, this year we have seen the commencement of amendments to sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected.  This Bill will serve to complement that legislation by providing a deterrent to those who may seek to abuse the law through the making of fraudulent claims, statements or declarations.<\/p> <p> I welcome the issues paper on capping damages in personal injuries actions which was published today by the Law Reform Commission, LRC.  It arises from a recommendation of the Government cost of insurance working group and the Personal Injuries Commission that the LRC examine whether it would be constitutionally permissible or otherwise desirable to provide for a statutory regime that would place a cap or tariff on some or all categories of damages in personal injuries cases.  The LRC has invited all interested parties to give their views on which of the various models it has identified could meet the constitutional criteria identified in the paper.  The closing date is Friday, 31 January and I urge widespread engagement in this process by stakeholders, appropriate organisations, the public and Members.  I wish to acknowledge the work of certain committees on this important issue and again commend my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.<\/p> <p> The Bill is an historic one in codifying the offence of perjury in the State.  Historically, as a common law offence, perjury has been difficult to prosecute.  I am hopeful that by providing for a statutory offence of perjury we will have a clear legal framework to guide our enforcement authorities in decisively taking action in this area.  I wish to again acknowledge the contribution of Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  I am pleased to commend the Bill to this House.  I very much hope that we can quickly progress it to enactment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100049#BBB01300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576088400,"counter":543,"content":"<p>It is good to have an opportunity to address the Bill.  I have come from the Seanad, which has just passed the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill.  This Bill is another tool in the kit required to deal with insurance fraud.  Legislation which has been passed with significant co-operation in both Houses are the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act, the Judicial Council Act and the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill.  This Bill will be another addition to that canon.  That legislation was fast-tracked with the co-operation of both Houses because all Oireachtas Members understand the extent to which insurance issues are damaging business and costing jobs.  All Members accept that the Government is doing everything in its power as quickly as it can.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, touched upon the important areas we have addressed.<\/p>  <p>  It is important for me to put on the record the extent to which we need to send a message through this Bill to people who bring forward fraudulent or exaggerated claims which are doing significant damage.  The Judiciary is moving to review the guidelines through the committee designate selected by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Frank Clarke.  The message on insurance I wish to send from this Chamber is that with this additional tool in our kit there will be an end to the era of easy money and people taking spurious claims to the courts or presenting affidavits which result in a claim pending for two, three or four years and insurance companies being forced to reserve funds with a resultant impact on businesses through an increased premium.  That era is coming to an end with the full support of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  For that, I thank every Member of the Houses.  Without their support, this could not be done.  The message has not got through to the slow learners.  Deputies may be aware of recent newspaper reports regarding certain members of the legal or medical worlds.  Such practices cannot be allowed to continue.  I accept that only a very small percentage of those professions facilitate spurious claims.  The power of this legislation will be brought to bear on those who perjure themselves in our courts or swear untrue affidavits.  It is important that the slow learners get the message that the era of easy money from insurance is over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100051#DDD00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1576088400,"counter":544,"content":"<p>The use of the phrase &quot;slow learners&quot; by the Minister of State was unfortunate.

I wish to congratulate Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh on this very important Bill and to acknowledge the instrumental role of Senators McDowell, Boyhan and Marshall, who sponsored it.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has spent a significant amount of time recently listening to Senators on criminal and general justice matters.  I think he would agree that there is a lot of sense in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and that if we had listened to Senators in respect of legislation such as the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, we would probably be far more inspired than we are, having listened to other members of the Cabinet.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, I went online to research the law of perjury in order to prepare for this debate.  The manner in which perjury developed as a common law offence is of interest.  As the Minister stated, it is now sought to put it on a statutory basis, which is a very important development.  I came across an interesting, informative and amusing article while investigating the history of perjury.  It was written by a senior counsel named Paul Anthony McDermott.  My reading of the article was particularly poignant because yesterday was the day upon which he died.  I wish to take a few moments to refer to him because he was a considerable person who merits recognition in the Chamber in light of his significant contribution to the justice and legal systems.  He had a very distinguished academic career.  Academic success is sometimes not recognised in the way it was many years ago.<\/p> <p>Certainly, in the middle of the last century there were regular occasions when academic achievements in universities would be advertised and publicised in newspapers.  That is not done often now, probably for reasons to do with modern life.<br\/><br\/>He excelled academically.  He also wrote a number of important legal textbooks.  One was on double jeopardy and <i>res judicata.  <\/i>He wrote a book on prison law during his twenties, which was a considerable achievement.  He then became a barrister and, as the Minister knows, he was a very distinguished barrister.  He worked for many years as a junior counsel and only became a senior counsel in 2015.  He was an extremely hard worker.  Like many successful barristers, he did not take himself too seriously and had a great sense of self-deprecation.  He was able to comment in the public sphere about issues of importance.  He made complicated legal issues such as perjury digestible for the public.  He was happy to contribute in the public sphere and share his learning and he did so in an understated, elegant and sophisticated way.  On my behalf, and I am sure I speak on behalf of other Members, I offer my condolences to his wife, Annick, his sons, Harry and Andrew, his mother and his brother, James.<br\/><br\/>The article I read by Paul Anthony McDermott was published last June and dealt with perjury.  That was when the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, announced that the Government was going to adopt Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's Bill.  In the article, which was published in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>, Paul Anthony McDermott referred to the fact that the Perjury Act 1911 was never applied in Ireland.  I do not know why it was not applied.  It was not that the British Government at the time believed there was no issue with perjury in Ireland or that Irish people did not tell lies.  Similarly, it was not applied in Scotland.  We know from the Minister's speech and Paul Anthony McDermott's article that there was an earlier Act, the Perjury Act 1729.  I will quote a short paragraph from the article written by Paul Anthony McDermott as it gives a good insight into both the archaic nature of the law of perjury and his distinctive style:<\/p><blockquote>\tAn earlier Irish Perjury Act of 1729 does still apply here, but it simply allows someone convicted of the common-law offence to be sent to a house of correction for hard labour or transported to one of &quot;His Majesty's plantations beyond the seas&quot;.  Sadly, hard labour has fallen out of fashion in almost every area of modern life, and US president Donald Trump&rsquo;s immigration policy, combined with Ireland&rsquo;s current lack of colonies, makes transporting felons logistically challenging these days. <\/blockquote> <p>That is a humorous and instructive account of the Perjury Act 1729 and how it applied historically.<br\/><br\/>When considering the common law offence of perjury, it is important to note that we do not criminalise lying.  It is not a criminal offence to lie.  Recently, and this was mentioned by Paul Anthony McDermott in his article, somebody sought to initiate a private prosecution against the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom because of alleged lies he had told during the referendum campaign on Brexit.  That was thrown out of court on the basis that there was no criminal offence to provide that somebody who does not tell truthful facts during a political campaign is committing a crime.  There is no criminal act of telling lies.<br\/><br\/>The reason there has been a common law offence of perjury for hundreds of years is that it has been recognised that to tell a lie under oath in court is something the law should prohibit and criminalise.  People sometimes forget that courts are formal, not casual, places.  They are places where people should only go as a last resort.  If one goes to court the evidence one gives can have dire consequences for other people.  Historically, evidence could result in the death of another person.  Today, evidence given in court can result in a person losing his or her liberty or, in the civil sphere, in a person having a significant award of damages made against him or her.  There are significant consequences to evidence given under oath in court.  That is why the law has always recognised that it is wrong of a person to tell lies under oath.  For that reason it has been a common law offence.<br\/><br\/>It is surprising that we have not put this on the Statute Book to date.  The word should not go from this House that perjury in Ireland was not prohibited or criminalised up to now.  It is an offence, but the problem is that when an offence is a common law offence it depends upon the development of that offence through the written judgments of judges and the development of the common law before the courts.  It is much more appropriate in a modern society that all criminal offences are codified in legislative Acts so the public is well aware of the type of behaviour that is criminalised and will result in punishment.<br\/><br\/>People regularly swear affidavits before the courts.  They swear them in a casual way, without giving due attention to the content of the affidavits.  Part of the problem is that lawyers draft affidavits for people.  It is the obligation of the person swearing the affidavit to read it carefully and ensure that the draft prepared by the lawyer accurately reflects what the person is stating and the evidence the person wishes to put before the court.  Unfortunately, people assume they will be happy with it because it is drafted by the lawyer.  They speed read it and do not give it due attention.  The single message that should be conveyed when this legislation is enacted is that if one is going to give evidence in court it is a very serious matter.  One gives evidence in two ways - first, by way of affidavit and, second, by way of oral evidence given to the court by turning up in person.  People need to be much more careful when swearing affidavits.  Similarly, when somebody goes into a witness box to give evidence, he or she must recognise that he or she can only give evidence that is truthful.  That emphasis is so strong that we require people to swear an oath or to make an affirmation before they give their evidence.  When somebody is giving evidence we must ensure that the person understands that if he or she does not give truthful and accurate evidence there will be consequences for him or her.<br\/><br\/>This issue has developed in recent times as a result of the recognition by politicians that some people are going to court too easily and casually and some are going to court for the purpose of trying to obtain money wrongfully by giving false evidence to the court.  However, other legislation has been in place for many years which makes it an offence to give false evidence on affidavit.  Anybody who is taking a personal injuries action must swear an affidavit of verification.  The affidavit must testify that the content of the civil bill or the personal injuries summons is true and accurate.  It is an offence for it not to be true and accurate or for an affidavit that is untrue to be sworn.  There is also such a requirement in other legislation.  In the Defamation Acts there is a requirement for persons taking a defamation action to swear an affidavit testifying to the accuracy and truthfulness of the content of the civil bill or statement of claim.<br\/><br\/>It must be recognised, however, that it is not just people who take cases who may be committing perjury.  There is an assumption that it is only the plaintiff taking the case who is likely to commit perjury.  In many instances, a defendant will have a motive to commit perjury and give false evidence to a court, even if that defendant is indemnified by an insurance company.  We need to recognise the balance in the legislation put forward by the Senators.  It does not just apply to people taking claims but also to people defending claims, as it is equally serious for somebody untruthfully to put evidence before a court for the purpose of trying to prevent him or her being held liable in damages for the action brought by the plaintiff.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, said, we have made a number of statutory developments in this House in order to deal with what are referred to as fraudulent claims, exaggerated claims and claims which should never be brought before a court.  As I said, the most important message we need to send out is that going to court is not a casual event but an extremely serious event.  Most people in their lives will not go to court.  It is an unfortunate consequence that sometimes people are forced to go to court because of what happens to them in traumatic events, whether it be a personal injury they suffer through no fault of their own but through the negligence of others, or a family law dispute or an employment dispute.  Most of us, hopefully, can spend our lives away from courts.  While there are circumstances in which people have to go to court, they should only go there as a last resort.  The first message from this House should be that going to court is not casual.  It is a serious event and if people go there, it should only be the last resort.<\/p> <p> We need to consider what we have done.  We have taken many steps, as an Oireachtas, to try to facilitate the detection of fraudulent claims.  As the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, said, we enacted speedily the Judicial Council Bill and currently the Chief Justice and the members of the superior courts are putting together the committee that is going to try to come up with a range of damages in respect of personal injuries.  We also brought forward other legislation which has gone through the House and Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's Bill is part of that toolbox of legislation.  My colleague, Billy Kelleher, MEP, also has legislation to which the Minister should give ample consideration.<\/p> <p> We also need to recognise that steps are being taken outside this House to reduce damages.  The Court of Appeal since 2015 and 2016 has consistently given decisions which are reducing awards in personal injuries actions and they are coming down.  We hear repeatedly people state that awards in Ireland are much higher than in the UK.  They are for minor injuries such as whiplash, but what we do not hear in this debate is that for catastrophic, extremely serious injuries, awards are much higher in the UK.  That is a part of the debate that needs to be spoken about in order to bring balance. <\/p> <p> All of these steps are being taken for the purpose of trying to achieve one societal benefit, that is, the reduction of premiums that are being charged by insurance companies to persons who want to operate and get public liability insurance.  That is a commendable societal objective and we want to achieve it.  We have done considerable work in seeking to achieve that, when we look at the awards coming down, the work being done by the Judicial Council Bill, the enactment of other legislation and the establishment of PIAB, and I also include Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's Bill.  However, irrespective of any issues to do with insurance claims and the recent coverage they have received, this legislation should be enacted in any event because it covers far more than simply insurance claims, the issue that is attracting public attention currently.<\/p> <p> The whole purpose of this action on the part of the political world and the Judiciary is to try to reduce premiums.  We need to send the message out to the insurance industry that we are fully aware of what it is looking for, but it needs to be aware of what we are looking for.  We are looking for a reduction in premiums so ordinary businesses can operate.  We note that profits in the insurance industry in Ireland have rocketed in recent years.  We are not introducing all of these reductions in damages for the purpose of ensuring that insurance companies' profits continue to rise.  If their profits are rising so high, there must be a responsibility on them to use those profits in order to reduce the cost and price of premiums that ordinary people have to pay.  We may need to get to a stage where, as a political system, we start looking at how we can ensure that insurance companies cannot continue to accumulate huge profits while, at the same time, identifying some fraudulent claims and then saying the system is not working and needs to be reformed.  It does need to be reformed but the reason we are reforming it is not just because there are fraudulent claims which need to be thrown out and which are being thrown out.  We are reforming it also for the societal objective of trying to get the insurance companies to reduce their premiums, which is something we need to examine continuously.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Bill.  It is a good contribution to what we have on the Statute Book currently.  It has been pointed out that we have had very few prosecutions for perjury in this country, which is true and we need to see more.  If somebody gives false evidence before a court and there is sufficient evidence indicating that was done deliberately, there should be prosecutions.  We also need to be aware that the courts are not naively falling for exaggerated or fraudulent claims of people who come before them.  Every day of the week, we read in our newspapers about cases and claims that are being thrown out by the courts because they are exaggerated or fraudulent, or because the judges simply do not believe the person taking the case.  We do not read as much in our newspapers about cases where judges disbelieve defendants and find in favour of the plaintiff because the evidence of the defendant was not accepted.  We do not read much about occasions when insurance companies may allege fraud against a person taking a claim but it is realised the company has no evidence for it and it is just put out there.  If the company puts it out there, there is an entitlement for a court to consider whether aggravated damages should be awarded because of the making of a baseless allegation of fraud against a person who is taking a claim.<\/p> <p> I commend the legislation.  I hope we will be able to get it through promptly and get it onto the Statute Book.  I conclude by urging the Minister again to listen to the good sense that comes from Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I know he has spent a lot of time there recently.

The truth is that perjury is something we have had in our society for a long time.  As Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned, if we go right back to the 1700s, we find it on the Statute Book.  It is interesting that one of the big things people had in their lives, certainly among the older generations, was that when they swore on the Bible, they took that as meaning they had to tell the truth.  That was a very powerful thing in a society that was devout in a religious sense.  People were very much of the view that they would not break that oath when they took it and it was seen as being even more than a mortal sin to commit the act of perjury.  It is in that context that we found perjury did not reach into the legal sphere as much as it would have under normal circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  We are in a different age now, for better or for worse, and the act of perjury is something we see happening at a more accelerated rate in our society.  In many of the commentaries we see in newspapers and throughout the media, we see cases reported on which are thrown out of court where it is clear untruths are being told to the court and those doing that seem to suffer no repercussions.  It would be welcome if legislation of this nature were to be a deterrent for people who would chance their arm and go into court on the basis of what have they to lose.  That type of attitude is what has got us into huge difficulty in the past and this legislation will, hopefully, bring us to a situation where less of it happens in the future. <\/p>  <p>  The Bill, as the Minister outlined, goes into some detail as to how this can operate.  However, we need to ensure there are safeguards in place.  We all know of situations where a person has a genuine injury yet what the consequences of that may be is somewhat open to interpretation.  We would not want a situation where legislation of this nature were to be too onerous in that context.<\/p> <p>Where we are in agreement is on cases in which people make fraudulent claims and set themselves up to make a killing without any due process or proper basis for that claim to be brought forward.<\/p> <p> The Senators have done a great deal of work and a great service to the State by bringing this Bill forward.  In fairness to the Government, it is welcome that it has accepted the Bill and is moving it forward so quickly.  As was said earlier, there are now a number of items of legislation going through the Houses.  I hope they will have an effect on the whole area of insurance and the way in which it is being used and abused throughout the State.<\/p> <p> It is important to acknowledge that the number of people who engage in fraudulent or exaggerated claims is very small.  We must also recognise and be conscious of the fact that the insurance industry itself uses these sometimes exaggerated claims as a reason for having such high premiums.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, in an exchange in a finance committee meeting exposed some of this.  The insurance companies were claiming that up to 20% of claims were fraudulent.  However, when they were pressed as to how many of these fraudulent claims they had reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there was practically none.  It is very easy to throw numbers out but it is important to back them up.  We must also be conscious of that.  It would be very cavalier of us to put the idea out into the public domain that somehow or other fraudulent claims are causing the problem.  The problem in our insurance industry is very much the greed of a small cohort of it.<\/p> <p> This is not to say that the issue of perjury does not need to be dealt with appropriately.  This legislation does that.  We see ongoing issues in this regard, not just from the point of view of insurance but in many other cases.  All of us are contacted by people who are very much at the end of their tether in that they either have been falsely accused or find that certain situations have developed in their lives such that they cannot find recourse to justice.  At the core of this is something that has been done in a very vexatious or sinister way to destroy these people's lives.  We see this sometimes in family disputes and at other times in disputes among neighbours and so on.  If sound legislation is in place and these processes can be brought to a court, it may be a relief to a person found to have committed an act of perjury.<\/p> <p> The advance of this Bill as quickly as possible through these Houses in the time we have left would be a very welcome development.  I again commend the Bill.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is here with us and I congratulate him in particular and all the other Senators on the work they have done.  I also congratulate the Minister on embracing the Bill and bringing it this far.  I know he will have the support of everyone in the House to make this law as quickly as possible.  It would be a welcome advancement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100053#FFF00200","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576090200,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018.  I congratulate the Senators on the passage of the Bill through the Seanad and on moving it on to this House.  The Bill is to be welcomed.  Perjury has been around for a long time, but this is the first time it will be properly defined in Irish law and treated as a specific criminal offence.  It is currently treated as a common law offence and as such is deemed more difficult to prosecute.  A ten-year jail sentence and a fine of up to &euro;100,000 will, I hope, help to deter people, including garda&iacute;, business people and State employees, from lying materially under oath, whether in court, at tribunals or during commissions of investigation.  This legislation has been talked about mainly in conjunction with insurance claims and so on, so I will concentrate on that.<\/p>  <p>  The creation of a specific criminal offence of perjury has been hailed as a way of combating personal injury fraud and consequently bringing down soaring insurance premiums.  This is disingenuous.  As we saw recently in the finance committee, large insurance firms are either exaggerating the number of fraudulent personal injury claims they receive in order to hike up premiums or grossly under-reporting them to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  FBD, AXA, Allianz and AIG are all on record estimating one in five personal injury claims to be fraudulent.  This 20% headline figure is the one that dominates the headlines, giving the impression that one fifth of claimants are fraudsters.  However, digging deeper into the numbers paints a different picture altogether.  Out of a total of 2,500 personal injury claims in 2018, AIG flagged 18%, or approximately 450, as suspicious but only reported four cases, or less than 1%, to the Garda.  If this is a case of failing to report suspicions of fraud, the insurance companies could be breaking the law.  Either way, they are not telling the whole truth.  Mr. Justice Kevin Cross, the head judge in the personal injuries section of the High Court, recently stated that \"it is fundamentally dishonest to blame supposedly fraudulent claims for the cost of insurance\".  Unfortunately, the insurance companies' spin is being widely accepted and repeated in the D&aacute;il and in the media, leading to a total clouding of the real issue of insurance companies making huge profits from gouging their customers.<\/p>  <p>  Unregulated insurance hikes are also leading to the closure of businesses, particularly in the leisure sector.  There is no transparency as to how premiums are calculated.  It can be difficult even to find details of one's own previous premiums before they were increased by the company.  Anecdotally, I have heard of insurance renewal notices that do not refer to the customer's previous premium, with the person involved being required to follow up separately with the company in order to find out what his or her premium was for the previous year.  Given that car insurance is a prerequisite for driving on the roads, this information should be made readily available in order that increases can be easily tracked.  Companies should be required to provide details as to how they calculate premiums.<\/p>  <p>  According to Insurance Ireland, 17 general insurers in the marketplace made combined operating profits of &euro;227 million in 2017, up from &euro;16 million in 2016, a profit increase of over 1,300%.  Motor insurance was very profitable for insurers in 2017 - not so great for motorists though - with the 17 companies making a combined profit of &euro;124.8 million on private and commercial motor insurance.  The companies made 16.2% more on customers' motor premiums in 2017 than they did in 2016.  These companies reported a loss of &euro;24.6 million on employer liability, which is not much in the context of their profits.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is looking into reports that insurance companies are also scamming customers through dual pricing, whereby they charge renewal customers more than new clients, effectively penalising loyalty.  This is not just an Irish phenomenon.  A report by the UK Financial Conduct Authority in October stated that millions of customers of insurers operating in the UK were paying a total of &pound;1.2 billion, or &euro;1.4 billion, more than they should.  This is shocking.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance companies are cleaning up and it is time for us to look at insurance in a different way.  New Zealand got rid of a tort-based system in 1974 in favour of the state-owned Accident Compensation Corporation.  The ACC provides cover and compensation for all accidents and injuries in the country.  Operating on a no-fault basis, the system is funded through general taxation and an employer levy.  There is a fixed award structure, ensuring consistency in compensation for similar injuries.  It is affordable and easy to navigate and claims are processed relatively quickly, so one might say it would never work here.  Critics complain that the no-fault aspect could translate to no accountability, with people becoming more negligent in the absence of repercussions.  In reality, however, this is a well-functioning system which has largely removed the element of blame.  Furthermore, the fact that it is state-owned means the private insurance companies are prevented from capitalising on it.<\/p>  <p>  Another idea would be to open up the insurance market across the EU, which would add to competition and result in lower premiums.  In May of this year the European Commission launched a formal antitrust investigation into whether Insurance Ireland's InsuranceLink data pooling system is restricting competition by offering a competitive advantage to its subscribers, effectively operating a cartel.  Excluding other companies from this data pool could potentially reduce motorists' choice of car insurance policies at more competitive rates.  Antitrust investigations can take years to complete, but it will be very interesting to hear the outcome of this case.  I think it will do more to reduce premiums than this legislation will.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the question of whether this Bill will lead to meaningful change in deterring people from lying under oath.  Section 25 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 provides that where a person gives or dishonestly causes to be given evidence in a personal injuries action that is false or misleading in any material respect, or which he or she knows to be false or misleading, he or she shall be guilty of an offence.  Section 14 of the same Act requires the plaintiff to swear an affidavit as to the truth of all assertions, allegations and information provided to the defendant.  However, the cost of insurance working group looked at the use of this legislation to date and found no prosecutions or convictions under section 14.<\/p> <p>Ken Murphy, the director general of the Law Society, highlighted that there is a lack of will to pursue such cases.  CSO figures show that only two perjury offences were recorded in each of the years 2011 and 2012.  Why should we believe that this new Bill will radically change the position ?  According to the 2016 Personal Injuries Assessment Board statistics, the number of employer liability workplace accident claims increased by 8.2%.  The Irish SME Association, ISME, has lobbied for the introduction of the Perjury and Related Offences Bill, citing the fraudulent claim spiel.  Perhaps rather than vilifying the usually genuine injured party, it could perhaps focus more on addressing the cause of such accidents at work.  Many of these incidents involve life-changing injuries which happened as the result of negligence on the part of an employer, so rather than engaging in victim-blaming, ISME should work on raising its members' standards.  In conclusion, while I welcome this legislation in the hope that it will prevent people from lying in court to gain a personal advantage, I am sceptical that it will lead to lower insurance premiums.  In this regard, it is being used as a distraction from the real need to properly regulate the insurance industry or to replace it with a fairer, State-run, not-for-profit alternative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100054#GGG00200","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576090800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Troy.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018.  I commend Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh on his work in this area.  I also commend ISME.  This is a very important Bill and I am glad that work has been done on it.  The Bill will place perjury on the Statute Book as a statutory offence.  It has not been classed as such an offence to date.  Until now, it has been a common law offence and, as a result, has been quite difficult to prosecute in the courts.  Consequently, many of those who lie on oath in a case or who exaggerate are often let off scot-free.  There are consequences for lies that have been told in court.  Reputations are damaged, livelihoods are lost and in more serious cases, liberty can be lost.  The impact is most acutely felt in the area of insurance.  A minority of people bring fraudulent or exaggerated claims.  They lie in court, try to get compensation and rarely suffer any consequences.  There is a right for genuine complainants to get fair compensation and to be allowed to prosecute their claims.  Most people never see the inside of a court.  Those who do are often nervous wrecks.  However, a few seem to be very comfortable in there and like to come back again and again.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of insurance, we have seen that community facilities, businesses, taxi drivers, hotels, cr&egrave;ches, pubs and many others have been crippled by high insurance costs and very often high premiums as a result of a claim culture.  These claims and increases in insurance costs increase the cost of living, often causing the closure of businesses and community facilities.  It is damaging our society and has now reached a crisis point.  Communities are afraid to put on services for their community, such as activities for young people or cultural activities, because they are afraid of claims, and the social fabric is being damaged as a result.  A message has to go out from here that there will be no more access to easy money for those who are prepared to lie in court.<\/p>  <p>  We have to address the issue of genuine cases where the awards made are simply too high.  Awards in the Republic are often multiples of those in the UK.  People are entitled to fair compensation but not excessive compensation.  Equally, for insurance companies that charge high premiums, the projects and efforts being undertaken in the D&aacute;il and Seanad are to drive down premiums, not to increase profits for insurance companies.  That message must be very clear.<\/p>  <p>  I want to compliment a number of steps taken by my own party.  Billy Kelleher, MEP, when a Member of this House, introduced the Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2018.  The purpose of that Bill was to amend the Civil Liability Act to provide that where a court dismisses a case on the basis that it is a fraudulent action, the court must refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I also thank my colleague, Deputy Troy, who is pursuing that Bill and a number of other avenues to tackle fraudulent insurance cases in this country and the other ways in which insurance is unnecessarily being driven high.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il would establish a national claims information database, an anti-fraud unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, an index to track business insurance premiums and would update the Personal Injuries Assessment Board book of quantum regularly.  Something that I experienced as a practising barrister is the inconsistency in awards that could be made in different parts of the country depending on where or who the case was taken against.  The message must also go out to insurance companies that this Bill, which will make it a statutory offence to perjure oneself, not only applies to claimants but also to any defendant and anybody acting for an insurance company.  The message must be very clear that one will not be allowed to go into court to lie to get easy money.  This Bill will make it a statutory offence to perjure oneself and act as a deterrent to those who are thinking about that.  If they go in to lie, they will be prosecuted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100055#HHH00200","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1576090800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I too welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.

I give full credit to Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and ISME for the work that they have done in advancing this legislation.

It is ironic that we are debating this legislation the weekend after Amy Molloy, an investigative journalist with the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, to whom I give credit, published details of an undercover investigation she carried out during which she found that at least seven firms are sending clients to the same orthopaedic surgeon.  She also found that some medical reports were found to be copied word for word with incorrect patient names.  Solicitors and claimants asked doctors to amend medical reports, including about physical examinations for whiplash.<\/p> <p>Our payouts for whiplash are the highest in the world.  The article states: &quot;One solicitor claimed he is paying a GP in bulk 'for up to 10 medical reports at a time', but said they 'do not have a special relationship'.&quot;  That shows the seriousness that currently pertains to this issue.  I do not intend to tar every solicitor or GP with one brush, but some GPs and lawyers are bringing their own professions into disrepute, and through their actions are driving up the costs of premiums.<br\/><br\/>Another report published in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>today related to a captain of industry, an entrepreneur who has created thousands of jobs throughout this country in many rural and isolated areas where there is no other employment.  I am referring to Pat McDonagh of Supermac's.  Over recent years, he has fought fraudulent or exaggerated claims on eight occasions.  He paid out approximately &euro;35,000 in claims but paid a further &euro;380,000 in legal fees.  I am only a layman.  I am not a legal professional and do not claim to be, but that is exorbitant by any stretch of the imagination.  We are fortunate that Mr. McDonagh has the resources to challenge the prevailing culture.  On many occasions, insurance companies told him it would be easier not to fight the case but to surrender, raise the white flag, and pay out the damages, but he refused.  The reason he did so is quite clear, based on some of the cases brought against him.<br\/><br\/>One woman claimed she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, and stopped eating in restaurants after she allegedly found a thumbtack in her chips.  However, she dropped the personal injuries case against Supermac's after footage emerged of her dining in a hotel at a time when she alleged she could not bring herself to go into a restaurant for food.  In another case, a man went into a Supermac's in the midlands, took a photograph of the wet floor and then conveniently slipped.  Again, he decided not to proceed with the case after footage of the incident was shown.<br\/><br\/>Mr. McDonagh is fortunate that he has the resources to challenge such cases.  However, thousands of other small and medium-sized enterprises, including people who are self-employed, one and two-man operations, or those with five or six employees, working from week to week providing employment, do not have the resources to deal with court cases.  They have no choice but to take on board what their insurance companies tell them and pay out the damages.  When it comes time to renew their premiums 12 months later, if they can get a renewal, they then face huge increases.<br\/><br\/>Placing perjury on the Statute Book is not just about penalising those who commit perjury.  It is also about preventing them from doing so in the first place.  Tough sanctions may make people think twice about lying and perverting the course of justice.  Making perjury a statutory criminal offence is not just about addressing fraudulent personal injury claims, although that is an important component.  It is also about making accountable all those who lie in courts, commissions, or tribunals.  This Bill proposes penalties of up to 12 months for conviction on a summary offence and up to ten years for conviction on indictment.  The overarching objectives of the Bill are to provide for a statutory offence of perjury that can be clearly interpreted by investigators, prosecutors and courts alike; provide for statutory perjury related offences, including false statements under oath, false statutory declarations and false declarations; and provide for clear statutory penalties for perjury, to act as both deterrent for the offence of perjury and as sufficiently punitive penalties to reflect the substantial damaging effects caused by perjury.  We want to achieve reduced premiums, not increased profits for the insurance companies.  Addressing this is only one element of tackling the high costs of premiums.  The insurance company cartel also needs to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>In that context, it is welcome that the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, requested that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, carry out a forensic audit of the public liability insurance market.  She requested that study in the summer, after much pressure from across the political divide, because each and every one of us encounters this issue in our clinics daily and weekly.  Four months later, in a reply to a parliamentary question I asked the Minister, she said:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe CCPC has commenced its study and I understand that a procurement process was launched to seek the services of external economic consultants to expedite the delivery of this study.  These consultants will supplement the CCPC&rsquo;s in-house expertise.  The CCPC has advised me that the study is a priority and it will be concluded as soon as practicable.  <\/blockquote> <p>If it is such a priority, why has the CCPC not set itself a deadline for when the study should be concluded?  When asked at a committee meeting today, the Minister was unable to say when that might happen.<br\/><br\/>The crisis inflicted on small businesses and community groups by insurance premiums has been allowed drag on for far too long.  This legislation will go some way towards addressing the increases in insurance premiums.  I ask the Minister to take this opportunity to state clearly that the Bill will pass through the remaining Stages at an accelerated pace in order that it can be signed into law without any further delay.  I also ask the Minister to address the two pieces of legislation my party has brought forward on this issue.

Domestic violence is a scourge on our society.  While it is not always immediately visible or spoken about by victims, the fact is that it affects people from all walks of life in all age groups.  Last week, my Department was involved in a conference organised by the National Observatory on Violence Against Women, which focused on aspects of the Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.  The Garda Commissioner also addressed this important event where he highlighted the disturbing fact that domestic homicides have outpaced murders in the context of organised crime, although they generate far less coverage and discussion.  I fully agree with his analysis, which is why today's debate is very important.  I think it is fair to say that public awareness of this insidious crime is gradually and at last increasing.<\/p>  <p>  This Government has made a major priority of tackling domestic violence through a multiplicity of actions.  That comprehensive approach is essential as there is, it is sad to say, no one law or initiative that can eradicate domestic violence from our society.  I would like to take the opportunity now to update the House on some of our initiatives.  Indeed I am confident that in the future, 2019 will be recognised as a landmark year in the struggle to prevent domestic violence, to punish perpetrators and to protect and care for victims.<\/p>  <p>  The year began with the commencement of the Domestic Violence Act on 1 January.  This Act brought in wide range of new protections to victims under both the civil and criminal law.  The key part of this is the creation of the new offence of coercive control.  It is also significant that this year Ireland ratified the Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, which I was pleased to announce on International Women's Day.  Ratifying the convention delivers on a Government commitment and sends an important message nationally and internationally that Ireland will not tolerate these sort of crimes.  This year has also seen the opening of a significant number of divisional protective services units, DPSUs, by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These units have specially trained officers responsible for engagement with and interviewing of victims.  It is anticipated that there will be a DPSU in each Garda division by the end of quarter one of 2020.  I will return to some of these developments later in my statement.<\/p>  <p>  A number of important pieces of research have also been commenced in 2019 in this important and sensitive policy area.  In May, I launched a major independent in-depth expert research study on familicide and domestic homicide reviews.  My Department has also internally commissioned and prepared research projects that explore victims' interactions with the criminal justice system.  Domestic violence has been a strong feature of this research.  This research review focuses on best practices with victims in general and exploring victims' experiences at each stage of the criminal justice process, namely, the initial police contact, investigation, prosecution, trial, sentencing and parole.  A focus on studies conducted with victims with specialist needs such as victims of intimate partner violence, sexual violence and victims at the intersection has produced very informative data.  All of this research is intrinsic to supporting the development of more evidence-informed policymaking.  In this context, I acknowledge the valuable contribution of NGOs working in this field.<\/p>  <p>  Stepping back, historically, it is fair to say that there were serious deficiencies in the way we collectively dealt with domestic violence here in Ireland.  While victims suffered, we as a society too frequently pretended we did not see it.  Oftentimes we looked the other way.  The term \"behind closed doors\" is regularly used when discussing domestic violence, but that can and will no longer be the case.  The creation of the first and second national strategies on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence represented key milestones, and their implementation provides a concrete example of the priority placed on these issues by Government.  The bulk of the strategy's actions are aimed at changing societal attitudes through awareness raising to help prevent domestic and sexual violence, improving services to victims, and holding perpetrators to account.  This is being achieved through the implementation of the actions set out in the strategy, including the enactment of legislation.  The strategy is very much a living document that informs the direction that the Government, working in partnership with civil society, is taking to tackle these issues head on.<\/p>  <p>  A real high point for me in my term to date as Minister for Justice and Equality was signing the statutory instrument to commence the Domestic Violence Act 2018.  I strongly believe that this legislation will help to improve the protection afforded by our laws to victims of domestic violence.  The Act puts the needs of victims first and foremost.  It does this in a number of ways, first, through the creation of the new offence of coercive control.  The devastating psychological impact of controlling behaviour, emotional abuse, humiliation or intimidation of victims is often a defining feature of domestic violence.  We know how damaging this abuse is to victims.  Creating a specific offence of coercive control sends a clear, consistent message that this behaviour in an intimate relationship cannot be tolerated.<\/p>  <p>  Another particularly valuable aspect of the 2018 Act is that an intimate relationship between victim and perpetrator can now be regarded as an aggravating factor on sentencing for a wide range of offences.  This sends a message to perpetrators, victims and indeed wider society that we will no longer tolerate the appalling breach of trust committed by one partner against another in perpetrating crimes in an intimate context.<\/p>  <p>  The Domestic Violence Act also improves aspects of access to barring orders.  Safety orders are now available to persons who are in intimate relationships but who are not cohabiting.  The Act also recognises the serious impact of domestic violence on children, and the courts will have the option of appointing an expert to assist the court in ascertaining the views of the child.<\/p>  <p>  The landmark Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, which transposes the EU victims directive, is another legislative support for victims of domestic violence.  The Act, which was passed into law in November 2017, introduces for the first time statutory rights for all victims of crime, including victims of domestic violence.  The legislation gives all victims of crime an entitlement to information about the criminal justice system and their case and, very importantly, information on victim service supports and the progress of the investigation and any court proceedings.<\/p> <p>This legislation has been put in place to better protect victims.  As I have said, the Garda Commissioner recently addressed the Irish Observatory on Violence against Women conference and made an important speech on the importance of focusing resources on domestic violence.  He stated that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now responding to 30,000 domestic abuse calls every year.  Those figures are stark, shocking and disturbing.  Each one of those calls is made by someone who is experiencing a deeply traumatic incident, reaching out for help at a time of crisis.  Significant policing changes means that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now in a better position to provide the help those callers need.<\/p> <p> I mentioned divisional protective services units, DPSUs, and additionally, over 2,700 front-line garda&iacute; have received training in how to identify and investigate the new offence of coercive control and this number is set to increase.<\/p> <p> As well as this, a domestic violence risk assessment matrix is being rolled out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a phased basis in early 2020 which will allow garda&iacute; to identify victims at a high risk of harm and perpetrators at a high risk of committing a domestic violence offence.  At the same time, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is developing policies and procedures to inform the overall policing approach to domestic homicides.  This includes a domestic homicide review team in the Garda national protective services bureau which is examining a number of domestic homicides of relevance for review.  The intention is that this will result in an improved response by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the handling of domestic violence or abuse into the future and ultimately reduce the number of domestic related homicides in our society.<\/p> <p> Separate to this, I announced, in May of this year, the establishment of an independent, in-depth study that will provide a solid framework for how the State can better support families and local communities who fall victim to familicide.  This specialist research, being led by Norah Gibbons, will look at the provision of supports to families who are victims of familicide.  The research will identify international best practice in the conduct of domestic homicide reviews and this will help inform our own approach to the introduction of such reviews here.  The expert study is progressing well and I want to thank all the victims and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that have engaged with Norah and her team to date and of course I thank Ms Gibbons and her expert team.<\/p> <p>The study is due to be completed in May.  It will help us better ensure that victims of familicide are supported in as compassionate and timely a way as possible.  This will include the families of the victims and local communities who experience the horror of familicide cases in their local areas.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that the landscape of domestic abuse in Ireland has finally begun to change and 2019 has been a landmark year in implementing that change.  We have greatly improved how we support victims of domestic violence.  Many changes have been made to right the wrongs of the past but the reality is that we will be required to continue to tackle domestic violence on an ongoing basis.  These issues can no longer remain behind closed doors.  Domestic violence is a problem that no one should have to face alone.  I hope that the changes to the law and the significant changes made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to how it handles these crimes, as I have outlined, will make victims of domestic violence feel they can rely on our justice system in their greatest time of need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100057#KKK00700","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576092600,"counter":573,"content":"<p>Is Deputy O'Loughlin sharing her time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100058#LLL00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1576092600,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I will take the first block of time and my colleague, Deputy Browne, will speak later.<\/p>  <p>  I am here to give voice to those without voices, who live in fear of speaking up and speaking out.  We are here to argue for and demand proper services for women in crisis.  These are women who are at risk, who have gathered their courage to make life-altering decisions and who are holding their lives and safety and those of their children in their empty hands.  These women have taken the momentous step of contacting, or escaping to, women's refuges, looking for support, a way out, a roof and shelter.<\/p>  <p>  We could talk endlessly about statistics and figures which are stark, bleak and disturbing.  We should be disturbed because we, as a society, need to be shaken out of our appalling apathy in relation to the services provided to these women and children.  We need to call out the Government on its failures to implement fully the Istanbul Convention, despite what the Minister has said, its failure to build, create and maintain refuge places and its failure to support these women through the court system.<\/p>  <p>  Those of us who have not been through such a situation cannot fully imagine the courage it takes for a woman to run away from an abusive partner.  The toxic power struggle these women endure is unimaginable but tonight we must, for them, imagine ourselves in that situation.  We must imagine what it is like to be drowning in a life of fear, never to be able to relax in one's own home, never to know what is coming next, whether it will be an assault or an attack, an attack on one's children, or for those children to witness an attack on oneself.  These women summon their courage, make plans and put their very lives on the line by walking out the door to what they think is a place of safety, only to be told there is no room at a refuge.<\/p>  <p>  This is not Bethlehem and there are no friendly innkeepers and mangers out the back.  This is an island of 10,000 homeless people who are ahead of the woman who has left an abusive partner in the race to find accommodation.  Some 24% of women escaping domestic violence are pushed and forced into homelessness.  We come back again to the stark, bleak figures.  According to Safe Ireland, the national social change agency working to end domestic violence, victims of domestic violence had to be turned away because services were full on 3,256 occasions last year.  That is an average of approximately nine requests denied per day.  Aoibhneas, the largest refuge in Dublin, turned away 365 families in 2018; one for every day of the year.  Cope Galway turned away 119 women and 204 children because of a lack of capacity.  Teach Tearmainn, in my constituency of Kildare South, turned away 78 women and 114 children.<\/p>  <p>  Let us step away from the figures and walk in these women's shoes.  What does a woman do when she has walked out of her home, away from her abuser, sought refuge and been denied it because of the failures of the Fine Gael Government, the abject, callous inaction of an inept administration?  The only place that woman can go is back to that house and abuser.  Is it any wonder that the figures for femicide are so high?  A total of 126 women were killed in the last 32 years by a current or former partner, which is an average of four women per year.  The Garda Commissioner said last week that domestic homicide is outnumbering gangland murders by two to one.  Garda&iacute; respond to 500 to 600 calls every week.<\/p>  <p>  The Istanbul Convention that Ireland signed up to in 2015 and only ratified in March of this year has still not been implemented, despite what the Minister said in his opening remarks.  Ireland, as a signatory to the convention, has an obligation to provide refuge spaces for victims of domestic violence.  The number of refuge spaces that are provided by a state is determined by the population of the state and that brings us back again to those stark, bleak figures.  There should be 472 places available, but there are only 141.<\/p>  <p>  Something the Government could do to help these women and children would be to listen to the calls made this week for a new family law court in Smithfield with new facilities and services, such as specialist legal advice services, the provision of on-site legal aid and mediation services, the creation of a child-friendly environment and the provision of a sufficient number of rooms to cater for private consultations, particularly to facilitate safe spaces for people and families who are experiencing domestic violence and abusive situations.<\/p>  <p>  At the invitation of one of the organisations that deals with domestic abuse, I visited Dolphin House approximately two years ago and I was appalled when I saw the conditions there.  Victims of domestic violence, often accompanied by their children, were standing in a hallway one or two feet away from the people who perpetrated abuse on them because there is no space for anybody to confer with their solicitors or advisors.  The commitment was made four years ago that a new family law centre would be delivered by 2020 but we are absolutely no nearer its provision.<\/p>  <p>  The leniency of sentences handed down to men convicted of abusing their partners needs to be highlighted.  A Women's Aid report from this year showed three in five such men get suspended sentences.  Most women interviewed for the report were dissatisfied with the sentences passed down and did not believe that justice was carried out.<\/p> <p> We need not only a properly funded and resourced family law court in Smithfield, we also need to have such courts rolled out across the country.  We need a refuge in every county so that we do not have a situation like the one in Kildare where women from Carlow, Offaly and Laois and even Tipperary are trying to get into a refuge with only four apartments.  We need full-time court accompaniment workers for every refuge so that front-line staff are not pulled away from their vital work when they go with women to their court appearances.  Every refuge must open on a 24-hour basis.  Women do not decide to leave their partners and their homes solely between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  Refuges do much more than provide a place of safety.  They are the foundation stones that allow women to piece their lives back together.  Those lives have often been shattered by years of mental and physical abuse.  Refuges help women to get their benefits, regain their financial independence - some for the first time in years - and to bring their cases to court.<\/p> <p> We need to look at the court system and the staggering chasm between orders sought and orders granted.  The future of a woman's life, her safety and the lives and safety of her children can come down to the decision of one judge.  Those women have no other avenue to pursue if an order is not granted.  The stress, trauma and misery visited upon them by judges who do not protect them by issuing orders against their partners who are inflicting violence upon them is unbelievable.  The court system is difficult to navigate and terrifying for many women.  Change needs to be made on this from the top down.  We need to look at how our justice system could be a pier onto which women can alight following an arduous journey through stormy seas.  It should be a haven and a place of respite.  Instead of helping these women and ensuring their safety, the courts spit them back out into a cruel and pitiless world.  There is so much that can be done to help these victims.  The courts are a major source of trauma for women seeking to get their lives back together.  If the family law system were reformed and properly resourced, it would ensure that the safety of children and the non-abusive parent are at the centre of family law proceedings where there is domestic violence.<\/p> <p> We must reform and resource the criminal justice system to make it responsive to the needs of survivors of domestic violence.  I was shocked to learn that women seeking legal aid are only entitled to one application per year.  If a woman needs to go back to the courts for maintenance or access, she must wait a year to do so or pay for it herself.  It is blindingly obvious that this restriction should be immediately lifted.<\/p> <p> When the courts award supervised access, are they aware that there are no facilities for supervised access?  Barnardos had such a service but, inexplicably, funding for it was cut years ago.  Women have to supervise access themselves, coming back to the same situation from which they are desperately trying to escape.<\/p> <p> I will briefly mention the impact of domestic violence on women's health.  The World Health Organization states that women who have experienced domestic violence are at an increased risk of depression and suicide attempts, physical injuries, psychosomatic disorders, unplanned pregnancies, HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.  Some 30% of women who experience domestic violence in Ireland are physically assaulted for the first time during pregnancy.  Reported physical abuse included being gagged, kicked, beaten, choked, strangled, stabbed, slammed against the wall, spat on, having hair pulled, being scalded, beaten and raped while pregnant.  Evidence shows that 49% of women injured by their partner's violence required medical treatment and 10% required a hospital stay.<\/p> <p> What does it say about us as a society that these troubled, tormented, terrified women present at our so-called places of safety, our refuges and our courts?  I use the word \"our\" because we, as a society, provide them, or in this case fail to provide them, with the security and safety they so desperately need.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il is calling on the Government to allocate the necessary funding for the establishment of a dedicated family law court as a matter of urgency.  The conditions in which family law and childcare cases are currently being heard are totally unsuitable and are damaging to victims.  We are calling for the implementation of the Istanbul Convention, which would allocate the proper number of spaces in refuges that are required.  We are calling on the Government to stop perpetuating the cycle of abuse inflicted on these women and children.  I accept that are abused by their partners but in its criminal neglect of failing to provide for these women and children, the Government is not only failing to alleviate the abuse, it is practically perpetuating it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100058#LLL00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1576093200,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Ward.

Ireland's ratification of the Istanbul Convention was a landmark for victims of domestic and gender-based violence and abuse.  Ratification is a commitment by this State to protect and support victims in the first instance, and to work towards the eradication of this horrific and insidious crime.<\/p><p>Domestic abuse remains rife in Irish society.  Worse still, it continues to be shrouded in shame.  One in five women will experience violence in her own home and 41% of women know someone in their circle of family or friends who has experienced partner violence.  Men also endure domestic violence or coercive control by an abusive partner, albeit in significantly smaller numbers.<\/p><p>Safe Ireland's message to the Government yesterday was blunt - promises and recycled budgets will not respond to the needs of women and children who are experiencing domestic abuse and coercive control.  Safe Ireland's data tells us that nine requests for refuge accommodation went unmet every day last year because services were full.  That is 3,256 victims of domestic abuse or violence who, having got themselves to the point of asking for help, were unable to secure safe accommodation and support when they needed it most.<\/p><p>I have seen first hand the incredible work done by the Tallaght-based Saoirse Women's Refuge.  It provides short-term crisis refuge accommodation and 24-hour support for up to six families at a time.  It also provides an outreach service for women who cannot or do not come to the refuge, as well as post-refuge support.  Last year, Saoirse could not accommodate 287 families because the refuge was full.  Saoirse also has to rely on fundraising for the general upkeep of its premises.  This puts added pressure on an already overworked organisation.<\/p><p>Saoirse also informed me of the stress a woman has to go through in the legal system.  The process of obtaining a safety order can be very difficult logistically but also mentally.  Often, a physically and mentally abused women will have to bring her already traumatised children into the family law courts.  There is no privacy, no space and they often feel unsafe.  One woman described to me how the perpetrator sat through the proceedings - these are her words - eyeballing her and leaving her feeling re-traumatised and re-victimised.  A simple, humane solution would be to allow a video link from the refuge to the family law court to apply for safety orders.  Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget included an additional capital investment of &euro;9 million for domestic violence refuges and an additional &euro;2.8 million for domestic violence housing support services for 2020.<\/p><p>When speaking at a presentation in support of Sinn F&eacute;in's legislation in respect of domestic violence paid leave in the audiovisual room last week, domestic violence advocate Emma Murphy spelt out in plain terms what women face when leaving an abusive relationship.  She stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tShe has to look for a safe roof for herself and her children.  She most likely will have to see a doctor.  She most likely will have to go through therapy or counselling, including for her children.  She will have to have a meeting with Tusla regarding the abuse the children have witnessed.  She will then have to go to Dolphin House to get an interim safety order, then follow up with a hearing date.  She may have to file for maintenance.  She will have a meeting with key workers, support workers, social workers and so much more.  This is not even mentioning the trauma or distress she is going through inside from leaving her partner. <\/blockquote>  <p>My colleagues, Deputies McDonald and Quinlivan, introduced legislation last week that provides for a statutory entitlement to ten days domestic violence leave.<\/p>  <p>This legislation, if enacted, will enable victims of domestic abuse to take the necessary time off work to seek support, find accommodation or attend court in a structured and supported environment.  Victims have a right to a pathway out of abuse without fear of losing their jobs.  As legislators, it is our responsibility to deliver on that right and ensure the supports and services victims access are in place and properly resourced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100059#MMM00300","speaker":"1446","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576093800,"counter":579,"content":"<p>We all have long experience of speaking on this issue.  I was a member of Leitrim County Council for many years.  Many people came to me privately to talk about the situations they were in.  I have great respect for the domestic violence advocacy service in Sligo.  I have had to direct many people there many times.  The level of funding received and the way in which the service considers it is neglected by the State in respect of all of that is a shame on everyone.  This Government needs to step up to the mark in this respect.<\/p>  <p>  The family law centre in Smithfield has been mentioned.  I believe it would be more than appropriate to ensure a solid commitment to make that a reality.  When many of the women I have spoken to go to court they find it a traumatic experience.  Having to go to court is a cramped experience.  They find themselves close to the perpetrator of the violence.  The experience is retraumatising for them.  This is one of the obvious situations that needs to be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  It is about a year ago since a particular woman came to me.  She was from a different part of the country and she had moved to Leitrim.  She had two little boys.  She told me of her experience.  For many years she had been living with a partner who had abused her and controlled her.  He followed her to work every day.  He picked her up from work in case she talked to anyone.  He totally dominated her life.  Her two little boys were the reason she stayed for so long.  Sometimes when the violence would get bad, he would go out, get into the car, put the two boys in the car with him and drive off.  He might not come back for hours or sometimes for two days.  She would not know where he was or where her children were.  She was in such terror over what would happen to them.  Eventually, she found the strength she needed.  Finally, she had a close friend who assisted her in getting away and she got away.  The first time I met her she was with me for an hour or more.  It was a hard experience to sit and listen to someone who had been terrorised in that way.<\/p>  <p>  I remember another woman who was a friend of my mother - my mother is in her 80s now.  The woman told me how she lived all her life with a man who beat her.  Given the type of society we had at the time she figured she could do nothing about it.  The thinking was that was simply the way it was.  A certain atmosphere existed in our society in the past.  People were told that they had made their bed and had to lie in it.  That was the attitude.  We have to be far better than that.  However, it is not only a matter of the attitude we have - our attitude has improved a great deal, in fairness - it is also about the supports we provide.  We must ensure that when people have the courage to break out they can come to a place where they have comfort, support and generosity.  They need to feel included.  There must be no obstacle in their way to find another life.  Often that is precisely what they need to do; often they need to find a completely new life.  The woman I referred to earlier with two small children could not go near the part of the country where she had lived.  She had to break all contacts with her friends and work colleagues.  She had to live a new life.  It was very difficult.<\/p>  <p>  I realise the Minister of State, like everyone in the House, has come across similar situations.  However, if we are going to make a difference we have to change what we are doing.  Clearly, the system in place at present is not working for so many people.  Women's Aid and other organisations have come forward and raised several things that need to be done.  One relates to the Bail Act.  When a person is charged with domestic violence, more often than not it is in the District Court and so the Bail Act does not apply.  Even if the Garda maintains that the defendant is in danger of recommitting the violent crimes that he has committed against his ex-partner, the Bail Act will not apply if the punishment is a sentence of less than five years.  All domestic violence cases should come under the Bail Act.  That is something that can be done as a practical measure.<\/p>  <p>  Women's Aid highlighted another issue that would be easy to work with.  The organisation said linkages should be developed between the family and criminal law courts so that information on domestic violence related to criminal offences is communicated properly to the family law courts determining access and custody matters.  I read that recommendation in a document some months ago when it was released by Women's Aid.  Around that time a woman told me that her former partner had been beating her for years.  He was able to go into the family law court.  The fact that he had been convicted in the criminal court for attacking his partner was inadmissible.  There is a great deal we can do.  We do not require vast amounts of legislation or time to bring these measures through in the House.  There must be a focus on this.  I appeal to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Department to sit down and work with the non-governmental organisations.  In fairness, many of the organisations have the answers but they are not being listened to in the way they need to be listened to.  Whether there is a fear that it will cost money or whatever, I do not know.  In any case, the amount of money it would cost is negligible compared with the amount of pain that could be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  This debate is welcome but we have a great deal of work to do.  We need to come together collectively to make a difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100060#NNN00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1576093800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.<\/p><p>It seems to be the time of year again when the D&aacute;il has its annual set piece on domestic violence.  It is usually late into an evening.  Usually, it is in the run-up to Christmas and usually it follows International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.  This is also the time of year when women in violent relationships live in fear and dread at the onset of Christmas and the season to come.  This is because emotional manipulation, financial pressure and the added likelihood of physical violence all spike at Christmas because of many different factors.<\/p><p>I have been at several debates on this topic in the Chamber.  I beg to differ with the claim from the Minister for Justice and Equality when he introduced this topic.  I could not believe what he said.  He said the Government had made a major priority of tackling domestic violence and he was confident that in the future, 2020 would be recognised as a landmark year.  What planet are those in the Government on?  In fact, the whole domestic violence sector gets one quarter of the funding that the racehorse and greyhound industries get each year.  In fact, the sector gets less - it gets &euro;20 million.  The idea that this Government has made it a priority is risible.<\/p><p>I find it hard to think of a greater contrast to Government complacency than the outrage that exists on this internationally.  I also differ with what was said in the Fianna F&aacute;il contribution about apathy in society on this issue.  Tens of thousands of people marched on 25 November in Paris, Rome and throughout Europe.  Millions of people have been marching in Latin America with the <i>Ni una menos<\/i>movement.  Right now, there is a viral video - I imagine people have seen it - called &quot;A rapist in your path&quot;.  It began with women performing it on the street and it has gone viral.  It was performed in Dublin on Saturday.  There is major concern over this issue but we are not getting the interest of the establishment.  We continue to see victim blaming in the courts.  We continue to see no action in funding bar a small increase this year.  That increase in no way matches the increased demand arising from more disclosures as a result of the #MeToo movement.  As I said, &euro;20 million is given to the domestic violence sector and &euro;5 million is given to the sexual violence sector.  These are pitiful amounts of money.  That is why nine people per day are being turned away from refuges.<\/p><p>I wish to highlight briefly the Sonas refuge in Blanchardstown in my constituency.  I paid a visit there some months ago and met the chief executive.  I was horrified when she told me that from that refuge alone, which is in the Taoiseach's constituency, up to 500 women are turned away every year.  While those operating the centre do their utmost to find safe houses for the women, several of those women stay in violent relationships.<\/p> <p>Because of the housing crisis, many women must leave the refuge after their stint is done and become homeless.  What kind of a system is this?  The Minister tells us it is a priority for the Government.  That is seriously difficult to listen to.<\/p> <p> We also should have outreach workers who work for these services and who assist women in getting barring orders etc.  They go into schools educating young people about what a toxic relationship is and trying to prevent gender violence happening in the first place.<\/p> <p> We should have a rape crisis centre in Dublin West.  Today, a number of women from Blanchardstown came to the D&aacute;il.  They have these hundreds of letters, that were signed by local people, to go to the Taoiseach.  I have them wrapped in tinsel.  They wrapped them for him.  The aim is to get 500 local people to sign 500 letters to symbolise each of the families that is turned away from the refuge each year.  Arising from that, people are showing window posters in their houses in Blanchardstown.  They are also collecting up more letters.  They are discussing this issue.  They are bringing it into their workplaces.  They are bringing it into the cr&egrave;che and they are showing it to other women.  That is the type of network that we need in order to force the establishment parties to take this seriously.  The message from today from that group was: not one more turned away.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to consider seriously why he is under-funding this area to such a degree and why he is refusing to do serious education and prevention work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100060#NNN00300","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576094400,"counter":582,"content":"<p>If anybody has looked at the Women's Aid website on the 16 facts for the 16 days, they are, indeed, stark.  One-in-two women murdered in Ireland is killed by her partner or ex-partner.  One-in-three women experiences emotional abuse from a partner or ex-partner.  One-in-eight women is abused while pregnant.  Ireland has only one third of the refuge space required for this outrageous problem.  Children experience domestic abuse.  Violence against women, Women's Aid finishes with, is a human rights issue.  Like many areas, we are failing poorly on our human rights record.<\/p>  <p>  We also have a situation where nine out of the Twenty-six Counties in the so-called Republic do not have a refuge.  Women have to travel for secure refuge, uprooting children from school and taking themselves away from their own immediate friends and support networks.<\/p>  <p>  The number of unmet requests for refuge services in 2018 was 3,256.  I do not have the figure for 2019.  With only 21 refuges in the country, we provide a mere 31% of that recommended in the Istanbul Convention.<\/p>  <p>  My cousin worked for almost 30 years as an assistant for Women's Aid.  She was appointed to take women and their children to the courts.  She retired recently.  She said that the saddest aspect for her was when she left the job she was increasingly sending women back into the arms of their abusers, the reason being that there are no homes for them to go to.  There are not enough refuge spaces and the housing crisis has exacerbated this tragedy.  For people who work with them, and more for people who suffer under it, this is a terrible tragedy.  It was not like that 20 years ago.  It is now exacerbated by the terrible housing crisis that we have.<\/p>  <p>  I will mention two particular instances.  County Carlow does not have a refuge.  Women's Aid states that an independent report launched last year and commissioned by Carlow county development was highly critical of the lack of a refuge.  Tusla is refusing to acknowledge the need for a refuge in Carlow and is instead advocating for safe accommodation.  How can that be acceptable, considering the national deficit of refuges and an independent report which is stating otherwise?  Tusla stated that in the case of Carlow-Kilkenny needs analysis there are a number of recommendations one of which was the provision of additional domestic violence safe accommodation and that it is important to note the distinction between safe accommodation and refuge accommodation which are two different models of service provision and in this respect the needs analysis did not identify or recommend the provision of refuge accommodation.  Safe accommodation is where a woman can go in the middle of the night, which of course is badly needed, but it does not offer longer term secure accommodation for women or children.  Women in Carlow who can access that sort of accommodation have to go to the Amber centre in Kilkenny.  The reason I raised it is because I was asked to do so.  Fr. Peter McVerry will be attending a rally there this weekend.  It will be taking place at the fountain at 2 p.m.  That rally is to advocate for the establishment of a refuge dedicated to Carlow town.<\/p>  <p>  Something our Councillor Adrienne Wallace pointed out to me when she wrote and asked me to raise this was the &euro;60 million of funding that was ring-fenced for children in need and handed back by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to the State leaving 6,000 children without a social worker.  It might seem a moot point but it is directly connected.  I also have a letter from a former worker in the D&oacute;chas family centre in Liscarne in Clondalkin made redundant due to - guess what - funding issues.  She worked directly with parents and children and often the families were referred to her due to protection concerns.  Most of the clients who attend the centre have addiction issues but due to the significant loss of funding, as funding was withdrawn from the centre, two or three social workers were made redundant.  However, the need has not gone away.  In one of the most deprived areas of the city, the need still exists.  The D&oacute;chas centre should be fully staffed and funded and providing for the people of Clondalkin.  In his response, the Minister might explain not only that this is an accountancy issue but where is the morality in &euro;60 million that was dedicated and ring-fenced for children in need being handed back by Tusla to the State when there are over 6,000 children who need social workers and there is only one third of the provision for refuges for victims of domestic violence in this country?<\/p>  <p>  Like Deputy Coppinger, I was inspired by the feminist uprising that is taking place from India to Chile, to France, to Italy, to Spain and I hope spills over here.  Women are now demanding an end not only to domestic violence, but to the disregard of their needs and the funding that is required to help empower them and their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100061#OOO00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1576094400,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Connolly.<\/p>  <p>  First, I acknowledge the time of year, Christmas time, which for many is a happy and joyful time of year, but for some women experiencing domestic violence and their children, can be the most violent time.<\/p>  <p>  Alarmingly, the Stop Domestic Violence In Ireland organisation has stated it is already on course to record its busiest ever December after it was inundated with calls over the past few weeks.  Services helping victims of domestic violence were unable to meet more than 3,000 requests for safe accommodation last year and this is a story repeating itself year after year due to the fact that the Government continues to starve funding to support services across the country.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak of the situation facing domestic violence services in my constituency of Donegal.  Currently, the Tusla domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services programme provides funding to three services in County Donegal.  However, it provides only a marginal amount of funding to the vitally important domestic violence service in Inishowen, known as Lifeline.<\/p>  <p>  Lifeline Inishowen domestic violence service provides a community response offering a first step to support women and children in Inishowen who are experiencing domestic violence.  This is because Tusla believes that funding additional domestic violence services in Donegal, such as to Lifeline, would lead to a so-called \"duplication of service provision in the Inishowen area and a risk of fragmentation of services if several organisations were to provide similar services within the same geographical area.\"<\/p>  <p>  Without adequate funding for Lifeline services, the nearest refuge or support centre is in Letterkenny which could mean a two-hour drive for women coming down from Inishowen.  So that the House knows, Inishowen is the size of Longford.  One is talking about a small part of Donegal the size of a county in another part of Ireland.  That is not practical for women experiencing domestic violence or abuse and yet Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs insist that providing funding to Lifeline in Inishowen would be a duplication.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is putting women and children's lives at risk by not adequately funding the support services.  For example, no funding was provided for the domestic violence sector in budget 2020.  Fine Gael and the Government is continuing to starve the professional support services of the funding and resources these organisations need to deal with the increased numbers coming forward experiencing domestic violence.  Furthermore, many professionals within the services are also struggling to maintain and recruit staff because of the low pay parity in the sector.<\/p> <p> I will conclude by referring to the Istanbul Convention, which was put forward by the Council of Europe and which Ireland ratified on 8 March this year.  The Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence provides actions obliging State to do all that is in its power to combat domestic violence.  Interestingly in the case of Lifeline, the convention states: \"Parties shall recognise, encourage and support, at all levels, the work of relevant non-governmental organisations and of civil society active in combating violence against women and establish effective co-operation with these organisations.\"  I hope the Minister will reflect on this aspect of the convention and compare it to the current view as stated by Tusla with regard to Lifeline Inishowen as well as other domestic violence services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100061#OOO00300","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576095000,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I do not welcome this opportunity because taking part in statements on domestic violence is disturbing and upsetting.  Let me start in a positive manner.  I welcome the progress.  I welcome the Domestic Violence Act 2018 that introduced a new offence and extended the range for barring orders; the Garda divisional protective services units and note they are being rolled out; and the Minister's statement that domestic violence is a priority.  Then I look at his speech overall, which runs to the three pages of small print with a lot of content, and consider what is in it and what is left out.  I am afraid the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is present to take my contribution.  The Minister talked about domestic violence being a scourge on our society.  That might  explain why the prevalence of domestic violence has remained so high.  I would not use the word &quot;scourge&quot;.  Domestic violence is abuse and a crime.  The manner in which we have dealt with it as a society is wrong.  We make our statements in the context of the 16 days of action.  Can the Minister of State imagine that we need to have 16 days of action year after year, nationally and internationally, to bring home the point that women are not safe, especially in their own homes?  The 16 days finished yesterday.  I make this contribution in the context of a Minister telling us he is committed, although his speech contains no reference at all to the lack of refuges.  There is no mention of the fact that we are supposed to have 472 refuge spaces but there are only 141.  I wish we did not need any of them but according to international data and figures, we require 472 refuge spaces to allow women and children to go to a place of safety, yet we have 141.<\/p><p>I will turn to the estimated annual economic cost.  I like to do this maybe to appeal to the male mentality more than the female, although I do not mean to be disrespectful, in the hope that figures might grasp the Deputies.  The estimated annual cost of domestic violence to the economy is &euro;2.2 billion based on EU estimated costs for each member state in respect of health bills, policing, loss of productivity and court procedures.  However, Safe Ireland and NUIG in collaborative research have said that the estimated cost of domestic violence is far greater.  The research is currently examining the economic and social costs of domestic violence across three phases of a survivor's journey from living with the abusive relationship to relocation and recovery.  Dr. Caroline Forde, a researcher at the Centre for Global Women's Studies in NUI Galway, stated:<\/p><p>Domestic violence is more than a human rights violation and public health issue.  By exploring its wider economic and social impact, we highlight the often invisible or ignored consequences for individuals, households, the community and society.<\/p><p>I recall Erin Pizzey's book<i>, Scream Quietly or the Neighbours Will Hear<\/i>, which left a lasting impression on me.  That was more than 40 years ago and women are still screaming quietly to prevent the neighbours hearing, unfortunately.  On 8 May of this year the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children and Youth Affairs was told that refuges are turning away more women and children than they are accommodating.  Margaret Martin, executive director of Women's Aid, stated that 52% of women and children - I doubt that figure so I will have to check it - who turn up to women's refuges are turned away.  They are told they are full.  The fact that they have fled the abusive partner puts them at even more risk.  Noeline Blackwell, chief executive of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, reports an explosion in demand for the centre's therapeutic services.  It is not just a regular increase.  The number of people who are disclosing sexual violence and seeking the treatment they need has increased enormously.  The Garda figures are seriously deficient and problematic.  We know this from their appearances at various committees.  Misclassification of some domestic crimes has left victims of abuse at risk of being attacked again.  In total from 2003 to May 2017, there were 89 additional homicides that had not been counted in official Garda figures.  The CSO is publishing Garda crime figures under reservation, with the director general of the office telling us at the Committee of Public Accounts that the doubts around those statistics will not be lifted next year or in all likelihood the year after that.  We are talking about a number of years.  Some 10,782 women and 2,572 children received support from domestic violence services in 2018.  I have to quote the figure for those who were turned away - 3,256 requests - because the refuges were full.<\/p><p>I do not know how any Minister can come in here and tell us he is making it a priority, which I want to welcome, without basing it on fact or evidence and without going through some of the gaps that exist on the ground and without looking at homelessness.  Women who do get places in refuges are not even included in the homeless figures.  I have a great difficulty with that.  I also have a great difficulty with many Ministers coming in making statements and not backing them up.  Then we are subjected to Science Foundation Ireland in the audiovisual room, who put an extraordinary and proper emphasis on evidence-based policy.  The Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland, SAVI, report of 2001 or 2002 is frightening as it highlights the prevalence of sexual and domestic violence.  We begged and appealed and did everything possible for the past three and a half years to get the Government to review that and bring it up to date.  Finally we succeeded in a piecemeal fashion and the up-to-date report is going to come at some stage in the future - I think in 2025.  We must look at the figures on the ground and the cost on a human level and on an economic level and realise that we need to deal with it and that it makes sense to deal with it in a more efficient and effective way.  I would be with the Minister if he had said &quot;Look, we realise that&quot;, but we got three pages of a speech that tells us the Government has approved this legislation and that legislation without looking at the operation on the ground or listening to Safe Ireland and all of the other organisations.  I will finish with Galway, where we have Domestic Violence Response, DVR, in Oughterard doing sterling work and struggling on the ground with a tiny funding.  A report commissioned by Tusla was never published.  Through parliamentary questions, I have learned it might be published some time in the new year.  If the Government wants to create trust and an environment where we can work together, the facts have to come out.  The organisations on the ground are struggling to survive and without them, we would not even have the services that we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100062#PPP00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1576095000,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Troy.  One in four women in Ireland experiences physical and sexual violence by an intimate partner.  Over the past 32 years, 126 women have been killed by a current or former partner.  The Garda states that domestic homicides have outpaced gangland murders by almost two to one in the past three years.  The Garda responds to between 500 and 600 domestic abuse calls a week.  These statistics are horrific.  It is clear that the women of Ireland are being failed.  Women and children are being turned away from refuge centres due to a lack of space and professional support services.  Despite this, budget 2020 failed to provide any additional funding for the domestic violence sector.  The Government must commit to meeting its obligations under the Istanbul Convention.  Under this, there should be 472 refuge spaces for victims of domestic violence, yet Ireland only has 141, less than 30% of the required spaces.<\/p> <p>Nine counties have no places for women seeking refuge.  To escape, women need somewhere to go.  This also affects men, albeit in smaller numbers, but it is every bit as serious when it happens to them.  Fianna F&aacute;il calls on the Government to allocate the necessary funding for the establishment of a dedicated family law court as a matter of urgency.  The conditions in which family law and child care cases are heard are totally unsuitable.  I practised family law as a barrister for approximately seven years and experienced the lack of privacy and dignity for people looking for justice, help and support in many family law courts throughout Ireland.  I commend the Government for bringing in the Domestic Violence Act 2018.  That was a very important step.  <br\/><br\/>People who have suffered domestic violence are more likely than others to suffer from mental illness, depression and anxiety.  This may be obvious but it is very important because psychological violence is also very real and serious.  The abuser knows what buttons to push.  It is important to address mental illness and mental health effects to help people's recovery. <br\/><br\/>I recently attended the launch of the exhibition at the Wexford omen's refuge for the 16 days of action opposing violence against women.  It was a very powerful exhibition.  The most powerful exhibit was probably the plastic shopping bag with only a few items of clothing.  It reminds us that when people flee domestic violence they very often have to flee with no notice, at the first available opportunity.  They leave with almost nothing.  Other exhibits were the broken phones with messages of hate and control on them, a smashed car window and one message which read, &quot;The real monsters never lived under my bed, they held me close and told me they loved me.&quot;  That was a very powerful message.  I compliment Pauline Ennis and her team and all the people who work in, support and contribute to the Wexford Women's Refuge in Wexford town.  They do phenomenal work and deserve as much support as possible. <br\/><br\/>Deputy Martin Kenny raised an important point about the admissibility of evidence.  As someone who practised criminal and civil law, I argued this point before judges and have seen others argue it.  There is confusion in our courts over the admissibility of a criminal conviction in a civil court.  Lay litigants, as many in the family law courts are, may not be aware of the Supreme Court judgment in the Catherine Nevin case in February this year.  Several years ago, the then President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, found that a criminal conviction was admissible in the case that was brought to disinherit Katherine Nevin.  That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal and on 7 February 2019, the Supreme Court, in a judgment by Ms Justice Iseult O'Malley, upheld that appeal.  A criminal conviction is admissible in a civil case as <i>prima facie<\/i>evidence of what that conviction is for.  I have given the date of the decision in case people need to use it.  It is always a matter for the judge to decide whether to admit that as evidence but it is important that the judgment be available.  I thank Deputy Kenny for bringing up that important point which I had forgotten about but it does arise regularly.  I hope that judgment can be used by people who need it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100062#PPP00300","speaker":"1354","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576095600,"counter":588,"content":"<p>This is an important issue but, as a previous speaker has said, it is unfortunate that statements such as this tend to be used almost as fillers at the end of the day or on occasions in the D&aacute;il that are not conducive to maximum attendance for various reasons.  When commencing the debate, the Minister was very self-congratulatory about the work the Government has done, citing the ratification of the Istanbul Convention earlier this year.  The convention was ratified by the Council of Europe in 2011.  It took us until 2015 to sign it and a further four years for it to be ratified.  It is one thing to ratify a convention but it is another to back it up with adequate resources and the legislation to give it effect.<\/p>  <p>  Not one of us knows the women or men affected daily by domestic abuse.  The figure has been quoted of one in four women in Ireland experiencing physical and sexual violence from an intimate partner.  That is a striking figure but we do not know the figures for men.  This week a gentleman was brought to my constituency office by his siblings.  He had to leave the family home for his and his children's well-being.  I filled out the housing application form but because he owns a house and his name is on its title deeds, it will take time for the council to process that application and to ensure he can avail of a housing assistance payment, HAP.  The same happens to women who have to leave a house in a hurry for their own safety.  It takes too much time.  <\/p>  <p>  The obligations under the Istanbul Convention state that we should have 472 refuge spaces for victims of domestic violence but we have only 141.  We are only meeting 30% our target and when people come to our offices for assistance, the system prevents us from providing it.  I have no doubt that across the political divide we do our level best to get assistance.  That needs to be considered.  There should be greater flexibility to support people in this situation.  <\/p>  <p>  I compliment the good work of Teach F&aacute;ilte in Mullingar as a centre for women who suffer domestic abuse.  The recurring theme in the debate is that these centres are not adequately resourced.  While Teach F&aacute;ilte is celebrating a significant anniversary this year, it would not be there were it not for the hard work and dedication of a voluntary committee who have to go out day in, day out to raise critical funds.  Without those fundraising events, those doors would not be open and if they were not open, more women would be left in precarious, dangerous situations for much longer.  Sharon O'Halloran, the chief executive officer of Safe Ireland, said earlier this week: \"Recycled budget announcements and grand statements of commitments will do very little for the women and children coming to our services every day.\"  The Minister should cease the self-congratulations and commit to adequately resourcing these centres so that when women who find themselves in a precarious situation present, they will not be turned away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100063#QQQ00200","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1576095600,"counter":589,"content":"<p>Once again I raise the non-provision of a refuge in Cavan-Monaghan for victims of domestic violence.  I have raised this issue through parliamentary questions and in other D&aacute;il debates over recent years and, unfortunately, little or no progress has been made in that respect.  Women who are victims of domestic violence from the wide geographical area of Cavan-Monaghan have to source emergency specialist accommodation in other areas.<\/p> <p>Some of them look for help in the neighbouring counties of Louth and Meath, where the centres are already under huge pressure.  Women in north-west Cavan have to seek out accommodation or specialist support from services in County Sligo.  Similarly, in our neighbouring county of Monaghan, people must look to the services in counties Louth or Meath for help.  That is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> Like Deputy Troy, I acknowledge the great work done by the many voluntary organisations.  They do receive some support from Government, through several Departments, but they depend very heavily on fundraising.  Tearmann Domestic Violence Services in County Monaghan provides a range of community-based services for victims of domestic violence, including emotional and practical support, advocacy and accompaniment and support in court.  It also provides an outreach service in Cavan town.  I commend the people who founded that service and who work there, as well as the people who support its necessary fundraising efforts.<\/p> <p> In line with requirements under the Istanbul Convention and commitments made under the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, there is a need to expand the region of distribution of services, including accommodation services.  I have had correspondence from Tusla, following parliamentary questions to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, which clearly outlines its concerns about the unevenness in the availability of specialist emergency domestic violence accommodation across the country.  There are nine counties, including Cavan and Monaghan, which I represent, which do not have a specialist service.  I welcome that Tusla has had some contact with stakeholders in the Cavan-Monaghan area to explore potential options for taking forward the provision of emergency accommodation in the area.  I appeal to the Minister of State, through his Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, to ensure adequate funding is provided to Tusla so that practical progress can be made.  We need to see centres being identified and established and the necessary support staff put in place.  Nationally, Tusla is undertaking a domestic violence provision review.  I hope that review will result in safe accommodation and services for people affected by domestic violence where there is currently a total lacuna in terms of provision.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, in the last correspondence I had from it, Tusla indicated that funding will not be available for significant service developments in 2020.  However, the agency will, I was told, continue to plan towards and resource future developments in line with commissioning priorities.  I have heard that type of promise before.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the huge geographical area encompassed by the borders of the counties of Cavan and Monaghan, which stretches practically from the west to the east coast, without a service in any part of either county.  As I outlined, we are depending on services in neighbouring counties which are under pressure as they are.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure that areas like Cavan and Monaghan are prioritised when future services are being developed.<\/p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Browne, noted that one in four women in Ireland experiences physical and sexual violence from an intimate partner and that, over the past 32 years, 126 women were killed by a current or former partner.  Those statistics are startling, frightening and woeful.  It is dreadful to consider that so much violence has been inflicted on women over the course of years.  Unfortunately, that violence continues today and it is totally reprehensible.  Thousands of women and children are being turned away from refuge centres due to a lack of space and a shortage of professional support services.  It is an area that must be prioritised for investment.  To reiterate, there are nine counties with no refuge places and the situation is made worse by the housing crisis that prevails.<\/p> <p> Other speakers referred to the bravery demonstrated by women who have spoken out about their experiences.  It must be a harrowing experience in itself to go public in that way and we owe them a debt of gratitude.  One way to show that gratitude would be to ensure that adequate services are provided and that people who are suffering through domestic violence have resort to accommodation and support services when they need them.  I am being parochial in appealing to the Minister of State to examine the situation in the two counties I represent.  I am anxious that we make progress in providing necessary services and accommodation there and throughout the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100063#QQQ00300","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576096200,"counter":591,"content":"<p>This is an important and timely debate that will help to raise awareness of what Deputy Connolly described as the crime of domestic abuse and violence and the steps being taken to counter it.

While acknowledging Deputy Connolly's observation regarding the reliability of figures, I am struck by the information from the Garda Commissioner, as referred to by the Minister, that there are 30,000 domestic abuse calls every year.  Those numbers reflect the instances where people had the courage to make a call.  One wonders why so much of this awful criminal abuse is occurring in our society.  What has gone wrong that it is happening?  It is a big question.<\/p>  <p>  No single Department or organisation will be able to deal with this issue on its own.

All of those aspects are vital.  Several speakers referred to the domestic violence and victims legislation that was passed in recent years.  I was involved in both of those debates, both in this House and in the Seanad.  I was Chairman of the committee where the practice of coercive control was discussed some years ago.  That awful and pervasive practice is now a crime in this country and garda&iacute; are being trained in how to deal with it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which runs from 2016 to 2021.  It is a whole-of-Government response to domestic and sexual violence, encompassing a wide range of actions to be implemented by Departments and agencies.  Its first objective is to improve services to victims.  I take on board colleagues' points about the need for more refuges and safe spaces, and the distinction between the two.  The second element of the strategy is awareness raising to help change attitudes in society and prevent domestic and sexual abuse.  The Department of Justice and Equality is midway through a six-year, two-part national awareness campaign, for the first three years of which the What Would You Do? campaign focused on various aspects of domestic violence.  Such campaigns are helpful if they encourage people to come forward and report abuse.  The third component of the national strategy is holding perpetrators to account.  The CHOICES programme, which began in 2017, works with men who have engaged in domestic violence and provides support to their partners and ex-partners.  It is run by MOVE Ireland, the Men's Development Network and the north-east domestic violence intervention programme.  The strategy is a living document to which actions are added on an ongoing basis.  Currently, there are 72 actions, 13 of which were added since its publication in 2016.  The success of the strategy is dependent on the community and voluntary sector, which plays a crucial role in monitoring it.  That collaboration between State agencies and the community and voluntary sector is vital if we are to tackle this issue properly.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the importance of funding and have taken note of the concerns raised by Deputies in this regard.<\/p> <p>Tusla has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual or gender-based violence, with &euro;25.3 million allocated to it for these services in 2019.  It met my Department and the strategy national monitoring committee today and will carry out a review of needs in terms of numbers of spaces and other support services.  It is hoped we will shortly have a response from that.  Working with relevant NGOs, my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the strategy monitoring committee is the forum at which all stakeholders are represented and will build a consensus on the precise approach Ireland must adopt to ensure we meet the very real needs to which Deputies have referred.<\/p> <p> A transformation programme under way this year in my Department has changed how it approaches many issues.  It has improved collaboration through a strengthened partnership with key NGOs in this area and bolstered the Department's policy capacity.  As Deputies will be aware, the aim of the transformation is to create a Department that is more agile, evidence-based and open, while remaining loyal to traditional Civil Service values of integrity, impartiality and professionalism.  Work in this area was carried out by Cosc recently, but the Department has reorganised into specialist teams with a focus on specific functions relating to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The intention is that the Department will be in a better position to deliver on its strategic objectives.  More clearly defined roles and responsibilities will mean improved accountability, while services will be delivered in a better and more streamlined way.  Information will be shared with stakeholders and the public in a more proactive way through a dedicated transparency function.  The Department aims to ensure that the important issues within our responsibility, including in respect of tackling domestic violence, will be handled in a better way in the future.  This renewed engagement with stakeholders will be important to ensure that those actions are achieved and will help us to look forward and prepare the groundwork for the next iteration of the strategy in 2021.  It will continue to work on behalf of and for victims of these crimes.<\/p> <p> I am grateful to the Deputies who contributed on this very important topic. I thank the Business Committee for allocating time for statements on domestic violence which has allowed me to outline the changes that have been made this year to tackle the issue.  I acknowledge that we have far more to do to reduce domestic violence and tackle its awful effects.  Important progress has been made this year with the ratification of the Istanbul Convention and the passage of legislation.  All Deputies must do more on the issue.  The Department and the Government, in partnership with civil society, will continue to prioritise the fight against domestic violence.  This debate has been an important part of that process.  I thank Deputies for their robust, honest and straightforward contributions and for bringing this very important issue to the fore again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100064#RRR00200","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Scouting Ireland: Statements (Resumed)","time":1576096800,"counter":593,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100065#SSS00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1576096800,"counter":594,"content":"<p>Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin was in possession but is not present.

Similar issues in many sectors of society have too often come to light.  The victims in each case have real experiences and have had to suffer in silence for far too long the scars inflicted upon them by those experiences.  Failing our children is not, and never can be, acceptable.  The victims deserve to have their voices and stories heard, while those responsible must be held to account.  The protection of our children is of paramount importance.  The legacy issues which have come to light in respect of scouting in Ireland have undermined public confidence in the scouting movement. <\/p>  <p>  The report into historic abuses is expected to be completed in February.  It will be important in terms of ensuring attention is drawn to all aspects of historic abuse and sending the message that the culture of silence which permeated the scouting movement in respect of these abuses will no longer be tolerated.  Without acknowledging the evidence of cover-ups, we cannot fully address the abuses that took place.  It is a sad indictment of our society that anyone would contemplate trying to cover up abuses which occurred.  Such actions are wholly disrespectful to the victims.<\/p>  <p>  Representatives of Scouting Ireland who appeared last week before the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, which I chair, provided an update regarding the files held by the Scouting Ireland safeguarding team.  As of March of this year, Scouting Ireland held 995 files, including historic files from the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland and the Scouting Association of Ireland, as well as Scouting Ireland files from 2003 until January of this year.  I acknowledge that many of the files are not related to cases of sexual abuse, but the number of files held is significant.  Some 457 of the 995 files are classified as containing abuse and, of them, 401 relate to sexual abuse involving 247 alleged perpetrators.  Those figures were provided to the committee following its meeting last week.  I note that Scouting Ireland stated the number of files is not equivalent to the number of abuse cases.  Scouting Ireland stated all abuse cases have been reported to the relevant authorities, but the sheer volume of files relating to sexual abuse is astounding and shameful.  It is shameful that abuse, particularly sexual abuse, could happen in one case, let alone the number identified in the files held by the Scouting Ireland safeguarding team.<\/p>  <p>  The cases relating to abuse and sexual abuse of children have called the future of the scouting movement in Ireland into question.  Many parents are concerned about allowing their children to become part of the scouting movement.  Action must be taken by Scouting Ireland to fully address these concerns.  As a parent, this conversation has taken place within my family, as is the case for many families throughout the country.  Scouting Ireland has recognised the damage caused by these revelations, as well as the more recent evidence of a cover-up outlined by its consultant, Mr. Ian Elliott, at a meeting of the committee some weeks ago.  Another report consisting of a barrister's opinion regarding certain aspects of the scouting operation in recent years is due to be published and may provide an opportunity to restore public confidence in the organisation and how it is currently operating.  However, once confidence is lost, it is not easily rebuilt.  The challenges facing Scouting Ireland in this regard are significant and the concerns parents and guardians may hold are fully understandable.  Scouting groups are well embedded in local communities and those involved are well known and trusted.  However, the safeguarding issues may be a cause of concern parents and guardians worried without it being a reflection on the great work of the many people working at grassroots within the organisation.<\/p>  <p>  There has been discussion on the establishment of a statutory inquiry into allegations of historic child sexual abuse within legacy scouting organisations.  Such an investigation would be warranted.  However, it is important that we allow the internal investigation within Scouting Ireland to be completed and made available to the Minister and the committee for consideration, as Scouting Ireland has committed.  I hope that in February or March we will collectively be in a position to make a recommendation to the Department on whether the committee believes a statutory inquiry would be appropriate, notwithstanding the position of any political party or Independent.  That is the appropriate course of action for the committee, given the significant work it has put into the issue.  I wish to acknowledge the Minister picking up on my statement at last week's committee meeting that, after Tusla, Scouting Ireland has consumed the largest portion of the committee's time over the past year or so.  That has been acknowledged by other committee members.  I commend and appreciate their support in getting through the business of the committee relating to Scouting Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Nothing can right the wrongs suffered by victims of child sexual abuse, but we must do all we can to ensure accountability and that victims are listened to as well as heard.  I am aware that those who contact the Scouting Ireland helpline are offered counselling.<\/p> <p>Indeed, it has also been brought to my attention that individuals who were not subject to abuse at the hands of those in the scouting movement in the past have also been offered counselling and support from Scouting Ireland.  That should be put into the public domain.  We must ensure that victims know that supports are available to them and that they receive every assistance to help them address the trauma they experienced.<\/p> <p> Our society has a shameful past when it comes to historical sexual abuse allegations, not just in legacy scouting organisations but also, unfortunately, across a number of sectors.  In the past we have failed children and young people and today we must do everything we can to address that wrong.  As legislators, we can never do anything to undo the wrongs of the past, but we must do all in our power to support victims.  We cannot sweep those injustices under the rug.  We must address them head on and work collectively in both Houses to ensure they are never repeated in the future.<\/p> <p> I wish to record my appreciation of the willingness of not just the scouting movement to appear before us but also of the volunteers throughout the country who have been in touch with all Members, on multiple occasions in many instances.  The hierarchy of Scouting Ireland has changed, but it has appeared before the committee on a number of occasions.  I appreciate the structural changes it has made on foot of the recommendations and the Minister's announcement that the former Senator, Jillian van Turnhout, will return to assess Scouting Ireland in respect of the previous recommendations she made.  That is warranted.  Given the public awareness of this issue, it is something we must follow up.<\/p> <p> It is a pity the Minister could not be present, but given the lateness of the hour and the fact that the debate was rescheduled, perhaps she thought it would be dealt with tomorrow.  It is important that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs continues to press Scouting Ireland and Mr. Elliott to make this report on historical abuse cases available as quickly as possible so recommendations can flow from it in terms of what we can learn from it and what we can do to ensure such abuse does not recur in the future.  If any supports are not being provided, we can identify them through that report.  I hope it will be published well in advance of the next general election and certainly by the end of February, which is the commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100065#SSS00400","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576097400,"counter":597,"content":"<p>While I acknowledge that failures in previous decades were undoubtedly highlighted in RT&Eacute;'s \"Scouts Dishonour\" programme, the programme also outlined details of a case that involved an alleged abuser who was reported to the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland in the 1980s and 1990s but was only removed from Scouting Ireland in 2018.  That is not a historical failure but a current one.  Scouting Ireland's full review conducted in August 2012 found that no volunteers active in the commissioning organisation in 2012 were found to be named in the legacy files.  Based on the information aired on RT&Eacute;, this is not the case.  How is it that an alleged abuser was able to continue in his role with Scouting Ireland even though the accusations had been reported in previous decades?  Was his file overlooked in 2012, and if so, why?<\/p>  <p>  Scouting Ireland has provided a breakdown of 401 sexual abuse files it has in its possession.  All of them have been reported to the appropriate authorities, which is reassuring.  It is important to refer to Scouting Ireland's safeguarding file overview of 29 March 2019.  Deputy Farrell, Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, spoke about the 995 files.  They were broken down as follows: 457 as abuse, 516 as not abuse, and ten other files.  On the abuse classification, 401 were classified as sexual abuse, 13 were classified as emotional, five were classified as neglect, and 38 were classified as physical.  The sexual abuse breakdown was 321 adult on youth, two were adult on adult, seven were unclassified, and 70 were youth on youth.  Scouting Ireland talks continuously about the 321 from the breakdown.  There are still another 70 to 80 files that we have not discussed.  What is not clear to me - I put this question to Scouting Ireland last week and followed up with it today when its representatives were before the committee, but I am still awaiting a reply - is how many of the 401 files are historical files from the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland and the Scouting Association of Ireland and how many relate to Scouting Ireland files that have been created between its founding in 2003 and 2019.  We must have clarity on this issue, but it does not appear to be forthcoming.<\/p>  <p>  It is crucial that an independent, statutory inquiry is held into the child abuse allegations in the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland, the Scouting Association of Ireland and Scouting Ireland.  Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, the former special rapporteur on child protection, has said any review must be independent, prompt, effective and transparent.  While I do not doubt Ian Elliott's qualifications or professionalism in conducting this so-called learning review, it does not change the fact that Scouting Ireland previously employed Mr. Elliott as its interim safeguarding manager in 2018.  The level of independence is questionable.  It is clear there must be an independent inquiry to ensure wrongdoing is exposed and the structural failings in these organisations are documented.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, must immediately outline what her Department is doing to address these serious issues.  I welcome her announcement last week in the D&aacute;il regarding Jillian van Turnhout conducting another comprehensive review on what was recommended previously.  Trust has been broken and we must remedy this urgently.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the volunteers and scout troops throughout the country.  They have been rocked by what has been happening for the past 18 months in Scouting Ireland.  \"Prime Time\" programmes and Oireachtas debates do nothing to instil confidence in parents, volunteers and children.  It is a fabulous organisation at grassroots level.  It is supported and embedded in most communities in Ireland and I wish to see that continue.  However, governance is required, and stability and reassurance must come down from the top.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100066#TTT00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1576097400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I echo the words of the contributors this evening, not least those of my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, who has been vigilant on this matter.  In particular, I echo her concluding comments.  There is not a Deputy in the country who does not have multiple numbers of scout troops in their constituency.  In my 20 years' experience as a public representative, it is an organisation that seeks the help of its public representatives least often and is the least likely group to impose on its Deputies and councillors.  It does its work quietly, and that might have led to some of its problems at the start of this.  Public representatives, unless they were deeply involved with the organisation as volunteers, tended not to know much about the structures of the organisation, and perhaps that left it vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most famous scouting centres in Ireland, Larch Hill, is in my constituency.  It is an amazing facility that is run by great volunteers.  Up to 40,000 children are under the care of Scouting Ireland across the island of Ireland, and we are thinking of them.  We also think of the adults who volunteer their time and have done so for years.  They give up a huge amount of time.  On some occasions there are up to 5,000 scouts at Larch Hill.  It is something the local population is not aware of in terms of traffic because it moves quietly and seamlessly.  The volunteers do great work and equip young children with amazing skills.  They are skills one would not necessarily acquire in sports.  Sports do not always suit every child, nor does being a boy or girl scout suit every child, but those who opt for it learn amazing skills.  That cannot be left unsaid.<\/p>  <p>  I was in the Chamber last week when the Minister, Deputy Zappone, spoke on this.  As Minister, she has responsibility, so her words carry a great deal of weight.<\/p> <p>Her words were broadly positive and cautious in regard to the work that has been done.  She rightly identified the fact there are many in this House who have been vigilant in respect of Scouting Ireland and its response, particularly its initial poor response, to the accusations and findings of that famous \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme.  She also acknowledged the fact this type of public scrutiny, and the type of scrutiny that has gone on in this House, is appropriate.  The reason people elect us to represent them in their communities is that we keep them safe, we bring in laws and scrutinise those organisations that ought to be scrutinised, and we do not let up on that and we remain vigilant in that regard, as Deputy Rabbitte has been vigilant.<\/p> <p> The Minister made many positive comments in regard to the progress Scouting Ireland has made and which must be acknowledged.  It is a very difficult time for the organisation and for the executives of the organisation in having to trawl through the many hundreds of files that have been identified in regard to the perpetrating of sexual abuse on young, innocent children.  Their parents set them off on what ought to have been a journey of liberation and joy to enjoy with their friends and their peers, yet it was to turn so sour for them and then to be buried for so long.  It is not the first time in our history this has happened, as the Minister said.<\/p> <p> The Minister acknowledged there are Members on different sides of the House who, for reasons outlined by Deputy Rabbitte, are looking for a statutory inquiry, and the Minister also acknowledged she is open to consideration of that.  With the greatest of respect to everybody who has been involved, and notwithstanding the reputations of those who have been involved, anybody knows that when an organisation, or even a tiny part of it, has come into disrepute, the recovery of that organisation cannot be contaminated in any way by any individual, or by the fact they may have operated in a previous capacity with that organisation.  It is for that compelling reason and so the parents of this country, the parents in our constituencies, who are the greatest protectors of their children, can know that when this torrid story is finally complete, they will know that the steps that are being taken are being taken with the greatest efficacy and independence and without any contamination in terms of motive, although I am not ascribing any motive to anybody.  The clear implication is that only such a statutory inquiry, carried out by somebody who has never had anything to do any of the organisations involved, is one that will satisfy the public.  Let us remember the public purse also has to be protected in regard to Scouting Ireland.<\/p> <p> In saying that, I also welcome that the Minister has taken the weighty decision, and it is a burdensome decision for any Minister, to continue funding for Scouting Ireland until April 2020.  Therefore, it is a step-by-step recovery of the organisation's reputation and it is a tribute to those who are managing it and involved in it.  There is just this last little step that has to be taken to ensure the organisation knows it has the absolute confidence of all of those stakeholders it engages with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100066#TTT00300","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576098000,"counter":600,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Zappone, I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  The Minister regrets she is not available to be here in person.  I take the opportunity to respond to a number of issues that have been raised, both last week by Deputy Rabbitte and again today by her and many others.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Ian Elliott's review of historical abuse, Mr. Elliott is a very highly respected expert in the area of child protection and safeguarding and he has a reputation for rigour and plain speaking.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, will give Mr. Elliott's analysis of historical abuse in legacy scouting organisations very careful consideration when it is shared with her in February next year.  It will also be shared with the joint Oireachtas committee.  If the joint Oireachtas committee comes to the conclusion that Mr. Elliott's report might itself benefit from being independently reviewed, then the Minister will, of course, consider this.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the call for a statutory inquiry, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, is giving very careful thought to the suggestion of establishing a statutory inquiry to investigate historical abuse within legacy scouting organisations and the Government will make a decision on the best way to proceed as soon as possible.  It will be important to ensure that any inquiry is an appropriate tool which will lead to the outcomes that are envisaged and the Minister, Deputy Zappone, is very mindful of the remarks made by Mr. Justice Charleton in the third interim report of the disclosures tribunal to the effect that a tribunal is a final resort.  Justice Charleton further stated: \"when a public controversy arises, the first option should be always to ask whether there are structures in place within the administration of public life which can enable facts to be found with such degree of certainty as to enable satisfaction at a reasonable level that the truth has been discovered.\"  We must also ensure that any inquiry does not interfere with or prejudice any other ongoing processes, such as civil or criminal proceedings.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister was happy to hear in a recent written progress report from Scouting Ireland that it had implemented all of Ms Jillian van Turnhout's recommendations that were laid out in her report of June 2018.  The Minister was pleased to report that Ms van Turnhout has agreed to meet again with Scouting Ireland in the new year to further discuss its implementation of her recommendations.  As Scouting Ireland said yesterday, it is open to scrutiny and the Minister welcomes this openness and transparency as we move to improve confidence further in the organisation's governance and safeguarding.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to have access to accurate figures when it comes to the numbers of case files held, the general nature of the content of these files and the further reporting that has taken place.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, notes that Scouting Ireland agreed to provide further clarity to the joint Oireachtas committee regarding this and she understands that it wrote last week to the Chairman and committee members to this end.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to disciplinary proceedings following the independent barrister's report, the Minister is aware that the disciplinary proceedings that followed Lorna Lynch's independent report have taken some time to progress.  While this can be frustrating, it is important to ensure that due process is followed and all parties have access to appropriate right of reply, as per the principles of natural justice.  The Minister understands that a timeframe is difficult to be certain about but, from last week's committee discussion, it looks like we might expect a conclusion to these proceedings early in the new year.<\/p>  <p>  In her statement on Thursday last week, Deputy Rabbitte raised the issue of the adult volunteer who was suspended in 2018, the same person raised in the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme as having had complaints made against them in the 1980s and 1990s.  The Minister has sought clarity from Scouting Ireland regarding this issue.  Scouting Ireland has this week reported to her officials that it cannot provide any detail on this case as it could potentially prejudice the ongoing legal process and-or the ongoing investigations being conducted by Tusla or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Scouting Ireland has confirmed, however, that all disclosures made to the child protection and safeguarding personnel in Scouting Ireland were indeed reported to State agencies, as required, and any advice or recommendations received from these agencies relating to these reported disclosures were absolutely followed.  Additionally, Scouting Ireland confirmed that all reportable cases identified in the 2012 review were confirmed as reported to the appropriate authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100067#UUU00200","speaker":"1241"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2019: Message from Select Committee","time":1576098000,"counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100067#UUU00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1576098000,"counter":602,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimates for public services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2019 - Vote 23.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121100067#UUU00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1576098000,"counter":603,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 December 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
