I am accompanied by Ms Patricia Cronin, assistant secretary with responsibility for governance and operations in the Department.  The total provision for the Department in 2020 is &euro;541.5 million, comprising &euro;404.8 million capital, inclusive of &euro;27.3 million in capital carryover from last year, and &euro;136.7 million for current spending.  Being before the committee at this time of the year to give a presentation on the 2020 Revised Estimates is unusual.<\/p> <p>  This time last year, the budget was framed to progress some key projects and policy objectives.  These span a number of areas of strategic national importance and encompass climate action, energy efficiency, communications, the environment, natural resources, waste management and inland fisheries.  In looking at each of the programme areas in detail, I will highlight some of the key areas.  Programme A, communications, was considered yesterday by the Select Committee on Transport and Communications Networks, so I will start with the energy area.<\/p> <p>  Programme B in energy aims to deliver energy-efficiency measures across the residential, public and business sectors.  This year the programme provides &euro;12.2 million to cover the operational costs of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and &euro;137.2 million to fund expanded sustainable energy programmes.  The focus this year was on the achievement of targets in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as the continued incentivisation of the uptake of electric vehicles to support further the transition to a sustainable future.  Funding for the sustainable energy programmes includes: the better energy warmer homes scheme, to deliver a range of energy-efficiency measures free of charge to low income households; the better energy homes scheme for homeowners, to provide grants towards a range of energy-efficiency measures; better energy communities programme, to encourage community partnerships to improve the thermal and electrical efficiency of the building stock in energy poor homes; targeted interventions in the commercial and public sectors, to deliver significant energy efficiency and energy savings while reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels; and grant funding to incentivise the purchase of new electric vehicles, support the installation of home charge points and the provision of on-street public chargers.  The programme also includes investment of &euro;10.7 million for energy research, include applied energy research and demonstration projects aimed to accelerate diversification away from fossil fuels to green energy.<\/p> <p>  The aim of programme C, natural resources, is to manage Ireland's mineral, hydrocarbon and other geological resources in a sustainable and productive manner.  Funding under this programme allows the Department to provide reliable geoscience support for environmental protection and the sustainable development of Ireland's natural resources, and to address the health and safety implications of certain historical mining sites.  The programme includes an allocation of just over &euro;11.6 million for Geological Survey Ireland services, including &euro;7 million for the Tellus and INFOMAR mapping projects.  The Tellus mapping project consists of airborne, geophysical measurements and ground geochemical sampling.  Data from the project will allow for improvement in geological maps and will facilitate better land use, planning and research.  The INFOMAR project is Ireland's national seabed survey and is managed by Geological Survey Ireland in co-operation with the Marine Institute.  Under the groundwater programme, the Geological Survey Ireland national network of turlough flood level gauges will provide enhanced data and models on turlough flooding to the Office of Public Works, OPW, and local authorities.  A sum of &euro;5 million is provided for mining services, including &euro;1.1 million for mine safety and monitoring work at the Avoca mines site.<\/p><p>There is also funding to develop an overall plan for the remediation of the legacy mines at Avoca and Silvermines.<\/p><p> Programme D covers inland fisheries.  It provides grant funding to Inland Fisheries Ireland, which is responsible for the conservation, management and regulation of Ireland's inland fisheries resource.  This year, Inland Fisheries Ireland has continued to deliver its licensing, permitting and enforcement responsibilities along with the rehabilitation of our rivers and streams.  The national strategy for angling development will ensure that Ireland's fish stocks and angling infrastructure are protected for their economic value and recreational benefit.  The inland fisheries programme includes an allocation of just under &euro;20.3 million towards the staff costs of Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Loughs Agency.  The Loughs Agency is a North-South body and is co-funded on a 50-50 basis by the Department and Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.  Also included in the programme is &euro;13.6 million for non-pay current and capital expenditure by the two agencies.<\/p><p> Programme E covers environment and waste management.  The purpose of the programme is to promote the protection of our natural environment, the health and well-being of our citizens and the transition to a resource-efficient circular economy in support of ecologically sustainable development, growth and jobs.  The environment and waste management programme includes an allocation of &euro;43 million towards staff costs, namely, non-pay current and the capital costs of the Environmental Protection Agency to allow it deliver on its mandate, research commitments in areas such as ambient air quality as well as the broader climate change agenda.  The programme includes &euro;11.25 million grant funding for the remediation of landfill sites.  A further &euro;1 million has been allocated for a waste management campaign to increase awareness of the necessity to minimise waste and increase recycling.<\/p><p> In the area of climate initiatives, an allocation of &euro;2.5 million will fund a range of Irish academic and research institutions involved in technical research and modelling to inform policy measures.  Funding of &euro;10 million is being provided for the climate action fund to cover potential drawdowns this year by the seven projects approved for funding of up to &euro;77 million.  This support is expected to leverage total investment of &euro;300 million in the period up to 2027.  A total of &euro;6 million is being provided for the just transition fund in 2020 to support innovative projects and the wider midlands region as it transitions away from peat.<\/p><p> Appropriations-in-aid are income receipts of the Department other than from the Exchequer.  Receipts are in the main comprised of mining and petroleum income amounting to &euro;8.8 million, a total of &euro;3.7 million in pension levy and pension contributions to the Department and its agencies, and a receipt of &euro;10 million from the energy efficiency national fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020102200002#A00300","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603321200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>We will commence with questions on programme B.

Throughout Europe, 20% of all energy is to come from renewable energy.  In our case, we had a legally binding target of 16%.  The latest projections from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland shows that between 12.5% and 13% will come from renewables.  We have a shortfall of 3% to 4%, primarily in the heat sector.  The directive requires that where a state is in shortfall the balance has to be met by those countries that have exceeded their targets.  Other countries have done this and the Netherlands is an example.  It had to purchase credits to be in compliance.  The Department is in negotiation with a number of European countries.  Before the end of the year we expect to be able to cover the majority of the compliance difference through entering into an agreement with two other countries.  The agreement has not yet been completed and the exact details are not fully arranged.  We will spend &euro;50 million on meeting our compliance with the directive.  It shows these European directives on renewables and climate emissions have real teeth and require us to act.  It is with real regret, from all concerned I am sure, that we did not spend &euro;50 million in recent years to meet the target and instead we will have to purchase these credits on the European market, which will bring us back into compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020102200002#B00400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1603321200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Is the amount paid relative to the degree to which the target is missed?

It will not just be in the Department but also in agencies such as the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which needs a significant increase in resources to be able to meet the targets we are setting ourselves.  The target of going from deep retrofitting 1,000 or 2,000 houses a year to 50,000 houses a year is no small task.  Going to at least 70% renewable energy, developing 5 GW of offshore wind in the Irish Sea will be a huge challenge.  It is an opportunity for the State.  All of these examples and many more of the actions we will take on energy will bring huge investment and benefits to the country.

It became a significant issue in that a survey at the time showed very serious levels of poisoning and pollution from historic legacy mining in the area.  If I recall correctly, the Avoca River had very high levels of cadmium, arsenic and other pollutants associated with mine sites.  It was discovered that the mine shafts and other mine areas were dangerously exposed to the public.  Therefore, there was genuine concern over public access to quite dangerous mine facilities.  There was significant expenditure to fence off the area and on ongoing measures to restore the water quality in the Avoca River.  When I became Minister again, I found it remarkable that we are spending &euro;900,000, or effectively &euro;1 million, making the mine safe in 2020.  This just shows the extent of legacy issues when mining sites are left.  The mining was primarily in the 19th century.  Based on memory, I believe silver was mined.  The mines were revived in the 1940s or 1950s.  Again, I am working from memory.  The mines were abandoned in more recent years but the legacy issues, particularly water pollution in the Avoca River, are very significant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12020102200002#C00400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1603321200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I am really pleased to see there will be a focus on this.

This progress, aligned with the planned Arklow wastewater treatment plant, will certainly facilitate a renewal of the town and region.  I ask, however, that the focus not be on mining issues alone; perhaps there could be a funding focus, although perhaps not through this programme, on the river itself, the biodiversity and the rewilding of the area.

The quality of our fisheries is as good a marker and test as any of what we are achieving on water quality and biodiversity protection in a variety of different ways, the acidity of our water reflecting land use and forestry and so on.  I suggest, with the arrival of a draft new corporate plan for 2021-25, that this might be an opportunity for the committee to bring in Inland Fisheries Ireland, look at this strategy and consider whether there are plans for the expansion, deepening and strengthening of its role.  If so, I would be very interested to see if we might get support for that from the Exchequer and to question the agency in detail on whether there is further ambition or widening or strengthening of the work it is doing.  In my own communications with the agency, I might suggest to it that such questioning by this committee may arise.  I would very much welcome if the committee were interested in reporting back to me in advance of next year's budget Estimate on what approach should be taken.  That would be useful work.<\/p> <p>  I have an interest in the salmon run.  It is one of those phenomena that are critically important.  Salmon are an endangered species.  Ireland is one of the few remaining countries in Europe which has a wild salmon run of any scale.  Anecdotally, I am told that this year, for whatever different reasons, there has been a significant return of salmon compared with previous years.  I do not know whether this is related to any immediate environmental factors around Covid, perhaps reduced fishing activity, but it has inspired me.  We have gone to a lot of work in recent years, with the removal of drift netting and other measures, to try to protect the salmon run.  If we could turn that into further increases in future years, I think it would be hugely symbolic for the protection of our natural systems.  If the committee were interested in looking at this and willing to do so and willing perhaps to bring the agency before the committee to explain its new corporate plan and to push its representatives, I would be very keen to back that up and follow it up.<\/p> <p>  I will be honest.

One of the issues that came up was their working with the three other Dublin local authorities to submit a joint bid to the Department under the scheme that exits for support for municipal e-charging systems and to do that on a citywide basis.  Rather than Fingal having a certain type of municipal charge and South Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire or Dublin City Council having another, I understand that the four councils have been working together to put in a joint application.  I look forward to receiving that.  As I said previously, it was very disappointing, given that the fund has been in place for a couple of years and that calls had been made for local authorities to come forward with applications for municipal e-charging, that only two councils - Dublin City Council and Louth County Council - made applications.  If the four councils to which I refer are able to put in an ambitious bid, that will start us in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  There is in the budget - and there will be in future budgets, including next year's - &euro;600 in support for the installation of home charging points.
