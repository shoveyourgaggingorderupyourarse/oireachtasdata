This was divided between two programmes: public expenditure and sectoral policy, costing &euro;18.6 million; and public service management and reform, costing &euro;40.9 million.  The latter included significant expenditure in respect of the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  For 2020, that office has been given its own separate Vote, with a budget of almost &euro;22 million.  Vote 11 is consequently significantly smaller for 2020.<br\/><br\/>At the end of 2019, the Department had underspent by &euro;2 million relative to its budget.  Unspent capital funding of &euro;146,000 was carried forward to 2020.  The remaining &euro;2 million was liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.  I issued a clear audit opinion on the 2019 appropriation account for Vote 11.<br\/><br\/>Vote 12 is used to pay pensions and retirement lump sums to civil servants and prison officers.Almost 26,400 pensions were in payment at the end of 2019.  Pension payments for other public servants are charged, directly or indirectly, to other Votes, including those for education, health, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions.  The gross spend on Vote 12 in 2019 amounted to just under &euro;600 million.  This represented an increase of 4.4% from 2018.  Appropriations-in-aid, mainly comprising employee pension contributions, amounted to &euro;337.7 million in 2019, which was up 34% from 2018.  The increase was mainly due to increased employee contributions in respect of the single public service pension scheme.  The net result was a surrender at the year end of &euro;110 million in respect of 2019.  Again, I issued a clear audit opinion regarding the 2019 appropriation account relating to Vote 12.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Chapter 3 is on Vote accounting and budget management.  Vote accounting and budget management is a standard annual report aggregating and summarising the results across all of the appropriation accounts.  It is produced because there is no other source of that aggregate information.  As the figure, which can now be shown on screen, indicates, there has been a strong upward trend in voted expenditure over recent years.  The report indicates that, in 2019, the total gross expenditure for all 42 Votes was &euro;56.9 billion.  After deduction of receipts totalling &euro;2.9 billion, the net expenditure for the year was &euro;54 billion.<br\/><br\/>One of the functions of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is the setting of frameworks for financial reporting by public sector bodies and publication of guidance and standards for corporate governance of public bodies.  This includes dissemination of an annual circular setting out guidance for Accounting Officers preparing their appropriation accounts.<br\/><br\/>Members will be aware that appropriation accounts are prepared on a cash basis.  This means that receipts and expenditure are recognised in the accounting period they occur.  Notes to the appropriation accounts present additional information on the accrual basis, which is used for standard commercial accounting.  Note 1 presents an operating cost statement for the Vote and note 2 presents a statement of financial position at the year end.  These are intended to be a form of income and expenditure account and balance sheet, respectively.<br\/><br\/>Chapters 4 and 5, from my 2018 report, deal with accounting issues that affect the appropriation accounts.  Chapter 4 deals with accounting for capital assets, that is assets used on a continuing basis and having a useful life of more than one year.  The 2018 appropriation accounts recognised capital assets with a net value of &euro;6 billion.  Over 80% of this value related to property assets, that is land and buildings, in use.<br\/><br\/>Current accounting practice by Departments has resulted in gaps in the assets recorded, and inconsistencies in asset valuations and deprecation rates.  The report highlights the need for action at a central level to address the lack of coherence caused by deficiencies in the accounting framework and includes a number of recommendations to achieve completeness and greater consistency.  The Department has indicated that it will implement the report recommendations in the context of the phased implementation of reforms arising from an assessment of the central government financial reporting framework in Ireland carried out by the OECD in 2019.<br\/><br\/>The aim of the operating cost statement in note 1 to each of the appropriation accounts is to show the total amount of resources consumed to provide a voted service.  As a result of how Votes are structured, some of the related expenses may be charged to different Votes.  For example, as mentioned earlier, the pension-related expenses of all civil servants are borne on Vote 12 irrespective of the Department where the pensioners worked.  Certain services are also provided by Departments and offices to others on the basis that, as specialists, the provider is able to perform the services most efficiently.  Examples are the Office of Public Works, OPW, which provides office accommodation across central government; and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, which provides ICT system supports especially for smaller Departments and offices.  These are referred to as allied services.<br\/><br\/>In 2018, the total costs of such allied services was calculated at: &euro;813 million, of which &euro;566 million, or almost 70%, related to superannuation and retirement allowances; and &euro;179 million, or 22%, related to the OPW.  The examination found that the accounting policies and guidance issued by the Department for the treatment of allied services did not provide a clear definition of allied service and, as a result, there was inconsistent treatment of these costs.  The examination also found that there were deficiencies in the various cost measurement and allocation bases used to calculate allied service cost.  For example, the apportionment of pension costs incurred in a year does not reflect standard accrual based accounting for pensions.<br\/><br\/>My office will continue to assist the Department to develop the accounting policies and guidance for accounting officers to ensure that the accrual based information, presented with appropriation accounts, is appropriate and consistent, and that it facilitates a smooth transition to full accrual accounting for central government, which is a long-term objective of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020102200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1603362600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

As they are aware, the agenda covers, as mentioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General: the appropriation accounts 2019 for Vote 11, which is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and Vote 12, which relates to superannuation; chapter 3 of the report on the accounts of the public services on Vote accounting and budget management; and chapters 4 and 5 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2018 in relation to accounting for capital assets and accounting for allied services.<br\/><br\/>In 2019, the two strategic goals of the Department were to manage public expenditure at sustainable levels and ensure effective and responsive public management and governance structures.  These goals are fully aligned with the two programmes set out in my Department's appropriation account for 2019.  I will address each of the agenda items now and return to reference some of the Department's key priorities in respect of expenditure management and reform before I conclude.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In the context of my Department's financial performance in 2019, its appropriation account shows a gross outturn of 97% of the budgeted allocation when capital carryover of &euro;144,000 is taken account.  The Department surrendered just under &euro;2 million of its &euro;59 million allocation to the Exchequer at the year end.  The increase in the allocation in 2019 over 2018 was due to recruitment costs that have since levelled out as headcount has remained largely static from the end of 2018 to the present.  While programme expenditure remained flat overall in 2019 when compared with 2018, financial resources moved between some programme subheads.  For example, from Civil Service learning and development - the OneLearning initiative - on the completion of its Civil Service-wide IT training and development system to other areas in the Department to progress cross-Government reforms such as the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer's Build to Share programme, which is a significant centralised shared service that we are providing in our Department for Departments and offices across the system.<\/p><p>This year is particularly significant for the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, and the Department with the establishment of the new OGCIO Vote, which has an Estimate of &euro;21.7 million net in 2020.  The creation of this Vote, for which I am also the Accounting Officer, will help support the digital transformation agenda across government, while providing and developing pan-public service ICT infrastructure, service delivery models and cross-government applications.<\/p><p> The new OGCIO Vote is being financed solely by Exchequer neutral transfers from client Departments and Government offices, including my own.  The Department provides the OGCIO, which remains part of the Department, with corporate services, human resources and finance support at no extra cost to the Exchequer or client organisations, ensuring value for money through enhanced labour productivity.<\/p><p> The development of various shared IT services and platforms in the Civil Service and the wider public service has provided an enormous impact during the Covid pandemic.  Our ability to provide significant online services, whether people applying for pandemic payments, the wage subsidy scheme through Revenue or for a driver licence, has shown the value of the investment made over the past several years.<\/p><p> In respect of Vote 12, superannuation and retired allowances, the net outturn for 2019 was &euro;261 million, compared to an Estimate of &euro;371.3 million, giving a surplus to surrender of &euro;110.3 million.  This surplus arose mainly on account of underspending on established lump sums and greater than expected receipts from the single public service pension scheme.  There was an additional once-off remittance in 2019 for contributions which had accrued in previous years which were not remitted until 2019.<\/p><p> Chapter 3 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2019 addresses Vote accounting and budget management.  Looking at overall expenditure in 2019 in gross terms, voted spending for the year amounted to &euro;67.3 billion.  This is &euro;649 million, or 1%, above the amount that was set out in the Revised Estimates Volume 2019 and reflects several Supplementary Estimates including in the areas of health, justice and education.<\/p><p> It is the role of my Department to implement a strong and sustainable public expenditure framework, as well as to drive the reform programme across the Civil Service and public service in order to support the delivery of services in the most efficient and effective manner.  To achieve this goal, my Department sets out clear and accessible structures and guidelines for Departments to follow.  In order for effective management of public expenditure to succeed, it is important all colleagues across the public service apply these policies and guidelines in their own organisations.<\/p><p> The Department fully agrees with the recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General in both his chapters on capital assets and allied services.  All recommendations have been accepted and significant progress has been made to implement these recommendations.  Additional guidance on the accounting treatment for capital assets was provided for in the appropriation accounts circular for 2019 and the guidance manual for the preparation of the appropriation accounts relating to clarifications on the treatment of depreciation of capital assets.<\/p><p> More generally, in September 2019, prior to the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter, the Department established a working group with finance officers of Departments to review the accounting policies for capital assets and to develop a new policy.  Work has been ongoing with the working group in reviewing the accounting treatment of fixed assets and working through the various complex historical issues, such as depreciation rates and valuation methods, as well as the different classes of capital assets involved.<\/p><p> While we agree with the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, when it comes to evaluating capital assets for public bodies, there are a variety of complications which may not arise in respect of a private entity.  What is the value of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or the GPO, for example?  How do we put a value on the 770 monuments managed on behalf of the citizens by the Office of Public Works?  When it comes to more standard buildings, lands or IT, it is more straightforward and the recommendations set out should be more easily implementable.<\/p><p> We are finalising a draft new policy document on capital assets.  This is being developed as part of the phased implementation of the financial reporting reforms recommended by the OECD and will address the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations.<\/p><p> The accounting treatment for allied services has also been addressed by my Department.  Substantial clarification was produced in the appropriation accounts circular for 2019 and the guidance manual for the preparation of the appropriation accounts, which we understand has assisted in improving the presentation of allied services in the accounts.  The Department will keep this area under review.  This is a key issue of the operating costs statements of Departments to the State as opposed to actual cash spending on their appropriation accounts.  This is an area more generally which gives a more accurate assessment of the actual cost of services run by Departments as opposed to cash appropriation on which we tend to focus.<\/p><p> The work in both these areas is underpinned by the wider strategy for the reform of Government financial reporting.  This is on foot of a major OECD review of financial reporting in 2019, which recommended that Ireland move to an international standards based accruals system of financial reporting.  The broad approach proposed by the OECD has been accepted by the Government.  Work is under way to examine the relevant international standards to be used as the basis for future Government accounting policy.  This will be the most significant reform in how we implement financial and accounting policies since the foundation of the State.  We have been operating on the basis of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 which is a cash-based system.  We have moved gradually to an accruals system in terms of the balance sheet information provided and the operating costs statement.  To move to a full accruals system will be an enormous cost and change but, over time, the better information will assist in assessing the value for money of spending and to report and account more accurately.<\/p><p> The progress we made in the sustainable management of public expenditure and driving and supporting the reform programme in 2019 is set out in considerable detail in my Department&rsquo;s 2019 annual report.  Due to the Covid-19 public health emergency, the context for the Department&rsquo;s work changed enormously between the end of 2019 and today.  This has led to significant changes in the Department&rsquo;s work and how it does that work.  The landscape for managing public expenditure and leading public service reform is now different.<\/p><p> I would like to take this opportunity to highlight that we have seen incredible commitment, flexibility and responsiveness from civil servants and public servants in dealing with the Covid-19 crisis.  The public service has shown a sense of common purpose and an ability to deliver at a pace not seen before.<\/p><p> Looking ahead, our priorities will continue to be focused on implementing a strong and sustainable public expenditure framework and driving and supporting the reform programme.  In terms of public expenditure, a key focus will be to continue to manage public expenditure effectively, while addressing challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic, Brexit and climate change.<\/p><p> In addition, the Department will continue to mainstream budgetary reforms, such as the spending reviews, enhancement of performance information and ongoing development of the evidence-based approach to expenditure policy formulation through the role of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, which produces significant numbers of reports looking in detail at spending programmes and the value for money of State spending.  We will oversee the review of the national development plan and alignment with the national planning framework as part of Project Ireland 2040.  Another key priority will be to manage public service pay and pension costs on a fiscally sustainable basis using agreed industrial relations frameworks.  We will also work to address the challenges posed by Brexit, while maximising the opportunities presented by EU membership in a range of EU policy areas.<\/p><p> With regard to public service reform, we will continue to lead the implementation of Our Public Service 2020.  The Department is also leading the development and implementation of a ten-year Civil Service renewal vision.  Aligned with this, we will lead and support the development and implementation of a new Civil Service people strategy, which reflects the workplace transformation that has taken place as a result of Covid-19.  The Department will continue in its leadership role to drive digital transformation with particular focus on those initiatives which will improve delivery of services to citizens and business in the most efficient manner.<\/p><p> I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to my colleagues in the Department for their hard work and the contribution they have made to delivering on our objectives during 2019 and this year.<\/p><p>Like any organisation, we look to the future and we advise the committee that along with other Departments we are now implementing a new statement of strategy to cover the next three years.  I am happy to receive the views of members on that strategy.  I thank the Chairman and look forward to discussing the various items on the agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020102200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603362600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Watt for that information.

In the case of many old schools, for example, there is no value to them.  They are old buildings that served as schools 30 or 40 years ago.  They will no longer provide a modern purpose, whether as an educational facility or as anything else.  Many of the older buildings, if they were set up for a particular purpose and the purpose is very different now, they do not have much value.  The land may have value, depending on where it is located.  It is a good point and it comes back to the wider matter in the Comptroller and Auditor General report in terms of how we treat capital assets.<\/p> <p>  The nature of an appropriation account is a cash base, which is the main focus of Departments and Accounting Officers.  If we had full accrual system and charged Departments for the use of assets every year, there would be a very clear benefit in maximising the use of those assets.  Currently, they are not penalised for inefficient use of capital assets.  It is really part of the benefit of moving in the direction mentioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If we have a better register and valuation of assets, and if we account for them properly over time, we can provide the right incentives for Accounting Officers to see their assets as something they should manage and maintain on an annual basis as opposed to just leaving them there because it reflects the investment of the past rather than investment or expenditure at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020102200002#D01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1603362600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Is there a timeframe within each Department to resolve this type of issue or is it to be taken as an ongoing matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020102200002#D01100","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603362600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>We have made progress on the issues raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report since its publication.

There is the overall resilience of the network, as government networks in Ireland and elsewhere are subject to periodic attacks and we must ensure the systems are resilient, robust and can repel those attacks.  We do not speak about this too much in public but it happens and at times they can be quite frequent.  Through Mr. Barry Lowry, the Government Chief Information Officer, and colleagues we have a cybersecurity group and we continue to invest and challenge the system ourselves to ensure it is robust.  It is an ongoing challenge.<\/p> <p>  There is also the question of data protection, which is part of what the Deputy has mentioned.  It concerns unauthorised access to data or inadvertent leaks, which can happen.<\/p><p>Every so often one will read in the newspapers about people who have been sacked from Departments, generally from the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social Protection, for accessing files they should not access.  That reflects the robustness of the system.  If one is not authorised to look into somebody's files, the system will identify that and an alert will go out.  We have good systems but no system is perfect and we have to continually update and prepare ourselves because the world moves on and changes.  In terms of electronic files and access, however, the IT systems are much more secure than the old days of going down to the registry and taking out the file and so on, whereby one might have signed in that he or she took out a file or not.  The IT system does not lie.  If one accesses a file, it will identify it on the system, whereas in the old days it was much easier to access a paper file.  It is much harder to access an electronic version of somebody's file without that being authorised and without it being discovered by the system.  They are robust in many ways but the fact that people have more data and files in an electronic format, that increases the risk of more significant breaches.

The cash outlay on pensions is going up every year, as set out in Vote 12.  That reflects the significant change in the Civil Service during the 1970s, in particular, when there was massive recruitment.  The modern Irish State expanded enormously during that period and redeveloped a more modern safety net, an education system and so on.  That meant many more civil servants were taken into the system during the 1970s and those colleagues have been retiring in recent years and that will continue.  The increase in costs in the A.1. part of the Vote reflects the increase in the number of people who are retiring and the longer life expectancy.  When people get to 65, their life expectancy is around 20 years so they have a longer time to benefit from a pension.<\/p> <p>  On the overall sustainability of the scheme, there are two points on that.  Mr. Pender will correct me on this if I am wrong but around 30% to 40% of public servants are now on the single public service pension scheme, which has costs that are about one third less than the previous scheme.  Those colleagues accrue less benefit each year and they also pay higher contributions so the overall cost to the Exchequer of the new recruits since 2012 is a good deal less than for people who came in before 2012.  Every few years, we do a report, which Mr. Pender is the main author of.  This report looks at the actuarial liability of the accrued service of all the civil servants who have retired and the accrued service of all those civil servants who are active and who are still paying into the scheme in employment.  From that, we work out what we can.  Based on various assumptions around inflation, wages and the discount rate we use, we work out the net present value of the pensions of those people who are retired and of those people who are in the system.  That is based on their service up to a certain date, namely, the year in which we do the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020102200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1603362600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>What percentage increase will we see in the coming years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020102200002#E00400","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603362600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>The last review we did showed that the actuarial value was around &euro;100 billion.

Therefore, we never know in a given year the number of people who will retire.  In any given year, there are 5,000 to 10,000 civil servants who could retire but we see that it is actually around 1,300, 1,400 or 1,500.  It does not impact on the A.1. part of the Vote as it is ongoing spending but because the lump sums are paid, they have a big impact.

We might err on the side of caution, therefore.  These are debates that take place a few weeks before the budget every year when colleagues present to me their updates for this year.  We had a conversation a few weeks ago on what the update for this year is and on what that means for the base on which we make a decision for the Estimate for 2020.  It is the inherent uncertainty of spending lines that are driven by demand that we cannot influence or control.  It is ultimately a function of decisions that thousands of people will take.  The big issue with the Vote in recent years has been the receipts.  I mentioned the issue where there was a larger than expected remittance.  Therefore, employers were effectively making contributions in respect of single public service pension scheme recipients but had not remitted it to the Vote during the years when it accrued and so there was a build-up.

Obviously, there is the deficit as a percentage of GNI* and the &euro;40 billion cash amount for this year and next year.  Our debt as a percentage of GNI* will get up to about 115% or 120%.  That is one metric to look at.  Another metric to examine would be our interest costs as a percentage of our revenue, which peaked at around 11% or 12% in 2013 and is now down to about 4%.  It is not just the stock of debt, we must also look at the cost.  My view on this is that we have to do this for this year and next year, but there is a limit or ceiling.  It is really determined by the cost of servicing this debt and our ability to fund it, which is a function of the role of the ECB, how savings and investments will evolve across the globe over the next number of years and a variety of factors.  If we have a low-interest environment for the foreseeable future, these debts will be manageable and sustainable.  If we moved back to a situation where the cost of new money is 2%, 3%, 4% or 5%, which is the norm or average we would have expected for a sovereign like Ireland, of course, the interest bill becomes more expensive.<\/p> <p>  There is a ceiling.  Nobody knows what that is.  Of course, one does not want to find out what the ceiling is.  It is like finding out from the bank manager what is the limit to one's overdraft.

In his opening statement, Mr. Watt stated that his \"Department sets out clear and accessible structures and guidelines for Departments to follow.\"  How is that monitored?

We do that by having around 150 officers in our Department who work on the expenditure side.  They are what we call \"Vote officers\" and they shadow their colleagues in other Departments.  The process, in effect, is one of delegated sanction.  The Government approves and sets out the Estimates for the year and they then go to the D&aacute;il for debate and a vote subsequently.  We send out at the end of the year what we call a \"sanction letter\", which states to Department X that it is permitted to spend a given amount on these subheads and it must adhere to the various procedures and so on for expenditure.  During the year, we monitor that expenditure monthly, deal with issues arising from Departments and give them guidance and help.  Ultimately, given the scale of the system - we have 330,000 public servants and spending of &euro;86 billion this year - it is not possible for that to be controlled and monitored to ensure we have compliance.  Otherwise, our Department would be making decisions in a centralised way in respect of a whole variety of matters and the system would not be able to function.  It is basically delegated sanction.  Accounting officers in Departments have legal responsibility to put in place the proper procedures consistent with the public financial procedures.  They must sign their appropriation accounts when they send them to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to confirm that proper procedures are in place and they have adhered to the various standards.

The report states this could create issues in assessing and doing comparative analysis between Departments.

We sent out a circular to set that out, particularly with regard to the interval - the gap between valuations.  Various buildings had not been valued since the early 2000s so we set out guidance about how we wanted more frequent valuation of buildings, the approach to depreciation and how we value an asset.  Should it be based on the historic value adjusted for depreciation?  Is it the replacement value?  It depends on the nature of it.  IT is more straightforward because it is more consumable.  IT equipment will last between five and seven years and one can depreciate it at a rate.  It is fairly straightforward.  Obviously, valuing buildings or land is much more complex.  The principle here is to have a system whereby we account for our assets, have a proper valuation of the assets and develop balance sheets, as we have done in the notes to the accounts and, ultimately, we move to a fully accrual system where decisions relating to the use or disposal of assets are fully reflected in the incentives Accounting Officers face when they are making decisions.

We have to address issues concerning public expenditure management and the move to an integrated accrual system of financial accounting.  I guess these are the broad themes but the Minister will give us his views and we will reflect those in our statement.  It is a question of trying to make statements meaningful rather than offering lots of platitudes because there is a danger of ending up repeating many points that do not mean anything.  Setting out something a bit more concrete might be where we go.  For example, consider the conversation we had today about more clear milestones indicating exactly when we are going to get to the stage of the accounting reform agenda.<\/p><p> We are in the middle of discussing the strategy.  Our Department's world involves pre-budget and post-budget phases.  We are now in a post-budget phase.  One hears people talking about this.  After the budget, everybody in the Department sits down to discuss matters.  We will be doing this in November.  We will be doing it remotely this year, obviously.  I will hear from my colleagues about how they are getting on and what the priorities are, and the information will be fed into the statement of strategy.<\/p><p> On the issue of properties, the matter is really for the OPW.  I suggest that we organise a note on that from the OPW because I do not have the details here.  Obviously, the Garda stations most recently closed down have been converted.  The one in Whitehall is now being used by Forensic Science Ireland, I believe.  The more modern stations can be used.  Many of the older ones would not have much use or value.  We can get a note on that for Deputy Devlin to answer his question because I do not have the details in front of me here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020102200002#J01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603362600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Watt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020102200002#K00200","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1603362600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions for the Secretary General.<\/p> <p>  On the broadband plan, I am aware the contract has been signed and that Mr. Watt was before the communications committee.  He and I, in addition to other members of that committee, had a discussion about the plan at the time in question.  Mr. Watt expressed his concerns at the time.  His belief was that the proposed project posed an unprecedented risk to the Exchequer.  It is signed now; I accept that.  I raised this in the D&aacute;il with the former relevant Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and asked what safeguards existed.  He assured the D&aacute;il that, among other things, there would be milestones in terms of the progress made.  It is now reported that milestones are not being reached, and Department officials are reported as saying there are no penalties.  With regard to the broadband connection points, 300 were supposed to have been connected this year.  There are 164 installed.  There are 51 connected, with a further three schools coming on.  That makes 54 but it is almost Christmas.  I acknowledge that Mr. Watt will say the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is responsible.  I followed the process very diligently when the contracts were being put together, as did others in this House.  I have had major concerns about large contracts with a single bidder.  What can be done at this stage when promised milestones are not being reached?  Where is the protection for the money voted by this House, the public funds?  There is potential for a hit to the State of &euro;2.6 billion.  We had long conversations about that.  We had very detailed conversations at meetings of the communications committee at the time.

I am accompanied by Ms Patricia Cronin, assistant secretary with responsibility for governance and operations in the Department.  The total provision for the Department in 2020 is &euro;541.5 million, comprising &euro;404.8 million capital, inclusive of &euro;27.3 million in capital carryover from last year, and &euro;136.7 million for current spending.  Being before the committee at this time of the year to give a presentation on the 2020 Revised Estimates is unusual.<\/p> <p>  This time last year, the budget was framed to progress some key projects and policy objectives.  These span a number of areas of strategic national importance and encompass climate action, energy efficiency, communications, the environment, natural resources, waste management and inland fisheries.  In looking at each of the programme areas in detail, I will highlight some of the key areas.  Programme A, communications, was considered yesterday by the Select Committee on Transport and Communications Networks, so I will start with the energy area.<\/p> <p>  Programme B in energy aims to deliver energy-efficiency measures across the residential, public and business sectors.  This year the programme provides &euro;12.2 million to cover the operational costs of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and &euro;137.2 million to fund expanded sustainable energy programmes.  The focus this year was on the achievement of targets in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as the continued incentivisation of the uptake of electric vehicles to support further the transition to a sustainable future.  Funding for the sustainable energy programmes includes: the better energy warmer homes scheme, to deliver a range of energy-efficiency measures free of charge to low income households; the better energy homes scheme for homeowners, to provide grants towards a range of energy-efficiency measures; better energy communities programme, to encourage community partnerships to improve the thermal and electrical efficiency of the building stock in energy poor homes; targeted interventions in the commercial and public sectors, to deliver significant energy efficiency and energy savings while reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels; and grant funding to incentivise the purchase of new electric vehicles, support the installation of home charge points and the provision of on-street public chargers.  The programme also includes investment of &euro;10.7 million for energy research, include applied energy research and demonstration projects aimed to accelerate diversification away from fossil fuels to green energy.<\/p> <p>  The aim of programme C, natural resources, is to manage Ireland's mineral, hydrocarbon and other geological resources in a sustainable and productive manner.  Funding under this programme allows the Department to provide reliable geoscience support for environmental protection and the sustainable development of Ireland's natural resources, and to address the health and safety implications of certain historical mining sites.  The programme includes an allocation of just over &euro;11.6 million for Geological Survey Ireland services, including &euro;7 million for the Tellus and INFOMAR mapping projects.  The Tellus mapping project consists of airborne, geophysical measurements and ground geochemical sampling.  Data from the project will allow for improvement in geological maps and will facilitate better land use, planning and research.  The INFOMAR project is Ireland's national seabed survey and is managed by Geological Survey Ireland in co-operation with the Marine Institute.  Under the groundwater programme, the Geological Survey Ireland national network of turlough flood level gauges will provide enhanced data and models on turlough flooding to the Office of Public Works, OPW, and local authorities.  A sum of &euro;5 million is provided for mining services, including &euro;1.1 million for mine safety and monitoring work at the Avoca mines site.<\/p><p>There is also funding to develop an overall plan for the remediation of the legacy mines at Avoca and Silvermines.<\/p><p> Programme D covers inland fisheries.  It provides grant funding to Inland Fisheries Ireland, which is responsible for the conservation, management and regulation of Ireland's inland fisheries resource.  This year, Inland Fisheries Ireland has continued to deliver its licensing, permitting and enforcement responsibilities along with the rehabilitation of our rivers and streams.  The national strategy for angling development will ensure that Ireland's fish stocks and angling infrastructure are protected for their economic value and recreational benefit.  The inland fisheries programme includes an allocation of just under &euro;20.3 million towards the staff costs of Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Loughs Agency.  The Loughs Agency is a North-South body and is co-funded on a 50-50 basis by the Department and Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.  Also included in the programme is &euro;13.6 million for non-pay current and capital expenditure by the two agencies.<\/p><p> Programme E covers environment and waste management.  The purpose of the programme is to promote the protection of our natural environment, the health and well-being of our citizens and the transition to a resource-efficient circular economy in support of ecologically sustainable development, growth and jobs.  The environment and waste management programme includes an allocation of &euro;43 million towards staff costs, namely, non-pay current and the capital costs of the Environmental Protection Agency to allow it deliver on its mandate, research commitments in areas such as ambient air quality as well as the broader climate change agenda.  The programme includes &euro;11.25 million grant funding for the remediation of landfill sites.  A further &euro;1 million has been allocated for a waste management campaign to increase awareness of the necessity to minimise waste and increase recycling.<\/p><p> In the area of climate initiatives, an allocation of &euro;2.5 million will fund a range of Irish academic and research institutions involved in technical research and modelling to inform policy measures.  Funding of &euro;10 million is being provided for the climate action fund to cover potential drawdowns this year by the seven projects approved for funding of up to &euro;77 million.

The latest projections from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland shows that between 12.5% and 13% will come from renewables.  We have a shortfall of 3% to 4%, primarily in the heat sector.

Other countries have done this and the Netherlands is an example.  It had to purchase credits to be in compliance.  The Department is in negotiation with a number of European countries.  Before the end of the year we expect to be able to cover the majority of the compliance difference through entering into an agreement with two other countries.  The agreement has not yet been completed and the exact details are not fully arranged.  We will spend &euro;50 million on meeting our compliance with the directive.

It was discovered that the mine shafts and other mine areas were dangerously exposed to the public.  Therefore, there was genuine concern over public access to quite dangerous mine facilities.  There was significant expenditure to fence off the area and on ongoing measures to restore the water quality in the Avoca River.  When I became Minister again, I found it remarkable that we are spending &euro;900,000, or effectively &euro;1 million, making the mine safe in 2020.

I suggest, with the arrival of a draft new corporate plan for 2021-25, that this might be an opportunity for the committee to bring in Inland Fisheries Ireland, look at this strategy and consider whether there are plans for the expansion, deepening and strengthening of its role.  If so, I would be very interested to see if we might get support for that from the Exchequer and to question the agency in detail on whether there is further ambition or widening or strengthening of the work it is doing.

The promotion of home installation of charging points is something from which communities will benefit, particularly from the point of view of trying to cover as many communities as possible.  I will give the Minister an example.  To the best of my knowledge, there is only one public charging point in my constituency.  It is in Swords, which has a population of approximately 60,000.  The socioeconomics of the community would lend themselves to the purchasing of private EVs.  I appreciate that the targets have perhaps been met but the question is whether the targets are high enough?  Will the Minister comment on that general point?

We need to be more ambitious.  I had a meeting last week with the Fingal county manager, the mayor and the various directors of services.  One of the issues that came up was their working with the three other Dublin local authorities to submit a joint bid to the Department under the scheme that exits for support for municipal e-charging systems and to do that on a citywide basis.  Rather than Fingal having a certain type of municipal charge and South Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire or Dublin City Council having another, I understand that the four councils have been working together to put in a joint application.  I look forward to receiving that.  As I said previously, it was very disappointing, given that the fund has been in place for a couple of years and that calls had been made for local authorities to come forward with applications for municipal e-charging, that only two councils - Dublin City Council and Louth County Council - made applications.  If the four councils to which I refer are able to put in an ambitious bid, that will start us in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  There is in the budget - and there will be in future budgets, including next year's - &euro;600 in support for the installation of home charging points.  This is to assist people in purchasing EVs.  I expect it to take off because, as everyone can see, a number of models with better capabilities and increased range are about to become available.  Such models will lower the cost involved and improve matters in every way.<\/p> <p>  For those of us who represent urban constituencies, one of the big challenges will be providing for apartment dwellers, people living in terraced houses or even those in ordinary suburban areas.  If every homeowner in a row of houses was to get an EV and install a heat pump - this is the direction in which we will need to go - how we manage the distribution grid at local level to provide that amount of electricity will be a real challenge.  In those circumstances, adopting innovative solutions in respect of municipal charging points, be that using lamp posts, municipal car parking or other mechanisms, is the direction in which we will need to go.  First things first, however.

The Minister mentioned that the four Dublin local authorities have come.  They probably did that off their own bat.

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities has to agree to whatever investment the ESB must make in the distribution network to facilitate that level.  While it may be a few years off, it is not so far off that it will become a challenge.  We are about to see a massive expansion in the number of electric vehicles because they are better cars, with maintenance and fuel costs that are a fraction of those of other vehicles.  The ESB will have a key role to play in this and it will have to be a commercial proposition for the company.  It and other operators will need sufficient revenue to cover the cost of the distribution network.  The scale of change is huge and will involve a multibillion euro investment in the local distribution network, particularly for urban areas.  In rural areas, it will be much less of a problem.

Achieving compliance only became an issue in recent years following the downturn and recession.  By 2011, due to actions take by previous administrations, we were on course to meet our climate target, but in the early to middle years of the last decade, we fell behind.  The earlier reductions meant we were not out of compliance.  It was only in 2018-19 that our lack of action caught up with us and we were no longer in compliance.  Under the European legislative mechanisms, we were able to purchase carbon units as part of meeting our target.

I am open to correction if I am wrong on this, but I understand that trade was moved to the Department of Foreign Affairs when Eamon Gilmore became Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and T&aacute;naiste.  This was done to reflect the T&aacute;naiste's office's desire to have a role in international trade and to link it to foreign policy.  From my experience as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, an experience which the Chairman has also had, I have seen that, in reality, most trade promotion happens through agencies linked to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  Trade fairs, trade promotion more broadly and responsibility for World Trade Organisation trade rules and so on are all under the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation rather than that of the Department of Foreign Affairs.

We have a number of country plans, including plans for North America, Germany, France and the UK.  We believe that the promotion of Irish culture is a big part of the Irish message that helps us to connect with other countries in a very positive way.  We see that in a very real way in places like Canada, the US, Australia, the UK and, increasingly, in Germany with regard to Irish literature and music.  This initiative is very much part of foreign relations.  It is not just about economics and politics.  It is also about culture and heritage.  We are getting more money all of the time to invest in our diplomatic footprint all over the world but we have made the policy decision that the trade elements of that, particularly trade promotion, trade fairs and world trade talks and everything that flows from them, are better placed in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation because that is where the expertise is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2020102200002#A00900","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1603321200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Is the Revised Estimate agreed?

As this is the first meeting of this committee, I have prepared a short opening statement that will set out the overall position\u00a0and update the members on some of the main developments within the defence sector over\u00a0recent times.\u00a0<\/p> <p> The defence sector is made up of two Votes, namely, Vote 35 - Army Pensions and Vote 36 - Defence.\u00a0 The high-level goal of both Votes is to provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfill all other roles assigned by\u00a0Government.  Accordingly, defence sector outputs are delivered under a single programme in\u00a0each Vote.\u00a0 The combined Estimates for defence and Army pensions for 2020 provides for gross expenditure of &euro;1.04 billion, an increase of &euro;33 million or 3.3% over 2019.  The 2020 provision comprises &euro;781 million for Vote 36 - Defence, an\u00a0increase of &euro;23 million, and &euro;259.2 million for Vote 35 - Army Pensions, an increase of &euro;10 million.\u00a0<\/p> <p>  The Army pensions Vote has a single programme, entitled Provision for Defence Forces&rsquo; Pensions Benefits.  It makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities\u00a0 payable to, or in respect of, former members of the Defence Forces and certain dependants.\u00a0 The 2020 Estimate provides a gross sum of over &euro;259 million for the Army pension Vote, of which some &euro;250 million covers expenditure on superannuation benefits for former members of the permanent Defence Forces and certain dependants.  Pension benefits granted are, for the most part, statutory entitlements once certain criteria are met.\u00a0<\/p> <p>  There are currently some 12,750 pensioners paid from the Army pensions Vote.  During 2019, some 410 Defence Force members retired on pension and a broadly similar number is provided for in 2020. The spending review undertaken on Defence Forces pension\u00a0expenditure in 2018, concluded, among other things, that the underlying trend of rising military\u00a0pensioner numbers is likely to continue in the coming years.  It recommended that the Army pensions Vote should be allocated resources in line with the review&rsquo;s cost analysis from 2019 onwards to ensure that the full funding demands are met.\u00a0<\/p> <p>  Against that background, I am pleased to inform Members that the gross allocation for Army pensions increased by &euro;10 million to just under &euro;259 million for 2020.  This builds on a previous funding increase of &euro;9.5 million in the 2018 Estimates and reflects the rise in Army pensioner numbers noted over recent years.\u00a0<\/p> <p>  I turn to Vote 36 - Defence, which is delivered under a single programme, entitled\u00a0Defence Policy and Support, Military Capabilities and Operational Outputs.  The Revised Estimate for defence of &euro;781 million for 2020 now includes a pay and allowances allocation of some &euro;522 million.  The pay allocation provides for the pay and allowances of over 10,400 public service\u00a0employees, including 9,500 permanent Defence Force personnel, 550 civilian employees and\u00a0355 civil servants and it makes provision for increases due under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  It also includes provision for increases in permanent Defence Force\u00a0allowances arising from the Public Service Pay Commission&rsquo;s, PSPC, report on recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces and implementation of the initial measures set out\u00a0 in the Government&rsquo;s associated implementation plan.\u00a0<\/p> <p>  The non-pay allocation comprises both current and capital elements. The Revised Estimate for defence provides a non-pay current expenditure allocation of some &euro;134 million for 2020.\u00a0 This allocation provides mainly for expenditure on ongoing Defence Forces standing and\u00a0operational costs such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.\u00a0\u00a0The capital allocation provided in the Revised Estimate is over &euro;125 million.  This significant capital envelope demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to defence.  As provided for under the national development plan, an overall total of &euro;541 million has been allocated to defence for the period 2018 to 2022 for capital programmes.  This level of capital funding will allow the defence organisation to continue a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, as reinforced in the defence White Paper update 2019. It will also ensure that the Defence Forces have the capabilities necessary to deliver on all the roles assigned by Government.\u00a0<\/p> <p>  The launch earlier this year of the five-year equipment development plan for the Defence Forces ensures that all defence capital expenditure programmes build on the White Paper on defence in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade.  The equipment development\u00a0plan is a living document that will remain cognisant of evolving security situations, equipment\u00a0priorities and timing issues and will ensure that the Defence Forces are in a position to undertake their assigned roles both at home and abroad.\u00a0 We have seen some of the benefits from that rolling capital programme in three new PC-12 planes and significant capital investment in a number of building projects.<\/p> <p>  Among the major priority investment programmes and projects identified for inclusion under\u00a0the capital allocation in the national development plan are a mid-life upgrade of the Army Mowag armoured personnel carrier, APC, fleet; the replacement of the Air Corps Cessna aircraft;\u00a0the CASA maritime patrol aircraft replacement programme;\u00a0a mid-life refit of two Naval Service vessels; and an ongoing schedule of capital investment across a range of force protection, transport,\u00a0communications and information technology, weapons and ammunition systems.\u00a0<\/p> <p>  The defence capital allocation also provides for significant investment in Defence Forces built infrastructure projects.  This will allow investment in projects that modernise and enhance the\u00a0training, operational and accommodation facilities available to members of the Defence Forces\u00a0in military installations and barracks across the country.\u00a0\u00a0Earlier this year, a five-year built infrastructure programme for the Defence Forces was published in line with the White Paper on defence.  This plan provides a coherent, structured approach to\u00a0ensuring that Defence Forces built infrastructure requirements are updated and modernised in line with existing and future requirements.\u00a0<\/p> <p>  A significant level of capital infrastructural projects, encompassing accommodation, training\u00a0and storage facilities, are at various stages of development from design through tender to construction,\u00a0including\u00a0an upgrade of training facilities in Sarsfield barracks, Limerick and Stephens\u00a0barracks, Kilkenny and an upgrade of accommodation facilities in the Defence Forces training centre in the\u00a0Curragh, the Defence Forces student accommodation complex in Galway, which is a particular concern for me, and the Naval Base in Haulbowline.\u00a0<\/p> <p>  In addition, the construction of a new medical facility will enable the move from the existing St. Bricin&rsquo;s site, thereby affording the Land Development Agency, LDA , an opportunity to provide\u00a0 social and affordable housing in this area.  Modernising and upgrading military installations is a key priority for me, facilitated by the planning framework outlined in the infrastructure\u00a0development plan.\u00a0\u00a0St. Bricin's is a really strategic site in the city.  It is effectively an old military hospital and, while it is a super site, the medical facilities there are not fit for purpose for a modern defence force so we will invest in a significant new, modern military hospital, probably in Baldonnel, which has been earmarked by the Defence Forces as the most suitable site.  That will allow the LDA to hopefully produce ambitious plans for the St. Bricin's site.<\/p> <p>  The 2020 allocation will allow Defence Force personnel to meet Government commitments in our overseas peace support missions and proudly represent Ireland abroad in diverse and often challenging, locations throughout the world.  Irish troops continue to do extraordinary work in very difficult conditions and I thank them personally for their loyalty and commitment to their overseas roles.<\/p><p> As at 2 October, Ireland was contributing 571 personnel to ten missions throughout the world.  Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of speaking to the officer in command of the new rotation to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, which will be leaving in the coming weeks. <\/p><p> At home, the 2020 provision allows the Defence Forces to continue to provide essential support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as requested across various roles, such as explosive ordnance disposal call-outs, Garda air support missions and Naval Service diving operations.  It also enables the Defence Forces, as part of their aid to the civil authority role, to provide support to local authorities, the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their emergency response efforts.<\/p><p> On foot of the Covid-19 pandemic, since early March the Defence Forces have provided significant and essential aid to the civil authority support to the HSE in areas such as contact tracing, patient transportation, logistics and Covid-19 testing.  Service level agreements and memorandums of understanding agreed between the HSE and the Department of Defence greatly facilitate and support all aid to the civil authority engagements and ensure the focus on effective service delivery is prioritised.<\/p><p> To date, some &euro;13.4 million has been expended by the Department of Defence in responding to Covid-19 and related issues.  This expenditure includes &euro;5.3 million towards the acquisition of a new PC-12 aircraft which has been used to provide additional fixed-wing capacity response, as required.  Most of the work on the PC-12 involved bringing test samples back and forth to labs in Berlin to increase testing capacity.  The Covid-19 expenditure also includes &euro;4.3 million in respect of additional medical, engineering, building, PPE, audiovisual, ICT and transport costs across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, over &euro;3 million in respect of additional allowance payments and some &euro;300,000 in respect of additional Civil Defence costs.   In addition, ICT investment of some &euro;500,000 has facilitated remote working opportunities across the Department and has ensured its capacity to maintain ongoing business continuity and the timely and efficient processing of all Defence Forces personnel pay and allowances, Army pensions and supplier payments throughout this very challenging period. <\/p><p> The onset of Covid-19 placed exceptional, additional and unforeseen expenditure demands on my Department across a wide range of areas.  This additional expenditure was essential and reflects the hugely proactive and positive contribution made by the Department of Defence as an organisation in reacting to this national crisis.  This collective response involved Permanent Defence Force personnel, members of the Reserve, Civil Defence volunteers and civil servants and civilian employees employed within my Department.<\/p><p> Over &euro;4 million in funding is provided for the Civil Defence in 2020.  This funding supports Civil Defence units throughout the country by way of essential training and the supply of vehicles, boats, uniforms and personal protective equipment, PPE, for volunteers.  Civil Defence volunteers provide essential support to the efforts of the front-line services and have been at the forefront of the Department of Defence response to the Covid-19 pandemic over recent months.<\/p><p> The Government also values the service of the Reserve Defence Force.  The White Paper on Defence highlights that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve.  I hope to do much more on this in the months ahead.  Perhaps I can discuss how we can develop the Reserve and its capacity with the committee when we have more time.  On behalf of the Government, I want to commend the voluntary effort that supports the Reserve Defence Force and to thank the members of the Reserve for their ongoing dedication and enthusiasm, particularly those members who assisted in the national Covid-19 response.<\/p><p> The programme for Government provides for the establishment of a commission on the Defence Forces.  This is an extremely important body of work.  I am very anxious to ensure its establishment as early as possible this year.  I will be working very closely with officials in my Department to achieve this objective.  I hope to bring a recommendation to the Government on the members of the commission and its terms of reference before the end of next month.  This would be well in advance of what we have committed to in the programme for Government, which states it will be done by the end of the year.  We will try to get it up and running early, if possible, which hopefully will indicate that we are anxious to get on with it and benefit from the expertise which will be on the commission as soon as possible.<\/p><p> I want to thank everyone within the defence sector for their enormous contribution this year in difficult circumstances.  I remain confident that the significant overall level of funding provided in 2020 will further enable the ongoing implementation of the organisational priorities outlined in the White Paper on Defence, for 2020 and beyond.<\/p><p>  Committee members have been provided with briefing material on both the Department of Defence and Army pensions payments.  I look forward to positive engagement on any issues they may wish to discuss.  I will try to address questions and comments as directly as I can.  If there are broader issues that the committee wishes to discuss with me at a later stage, I will make myself available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2020102200002#B00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603321200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It is superfluous to do anything other than reflect the usual commentary with any pension, which is that we have to do much more to protect those who are of pension age.  People often presume that those who have an Army pension are well off, but that is not the case.  Everyone on this committee will know men and women who have served their country honourably but are now down on their luck.  Much more should be done to help those on military pensions who are in that position.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on two aspects of the second Vote, the first of which is the capital plan for 2020.  The Minister listed several events that are due to happen this year or in the future.  He mentioned the new medical facility to replace St. Bricin's Military Hospital.  As there is nothing in the Estimates about St. Bricin's for this year, there is no need to mention it.  There are no specifics for next year either.  I do not know if a value for money audit has been undertaken on any of the plans with regard to St. Bricin's other than the expenditure of similar moneys on a facility in the Curragh which needs a lot of investment and could be much better placed in the future.  That might be something for the committee to examine.  Those of us who took part in the committee's visit to the Curragh last year saw the state of the facilities there.  The works on accommodation are welcome but conditions in the Curragh are much worse than most people would consider acceptable.  The same is true of many of the other barracks.  I do not have a major problem with selling off St. Bricin's, but it is odd that a military base in the city centre is up for sale.  There is a military logic for the location of military bases within countries which is often not understood.<\/p> <p>  The second issue has been teased out in many places including at this committee and in the media, namely the pay for those in the Defence Forces.  I believe the figure in the Estimates is the figure for a full complement of 9,500.  What happens to the allocation that is not spent?  Every year, there is an underspend in the money set aside for wages and allowances for a full establishment figure of 9,500.  Is the unspent money ring-fenced or pumped back in?  Can it be given as a gratuity at the end of each year to those who are actually serving?  Every family of Defence Force personnel would welcome that funding being spent where it is intended to assist those serving under tremendous strain given their low wages, as identified by this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2020102200002#C00300","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1603321200,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I might confine my comments to Vote 35.  If there is more time, I might come back to Vote 36.  I thank the Minister and his team for appearing before us.  It was great to hear the news about the potential Baldonnel hospital, the terms of reference and the commission on defence possibly being sorted by next month.  They are very positive.  Regarding Vote 35, the defence sector is the only sector where there is a separate Vote for pensions.  The pensions of teachers and members of the Garda are internalised in their operational Vote - their operational budget - but due to a historical anomaly, there are two separate Votes when it comes to the defence Vote.  It is very useful because it allows us to examine in detail the Army pension situation.  A number that really jumps off the page is the figure of 12,750 military pensioners.  We now have 50% more people on a military pension than we do serving in the military.  That is staggering.  If we compare it to the numbers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we will see that the ratio is in the opposite direction with far more people serving than receiving pensions.<\/p> <p>  I see where the Minister is coming from when he said that he was pleased to inform the committee that the gross allocation of Army pensions increased by &euro;10 million to some &euro;259 million for 2020.  That is completely correct.  Everyone wants more money but when I see an additional &euro;10 million being required for pensions, I am not happy.  I am devastated.  I would much prefer that &euro;10 million to be given in salaries and keeping people in service because many of those people do not want to retire.  They have retired because they have been forced to retire so I accept the Minister's point completely and agree with him that it is good to see an increase but I would much prefer it to be going into salaries and keeping people in service rather than into pensions, which, to me, is a problem.  <\/p> <p>  My next point is a technical one that is probably more for the Minister's team than the Minister.  I am comparing the figures for Vote 35 with the ones we got on budget day in page 75 of a booklet I have.  It says that Army pensions are &euro;262 million.  We see here now that the figure is &euro;259 million so I am not sure which figure is accurate.  Page 75 of the booklet states that pension provisions increased by &euro;3.5 million whereas we are told today that they have increased by &euro;10 million, so there is a discrepancy with regard to budget day figures and the figures in the opening statement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2020102200002#D00100","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1603321200,"counter":356,"content":"<p>The difference between the two is that budget day figures are for next year and the others are for this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2020102200002#D00200","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1603321200,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for clarifying that.

Historically, the defence Vote has been split into two.  It goes back decades.  My understanding is that the public service pension is also in a separate Vote so there is other precedent there but the Deputy is right.  They are not separated into two separate packages in the justice and education Votes.  It is quite useful to have them separate because if the Army pension Vote is increasing, we do not want to have to effectively supplement that by reducing expenditure elsewhere to compensate, so having both separate is somewhat helpful.  It is true to say that there are considerably more Defence Forces pensioners, which is a reflection in recent years of the number of people who have retired but also the age at which people retire from the Defence Forces.  This is a more demanding job physically than many other jobs in the public sector and, therefore, people are required in many cases to retire earlier, which means that there are many people of working age who essentially qualify for a Defence Forces pension.  The Deputy will be glad to hear that we are unlikely to see as many people retiring this year as in recent years.  Part of this might be linked to Covid-19 and other job opportunities and possibly less headhunting and trying to persuade people to move out of the Defence Forces because we have people who are really well trained, well educated, motivated and disciplined.  That the private sector tries to target people in the Defence Forces all the time is a reflection of the quality of training within our Defence Forces.  It might be a combination of less economic opportunity this year and a big increase in effort to retain and recruit.  Hopefully, both of those things combined mean that we will not see as many people retire this year as we have seen in recent years.<\/p> <p>  In terms of capital expenditure, I will give Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh a sense of some of the priorities.  Key priorities include expediting a range of infrastructural projects across Defence Forces installations, including new and refurbished accommodation blocks in Haulbowline, Renmore, County Galway and the Curragh; upgrade and refurbishment works to the apprentice hostel in Casement Aerodrome, upgrade and refurbishment at McKee Barracks, Dublin; upgrade of accommodation at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Rathmines; and a new medical facility that will enable a move out of the St. Bricin's site, which, in turn, will allow the Land Development Agency to provide for housing demand there.  In addition, funding is provided for new gyms in Kilkenny and Limerick so there is a good mix of quite significant investments across different barracks in different parts of the country.  Obviously, we must focus on where need is most acute.  I agree with the Deputy about the Curragh and have said this publicly.  The Curragh is a huge campus and there is too much dereliction there.  We have a plan to change that.  We have already seen investment in accommodation there and I hope we will see a lot more of that.  Having walked through the Curragh and spent some time there, I know there are opportunities there with investment in terms of a lot of space and capacity, some empty buildings and some dereliction that needs to be addressed.  There are a number of projects that are quite exciting in terms of what can be done there.  Only this week, we announced investment in terms of the jetty in Haulbowline.  There will be further commitments in terms of accommodation in terms of block eight and possibly another block that we want to take into next year with regard to improving accommodation at Haulbowline.  I could go through that whole plan but I will just reassure the Deputy that we have a rolling capital investment programme and have increased the capital budget quite significantly for next year on top of this year, which is significantly increased on previous years.  <\/p> <p>  I can remember that when I was Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, we spoke to the Department of Defence a few years ago about whether the State could, in partnership with the Department and the Defence Forces, develop the site at St. Bricin's.  The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces at the time rightly said that they could not move out of St. Bricin's unless the medical facilities there were replaced with something better and more modern that could allow for that move.  Now the shoe is on the other foot.  I am the Minister for Defence but I do recognise the potential of that site.  It is a really strategic site in the middle of Dublin city.  I also recognise that from a defence perspective, while the medical facility there serves an important purpose, it could be a lot better with a purpose-built modern facility so there is a double benefit for the State as a whole.  The Defence Forces would get a much more modern military hospital and, more broadly, the State would have a really strategic site for the Land Development Agency to develop for social and affordable housing.<\/p><p>Nothing is being forced on the Department of Defence or on the Defence Forces.  This is a partnership that I hope we can move together, which works for both.  My understanding is the most likely site for that, coming from recommendations from the Defence Forces, is Baldonnell because it is centrally located nationally and well-connected by road infrastructure.  It has a great deal of space and it would be an obvious place to develop that new military hospital.  That is not for this year's Estimates, however;I just wanted to give the committee a sense of the thinking there.<\/p><p> There is a very valid and good question on salaries.  We are signing off on Estimates for 9,500 personnel in the Defence Forces.  We are going to be 1,000 short of that so what happens to the money that was allocated for the salaries of those 1,000 people?  The answer is that we have a facilitation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to keep that money in the Defence Forces Vote and, therefore, we effectively factor in that additional money into other costs that benefit the Defence Forces, either capital investment or some of the other current expenditure we have.  We have insisted, and to be fair, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has facilitated, that we maintain the benefit of that unused salary money to keep it in the defence Vote to invest more in some of these other projects, be they capital or current expenditure.  We will do the same again this year but I hope to be in a position, next year and the year after, where that unused money earmarked for salaries and allowances will shrink dramatically because we will get our numbers back up to where they should be, namely, 9,500.  I have had that conversation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is why there has been a significant increase in our capital allocation for next year because we want to spend more of this money on salaries as we move beyond 8,500 to 9,000 and ultimately to 9,500, which is what our strength should be.  The money, therefore, which at the moment comes from that element of the Vote and essentially gets added to capital expenditure, will shrink if we are successful with retention and recruitment.  That has to be reflected in an increased Estimate, particularly around capital expenditure.  The defence Vote does not lose the money; we do not give it back.  It is a significant amount.  Pay savings were &euro;38 million in 2016; &euro;27 million in 2017; &euro;37 million in 2018; and last year, &euro;33 million.  When we are 1,000 people short, we save a significant amount but we have agreed a facility to hold that money within the Defence Forces Estimate and it will get transferred into other forms of expenditure that benefit the Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2020102200002#D00400","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603321200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for the investment in Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick and the facilities there, which will be received gratefully.<\/p> <p>  Regarding his comments on the commission for the Defence Forces, I very much welcome that he has brought that commitment from the programme for Government to the top of his agenda and that he hopes to have it established by the end of the year.

If it is a policy issue, we can discuss it on a different day but I want to bring it onto the agenda.  It is the issue of funding for veterans associations.  The Minister mentioned St. Bricin's Military Hospital.  The Irish United Nations Association has its base just a stone's throw away in Stoneybatter.  During my time on Dublin City Council we received a request every year for a small donation to assist the association with infrastructure changes or just to keep the group going.  Veterans associations are really important and I would like to discuss how we can better assist their members in order that they do not have to keep fundraising because I am sure they have better things to do with their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2020102200002#E00300","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1603321200,"counter":362,"content":"<p>We are happy to move ahead with investment in Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick.  It is one of a number of priorities we want to move ahead with.  There has been a delay this year in some of those physical construction works we were hoping to move ahead with because of Covid and so we are now trying to catch up.  I assure the Deputy there is no pulling back from that in terms of financial resources; quite the opposite in fact, we are trying to accelerate some of it.<\/p><p>Regarding the commission on defence, we are going to write to each of the political parties in the next few days outlining the six key areas we want feedback in setting up the commission.  We will finalise the terms of reference in the next few weeks.  We are going to put together a commission of eight to ten people.  It will need to have a balance of Irish and international expertise on defence matters.  Obviously there is recognition of the need for gender balance as well.  We need people who have defence experience in the form of serving in defence forces as well as public service defence experience.  I hope we will have an impressive group of people with a very solid chair who can keep this process on time to get a detailed report and series of recommendations within 12 months, as that is the plan.  I would like to be in a position to bring that to Cabinet by the middle of next month but if it gets delayed by a couple of weeks, then certainly by the end of next month.  This would mean we would be a month ahead of schedule, which is where I would like to be on defence matters.  We will also write to the representative bodies to ensure they can also make a written submission before we finalise the terms of reference.  I have had some verbal meetings as well with those bodies, and we are opening it up to the broader public to make submissions over the next few weeks.  We will try to be as inclusive and as broad as we can in our consultation.  Normally I would have a big, two-day seminar with a load of debates about what we should be doing on defence and what the commission should look like. and we would probably do it on one of our university campuses to try to get as much engagement as we can.  However, we just cannot do that during the pandemic and, therefore, we must do it both remotely and through written submissions more so than we usually would.  We are open to different ideas and perspectives.<\/p><p>On the Naval Service, when one looks at the outturns for 2018 and 2019, the Estimate was lower but Deputy Leddin might find that the outturn is higher than the Estimate by the end of the year.  If it is we will transfer money to recognise that.  It is important to say we have real challenges in the Naval Service at the moment.  We have two ships that should be at sea but are tied up as we do not have the personnel to crew them.  We are working hard to address this.  Another ship is out for a mid-life service and we want to get it back into operation as soon as possible.  We also had an unfortunate fire on the <i>L&Eacute; Niamh<\/i>, which will delay her return to full service by a couple of months as well.<\/p><p>There have been a few setbacks this year but there have also been some positive initiatives.  Last week, in Haulbowline naval base I spoke to our naval personnel via a Skype link and some of them were offshore at the time.  I had to explain to them what we are doing with the new retention and commitment scheme that involves them committing to go to sea for 24 of the next 48 months because that is how the cycles work.  One does two years at sea and two years on land.  That has been received pretty well.  We are recognising that we need to increase the monetary recognition of the sacrifices that are required to go to sea because we know there has been an issue with that.  I hope that the combination of this service commitment scheme and an expansion of the seagoing tax credit for next year will be attractive in the context of retaining people and also in attracting more people into the Naval Service.<\/p><p> That is a big priority for me and it is simply not acceptable that, while having a White Paper that talks about an eight-ship fleet and the programme for Government of the previous Government talked about a nine-ship fleet, we have so many ships that are not able to go to sea for different reasons.  It is hoped we will get back to having six ships fully crewed and operating properly next year and we will build from there to get back to seven, eight and nine ships over time.  We will make the necessary investments to do that, on land, in the upgrading of ships and in acquiring new ships.<\/p><p> I have not had a chance yet to meet the veterans associations as Minister.  I intend to do that as soon as I can.  There are challenges with meeting people in groups at the moment, but I got to know the veterans associations quite well when I was last in the Ministry for Defence.  We will maintain the support programmes that are there already and we will look to do more if we can.  I would like to consult with the veterans associations to make sure I am in tune with exactly what they are looking for before making any further commitments on that.  It is an important part of the defence family.  When people leave the Defence Forces, some find it tough.  They leave a structured environment, and that often creates pressures that others do not have to contend with.  Some people fall into difficult places and we need to make sure the defence family is still intact after people leave the Defence Forces in the context of the supports, comradery and reach we try to have to support them.  The veterans associations are the ones who can do that best, so that is a conversation I am happy to have with the bodies concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2020102200002#E00400","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603321200,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I am aware of the challenges the Naval Service has, as the Minister has outlined.  I encourage him to do what he can to increase the numbers there.  I understand that military personnel are highly valued in the private sector and are often directly recruited by the private sector.  I am also concerned about the Naval Service vessel patrol days, which numbered 1,408 in 2017 and just over 1,000 in 2019.  The Minister might comment on that.<\/p> <p>  I am glad to hear the Minister committing to having a look at the Reserve Defence Force and to trying to increase and support it.  I am concerned about its effective strength, which is 1,698.  That is less than half of what it was at its establishment.  In 1990, the forerunner, which used to be call the F&oacute;rsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il, was 14,000.  Maybe on another day we could have a full meeting on the Reserve Defence Force, its role and what can be done to strengthen it.  It is almost on life support at this stage with 1,698 members, and I am not sure if any of that number are non-effective or even if that distinction still exists or not.  I contend it performed a role, which was to give young people an outlet and an opportunity to experience military life.  Quite often, people who did that for a period would then maybe make a decision to take up a role in the Permanent Defence Force.  The amount of money being spent on that every year is dropping as well, which is probably reflective of the fall in strength of the Reserve Defence Force.  It is something that needs our serious attention, and a serious debate on the future and role of the Reserve Defence Force, if it has one, is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2020102200002#F00200","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1603321200,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the information contained in his briefing.

I assume that responsibility for expenditure under the capital plan would not be confined to the Department of Defence but that this is an important national programme.  I would envisage a role, perhaps under the town and village renewal scheme, for other Departments and I would see the Office of Public Works, OPW, being involved.  If we are going to be realistic about a national plan and a regeneration of the physical structure of the Curragh, it would not be either reasonable or fair for that to fall under the budget of the Department of Defence.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Covid-19 and the current role and function of the Defence Forces.  In the area of contact tracing, earlier in the year there appeared to be active engagement.  Is that still in operation?  I also recall that during the summer, mention was made of a role for the Defence Forces assisting with the HSE in the matter of private nursing homes in terms of deep cleaning and ensuring that every effort is being made by way of a national resolution to combat this issue.

I know he is familiar with the Naval Service and the pressures it is under.  I hope that the scheme we launched last week is an indication to people working in the Naval Service that the Government is taking this issue seriously.  It took a number of months to get this scheme agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, for understandable reasons.  Effectively, what it does is that if a person has been in the Naval Service for more than three years, he or she can commit to this scheme to go to sea for two of the next four years and get &euro;5,000 for each of those years that he or she follows through on that commitment, as long as 120 days are spent at sea.  We would expect that in their seagoing year, people would spend about 165 days at sea.  There is more than enough flexibility there.  We have also increased the seagoing tax credit from &euro;1,270 per year to &euro;1,500 per year.<\/p><p>Essentially, that is after-tax cash.  If one rolls that up, it is actually a combination of the two, which is quite a strong incentive to go to sea.<\/p><p> We built on a successful Air Corps service retention scheme, which was designed slightly differently but on a similar principle, and applied that to a commitment to go to sea, which is a retention scheme also because people sign up for the next few years.  That gives us a lot more certainty in the context of retention.  Unfortunately, when people are headhunted and offered jobs that may pay higher, and they are also faced with the lifestyle choices that come with choosing to go to sea.  I continue to maintain that we needed to reflect that challenge in the context of the financial response we had to put in place.  This is not a pay or salary increase, it is a retention scheme that is a financial incentive to being willing to go to sea, and to commit to doing that for the years ahead.  Certainly, the response so far has been quite strong.<\/p><p> The third element as part of that package is direct entry into the Naval Service where we will recruit and target certain skill sets, ironically from the private sector.  Hopefully, the shoe will be on the other foot for a change and we will be able to introduce those people in at a higher rank than they otherwise would have come in at, to make it more attractive for them.  Specialist engineers, radar operators or chefs, for example, may be among a range of specialists available in the private and commercial shipping sector that we could target to bring into the Naval Service.  Perhaps more importantly, in the context of re-enlistment, it may also bring such specialists back in if they had left.  There is a lot happening to try to address the retention and recruitment challenges we face.  It is important to say that the interventions in the Air Corps last year by the then Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, have been very successful.  I am aware that there is not a lot of headhunting for pilots at the moment given the state of the aviation industry this year, but even with all of that we have seen a lot of pilots come back in, which is great.<\/p><p> I want to do a lot of work on the Reserve.  Deputy Berry has raised this with me previously, as have other Members.  We will look at how we can expand the role of the Reserve and how we can complement the expertise within the Permanent Defence Force with potentially additional roles for the Reserve.  We will ask the commission to look at this in detail.  We are looking at whether we can introduce an amendment to the defence legislation coming through the Houses currently, to expand and give a legal footing to be able to do more with and for the Reserve and to make it a more exciting option.  Reserve numbers are not where they should be and we need to send a very clear signal to the effect that we have a single Defence Forces policy where the Reserve works in tandem with, and complementary to, the Permanent Defence Force, at home and potentially abroad too, and particularly where there are specific skill sets the Reserve could provide that may be in short supply in the Permanent Defence Force at different times.  That also applies in respect of the Naval Service.  We are looking at those issues and I look forward to progressing them through the commission and through conversations with reservists.<\/p><p> On Deputy Cowen's point, the retention of the money has been facilitated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for a number of years.  It is not the first year we have done this.  There have been accusations that because the strength is not what it should be, we are handing back all this money each year.  That is not the case.  We are the only Department where there is a recognition from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that unspent money on salaries is because we are below strength - on a temporary basis I hope - and they allow the Department of Defence to reallocate that money into other areas of expenditure that are needed.  We are using that at the moment to spend significantly more money on capital expenditure than suggested in the Estimates.  To be perfectly honest, it is happening because there is a problem and we need to fix that problem and get it addressed in future capital Estimates.  It is not a satisfactory situation that we have 1,000 fewer people in the Defence Forces than we should have.  This is, I hope, a temporary issue while we address the retention issues.<\/p><p> I was asked for some detail on recruitment and I shall give the committee a sense of that.  The Government has acknowledged that there are particular challenges in the Defence Forces and this is why there is a commitment in the programme for Government to examine recruitment and retention issues as part of the commission on the future of the Defence Forces.  There is also a proposal to establish an independent pay review body when the commission has completed its work.  A high-level implementation plan, strengthening our defence forces, is also being progressed.  Pay measures as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission have been delivered.  Other projects to enhance recruitment and retention are being delivered and others will feed into the negotiations over the next round of discussions on pay .  There will be an opportunity to fully consider pay matters in the Defence Forces as part of the next pay agreement and within the commission on the future of the Defence Forces.  Military authorities advise that 340 personnel were inducted in 2020 to the end of September and further inductions are planned during the remainder of the years.  The Defence Forces capacity to induct and train recruits was severely impacted upon by Covid-19 earlier in the year.  I suspect that there are still some limitations even now.  In conjunction with traditional recruitment, a range of alternative recruitment approaches are being utilised, for example, the campaign to re-enlist and recommission former members and to have a direct entry recruitment process, which I referred to earlier.  I shall give a sense of previous years' numbers: in 2016 there were 690 people recruited across all ranks; in 2017 it was 7,521; in 2018 it was 627; in 2019 it was 615; and to date in 2020 it is 340.  This, however, is an extraordinary year.  We are talking about some 600 to 700 people per year.  We need to try to increase this if we can.  Some of the points I referred to earlier will help us to do that.<\/p><p> The Chairman asked about the regeneration of the Curragh.  When I was Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we worked with the Department of Defence on some broad thinking around the regeneration of the Curragh as a whole.  It is not just about the barracks.  The Curragh is quite unique in its ecosystem and the space and opportunity there.  We can do a lot more through an ambitious programme of investment through the Department.  We should also be working with Kildare County Council and other Departments that have a more broad interest in the development of the Curragh as a whole.  I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and other Members, including members of this committee, have advocated for that.  We are certainly very much open to it.<\/p><p> With regard to the role of the Defence Forces in the continuing fight against Covid-19, we are available - when I say \"we\" I am talking about the defence infrastructure of the State - to do more.  Do not underestimate how much work the Defence Forces have already done in response to Covid-19: working with the HSE, publicly and behind the scenes; as support in areas of transportation and contact tracing and testing; setting up testing capacity on quay sides using Naval Service vessels; and also in operating some of the existing test centres.  The Defence Forces will remain at the disposal of the State to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the HSE and with national efforts generally.<\/p><p>Obviously, in the past few days, we have seen problems in terms of capacity around contact tracing.  They are problems we need to address quickly and I know the HSE is doing that, but the Defence Forces are there to help.  We have shown that, at very short notice, the Defence Forces can essentially design structures to complement what other arms of the State are doing.  We will continue to be available to do that as we move through the second wave. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2020102200002#F00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603321200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>On that, I will bring matters towards a conclusion.
